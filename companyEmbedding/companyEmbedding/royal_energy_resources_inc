About Royal Energy Resources, Inc.

Company Background

Management
Vision & Mission
Company’s Philosophy & Market Indicators

 

   Company Background
Royal Energy Resources, Inc. (based in New York) is a development stage Company which focuses primarily on energy projects in the United States of America. The Company is enhancing its activitiess to further countries like Romania. Per now the Company is forming a subsidiary for the planned acquisi,on and mining development of valuable rare earth materials like gold
                silver and copper. The subsidiary named S.C. Golden Carpathan Resources will be located in Bucharest.

                As of August 2010 the Company has interests in oil and gas leases and holds leases comprising 3,400 acres of property in Wyoming. Furthermore the Company holds a lease for uranium rights comprising 1,600 acres in Laramie County, Wyoming. The Company also holds the lease for 3,410 acres of rare earth and precious metals in Crook County, Wyoming

                The Company’s aim: Royal Energy Resources, Inc., (in the following also ROYE) was originally founded in 1999 with another scope of business. Today it is a public traded Company on the OTCBB market (R.O.Y.E.) and plans to be an emerging player in the gold and silver business. Oil‐ and gas royalties as well as uranium and rare earth materials are a business scope in the near future.

Company‘s Business Impressions
Royal Energy Resources, Inc. has acquired 3,110
                acres of mineral leases (in yellow on the map).
                These mineral leases lie between 4 and 12 miles
                away from Rare Element Resources Ltd.’s Bull Hill
                prospect (here shown in blue) and Bearlodge
                Mountain in Sundance Wyoming.
Business perspective: The Company is planning to
                request a permit for drilling testing from the
                Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality
                (WDEQ)/Land Quality Devision (LQD) – Exploration
                Drilling and Mine in the next few month.
                An indicator for the value of this area: Rare
                Element Resources Ltd. is another owner of
                mineral leases close to ROYE´s area estimates
                approximately 15 million tons of rare earth
                minerals in their mining section.
Rare earth metals in Crook County are close, app.
                5‐6 miles from Bear Lodge Mountain. The US
                geological survey has studied the area of Bear
                Lodge Mountain extensively (USGS Prof. paper
                ♯1049 –D) and has estimated that it contains one
                of the largest deposits of disseminated rare earth
                elements in North America.
Another indicator for the value of Royal Energy
                Resources, Inc.’s leases: Powertech Uranium Corp.
                based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada has
                proposed a $20,000,000 uranium mine in Weld
                County, CO. The permit is currently in the process
                for approval. At a current price the uranium would
                be worth over $500 million.
ROYE has 1,600 acres in Laramie County,
                Wyoming. The property is close to the well‐known
                uranium mine. 


Back to the top
 
Product‐ and Investment Porfolio
The Company was the successful bidder in the U.S. Government auctions to
                purchase certain oil‐ and gas leases rights. The oil and gas leases currently
                represent app. 3,000 acres of property located in Weston, Goshen, Converse,
                Freemont, Laramie and Plae County Wyoming.
 The Company also holds leases for uranium rights on app. 1,000 acres in
                Wyoming. ROYE is nego,a,ng with energy companies to develop the
                poten,al resources that may be contained in these properties..
 The management has completed several transactions wherein the Company sold the leases rights and retained a royalty interest in one transaction. No exploration activities have yet taken place. This will be a planned step for the future. The Company has received proceeds of $70,275 from these
                transactions (for further details please see 10Q fillings).

Royal Energy Resources Announces Recent Material Transactions

						 from   Royal Energy Resources, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


CHARLESTON, S.C., Aug. 5, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Royal Energy Resources, Inc. (OTC Markets: ROYE) today announced recent material transactions since restructuring earlier this year.     
On March 6, 2015, the Company underwent a change of control, whereby William Tuorto and his investment firm E-Starts Money Co. acquired an aggregate of 7,998,876 shares of Common Stock and 51,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. As a result, Mr. Tuorto became the beneficial owner of 92.3% of the outstanding Common Stock and 51% of the Preferred Stock. In connection with the transactions, Mr. Tuorto assumed control of the Board of Directors as its sole member and Chairman, and was appointed to fill all interim executive positions then vacated, as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer of the Company.  As a result, there is very limited stock available to the public, and the Company cautions existing and prospective shareholders and investors that its stock price may not reflect the Company's true valuation at this time.  
Subsequently, and in conjunction with a series of related-party transactions described below, Mr. Tuorto made the following executive appointments: Ronald Phillips, as President and interim Secretary; Douglas Holsted, as Chief Financial Officer; and Ian Ganzer, as Chief Operating Officer. 
Since acquiring control of the Company and assembling an initial executive team, Mr. Tuorto has repositioned the Company to focus on the acquisition of North American natural resource assets, including coal, oil, gas and renewables, seeking to acquire high-quality assets at distressed pricing in today's fragmented energy markets. The Company's initial footprint is in the coal sector, entering into the following transactions:
On April 17, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of all issued and outstanding membership units of Blaze Minerals, LLC, holder of approximately 40,976 net acres of coal and coal-bed methane (CBM), located across 22 counties in West Virginia. The Company acquired Blaze Minerals by the issuance of 2,803,621 shares of Common Stock, and was valued in Q3 at $7,009,053.    
On May 14, 2015, the Company entered into an Option Agreement to acquire substantially all the assets of Wellston Coal, LLC. The Company paid a nominal sum for the option and has the right to complete the purchase through September 1, 2015, by the issuance of 500,000 shares of Common Stock.  Wellston owns approximately 1,600 acres of surface and 2,200 acres of mineral rights in McDowell County, West Virginia. Wellston has approximately 3 million tons of mineable, high quality, mid-volatile metallurgical (Met) coal under permit, and access to an additional 3 million tons through permit extensions.
On May 29, 2015, the Company entered into an Option Agreement to acquire the membership units of Blaze Mining Company, LLC. The Company paid a nominal sum for the option and has the right to complete the purchase through September 1, 2015, by the issuance of 1,272,858 shares of Common Stock and $250,000.00 cash. Blaze Mining controls operations for and has the right to acquire 100% ownership of the Alpheus Coal Impoundment reclamation site in McDowell County, West Virginia. Alpheus has approximately 25 million tons of low-volatile Met fine and coarse coal. Alpheus has rail access, a permitted wash plant construction site, and an operating processing plant, which produces renewable energy in the form of coal pellets, for sale to utility customers using the onsite coal fines. Blaze Mining's operations are located within seven (7) miles from Wellston.
On June 10, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Blue Grove Coal, LLC and entered into a Definitive Agreement to acquire G.S. Energy, LLC.  GS Energy owns and leases approximately 6,000 acres of mineral rights in McDowell County, West Virginia. Based on a reserve report conducted in August of 2011, it is estimated that GS Energy holds 28.7 million tons of mid-volatile Met coal. Blue Grove is an affiliate company of GS Energy and is the operator of the mine. The Company acquired Blue Grove by the issuance of 350,000 shares of Common Stock with a market value of approximately $1,750,000 on the date of closing, based upon the market price of the Company's Common Stock.  The Company will acquire GS Energy, upon the completion of a financial audit, and by the issuance of 1,750,000 shares of Common Stock and $400,000 cash, with the exact purchase price to be determined based upon a market price of the Company's Common Stock on the date of Closing. At the time of execution, the market value for the GS Energy acquisition was $9,150,000. GS Energy's operations are located within thirty (30) miles of Wellston and Alpheus. The Company plans future integration of the operations in the form of blended coal sales, administrative efficiencies, and logistical cost-savings among the assets.
The GS Energy mine produces a low ash, clean Met coal that commands premium pricing and allows for profitable production in the currently depressed marketplace.  Blue Grove is presently operating at the mine, fulfilling orders, and anticipates annual production of approximately 150,000 tons, with annual revenues well in excess of $10,000,000.
The Company is currently evaluating a number of additional coal mining assets for acquisition, including expanding and balancing its portfolio in the thermal (steam) coal space.
The Company is committed to continue to report its progress as it business and operations develop, via additional press releases; by visiting its website at www.royalenergy.us; and by searching "Royal Energy Resources" via Twitter, Facebook and Instagram social media.  The above release should be read in conjunction with past submissions of the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, on Form 8-K or otherwise, and can be obtained online at www.sec.gov.  
This press release includes forward-looking statements as defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 relating to matters such as prospects, anticipated operating and financial performance. Actual prospects and performance may differ from anticipated results due to economic conditions and other risks, uncertainties and circumstances partly or totally outside the control of the Company. These and other risks are described in the Company's reports filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. These forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this communication and Royal Energy Resources, Inc. undertakes no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.

Luc Martin-Privat
Our Brew Master
Meet Luc our Brew Master. He is the brains behind GURU.  In fact, while he could have become your friendly neighborhood pharmacist, Luc had other dreams…
From the functional herbs he started playing with in his dad’s lab to his PhD in Pharmacology, Luc has mastered the art of blending botanicals, an art he is now applying to our beloved GURU.
Always on the lookout for smart organics from around the world, Luc is looking into the GURU recipe “Organically” to make it perfect everytime! And when he is not looking at new ways to craft our GURU, Luc is dreaming about new products!
