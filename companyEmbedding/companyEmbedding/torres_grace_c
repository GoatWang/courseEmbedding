In Search of the Heroes






When Holley Vaughn asked her father for help on a history paper, she never realized the effect it would have on students, teachers and families across the country. Understanding his daughter's disinterest in dry history, Greg Vaughn wondered why someone didn't do something to make it more interesting. Being a film maker, he decided that the someone should be HIM!
"In Search of the Heroes" was born out a parent's desire to make history come alive for his children. The collection has won every major educational award that can be won, including 2 Emmy's. Available on DVD and online streaming.
Come along on the journey and "PREPARE FOR ADVENTURE!"

Testimonies
I am a high school teacher and teach students with behavioral disorders. Many of my kids are members of gangs. Most have a criminal record of some sort. I just wanted to write and tell you how moved I (and my class) was upon viewing your movie "Forget Me Not". READ MORE
