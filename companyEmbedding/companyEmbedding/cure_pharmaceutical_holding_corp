CURE Pharmaceutical Initiates Cancer Cannabis Study - CURE Pharmaceutical Holding Corp.

Specifically, the company, along with its partner Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, will be testing to see if these cannabinoid molecules will attack tumorous cancer cells. CURE Pharmaceutical is primarily a drug delivery company. It is headquartered in Oxnard, California, and is best known for its CureFilm, a thin oral film that helps medicine enter a patient's bloodstream more quickly. CURE announced that it has entered into a partnership with Technion Research and Development Foundation to research different cannabinoid compounds to treat various types of cancer, including prostate and leukemia. "It's an area that hasn't received attention," said Rob Davidson, Chief Executive Officer of CURE. "There is strong anecdotal evidence, but we want to put some science into it," he said. Specifically, CURE would like to target tumor cells. The Israeli team, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Technion - Israel Institute of Technology will conduct the study, but CURE will identify the appropriate cannabinoid molecules to study. This news comes on the heels of CURE announcing earlier this month that it was going to enter into the pharmaceutical cannabis sector. The idea is that the two teams will research and identify how varying cannabinoid compounds within cannabis strains can affect various cancer subtypes. According to the company's press release, CURE can take that information to predict how to match a cancer subtype with an effective cannabis extract in order to get the best treatment results. They are also looking at pairing the cannabis treatment with chemo. Cannabis is sometimes used by cancer patients for pain or nausea but not to treat the cancer itself. Technion's lab group has already discovered two new pathways that have been activated by cannabis extracts in cancer cells.
 The American Cancer Society says, "While the studies so far have shown that cannabinoids can be safe in treating cancer, they do not show that they help control or cure the disease. More recently, scientists reported that THC and other cannabinoids such as CBD slow growth and/or cause death in certain types of cancer cells growing in lab dishes." The group supports the need for more scientific research on cannabis and cancer. Davidson said that they should have some data points in the first six months. "First, we'll do an in-vitro study and see the effects on cancer cells," he said. "We can get into human trials pretty quickly in Israel." The strategy will be to develop new chemical entities out of this research and potentially effective therapeutics for multiple indications. CURE plans to patent these molecules and will be pursuing the proper channels with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Normally, the initiation of a study isn't considered newsworthy because it is the results of the study that are more significant. Yet, several doctors expressed their support of the study. Bonnie Goldstein, formerly Chief Resident at Los Angeles Children's hospital said, "I currently take care of many patients, both adults and children, that have life-threatening advanced cancers and so far, I have been unable to match cannabis treatment to the patient's specific cancer sub-type. Initial studies show that different cancers respond to the anti-neoplastic effects of different cannabinoids. This research will answer this question and will allow physicians like myself to tailor treatment for cancer patients." CURE Pharmaceutical hasn't been a public company for very long. In November of 2016, the company engaged in a reverse take-over of Makkanoti Group, a Greek paper bag company and changed the company's symbol. CURE Pharmaceutical was originally incorporated in 2011 and is still a very early stage company. Revenues for the first quarter of 2017 were only $31,945, whereas expenses were $2.4 million. Total assets are only $2.6 million, so it will be critical for the company to either raise additional capital or quickly turn these plans into revenue producers.
 CURE Pharmaceutical hit a year's high of $8.85 and is currently trading at approximately $8.00 a share in the OTC Market. The company has a market value of $186 million with 23 million outstanding shares. The short interest in the stock has dropped by 41% as of April. If CURE gets the positive results it is hoping for and is able to capitalize on this data quickly, it will help the company get its cannabis business off the ground. However, study results can't be guaranteed, and like any biotech company, if the study doesn't generate the data it is hoping for, then it has spent over $600,000 on a test that didn't pan out the way it wanted. With short interest dropping, it seems other investors are willing to take a shot on this company. Also, a good result on this study will be beneficial to all CBD makers in the market, and they are no doubt watching the results as well.

	NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	MARCH 31, 2017




	(UNAUDITED)



	 



	NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS



	 


	Cure Pharmaceutical Holding Corp (the “Company”), formally known as Makkanotti Group Corp, was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 15, 2014. The Company was formed to engage in the business of manufacturing food paper bags in Nicosia, Cyprus. On November 7, 2016, the Company changed its name to Cure Pharmaceutical Holding Corp.


	 


	On November 7, 2016, the Company, in a reverse take-over transaction, acquired Cure Pharmaceutical Corporation (“Cure Pharmaceutical”), a specialty pharmaceutical and bioscience company based in California that specializes in drug delivery technologies, by executing a Share Exchange Agreement and Conversion Agreement (“Exchange Agreement”) by and among the Company and a holder of a majority of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the registrant prior to the closing (the “Majority Stockholder”), on the one hand, and Cure Pharmaceutical, a California corporation, all of the shareholders of Cure Pharmaceutical’s issued and outstanding share capital (the “Cure Pharm Shareholders”) and the holders of certain convertible promissory notes of Cure Pharmaceutical (“Cure Pharm Noteholders”), on the other hand. Hereinafter, this share exchange transaction is described as the “Share Exchange.” As a result of the Share Exchange, Cure Pharmaceutical became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and the Cure Pharm Shareholders and Cure Pharm Noteholders became the controlling shareholders of the Company.


	 


	For accounting purposes, Cure Pharmaceutical shall be the surviving entity. The transaction is accounted for using the reverse acquisition method of accounting. As a result of the recapitalization and change in control, Cure Pharmaceutical is the acquiring entity in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations.


	 


	Cure Pharmaceutical Corporation is a specialty pharmaceutical and bioscience company with a focus in drug delivery technologies. Cure leverages novel drug delivery technologies to develop and commercialize new applications of proven therapeutics through Oral Thin Film (“OTF”) via our proprietary patented CureFilm™ Technology as well as through transdermal applications. Our micro encapsulation of drug actives in our CureFilm™ Technology allows for a higher volume of an active and if required, multiple actives to be produced on a single oral thin film strip.


	 


	The Company is focused on partnering with pharmaceutical and biotech companies seeking to deliver drug actives utilizing and benefitting from our proprietary OTF and transdermal applications and when preferable to take our own products from clinical process to commercialization. We are focused on both the human and veterinary prescription, OTC and nutraceutical markets. Cure represents the complete solution for OTF drug delivery therapeutics from inception to finished product utilizing our CGMP/FDA registered manufacturing facility and processes.


	 



	NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	 




	Principal of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation




	 


	The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cure Pharmaceutical Holding Corp (“CPHC”) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Cure Pharmaceutical Corporation (“Cure”), collectively referred to as (“Cure”, “we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company” All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company’s film strip product represents the principal operations of the Company.


	 


	The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial statements and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Accordingly, they do not contain all information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for annual financial statements. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all the adjustments necessary (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) to present the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2017, and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto included in Form 10-K for the fiscal period ended December 31, 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on April 17, 2017.

	NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	MARCH 31, 2017




	(UNAUDITED)







	 




	Use of Estimates




	 


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues, costs and expenses during the reporting period. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 




	Cash and Cash Equivalents




	 


	The Company considers all cash on hand and in banks, including accounts in book overdraft positions, certificates of deposit and other highly-liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash and cash equivalents. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company had no cash equivalents. At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) in accounts that at times may be in excess of the federally insured limit of $250,000 per bank. The Company minimizes this risk by placing its cash deposits with major financial institutions.


	 




	Investment in Associates




	 


	An associate is an entity over which the Company has significant influence through a joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but not control or joint control over those policies.


	 


	The results of assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the condensed consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Company’s share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of the investment. Losses of an associate in excess of the Company’s interest in that associate are not recognized. Additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognized, only to the extent that the Company has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.


	 


	Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Company’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the associate recognized at the date of acquisition is recognized as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment.


	 


	On January 8, 2016, the Company received 50% ownership in Cure Innovations, Inc (“CI”). CI was created in 2015 by IncuBrands Studio, Inc (“IncuBrands”). The Company and IncuBrands each own 50% of the common stock of CI. The Company and IncuBrands entered into a Joint Venture agreement in 2013 to distribute several OTF products utilizing IncuBrands marketing and contacts in various industries as well as utilize the Company’s technology and capabilities of manufacturing OTF’s.


	 


	On December 6, 2016, the Company entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (“Joint Venture”) with Pace Wellness, Inc. (“Pace”) to jointly develop three Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (“API”) within the nonprescription and/or Over-the-Counter (OTC) medicines specifically utilizing the Company’s patented and proprietary CureFilm™ Technology. The three API’s to be jointly developed are Diphenhydramine HCL, Omeprazole and a third API to be determined at a later date (“Products”). Pace shall be the exclusive global distributor of the Products under the Solves Strips® branding or other private or branded labels. All benefits, advantages, and liabilities derived from, or incurred in respect of the Joint Venture shall be borne by the parties in proportion of their respective participating interests of 50/50 equal interest.


	 




	Property and Equipment




	 


	The Company capitalizes expenditures related to property and equipment, subject to a minimum rule, that have a useful life greater than one year for: (1) assets purchased; (2) existing assets that are replaced, improved or the useful lives have been extended; or (3) all land, regardless of cost. Acquisitions of new assets, additions, replacements and improvements (other than land) costing less than the minimum rule in addition to maintenance and repair costs, including any planned major maintenance activities, are expensed as incurred. Depreciation has been provided using the straight-line method on the following estimated useful lives:


	 









	Manufacturing equipment






	5-7 Years










	Computer and other equipment






	3-7 Years










	Leasehold Improvements






	Lesser of useful life or the term of the lease

	NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	MARCH 31, 2017




	(UNAUDITED)







	 




	Accounts Receivable




	 


	Accounts receivable are generally unsecured. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on the age of outstanding invoices and management’s evaluation of collectability. Accounts are written off after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted and management concludes that likelihood of collection is remote. Any future recoveries are applied against the allowance for doubtful accounts.


	 




	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets






	 


	Long-lived assets include equipment and intangible assets other than those with indefinite lives. We assess the carrying value of our long-lived asset groups when indicators of impairment exist and recognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable when compared to undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.


	 


	Indicators of impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in our use of the assets or in our business strategy, loss of or changes in customer relationships and significant negative industry or economic trends. When indications of impairment arise for a particular asset or group of assets, we assess the future recoverability of the carrying value of the asset (or asset group) based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If carrying value exceeds projected, net, undiscounted cash flows, an additional analysis is performed to determine the fair value of the asset (or asset group), typically a discounted cash flow analysis, and an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value over fair value. There was no impairment on our long-lived assets during the three months ended March 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company wrote off $58,522 of patents.


	 




	Revenue Recognition




	 


	The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the FASB ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. ASC 605 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred and/or service has been performed; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. The Company believes that these criteria are satisfied upon shipment from our facility. Freight billed to customers is presented as revenues, and the related freight costs are presented as cost of goods sold. Deferred revenue is recognized when earned and all significant obligations have been satisfied.


	 




	Advertising Expense




	 


	The Company expenses marketing, promotions and advertising costs as incurred. Such costs are included in general and administrative expense in the accompanying statements of operations. The Company recorded advertising costs of $1,876 for the three months period ended March 31, 2017 and none for the three month period ended March 31, 2016.


	 




	Research and Development




	 


	Costs incurred in connection with the development of new products and processes are charged to research and development expenses as incurred.


	 




	Income Taxes




	 


	The Company utilizes FASB ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is “more likely-than-not” that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.

	NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	MARCH 31, 2017




	(UNAUDITED)





	 


	The Company generated a deferred tax asset through net operating loss carry-forward. However, a valuation allowance of 100% has been established due to the uncertainty of the Company’s realization of the net operating loss carry forward prior to its expiration.


	 




	Stock-Based Compensation




	 


	Stock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment Topic of ASC 718 which requires recognition in the consolidated financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award.


	 


	Pursuant to ASC Topic 505-50, for share-based payments to consultants and other third-parties, compensation expense is determined at the “measurement date.” The expense is recognized over the vesting period of the award. Until the measurement date is reached, the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. The Company initially records compensation expense based on the fair value of the award at the reporting date.


	 




	Fair Value Measurements




	 


	The Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”, which defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements.


	 


	The estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.


	 


	ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:


	 


	Level 1 — quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities


	Level 2 — quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable


	Level 3 — inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)


	 


	The Company has no assets or liabilities valued at fair value on a recurring basis.


	 




	Basic and diluted loss per share




	 


	Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss for the period by the weighted average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Common equivalent shares, which consist of stock options and warrants, have been excluded from the diluted loss per share calculation because their effect is anti-dilutive.


	 




	Going Concern




	 


	The Company’s financial statements are prepared using U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had an accumulated deficit at March 31, 2017 of $13,339,056. The Company had a working capital of $693,961 as at March 31, 2017. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of the financial statements. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it establishes a revenue stream and becomes profitable. The Company is continually analyzing its current costs and is attempting to make additional cost reductions where possible. We expect that we will continue to generate losses from operations throughout 2017.

	NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	MARCH 31, 2017




	(UNAUDITED)





	 


	In order to continue as a going concern and to develop a reliable source of revenues, and achieve a profitable level of operations the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management’s plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional capital through borrowing and/or sales of equity and debt securities. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.


	 


	The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.


	 




	Recently Issued Standards




	 


	In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The purpose is to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments to provide users of financial statements with more decision-useful information. This ASU is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018. Early adoption is not permitted except for limited provisions. The Company does not expect the adoption of this amendment to have a material effect on its financial condition and results of operations.


	 


	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The new standard requires recognition of the income tax effects of vested or settled awards in the income statement and involves several other aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. This new standard became effective for the Company on January 1, 2017. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or statements of cash flows upon adoption.


	 


	In August, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force) (“ASU 2016-15”). The amendments in ASU 2016-15 address eight specific cash flow issues and apply to all entities that are required to present a statement of cash flows under ASC Topic 230, Statement of Cash Flows. The amendments in ASU 2016-15 are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption during an interim period. The Company has not yet completed the analysis of how adopting this guidance will affect its consolidated financial statements.


	 


	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business. This new standard clarifies the definition of a business and provides a screen to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business. The screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. This new standard will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2018; however, early adoption is permitted with prospective application to any business development transaction.


	 


	There are various other updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

	BUSINESS






	 


	CURE Pharmaceutical Holding Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 15, 2014. The Company was formerly named Makkanotti Group Corp. and was formed to engage in the business of manufacturing food paper bags in Nicosia, Cyprus.


	 


	On November 7, 2016, the board of directors and the majority stockholder of the then outstanding shares of registrant’s common stock executed a written consent to change registrant’s name from Makkanotti Group Corp. to CURE Pharmaceutical Holdings Corp. The Certificate of Amendment to Articles of Incorporation was filed with the State of Nevada on November 30, 2016.


	 




	CURE Pharmaceutical Corporation




	 


	Our wholly owned subsidiary and operating business, Cure Pharmaceutical, located in Oxnard, California was originally incorporated in July 2011 as a developer of advanced oral thin film (“OTF”) for the delivery of nutraceutical, Over-The-Counter (“OTC”) and prescription products for human and veterinary markets. We utilize drug delivery technologies to develop and commercialize new applications of proven therapeutics through our CureFilm™ technology, as well as through sublingual and transdermal applications. Our exclusive micro encapsulation of drug actives allows for a higher volume of an active and if required, multiple actives to be produced on a single OTF strip. We expect this technology will allow us to produce a broad spectrum of pharmaceutical, OTC and nutraceutical products.


	 




	Our Product




	 




	CureFilm™ Technology and Value Proposition




	 


	Typical forms of drug delivery that consumers have been familiar with over the years, include tablets, capsules, chewables, gummies, and more recent developments, such as melts and sublingual drops and sprays. We believe that we are one of the companies at the forefront of OTF drug delivery technology. Our OTF product is about the size of a postage stamp using a matrix that maximizes the amount of “active” drug that can be delivered via OTF.


	 


	Our CureFilm™ Technology consists of patented, patent pending and trade secrets in two areas: OTF – Core Technology, Sublingual Technology and Transdermal (skin) Technology.


	 


	Our proprietary multi-layer CureFilm™ allows dosages of many pharmaceutical, OTC and nutraceutical products to be put onto a small strip applied to the cheek (buccal), or under the tongue (sublingual). We believe that what sets us apart from the competition is our proprietary patented CureFilm™ Technology, multi-layer systems and formulation technologies that:


	 











	·






	Consists of two components - a liquid-based film layer that contains and stabilizes the active ingredients, and a powder matrix layer.









	·





	Provides improved stability as well as delivery of active ingredients.









	·





	Contains functional qualities to include extra flavoring ingredients, pliability enhancers, and mucosal permeation enhancers.





	 


	In a two-layer strip, the layers are designed to work together, in combination with the powder composition. The powder composition can be varied, as can the muco-adhesion properties of the strips, to alter the dissolution and absorption rates of the medicament. A complete multilayer system allows for increased stability, higher loading of active ingredients, and increased taste and palatability.

	Table of Contents






	 


	Another recent advancement in our CureFilm™ Technology utilizes micro-encapsulation of selected active ingredients. In the micro-encapsulation process, microscopic particles or droplets envelop the active ingredients to protect and shield them. The technique used in the micro-encapsulation process depends on various factors including the physical and chemical properties of the active ingredients. This micro-encapsulation technology has allowed the delivery of higher dosing with better flavor masking.


	 


	We have various types of CureFilm™ dietary supplement products that are being commercialized and developed. These include:

	MacuStrip Vitamin complex (eye health product)

	Clinical Development




	 


	We partner with pharmaceutical companies looking for new methods to deliver drug actives. Under Section (505)(b)(2) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, (“(505)(b)(2)”) the FDA may grant market exclusivity for a term of up to three years of exclusivity following approval of a listed drug that contains previously approved active ingredients but is approved in a new dosage, dosage form, route of administration or combination. The 505(b)(2) pathway is also the regulatory approach to be followed if an applicant intends to file an application for a product containing a drug that is already approved by the FDA for a certain indication and for which the applicant is seeking approval for a new indication or for a new use, the approval of which is required to be supported by new clinical trials, other than bioavailability studies. We have implemented a strategy under which we actively look for such so-called “repurposing opportunities” and determine whether our proprietary CureFilm™ Technology adds value to the product.


	 


	We currently have five such drug repurposing projects in our development pipeline, although there can be no assurance that such projects will be fully developed. The companies we partner with are typically responsible for managing the regulatory approval process of the product with the FDA and/or other regulatory bodies, as well as for the marketing and distribution of the products. On a case-by-case basis, we may be responsible for providing all or part of the documentation required for the regulatory submission.


	 


	In addition to pursuing partnering arrangements that provide for the full funding of a drug development project, we may undertake development of selected product opportunities until the marketing and distribution stage. We would first assess the potential and associated costs for successful development of a product, and then determine at which stage it would be most prudent to seek a partner, balancing costs against the potential for higher returns later in the development process. We currently have five of such potential drug candidates in our product pipeline, all of which are in the formulation development and pre-clinical phase of development. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully develop, market and distribute OTF products for these drug candidates.

	Competition




	 


	We face competition from other companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific and management personnel and for licenses to additional technologies. Many of our competitors, including Monosol, BioDelivery Sciences International, IntelGenx and LTS Lohmann, will have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Our success will be based in part on our ability to build, obtain regulatory approval for and market acceptance of, and actively manage a portfolio of drugs that addresses unmet medical needs and creates value in patient therapy.


	 


	The OTF manufacturing industry is relatively new, having only emerged over the last ten years. Although currently there are just a handful of current players within this industry, we expect that we will be subject to competition from numerous other companies that currently operate or are planning to enter the markets in which we compete. To date, among manufacturers of OTF, some medications that either are or have been available by OTF manufacturers in the marketplace include:


	 










	·





	Zuplenz (the first oral soluble film approved by the FDA as a prescription medication)









	·





	Benadryl (diphenhydramine product and anti-histamine used for allergies and mild sedative)









	·





	Gas-X (simethicone product for bloating, gas, and gastrointestinal complaint)









	·





	Melatonin PM (hormonal product sold as a “dietary supplement” marketed for insomnia)









	·





	Orajel Kids (benzocaine product for dental pain)









	·





	Suboxone (buprenorphine and naloxone fixed dosage combination product for opioid addiction)









	·





	Subutex (buprenorphine product for opioid addiction)









	·





	Sudafed (phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine product for nasal congestion)









	·





	TheraFlu (combination product of pain reliever, anti-pyretic and decongestant)









	·





	Triaminic (children’s anti-tussive product)





	 


	The barriers to enter this market are the “know how’s” of developing and formulating consumer desired products which taste great. Also, the high cost of entry by companies who have no expertise in the market makes entry by competitors risky since the technology to develop product is expensive and proprietary. The key factors affecting the development and commercialization of our drug delivery products are likely to include, among other factors:


	 










	·





	The safety and efficacy of our products;









	·





	The relative speed with which we can develop products;









	·





	Generic competition for any product that we develop;









	·





	Our ability to defend our existing intellectual property and to broaden our intellectual property and technology base;









	·





	Our ability to differentiate our products;









	·





	Our ability to develop products that can be manufactured on a cost effective basis;









	·





	Our ability to manufacture our products in compliance with cGMP and any other regulatory requirements; and









	·





	Our ability to obtain financing.





	 


	In order to establish ourselves as a viable industry partner, we plan to continue to invest in our research and development activities and in our manufacturing technology expertise, in order to further strengthen our technology base and to develop the ability to manufacture our CureFilm™ products ourselves, at competitive costs. Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business.


	 




	Significant Employees




	 


	We currently have no significant employees.


	 




	Office




	 


	Our office located at 1620 Beacon Place, Oxnard, California 93033. Our phone number is (805) 824-0410.


	 




	Government Regulation




	 


	We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to our business in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities. We do not believe that regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business.

	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS






	 




	Revenues for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.








	 


	Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $31,945 as compared to $28,609 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The slight increase was principally due to the Company completing a couple of R&D phases with two customers. The Company did not generate this type of revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2016.


	 




	Cost of Goods Sold




	 


	Cost of goods sold was $35,550 in the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $27,165 in the three months ended March 31, 2016. Cost of goods sold increased by $8,385 in the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company utilized a new third party converter for one of our customers. Due to the vendor having issues converting, we incurred additional unexpected costs than normal.


	 




	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses




	 


	Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 amounted to $2,402,547, and for three months ended March 31, 2016 amounted to $293,436. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, selling, general and administrative expenses were mainly comprised of amortization, commission, insurance, payroll, consulting and rent expenses. The increase in the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016 was due to the increase in payroll, insurances and public market expenses as well as noncash transactions relating to common stock to be issued for consulting services and recording the fair value of the warrants issued for services.


	 




	Research and Development Expenses




	 


	For the three months ended March 31, 2017, research and development expenses increased to $219,620 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016 of $127,352. As the Company was able to raise funds during 2016 by issuing convertible promissory notes, we were able to continue to focus on spending on improving our intellectual property. At the same time the Company focused on developing potential partnerships with pharmaceutical and bioscience companies and new OTC products.


	 




	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES






	 




	For the three months ended March 31, 2017




	 


	As of March 31, 2017, our total assets were $2,675,482 comprised of cash of $460,902, accounts receivable of $38,138, inventory of $79,358, prepaid expenses and other assets of $702,341, net property and equipment of $352,525, net intangibles of $894,689, and other assets of $147,529. Our total liabilities were $1,146,778 comprised of accounts payable of $293,981, accrued expenses of $29,921, current portion of loan and note payables of $72,548, current portion of capital lease payable of $6,390, deferred revenue of $183,938 and license fees of $560,000.


	 



	Cash flows used in operating activities



	 


	For the three months ended March 31, 2017, operating activities consumed $596,134 of cash. This was primarily the result of a net loss of $2,620,342, offset by depreciation and amortization of $48,258, stock payable for services of $115,644, and warrants issued for services of $1,801,993 as well as the changes in accounts receivable of $31,089, prepaid expenses of $35,894, accounts payable of $28,595 and deferred revenue of $10,320.


	 



	Cash flows used in investing activities



	 


	Investment activities used an additional $35,314 of cash during the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily as a result of payments for patents and costs associated in the development and improvement of our intellectual property of $11,000, payment to investment of $5,000 and acquisition of property and equipment of $19,314.


	 



	Cash flows provided by financing activities



	 


	Financing activities used $13,972 of cash for the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily as the result of repayments of loan and capital lease payables of $13,972.

	CRITICAL ACCOUTNING POLICIES




	 


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Note 2 – “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or condition


	 




	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets






	 


	Long-lived assets include equipment and intangible assets other than those with indefinite lives. We assess the carrying value of our long-lived asset groups when indicators of impairment exist and recognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable when compared to undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.


	 


	Indicators of impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in our use of the assets or in our business strategy, loss of or changes in customer relationships and significant negative industry or economic trends. When indications of impairment arise for a particular asset or group of assets, we assess the future recoverability of the carrying value of the asset (or asset group) based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If carrying value exceeds projected, net, undiscounted cash flows, an additional analysis is performed to determine the fair value of the asset (or asset group), typically a discounted cash flow analysis, and an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value over fair value. There was no impairment on our long-lived assets during the three months ended March 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company wrote off $58,522 of patents.


	 




	Going Concern






	 


	The Company has an accumulated deficit balance as of March 31, 2017. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it establishes a revenue stream and becomes profitable. The Company is continually analyzing its current costs and is attempting to make additional cost reductions where possible. We expect that we will continue to generate losses from operations throughout the remainder of 2017.


	 


	In order to continue as a going concern and to develop a reliable source of revenues, and achieve a profitable level of operations the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management’s plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional capital through borrowing and/or sales of equity and debt securities. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.


	 


	The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.


	 



	OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS



	 


	As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

	ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES




	 


	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(t) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:


	 







	 



	1.


	Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;





	 




	 




	 






	 



	2.


	Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of our management and directors; and





	 




	 




	 






	 



	3.


	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.




	 


	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


	 


	Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2017. Based on this assessment, management concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting as a result of the identified material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below. In making this assessment, management used the framework set forth in the report entitled Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO. The COSO framework summarizes each of the components of a company’s internal control system, including (i) the control environment, (ii) risk assessment, (iii) control activities, (iv) information and communication and (v) monitoring.


	 




	Identified Material Weakness






	 


	A material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement or the financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Management identified the segregation of duties as a material weakness during its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as of March 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2017, we had one full-time employee with the requisite expertise in the key functional areas of finance and accounting. As a result, there is a lack of proper segregation of duties necessary to ensure that all transactions are accounted for accurately and in a timely manner. As our resources allow, we will add financial personnel to our management team.


	 




	Changes In Internal Control Over Financial Reporting




	 


	There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to have a material affect, on our internal control over financial reporting.

CURE Pharmaceutical and CannaKids Announce Research Collaboration with Technion Research and Development Foundation Ltd. on Cancer-Fighting Cannabinoids
May 31 17
CURE Pharmaceutical announced that the CURE and the CannaKids partnership has entered into a strategic research collaboration with Technion Research and Development Foundation Ltd. in order to research how different cannabinoid compounds within cannabis strains can be used to treat various subtypes of cancer. Researchers from CURE’s Pharmaceutical Cannabinoid Division and Technion’s Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Cannabinoid Research will work together to research and identify how varying cannabinoid compounds within cannabis strains can affect various cancer subtypes. The results of the research will be used to predict how to match a cancer subtype with an effective cannabis extract in order to optimize treatment efficacy. Technion’s lab group recently discovered two new pathways that have been activated by cannabis extracts in cancer cells. Technion is looking forward to this partnership and working with CURE to continue uncovering the vast therapeutic potential of the cannabinoids found in various cannabis species. Accumulating evidence indicates that cannabinoids have antitumor effects, as several studies have demonstrated the use of cannabinoids in being able to regress different cancer types. This research collaboration with CURE will help the company with their goal of determining which cannabis strains might be used to tackle different cancer cells and what cannabinoid compounds within the plant are responsible for the ability to kill these cells.
