WALTHAM, Mass., July  27, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Histogenics Corporation (Nasdaq:HSGX), a regenerative medicine company focused on developing and commercializing products in the musculoskeletal space, announced it will release its financial and operational results for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, on August 10, 2017 before the market opens. 
Histogenics' management will host a conference call on Thursday, August 10, 2017 at 8:30 a.m. EDT.  A question-and-answer session will follow Histogenics' remarks.  To participate on the live call, please dial (877) 930-8064 (domestic) or (253) 336-8040 (international) and provide the conference ID "37210066" five to ten minutes before the start of the call.

About Histogenics Corporation
Histogenics is a leading regenerative medicine company developing and commercializing novel tissue therapies that may offer more rapid and durable recoveries for patients with pain and loss of function due to musculoskeletal conditions.  Histogenics' regenerative medicine platform combines expertise in cell processing, scaffolding, tissue engineering and bioadhesives to create tissue ex-vivo.  Histogenics' first investigational product candidate, NeoCart is designed to treat cartilage defects in the knee.  The Company recently completed enrollment of its NeoCart Phase 3 clinical trial and expects to report topline data in the third quarter of 2018.  NeoCart is designed to exhibit characteristics of articular, hyaline cartilage prior to and upon implantation into the knee and therefore does not rely on the body to make new cartilage.  As a result, NeoCart is the only product in development or on the market with a one-year primary superiority endpoint as compared to the standard of care.  There are more than 500,000 or more knee cartilage procedures in the United States each year, with many healthy active adults avoiding treatment as they seek other alternatives.  Left untreated, even a small cartilage defect can expand in size and progress to debilitating osteoarthritis, ultimately necessitating a joint replacement procedure.  Osteoarthritis is more common in adults over the age of 50, but the condition and precursors of the condition can be observed much earlier, and cartilage damage is believed to be one of the leading contributors of this disease.  For more information, please visit www.histogenics.com.

About Regenerative Medicine
About Cartilage Repair

NeoCart
NeoCart, our Phase 3 investigational product utilizes many aspects of our regenerative medicine platform to repair knee cartilage damage. A NeoCart implant is produced using a patient’s own cartilage cells harvested from the non-weight-bearing cartilage surface of the patient’s femur. The cells are expanded, embedded in our proprietary type I collagen scaffold and then incubated in our proprietary Tissue Engineering Processor (TEP), which is designed to simulate the variation in mechanical forces and low oxygen tension of the knee joint. We believe incubation in this environment helps to ensure that the chondrocyte phenotype is maintained and the cells are producing extracellular matrix proteins crucial to cartilage function prior to implantation. Once biomarkers indicate early signs of chondrocyte function, the neocartilage construct is shipped to the surgical facility and implanted into the patient’s knee defect using our CT3 bioadhesive.

NeoCart Study
Website

A Phase 1 clinical trial conducted in the United States demonstrated favorable preliminary results, which supported proceeding to a Phase 2 clinical trial. The two-year results of our Phase 1 clinical trial are publicly available. Crawford et al. Am J Sports Med. 2009;37:1334-1343.
A Phase 2 clinical trial conducted in the United States comparing NeoCart to the standard-of-care microfracture met its endpoints for safety and for improvement in pain and function. These results support the continued clinical development of NeoCart. The two-year results of our Phase 2 clinical trial are publicly available. Crawford et al. J Bone Joint Surg Am. 2012;94:979-89.
A Phase 3 clinical trial conducted in the United States comparing NeoCart to the standard-of-care microfracture is currently in progress. Information about the study is available on clinicaltrials.gov.
Investigational Treatment
The investigational NeoCart treatment has three phases.

Cell collection – The process begins during a short, simple arthroscopic examination when an orthopedic surgeon takes a cartilage biopsy from a non-weight bearing area of the joint. The tissue biopsy is sent to the Histogenics manufacturing facility for culturing into the implant.
Tissue production – The cartilage cells, or chondrocytes, are isolated from the cartilage and multiplied using standard tissue culture techniques. The cells are harvested, seeded into a unique 3-dimensional collagen scaffold, and cultured under exacting conditions of high pressure, oxygen concentration and perfusion.
Implant – After a few weeks, a discrete three-dimensional piece of the patient’s own neocartilage, potentially having characteristics of maturing native articular cartilage, is sent to the physician and implanted into the defect in a simple procedure that usually takes less than an hour. We believe within months, there is potential for the matrix to remodel, for the cells to mature, and for the cartilage to integrate with the host tissue.

Caution: New Biologic. NeoCart is limited by federal law to investigational use only and is not available for sale

Histogenics Corporation to Present at Upcoming Industry Conferences




















May 16, 2017 08:30 ET

 | Source: Histogenics Corporation





WALTHAM, Mass., May  16, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Histogenics Corporation (Histogenics) (Nasdaq:HSGX), a regenerative medicine company focused on developing and commercializing products in the musculoskeletal space, today announced that Management will be presenting at several upcoming industry conferences. 12th World Advanced Therapies & Regenerative Medicine Congress – London, England (May 17-19, 2017)Adam Gridley, Histogenics’ CEO, will be participating in several panels discussing regulatory strategies and capital raising and for regenerative medicine companies.  With over 600 participants, 200 speakers and 7 tracks of content, the congress is a vibrant platform for knowledge sharing in the areas of stem cells, gene therapy, T-cell receptors and gene editing. A presentation “Hybrid US/Japanese Clinical and Regulatory Strategies” is scheduled for Wednesday, May 17th, where Mr. Gridley will share the Company’s experience working with the Japanese regulatory authorities for Histogenics’ lead cell therapy product NeoCart.  Additionally, Mr. Gridley will be hosting a plenary roundtable discussion regarding “Analytical Considerations for Cellular Therapy Manufacturing” on Wednesday, May 17th. Lastly, a presentation “Public Market Fundraising for Regenerative Medicine Companies” is scheduled for Thursday, May 18th.Alliance for Regenerative Medicine Cell and Gene Exchange – Washington, DC (May 22-23, 2017)Stephen Kennedy, Histogenics’ CTO, will be participating on a panel on Tuesday, May 23rd discussing promising cell and gene therapy programs.  The Cell & Gene Exchange is a partnering meeting focused on bringing together the regulatory, business and patient advocacy communities. In conjunction with this meeting, Mr. Kennedy will also participate in a meeting of the Standards Coordinating Body for Gene, Cell and Regenerative Medicines and Cell-based Drug Discovery (SCB).  The SCB is a multi-stakeholder consortium in the cell and gene therapy sector working to support the development, dissemination, education and implementation of relevant standards and related deliverables via public-private partnerships and ongoing work with national and international consensus standards organizations.  The SCB’s goal is to serve as a source of information, knowledge, experience and data collection related to process, material and reference standards to enable more efficient and successful development, manufacture and testing of advanced therapies and cell-based drug discovery.  Mr. Kennedy was asked to join this committee in the first quarter of 2017 by the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine.Forum for Innovative Regenerative Medicine (FIRM) – Regenerative Medicine Crossroad® #4 Conference – Tokyo, Japan (June 1, 2017)Adam Gridley, Histogenics’ CEO, will be presenting a corporate overview including Histogenics’ recent progress negotiating a regulatory pathway for NeoCart in Japan.  The event is sponsored by the Regenerative Medicine Industrialization Tactical Committee of FIRM, and is designed to facilitate partnering and licensing discussions between innovative companies and Japanese regenerative medical companies in Japan. About Histogenics CorporationHistogenics is a leading regenerative medicine company developing and commercializing novel tissue therapies that may offer more rapid and durable recoveries for patients with pain and loss of function due to musculoskeletal conditions.  Histogenics’ regenerative medicine platform combines expertise in cell processing, scaffolding, tissue engineering and bioadhesives to create tissue ex-vivo.  Histogenics’ first investigational product candidate, NeoCart is designed to treat cartilage defects in the knee and is currently in Phase 3 clinical development.  NeoCart is designed to exhibit characteristics of articular, hyaline cartilage prior to and upon implantation into the knee and therefore does not rely on the body to make new cartilage.  As a result, NeoCart is the only product in development or on the market with a one-year primary superiority endpoint as compared to the standard of care.  There are more than 500,000 or more knee cartilage procedures in the United States each year, with many healthy active adults avoiding treatment as they seek other alternatives.  Left untreated, even a small cartilage defect can expand in size and progress to debilitating osteoarthritis, ultimately necessitating a joint replacement procedure.  Osteoarthritis is more common in adults over the age of 50, but the condition and precursors of the condition can be observed much earlier, and cartilage damage is believed to be one of the leading contributors of this disease.  For more information, please visit www.histogenics.com.
