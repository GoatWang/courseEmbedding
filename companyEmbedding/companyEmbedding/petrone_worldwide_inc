Petrone Consulting will bring their own methodologies and framework to identify problems to serve as the basis for recommendations for effective and efficient ways to execute and perform work tasks.
Interim Management As seasoned professionals with C-level experience we are prepared to fill the void when client companies face leadership, financial or operational challenges. In a moment’s notice, as experienced and credentialed senior executives we assume C-level roles, providing the leadership and strategic decision-making ability to maintain momentum, establish corporate priorities, build morale and provide critical continuity. We serve in the following roles: chief executive officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, chief restructuring officer, controller and treasurer. Petrone Consulting also has the capability to provide additional resources as needed.
Petrone Worldwide consulting members have experience at the highest levels of business, often having held senior positions for more than 25 years. We place a high priority on dedicating teams of executives who have served together on multiple engagements and have industry-specific experience
SERVICES
A Simple Framework • Long term goals. • Important projects. • Urgent tasks. • Maintenance tasks.

Internal consultants may be specifically suited to either:
1. Lead external consulting project teams, or
2. Act as organizational subject matter experts ‘embedded’ with external consulting teams under the direction of organizational management.
A group of internal consultants can closely monitor and work with external consulting firms. This would ensure better delivery, quality, and overall operating relationships. External firms providing consulting services have a dichotomy in priority. The health of the external firm is in aggregate more important than that of their client (though of course the health of their client can have a direct impact on their own health).
Internal consulting positions can be used to recruit and develop potential senior managers of the organization. Note: Corporations need to be conscious of and consistent with how internal consultant costs are accounted for on both a project and organizational level to evaluate cost effectiveness.
It is likely that the time and materials cost of internal consultants is significantly less than external consultants operating in the same capacity.
Internal relationship provides opportunities to keep certain corporate information private.
Often, the internal consultant requires less ramp up time on a project due to familiarity with the corporation, and is able to guide a project through to implementation — a step that would often be too costly if an external consultant were used.
If properly managed and empowered, internal consulting groups evaluate engagement on projects in light of the corporation’s strategic and tactical objectives.
Advantages- There are several potential benefits to employing internal consultants:
Change Management Assistance- -Development of Coaching Skills -Implementation of Technology -Development of Strategy -Operational Improvement

 
Creating Your Mission Statement, Setting Goals and Developing Strategies


A mission statement is a guiding light for a business and the individuals who run the business. It is usually made up of three parts:
Vision – big picture idea of what you want to achieve.
Mission – general statement of how you will achieve your vision.
Core Values – how you will behave during the process. Each of these three elements is an important aspect of the businesses guiding light.
Once you have developed your mission statement, the next step is to create the following items:
Goals – general statements of mileposts you need to meet to achieve your vision.
Objectives – specific, time-sensitive statements for achieving your goals Strategies/Action Plans – specific implementation plans of how you will achieve your objectives and goals.

Petrone Worldwide, Inc. (OTCMKTS:PFWI) Purchases Inventory to Satisfy the Increased Demand in the European and India Marketplace
 


















Weston, FL -- (ReleaseWire) -- 06/14/2017 --Petrone Worldwide, Inc. (OTCMKTS:PFWI), a leader in the hospitality industry with global operations capabilities, announces its official purchase of inventory to meet the increased demand in the European and India Marketplace. PFWI's founder, Victor Petrone, has spent over 20 years building a significant global network of institutional hospitality industry buyers (hotels, resorts and restaurants). PFWI is the exclusive importer and distributor for renowned brands. PFWI focuses as an importer and distributor throughout Europe and India for hospitality solutions for the finest hotels, restaurants and design firms worldwide, offering the hospitality industry an eclectic mix of materials and chic product options. This new inventory will increase PFWI revenue for the next two quarters at a rate faster than the company had previously projected.

Mr. Petrone believes that the potential for restauranteurs, hoteliers and design firms to easily access the products of PFWI is key; therefore, inventory in the market place is key. Growth in Q1 17 has increased by over 150% from Q1 16 predicated in large part on increasing standards of living and traveling in India, and other developing countries, making restaurant and hotel venues frequented while a recovery in the housing markets in the US and Western Europe, along with rebounding consumer confidence levels should also bolster sales gains causing global demand for major hoteliers to continue their growth and increase their supply chain requirements.

Petrone Worldwide, Inc. will continue to update both the public and shareholders on a regular basis by way of press releases, financial statements and other SEC disclosures.

About Petrone Worldwide, Inc. (OTCMKTS:PFWI)
Petrone Worldwide, Inc. is a leader in the hospitality industry with global operations capabilities. Now providing third party logistics for overseas manufacturing companies attempting to sell their goods in North America, PFWI sells and markets products under its own proprietary name and acts as distributor for a wide variety of companies to the hospitality trade.
