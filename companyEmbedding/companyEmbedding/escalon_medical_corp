(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion and analysis should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other financial information contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K and the discussion under "Risk Factors" included in Item IA of this Form 10-K.  Management historically reviewed financial information, allocated resources, and managed the business as two segments: Sonomed-Escalon and Escalon Medical Corp. ("Corporate"). The Sonomed-Escalon segment consisted of Sonomed, Inc., EMI and Trek, all of which are engaged in the development and sale of ophthalmic medical devices. The Escalon Medical Corp. segment includes the administrative corporate operations of the consolidated group. As the consolidated group is focused on one market, medical devices, segment reporting is no longer deemed necessary. Beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2015 filing management reviews financial information and manages the business as one entity engaged in the development and sale of ophthalmic medical devices. As a result of this change certain amounts in prior years were reclassified to conform to current year presentation.  Executive Overview-Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 The following highlights are discussed in further detail within this Form 10-K. The reader is encouraged to read this Form 10-K in its entirety to gain a more complete understanding of factors impacting Company performance and financial condition.   Product revenue from continuing operations increased approximately $782,000 or 6.3% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in revenue is attributed to the increased sales in Sonomed's ultrasound products of $531,000, increase in Digital products of $80,000 and in Trek products of $172,000.   Cost of goods sold as a percentage of product revenue from continuing operations increased to approximately 53.3% of product revenues during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, as compared to approximately 50.9% of product revenue for the prior fiscal year. The increase of 2.4% in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue is mainly due to the reduced margin of ultrasound products during the current period.   Operating expenses increased approximately 11.9% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, as compared to the prior fiscal year. This was due to increased marketing, general and administrative expenses of 15% and offset by a decrease of 0.3% in research and development.   The fourth quarter was hampered by the transition to new products which involved the discounting of our older product inventory and a material exchange rate reduction between the Euro and the US Dollar.  Results of Operations   Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2015 2014 % Change Product Revenue: Sonomed-Escalon $ 13,136 $ 12,354 6.3 % Total $ 13,136 $ 12,354 6.3 %  Consolidated product revenue from continuing operations increased approximately $782,000 or 6.3%, to $13,136,000 during the year ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the last fiscal year. The increase in revenue is attributed to the increased sales in Sonomed's ultrasound products of $530,000, increase in Digital products of $80,000 and in Trek products of $172,000.  The following table presents consolidated cost of goods sold and as a percentage of revenues for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014. Table amounts are in thousands:   Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2015 % 2014 % Cost of Goods Sold: Sonomed-Escalon $ 7,007 53.3 % $ 6,292 50.9 % Total $ 7,007 53.3 % $ 6,292 50.9 %  Consolidated cost of goods sold from continuing operations totaled approximately $7,007,000, or 53.3%, of product revenue from continuing operations, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 , as compared to $6,292,000, or 50.9%, of product revenue from continuing operations, for the prior fiscal year. The increase of 2.4% in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue is mainly due to the transition to new products, which involved the discounting of our older product inventory and a material exchange rate reduction between the Euro and the US Dollar.  The following table presents consolidated marketing, general and administrative expenses as well as identifying trends in marketing, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014. Table amounts are in thousands:   Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2015 2014 % Change Marketing, General and Administrative: Sonomed-Escalon $ 5,880 $ 5,113 15.0 % Total $ 5,880 $ 5,113 15.0 %  Consolidated marketing, general and administrative expenses from continuing operations increased $767,000, or 15%, to $5,880,000 during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, as compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses is due to increased stock option expense, executive retirement expense, commission expense, travel expense, headcount in sales, a commercial insurance refund recorded in the prior period and bad debt expense in the current year.  The following table presents consolidated research and development expenses from continuing operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014. Table amounts are in thousands:   Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2015 2014 % Change Research and Development: Sonomed Escalon $ 1,302 $ 1,306 (0.3 )% Total $ 1,302 $ 1,306 (0.3 )%  Consolidated research and development expenses from continuing operations decreased $4,000, or 0.3% of product revenue, to $1,302,000 during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, as compared to the prior fiscal year. Research and development expenses were primarily expenses associated with the introduction of new or enhanced products in the Sonomed-Escalon business unit.   2015 2014 Sonomed-Escalon $ 5,053,818 $ 5,420,401 Total $ 5,053,818 $ 5,420,401 Total Net Revenue $ 13,136,203 $ 12,353,796 38.5 % 43.9 %  Discontinued Operations  For the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 the Company had net income from discontinued operation of $511,000 and a net loss from discontinued operations of $32,000, respectively. During fiscal year 2015 the Company was informed by French Counsel that the total amount claimed by the BHH landlord in the liquidation of BHH was approximately $86,000. The Company did not have insight into the French liquidation process due to the Liquidator's reticence to communicate with the Company. As such, the Company had accrued the present value of the maximum amount potentially due under the lease guaranteed by the Company on behalf of BHH. The landlord's claim under liquidation of approximately $86,000 can not be revisited by the landlord and can only be potentially increased by interest or sundry expenses.  Other Income (Expense)  Liquidity and Capital Resources   June 30, 2015 2014 Current Ratio: Current assets $ 5,768 $ 6,897 Less: Current liabilities 2,762 3,351 Working capital $ 3,006 $ 3,546 Current ratio 2.1 to 1 2.1 to 1 Debt to Total Capital Ratio: Notes payable and current portion of long-term debt $ - $ - Total debt - - Total equity 2,990 3,464 Total capital $ 2,990 $ 3,464 Total debt to total capital - % - %  Working Capital Position  Cash Used In or Provided By Operating Activities During fiscal 2015, the Company used approximately $457,000 of cash for operating activities as compared to using approximately $623,000 for operating activities during the year ended June 30, 2014.  Cash Flows Used In Investing and Financing Activities Cash flows used in investing activities for 2015 were approximately $36,000 related to the purchase of fixed assets for continuing operations.  These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The 2015 consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the realization of the carrying value of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  The Company's continuance as a going concern is dependent on its future profitability and on the on-going support of its shareholders, affiliates and creditors. In order to mitigate the going concern issues, the Company is actively pursuing business partnerships, managing our continuing operations, and seeking to sell certain assets. The Company may not be successful in any of these efforts.  The Company will implement a plan in October 2015 to stem the recurring losses which will include significantly reducing administrative, selling an development activities. If the Company is unable to achieve improvement in the near term, it is not likely that our existing cash and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund activities throughout the next 6 to 12 months without curtailing certain other business activities.  The Company's forecast of the period of time through which its financial resources will be adequate to support its operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors, including the factors discussed in "Risk Factors".If the Company raises funds in the future, the Company may be required to raise those funds through public or private financings, strategic relationships or other arrangements at prices and other  terms that my not be as favorable as they would without such qualification. The sale of additional equity and debt securities may result in additional dilution to the Company's shareholders. Additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company or at all.  Common Stock   Shareholders' equity of $2,500,000 or market value of listed securities of $35,000,000 or net income from continuing operations (in the latest fiscal year or two of the last three fiscal years) of $500,000;   500,000 publicly held shares;   $1,000,000 market value of publicly held shares;   A minimum bid price of $1;   300 round lot shareholders;   Two market makers; and   Compliance with corporate governance standards.  As of September 24, 2015 the Company is compliant with each of these requirements.  inventory, sales returns and rebates warranty liabilities and purchased intangible assets. Actual results achieved in the future could differ from current estimates. The Company used what it believes are reasonable assumptions and, where applicable, established valuation techniques in making its estimates. Revenue Recognition   Persuasive evidence that an arrangement (purchase order and sales invoice) exists between a willing buyer (distributor) and the Company that outlines the terms of the sale (company information, quantity of goods, purchase price and payment terms). The buyer (distributor) does not have a right of return.   Shipping terms are ex-factory shipping point. At this point the buyer (distributor) takes title to the goods and is responsible for all risks and rewards of ownership, including insuring the goods as necessary.   The Company's price to the buyer (distributor) is fixed and determinable as specifically outlined on the sales invoice. The sales arrangement does not have customer cancellation or termination clauses.   The buyer (distributor) places a purchase order with the Company; the terms of the sale are cash, COD or credit. Customer credit is determined based on the Company's policies and procedures related to the buyer's (distributor's) creditworthiness. Based on this determination, the Company believes that collectability is reasonably assured.  The Company assesses collectability based on creditworthiness of the customer and past transaction history. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and does not require collateral from its customers. For many of the Company's international customers, the Company requires an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before the purchase order is accepted.  In determining income/(loss) for financial statement purposes, management must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. FASB issued authoritative guidance concerning accounting for income taxes also requires that the deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance, if based on the available evidence, it is more likely that not that all or some portion of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods.  reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements.  Sep 28, 2015  (c) 1995-2015 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.
