The selling security holders will receive all proceeds from the sale of the
shares of our common stock in this offering. We will not receive any proceeds
from the sale of the shares of our common stock offered pursuant to this
Prospectus by the selling security holders. We will bear all expenses other than
transfer taxes of registration incurred in connection with this offering, but
all commissions, selling and other expenses incurred by the selling security
holders to underwriters, agents, brokers and dealers will be borne by them.


The fitness and yoga industry is highly competitive in general. Although our
targeted marketplace is the Northeast region where we compete primarily with
“mom and pop” exercise and fitness facilities, which are typically comprised of
smaller family or individually owned and operated centers, we may have to
compete in the future against larger competitors that have greater financial
resources and name recognition than we have. We anticipate facing a high level
of competition when opening new facilities for customers, securing prime
leasehold locations where we wish to open our fitness and yoga centers, and
attracting and retaining qualified employees. Many aspects of our business model
are not proprietary and, if they prove successful, may be replicated by others.
We cannot prevent such competitors from entering the markets in which we seek to
open new centers. In addition, we face competition for our on-site yoga sessions
and classes from retail consumer outlet products such as streaming services
through the internet, yoga video DVD’s and television channel programs.
Consumers can purchase yoga instructional videos and audio products online from
national retailers such as amazon.com, yoga.org, and yogaoutlet.com, as well as
through the websites of nationally known yoga instructors such as Bryan Kest,
Shiva Rea, Baron Baptiste and Rodney Yee. In fact, we offer for sale yoga audio
products via download through our website, www.buddimatyoga.com, which sales are
diminimus and represent a non-material portion of our sales revenue. Moreover,
we believe that these retail yoga outlet products attract a different and more
cost-conscious consumer than those who attend live, instructor-led on-site
classes and sessions such as offered at our Ridgefield, Connecticut facility.
Accordingly, we do not anticipate that these retail consumer outlet products
will represent any material competition or risk to our classroom oriented yoga
business.
---

Our primary competition is other yoga and fitness studios within the fitness and
wellness industry. There is competition for these services in the geographic
area in which we hope to expand. We have not undertaken an in-depth evaluation
of the Company’s competition.


Company Description
BMP Holdings Inc., through its subsidiary Buddhi Mat LLC (“BM LLC”), provides
yoga classes, private instruction, specialty workshops, clinics and yoga teacher
training to the general public at its facility in Ridgefield, Connecticut (our
“Ridgefield Center”). BM LLC’s website is


 www.buddhimatyoga.com. BM LLC has
applied for and expects to be granted trade name and trademark protection from
the US patent office. We intend to expand our business operations in the
tri-state area by identifying a suitable location to open our second yoga and
fitness center. However, currently the Company has not formulated a specific
plan or identified a suitable location to open an additional facility.

Classes:

The Company, through its subsidiary BM LLC, offers its signature power yoga
class, which is a challenging and dynamic style of yoga designed to promote
strength, flexibility, stamina and focus. The pose sequencing is specifically
designed to help promote a balanced body and presence of mind. The class is 
designed for all levels and accessible to beginners. Students are encouraged to
work at their own personal level. Beginners are given modifications, while more
seasoned students will be guided on how to further challenge themselves. The 
Company also offers a basics class, which follows the same format as the power 
class, but at a slower pace. This allows for more focus on basic alignment and 
techniques that help build a solid foundation for the physical practice and a 
greater understanding of the process.

Specialty Classes:

Restorative Class — Restorative yoga is a practice of passive poses where the
body is fully supported and held by props such as bolsters, blankets and blocks.
It helps restore and renew the body and mind on every level. It is a deeply
healing practice that helps release and reduce stress and can be beneficial for
those who experience chronic pain or illness. Restorative yoga is designed for
all levels.

Meditation Class — meditation class explores the method of meditation for use as
a gateway to understanding oneself and the surrounding world. The class
emphasizes the benefits of an hour of stillness and reflection. There are
limited moving poses, as sedentary postures are explored in meditation.

Private Instruction:

One-on-one training with an experienced yoga teacher that offers individualized
attention to fit the needs of the individual student, to learn the basics as a
beginner, and in particular to learn modifications appropriate for a specific
physical injury.

Teacher Training Courses:

Yoga Alliance Registered 200 Hour Certification Program that prepares teacher
trainees to lead an all-level power yoga class. The course provides trainees
with hours of actual practice teaching time. The training group size is kept
small. Trainees learn to blend technical knowledge with philosophy to allow the
trainee to take control and command of a class as develop as an instructor.
Program requirements include ten (10) training weekends, class observation and
assisting, written assignments and online education seminars, as well as a
practical final of instructing a 90 minute community class.

Multimedia educational and promotional tools

The Company, through its subsidiary, intends to create and distribute audio and
video presentations for view on various social media websites including YouTube
and Instagram, among others. Such presentations would be distributed for
educational and promotional purposes. Such presentation will be made available
for sale through the Company’s website. Our audio products are recordings of
actual classes conducted by our staff by wearing a microphone attached to a
small recording device, such as a smartphone, and are offered on our website for
download. Our video products initially would be produced by our staff using low
cost digital camera equipment. Should we hire a third party video production
company to produce our video products, we expect that the production cost would
be between $1,500 to $3,000 per video. Sources of funds for such production
expense would come from working capital. Apart from our website, distribution of
our audio and video products would be made through social media, such as YouTube
and Instagram, at low cost. We expect that our video products and additional
audio products will be avail for distribution in the Fall of 2015.

Yoga Workshops and Conferences. The Company may sponsor, and its staff may
attend and/or present (instruct), at yoga workshops and conferences in various
venues throughout Connecticut and the Northeast. These activities are intended
to market the Company’s services, promote brand awareness and attract new
customers for the Company.

We were incorporated on August 4, 2014, under the laws of the State of Delaware.
Our principal executive office is located at 381 W. Mountain Rd., Ridgefield,
Connecticut 06877; our telephone number is (203) 403-2399. Our website is

NEW YORK, January 25, 2017 – Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey on behalf of all persons or entities who acquired PixarBio Corporation f/k/a BMP Holdings, Inc. (OTC BB: PXRB) securities between August 2, 2016 and November 16, 2016 (the “Class Period”).
The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the market for PixarBio’s securities exhibited manipulative or deceptive activities; (2) PixarBio’s assertions in press releases, third-party promotional materials, and PixarBio’s Form S-1 concerning, among other things, PixarBio’s business combinations and current shareholders, the identity and qualifications of key shareholders and employees, and PixarBio’s current and prospective development efforts lacked veracity. As of the foregoing, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading throughout the Class Period.
On October 30, 2016, PixarBio completed its merger transaction with BMP Holdings, a division of the Company, and executed a 10:1 stock split effective October 31, 2016.
On January 23, 2017, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) halted trading in the securities of PixarBio, citing concerns about possible “manipulative or deceptive activities” in the market for the Company’s stock.
If you purchased or otherwise acquired PixarBio common stock during the Class Period and suffered a loss or continue to hold shares purchased prior to the Class Period, have information or would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact J. Brandon Walker, Esq. by email at investigations@bespc.com, or telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out the contact form below. There is no cost or obligation to you.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
