Donald has been piping for dancing for nearly 35 years. Taught piping by his father Alexander "Sandy" MacPhee, Donald's dad encouraged Donald to pipe for his sister's dancers from a very early age ( Diane MacPhee Krugh and Donna Cusack) in their dance classes. Before long Donald was piping all over the world at dancing competitions and championships. In 1995 Donald brought out his first piping for dancing CD called - "The Competitive Highland Dancer's Champion's Choice" a favourite of many dancers and teachers the world over. It was in this idiom where he met and married Miss Christine Lacey a former 6 time World Champion. In 2007 Donald and Christine came out with a piping for dancing CD called " The Complete Collection", a double CD consisting of 60 tracks with over 2 hours of Scottish highland dance music for the dancer , the dance class,  the dance competitor and examiner. All competitive dances with different steps and tempos for each level of dancer.  For example on the Complete Collection for The Highland Fling - there is a track for a 3 step , 2 four step selections (each a different tempo), 4 different six step selections, and a Strathspey Work track of 15 continuous different strathspeys culminating in an 8:50 selection for classwork and barwork; thought such a this has gone into each selection for the music produced on the Complete Collection.

UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND  
   EXCHANGE COMMISSION   
450 Fifth Street, N.W.       
Washington, D.C.  20549,    
            Plaintiff,  
    v. 
DONALD J. MACPHEE,    
            Defendant.  

:::::::
 Civil Action No.
COMPLAINT
Plaintiff, United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission"), for its Complaint alleges as follows:

SUMMARY
1. This action concerns the activities of the defendant, Donald J. MacPhee ("MacPhee"), the former Chief Financial Officer of IGI, Inc. ("IGI").  IGI is a diversified company located in Buena, New Jersey, that produces and markets animal health and consumer products, including Mareks, a poultry vaccine that is used to inoculate chickens against cancer.  At various times between 1995 and June 1997, MacPhee, at the direction of IGI's former President, engaged in improper accounting practices related to revenue recognition, the recording of sales credits, and IGI's inventory.  As a result of his misconduct, MacPhee knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that he caused IGI to materially overstate its assets, revenues, and net income and caused IGI to file materially false and misleading reports and financial statements with the Commission for IGI's fiscal years ended December 31, 1995 and December 31, 1996, and for the quarters ended March 31, and June 30, 1997.  

    2. By engaging in such conduct, MacPhee violated Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") [15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) and 78m(b)(5)] and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 [17 C.F.R. §§ 240.10b-5 and 240.13b2-1], and was a cause of IGI's violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78m(a) and 78m(b)(2)(A) and (B)] and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 [17 C.F.R. §§ 240.12b-20, 240.13a-1, and 240.13a-13].

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
3. The Commission brings this action pursuant to the authority conferred upon it by Section 21(d) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)] to obtain a civil money penalty from defendant MacPhee.  

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21 and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u and 78aa].  Venue lies in this Court pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa].  

5. The defendant, directly and indirectly, has made use of the mails or the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce in connection with the acts, practices and transactions alleged herein, certain of which occurred within the District of New Jersey.  

THE DEFENDANT
6. Donald J. MacPhee, age 50, resides in Holland, Pennsylvania.  From 1988 through June 1997, MacPhee was the Chief Financial Officer of IGI.  In late June 1997, MacPhee alerted IGI's outside counsel about financial irregularities at IGI and in July 1997, he departed IGI for health reasons.  MacPhee is not now, and was not at the time of his misconduct, a certified public accountant.

FIRST CLAIM
 MacPhee Violated Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the 
Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 
7. Paragraphs 1 through 6 above are re-alleged and incorporated herein by reference.

A. Overstatement of Inventory and Understatement of Related Expenses
8. From 1995 through the second quarter of 1997, IGI, while MacPhee was Chief Financial Officer, overstated its assets and net income by not recording properly the costs associated with reductions in its inventory for large quantities of Mareks that were either destroyed or defective and could not be sold. 

9. In connection with this practice, MacPhee, at the direction of the former President of IGI, did not record the costs of large quantities of Mareks inventory that were either destroyed or were defective.  Instead, MacPhee, upon instruction from the former President, established inventory reserves.  The former President decided when and how much Mareks would be destroyed and directed MacPhee, who complied with the directive, to reduce or increase the inventory reserve balances to achieve the former President's desired financial results.  MacPhee knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the reserves did not properly reflect the costs of destroyed or defective inventory.

    10. As a result of MacPhee's misconduct, and that of others, involving IGI's inventory, IGI, while MacPhee was the company's Chief Financial Officer, overstated its assets and net income for fiscal years 1995 and 1996, and for the first two quarters of fiscal year 1997.

B. Improper Recognition of Revenue - Sales Cut-Off
11. IGI's revenue recognition policy required that sales revenue be recognized when products were shipped.  Contrary to this policy, during fiscal years 1995 and 1996, and the first three quarters of fiscal year 1997, IGI routinely recorded sales of its products prior to shipment in order to fraudulently increase its quarterly and annual revenues and to manipulate its earnings.

12. At or around the end of each quarter during the period from 1995 through the second quarter of 1997, the former President instructed MacPhee, among others, to hold IGI's books open and to record out-of-period sales.  MacPhee knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that as part of this practice, employees backdated sales invoices.  IGI's accounting department, which MacPhee supervised, routinely informed the sales staff when the "extended quarter" had ended and when out-of-period sales should no longer be entered into IGI's computerized accounting system.

    13. As a result of MacPhee's misconduct, and that of others, involving IGI's sales cut-off practices, IGI, while MacPhee was the company's Chief Financial Officer, misstated its assets, revenue, and net income for fiscal years 1995 and 1996, during each interim quarter thereof, and for the first two quarters of fiscal year 1997.

C. Failure to Process and Record Sales Credits on a Timely Basis
14. IGI, while MacPhee was Chief Financial Officer, failed to process and record sales credits on a timely basis in fiscal years 1995 and 1996, and during the first two quarters of fiscal year 1997.  By delaying the processing and recording of such credits, IGI misstated accounts receivable, sales, and net income from 1995 through 1996, and during the first two quarters of fiscal year 1997. 
15. IGI issued sales credits to its customers for returned products, for the return of liquid nitrogen containers used to ship Mareks, and for promotional allowances.  Customers generally sent requests for such credits to the sales clerks who prepared credit memoranda.  Before entering the credits into IGI's accounting system, the sales clerks sent the credit memoranda to their managers for approval.

  16. In fiscal year 1995, the former President routinely instructed two former managers to delay approval of large sales credits until the revenue levels were high enough to allow write-offs of the credits without affecting expected or targeted earnings.  MacPhee knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the approval of large sales credits was being delayed in fiscal year 1995.

17. During 1996, the former President instructed MacPhee not to record valid sales credits.  MacPhee's knowing or reckless failure to record sales credits caused IGI to overstate materially its assets, revenues, and net income in fiscal year 1996.

    18. As a result of MacPhee's misconduct, and that of others, involving sales credits, IGI, while MacPhee was the company's Chief Financial Officer, misstated its assets, revenues, and net income for fiscal years 1995 and 1996, during each interim quarter thereof, and for the first two quarters of fiscal year 1997.  

 19. Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, prohibit, inter alia, any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, or the making of any untrue statement of a material fact or omitting to state a material fact, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.  Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(5)], and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 [17 C.F.R. §§ 240.13b2-1], prohibit, inter alia, circumvention of internal accounting controls and falsification of corporate books and records.

    20. By virtue of the conduct described in paragraphs 7 through 19 above, MacPhee violated Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) and 78m(b)(5)] and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 [17 C.F.R. §§ 240.10b-5 and 240.13b2-1].

SECOND CLAIM
MacPhee Was a Cause of IGI's 
Violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the 
Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 
21. Paragraphs 1 through 20 above are re-alleged and incorporated herein by reference.  

22. IGI, while MacPhee was IGI's Chief Financial Officer, filed with the Commission annual reports on Form 10-K for its fiscal years ended December 31, 1995 and 1996, and quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, and June 30, 1997.  The financial statements in all the aforementioned filings were materially false and misleading by virtue of IGI's fraudulently inflated assets, revenue, and net income.  MacPhee signed IGI's Forms 10-K for fiscal year 1995 and 1996, the interim Forms 10-Q for those years, and the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 30, 1997.  MacPhee left IGI in late June 1997 and did not prepare or sign IGI's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 1997.

23. During 1995 through 1997, IGI had securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78l(g)].  As a result, IGI was required to file quarterly, annual, and other reports and statements with the Commission which did not contain untrue statements of material facts or omissions of material facts, and was required to make and keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflected the transactions and dispositions of its assets.  IGI also was required to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions were recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP or any other criteria applicable to such statements. 

24. As a result of MacPhee's misconduct, IGI maintained with respect to fiscal years 1995 and 1996, and for the first two quarters of fiscal year 1997, false and misleading books and records which, among other things, materially overstated its assets, revenues, and net income during those financial reporting periods.  

25. By reason of the foregoing, IGI violated Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78m(a) and 78m(b)(2)(A) and (B)] and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 [17 C.F.R. §§ 240.12b-20, 240.13a-1, and 240.13a-13].

26. By reason of the foregoing, MacPhee was a cause of IGI's violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, the Commission respectfully requests that this Court:

I.
 Enter an Order requiring defendant MacPhee to pay a civil money penalty pursuant to the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990, Section 21(d)(3) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)(3)]; 

II.
Retain jurisdiction of this action in accordance with the principles of equity and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in order to implement and carry out the terms of all orders and decrees that may be entered, or to entertain any suitable application or motion for additional relief; and

III.
Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and appropriate.

                    Respectfully submitted,

Research Interests
Cement Chemistry
Portland cement has many uses but it is best known as the binding constituent of concrete, the most extensively used man-made construction material in the modern world. Although considered largely an engineering material, its setting and subsequent durability properties are controlled by chemistry. Consequently, cement chemistry research, over many years, has lead to a range of technologically significant products and processes.
Cement formulations appropriate for extreme environmental conditions are used routinely in mine stabilisation, oil well cementing, underwater construction, cold weather climates, etc. · Durable concretes can be designed to limit degradation that previously would have arisen due to reinforcement corrosion, alkali aggregate reaction and sulphate attack. Of significance today is the environmental impact of Portland cement manufacture and focus is directed towards reducing the resulting CO2 emissions. More efficient use of Portland cement through the use of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) and the development of alternative cements are amongst the key research strategies adopted by industry and academia in addressing this.
Current Research
The Cements Research Group within the Department of Chemistry at the University of Aberdeen have research activity over a broad range of areas. Professor Macphee is currently involved in several areas:
Reactivity of glassy aluminosilicates
Glass reactivity is of interest across a range of technological themes. In geology, the weathering of igneous and metamorphic rock types is through glass reaction with its exposure environment. In waste management, glasses are used as primary matrices for the immobilisation of high level nuclear waste and as reactive constituents in cementitious matrices for low and intermediate level nuclear wastes. In construction, as with cementitious waste forms, Portland cements are commonly extended with glassy aluminosilicates, such as coal combustion fly ash or blastfurnace slags. Understanding the reactivity of these materials therefore has technological importance. Our focus is on the use of aluminosilicate glasses as supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) and funding from the European industry-academic network, Nanocem, has enabled detailed dissolution rate studies including time resolved solution analysis (MIP-OES) and high resolution surface characterisation (ToF-SIMS and XPS) of model glasses. 


“The early stage dissolution characteristics of aluminosilicate glasses and their implications for SCM reactivity in cement systems”, Newlands, K.C. and Macphee, D.E., Proc. 19 Int. Baustofftagung, (Weimar, 2015), I 77-90.


“Early Stages of Aluminosilicate Glass Dissolution”, Newlands, K.C. and Macphee, D.E., Oral presentation, Goldschmidt 2014, (Sacramento, CA, 2014).


Photocatalysis and photocatalytic cements
The use of photocatalysts in construction is one of the most sustainable technologies for atmospheric depollution. Globally, concrete structures are ubiquitous in the built environment. Their surfaces are exposed to solar radiation at varying intensities, dependent on latitude, season, time of day, angle of exposure and local weather conditions and they represent significant surface areas which, particularly in urban settings, are typically exposed to the highest levels of air pollution. Our interests range from the fundamental processes activated in an illuminated semiconductor photocatalyst, through the role of the photocatalyst surface on performance, to the influence of cement chemistry on these processes. We have recently completed a European project (Light2CaT) under the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7), which led to the development of a visible light TiO2-based photocatalyst with a high degree of selectivity for nitrate during the photocatalytic oxidation of atmospheric NOx gases, and we are currently partners in an EPSRC-NSFC joint programme with researchers at Wuhan University of Technology and Chongqing University aimed at optimising catalyst supports for construction applications.

He is also involved in research outside of the cement chemistry theme:
Photo-responsive materials for fuel cell and related applications
The commercial uptake of low temperature fuel cells has been limited by the durability of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA). Amongst the most common of the MEA failure modes is the poisoning of the platinum anode electrocatalyst by adsorbed carbon monoxide (CO), entering the fuel cell in the fuel (where hydrogen is derived from the reformation of hydrocarbons, or if in a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC), from fuel oxidation).  CO adsorption can rapidly degrade anode performance at concentrations of only a few parts per million in the fuel. Fuel purity therefore adds cost to the fuel cells cost of ownership, through fuel and component replacement costs as well as in the fuel cell down time. Our research in this field grew from our studies on tungsten oxide photocatalysis for water purification and a recognition that the expected drop in a DMFC test cell electrode performance was significantly limited under illumination. Development of this theme has led to several patents and the formation of Enocell Ltd, a university spin out company formed in 2011.

 THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT
 OF 1934, MAKING FINDINGS,
 AND IMPOSING A CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDER
I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") deems it appropriate to institute public administrative proceedings against Donald J. MacPhee ("MacPhee" or "Respondent"), pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act").

II.
In anticipation of the institution of these public administrative proceedings, MacPhee has submitted an Offer of Settlement ("Offer"), which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission or in which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings contained herein, except as to the Commission's jurisdiction over him and over the subject matter of these proceedings, which are admitted, MacPhee consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Public Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order ("Order").

III.
On the basis of this Order and the Respondent's Offer, the Commission makes the following findings:1
A. RESPONDENT
Donald J. MacPhee, age 50, from 1988 through June 1997, was the Chief Financial Officer of IGI, Inc. ("IGI"), a diversified company engaged in producing and marketing animal health products such as poultry vaccines, veterinary pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and skin care products.  At the direction of the former President of IGI, MacPhee engaged in improper sales cut-off practices, failed to adequately record sales credits in a timely manner and engaged in improper accounting practices regarding IGI's inventory.  In late June 1997, MacPhee alerted IGI's outside counsel about financial irregularities at IGI and in July 1997, he departed IGI for health reasons.  MacPhee is not now, and was not at the time of his misconduct, a certified public accountant.

B. OTHER RELEVANT PERSONS AND ENTITIES
 IGI, Inc. is located in Buena, New Jersey.  IGI's common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, and is listed for trading on the American Stock Exchange.

    The President, who was also IGI's Chief Operating Officer, directed MacPhee and other former IGI officers and employees to engage in fraudulent accounting practices from 1995 through 1997, that caused IGI to overstate its assets, revenues, and net income.  IGI terminated the President in November 1997.  

C. SUMMARY
This matter involves fraudulent accounting practices and reporting, internal controls, and books and records violations at IGI.  Throughout 1995, 1996, and during the first two quarters of 1997, IGI's former President manipulated the company's annual and quarterly earnings by directing MacPhee, among others, to engage in improper accounting practices that caused IGI to overstate its assets, revenues, and net income.  Former senior management manipulated IGI's earnings by failing to: (1) write off inventory that was defective or that had been destroyed; (2) record sales revenue in the proper accounting periods; and (3) process and record sales credits in a timely manner.  These accounting improprieties primarily concerned IGI's production and storage of mareks, a poultry vaccine that is used to inoculate chickens against cancer.  

During the relevant time period, IGI derived most of its revenues from the sale of poultry vaccines, of which mareks was the most important, and other animal health products.  Rather than writing off the cost of large quantities of destroyed or defective vaccines, the former President directed MacPhee to establish reserves, which the former President then used to achieve his desired financial results.  The former President also directed MacPhee, among others, to hold open IGI's books at the end of the quarters so he could inflate IGI's quarterly revenues. At the direction of the President, MacPhee also did not record sales credits in the appropriate time periods.  MacPhee's actions, in part, caused IGI to overstate its assets, revenues, and net income.2
 
D. FACTS
1. Overstatement of Inventory and Understatement of
	 Related expenses_______________________
From 1995 through the second quarter of 1997, IGI, while MacPhee was Chief Financial Officer, overstated its assets and net income by not recording properly the costs associated with reductions in its inventory for large quantities of mareks that were either destroyed or were defective and could not be sold.  In connection with this practice, the former President instructed MacPhee not to write off the cost of large quantities of mareks inventory that either was destroyed or that was defective.  Instead, the former President instructed MacPhee to establish inventory reserves.  The former President decided when and how much mareks would be destroyed and directed MacPhee, who complied with the directive, to reduce or increase the inventory reserve balances to achieve the former President's desired financial results.  MacPhee knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the reserves did not properly reflect the costs of destroyed or defective inventory.   

  As a result of MacPhee's misconduct, and that of others, involving IGI's inventory, IGI, while MacPhee was the company's Chief Financial Officer, overstated its assets and net income for fiscal years 1995 and 1996, and for the first two quarters of fiscal year 1997. 

    2. Improper Recognition of Revenue - Sales Cut-off
IGI's revenue recognition policy required that sales revenue be recognized when products were shipped.  Contrary to this policy, during fiscal years 1995 and 1996, and the first two quarters of fiscal year 1997, IGI routinely recorded sales of its products prior to shipment in order to increase improperly its quarterly and annual revenues and to manipulate its earnings. 

At or around the end of each quarter, the former President instructed MacPhee, among others, to hold IGI's books open and to record out-of-period sales.  MacPhee knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that as part of this practice, employees backdated invoices. The accounting department, which MacPhee supervised, routinely informed the sales staff when the "extended quarter" had ended and when out-of-period sales should no longer be entered into IGI's computerized accounting system.  



As a result of MacPhee's misconduct, and that of others, involving IGI's sales cut-off practices, IGI, while MacPhee was the company's Chief Financial Officer, misstated its assets, revenue, and net income for fiscal years 1995 and 1996, during each interim quarter thereof,3 and for the first two quarters of fiscal year 1997.

    3. Failure to Process and Record Sales Credits on a 
 Timely Basis_________________________________ 
IGI, while MacPhee was Chief Financial Officer, failed to process and record sales credits on a timely basis in fiscal years 1995 and 1996, and for the first two quarters of fiscal year 1997.  By delaying the processing and recording of such credits, IGI misstated its accounts receivable, sales, and net income from 1995 through 1996, and during the first two quarters of fiscal year 1997.

IGI typically issued sales credits to its customers for returned products, for the return of liquid nitrogen containers used to ship mareks, and for promotional allowances.  Customers generally sent requests for credits to the sales clerks who prepared credit memoranda.  Before entering the credits into IGI's accounting system, the sales clerks sent the credit memoranda to their managers for approval.  The former President routinely instructed a former officer and a former manager to delay approval of large sales credits until revenue levels were high enough to allow write-offs of the credits without affecting expected or targeted earnings.  The former officer and manager followed the former President's instructions and delayed approval of large sales credits.  MacPhee knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the approval of large sales credits was being delayed in fiscal year 1995.  

During 1996, the former President also instructed MacPhee not to record valid sales credits.  MacPhee's knowing or reckless failure to record sales credits caused IGI to overstate materially its assets, revenues, and net income in fiscal year 1996.

As a result of MacPhee's misconduct, and that of others, involving sales credits, IGI, while MacPhee was the company's Chief Financial Officer, misstated its assets, revenues, and net income for fiscal years 1995 and 1996, during each interim quarter thereof,4 and for the first two quarters of fiscal year 1997.  



E. LEGAL DISCUSSION
Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, prohibit material misstatements or omissions, made with scienter, in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.  SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., 401 F.2d 833, 860-62 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 976 (1969).  Scienter is the "mental state embracing the intent to deceive, manipulate or defraud."  Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 193 n.12 (1976).  A fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider the information to be important.  Basic, Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 231-32 (1988). Misrepresentation of a company's earnings, SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., 401 F.2d 833, 849 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 976 (1969), and the improper recognition of revenue in departure from GAAP, see Fin v. American Solar King Corp., 919 F.2d 290, 297, 300-01 (5th Cir. 1990), may be material.

Issuers must file accurate annual and quarterly reports with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.  See SEC v. Savoy Industries Inc., 587 F.2d 1149, 1165 (D.C. Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 913 (1979).  Exchange Act Rule 12b-20 requires that statements and reports contain all information necessary to ensure that statements made in them are not materially misleading.  

Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to make and keep books, records, and accounts that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of their assets. Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to devise and maintain a system of internal controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that, among other things, transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain the accountability of assets. Section 13(b)(5) provides that no person shall knowingly falsify any such book, record, or account or circumvent an issuer's system of internal accounting controls. Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 also prohibits, directly or indirectly, the falsification of any book, record, or account subject to Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act.  

F. VIOLATIONS BY MACPHEE
As a consequence of the fraudulent practices described above, while MacPhee was IGI's Chief Financial Officer, IGI's Forms 10-K for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1995 and 1996, and its Forms 10-Q for the periods ended March 31 and June 30, 1997, contained materially false and misleading financial statements that were not prepared in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP").  IGI also maintained, with respect to fiscal years 1995 and 1996, and for the first two quarters of fiscal year 1997, false and misleading books and records which, among other things, materially overstated its assets, revenues, and net income during those financial reporting periods.  Accordingly, IGI violated Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.

  MacPhee signed IGI's Forms 10-K for fiscal year 1995 and 1996, the interim Forms 10-Q for those years, and the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 30, 1997.5  MacPhee, at the direction of the former President, failed to write off the cost of large quantities of destroyed or defective inventory. Instead, MacPhee, at the President's direction, established inventory reserves, which MacPhee then used, at the President's direction, to systematically reduce the inventory.  Also, MacPhee, at the former President's direction, held open IGI's books at the end of the quarters to recognize out-of-period sales which caused IGI to inflate its quarterly revenues.  At the direction of the former President, MacPhee also did not record sales credits in the appropriate time periods.  

  MacPhee knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that by engaging in the foregoing practices, he caused IGI to materially overstate its assets, revenues, and net income and caused IGI to file materially false and misleading reports and financial statements with the Commission for IGI's fiscal years ended December 31, 1995 and December 31, 1996, and for the quarters ended March 31, and June 30, 1997.  

  Accordingly, the Commission finds that MacPhee violated Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and that he was a cause of IGI's violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.

IV.
MacPhee has submitted an Offer in which, without admitting or denying the findings herein, he consents to the Commission's entry of this Order, which: (1) makes findings as set forth above; and (2) orders MacPhee to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation, or any future violation, of certain provisions of the federal securities laws.  As set forth in his Offer, MacPhee undertakes to cooperate with the Commission staff in connection with this action and any related judicial or administrative proceeding or investigation commenced by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party.   

V.
Based on the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to accept the Offer submitted by MacPhee and imposes the relief specified herein.  

  Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, that MacPhee cease and desist from committing or causing any violation, and any future violation, of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder, and that he cease and desist from causing any violation, and any future violation, of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.

  IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that MacPhee shall comply with his undertaking described in Section IV. above. 

  By the Commission.

Jonathan G. Katz
Secretary

Footnotes

1  The findings herein are made pursuant to the Respondent's Offer and are not binding on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

2  On August 24, 1998, IGI, in its 1997 Form 10-K, restated its financial results for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1995 and 1996, and for the first three quarters of fiscal year 1997. IGI also restated its net income in its Forms 10-Q for the first three quarters of fiscal year 1997.  

3   Although IGI, based upon the results of the forensic audit, restated only its annual operating results for fiscal years 1995 and 1996, these improper sales cut-off practices resulted in out-of-period sales being recorded in all of the quarters during fiscal years 1995 and 1996. 

4   Although IGI, based upon the results of the forensic audit, restated only its annual operating results for fiscal years 1995 and 1996, the practice of not recording sales credits on a timely basis occurred in all of the quarters during fiscal years 1995 and 1996. 

5 MacPhee left IGI in late June 1997 and did not prepare or sign IGI's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 1997.
