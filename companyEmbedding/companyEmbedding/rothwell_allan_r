Rothwell Retiring from Eastman as Executive Vice President



Published on 2006-02-13. Author :
SpecialChem













KINGSPORT, Tenn. -- Eastman Chemical Company (NYSE:EMN)
announced the retirement of Allan R. Rothwell, executive vice president
and president of the company's Voridian Division. Rothwell, 58, will retire
April 1, 2006.
"It has truly been my personal and professional pleasure
to work with Allan for so many years," said J. Brian Ferguson, Eastman
chairman and CEO. "Allan's insightful perspective, judgment and leadership
have been instrumental in Eastman's success over the years. In addition
to his business leadership, he leaves a great legacy to our company through
the invaluable mentoring he has provided to Eastman people. Many of our
employees-including many of our leaders now-have directly benefited
from Allan's unselfish sharing of his wisdom and coaching." 
Rothwell's career with Eastman spans three decades and
includes senior level responsibility for several businesses, corporate
strategy and as chief financial officer. He was instrumental in leading
efforts that resulted in the 2004 announcement of the innovative IntegRex
technology for the company's polymers business. 
Rothwell joined Eastman in 1969 as a chemist and has served
in a variety of leadership positions in the company. He led Eastman's
operations in Asia from 1988 to 1992 and headed up both the company's
industrial intermediates and container plastics businesses in the early
to mid-1990s. After serving as vice president of corporate development
and strategy, Rothwell became senior vice president and chief financial
officer. He was appointed president of Eastman's chemicals business group
in 1999. He was appointed to his current position in 2001.
A native of Fresno, Calif., Rothwell holds a bachelor's
degree in textile chemistry from North Carolina State University. As a
Sloan Fellow, he received a master's degree in management from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in 1993. Ferguson said information regarding the
future management of responsibilities currently held by Rothwell will
be announced prior to his retirement. 
Eastman manufactures and markets chemicals, fibers and
plastics worldwide. It provides key differentiated coatings, adhesives
and specialty plastics products; is the world's largest producer
of PET polymers for packaging; and is a major supplier of cellulose acetate
fibers. Founded in 1920 and headquartered in Kingsport, Tenn., Eastman
is a FORTUNE 500 company with 2005 sales of $7 billion and approximately
12,000 employees.
