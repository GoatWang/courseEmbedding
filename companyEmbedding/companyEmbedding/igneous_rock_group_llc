Q:
Why is it that stars twinkle but planets do not?


A:
Stars twinkle because they are point light sources. Passing through the atmosphere, the small beam of light constantly shifts by bouncing off particles in the air. Planets are closer, so they appear as discs, with the shifting of light from one side cancelling out the other.

Q:
How do the body's systems work together?


A:
The human body is comprised of several different systems that must work together to carry out the various processes necessary for good health. According to the University of Washington, the nervous system controls many of these various systems directly. For example, when the body needs to alter the beating rate of the heart or blood pressure, the brain sends the message to do so via nerve impulses.

Q:

Where can metamorphic rocks be found?



A:
Metamorphic rocks are most often found in mountainous regions though they can be seen wherever there are signs of geological upheaval in an area. This type of rock is formed by the transformation of another rock type, a change that is usually triggered by tremendous heat, pressure or other violent phenomena. The forces that cause metamorphic rocks to form are so great that they change not only the appearance but also the chemical composition of an existing rock.

Q:
What is collection in the water cycle?


A:
Collection refers to the process by which water gathers back into bodies of water such as rivers, lakes and oceans. This begins with precipitation, when water falls from the clouds in the form of rain, snow, sleet or hail. A lot of the time, precipitation falls directly into a body of water, but at other times, it soaks into the ground, where plants, people and animals end up drinking it as ground water. Most of the water will end up leaching back into bodies of water through the soil.

Q:
How do glaciers change the landscape?


A:
Glaciers alter the landscape through erosion of the soil and rocks over which they pass. This erosion process leaves a vertical-walled valley similar to an amphitheater at the glacier's sources, according to Reference.com. As they travel through V-shaped valleys, glaciers transform the valley into a U-shape, grinding away cliffs and the bases of slopes. If the ocean fills these valleys, they become fjords.

They may form at high or low measures depending on the depth, but they all form at high temperatures. Magma eventually cools to from igneous rocks composed of interlocking crystals, the mineral crystals do not usually have any permanent alignment.- Intrusive(Hypabyssal or plutonic) igneous rocks, these have medium crystal sizes if the magma cooled fairly slow at intermediate depths, for example dolerite or coarse crystal sizes if the magma cooled slowly at great depths within the earths crust for example granite. The minerals are hard silicates such as quartz and feldspar and separate mineral crystals can be seen in the rocks- Extrusive(Volcanic) igneous rocks, these have fine crystals size as the magma reached the earths surface and cooled quickly such as basalt or pumice.Crystal Grain Sizes- The easiest way to classify an igneous rock is through its crystal grain size. The grain size can tell us a great deal about the cooling history of the rock and links to its origin. Igneous rocks are divided on the basis of average crystal size, this means ignoring all the very large crystals called phenocrysts. If no crystals can be seen even with a hand lens then the rock has a glassy texture and it cooled too quickly for any crystals to form.- Fine Crystals are less than 1mm so that individual crystals can not be identified by eye.- Medium grained crystals are 1-5mm and can be seen by eye - Coarse gained crystals are greater than 5mm in size and can be seen and identified by eye.Silica %- Chemical analysis gives the overall chemical composition of a rock rather than which mineral are present. The majority of SiO4 in igneous rocks is not present as quartz (SIO2 silica/silicon dioxide), but is contained within other silicates minerals such as olive and feldspar.- Its is easier to link SIO4 percentage to the colour as a short cut for identification. The mafic rocks are rich in dark coloured ferromagnesian minerals such as olivine and augite. Silicic rocks are rich in light coloured minerals such as quartz and feldspar. But colour can be misleading as in rock such as obsidian which is dark coloured however is silicic.Felsic Minerals (Silicic)The felsic minerals are quartz and feldspar which are bother rich in silica.Quartz (Silicic)- Only found in silicic or intermediate rocks - The magma must be over saturated with silica so that there is excess silica after the rock forming minerals have crystallised to form quartz- Vitreous lutre / Glassy- White, grey to transparent - No cleavage - Made entirely of silicaFeldspars(silicic)- Most common rock forming mineral in igneous rocks - Potassium feldspar(orthoclase) is only found in silicic and intermediate rocks so good mineral to use as classification.- Often found as large phenocrysts and groundmass in granite - Pink colour of K feldspar make its easy to identify - Grey or white feldspar is plagioclase - Hand lens: Glassy apprentice and smooth crystals cleavage - Hardness 6 - Cleavage in two directions - VitreousMafic Minerals- These are the minerals that contain both magnesium and iron and are referred to as ferromagnesian. They are dark coloured and silica poor.Biotite and Muscovite Mica (Mafic)- The micas are biotite found in silica to intermediate rocks and muscovite found in silicic rocks only.- Shiny black crystals of biotite can easily be identified through the silvery flakes of muscovite.- Micas can be starched with copper coin and are the only igneous rocks soft enough fro this test.- Hardness 2.5 - Biotite is black - Muscovite is silver - Vitreous Lustre (Glassy)- One perfect cleavage plain that makes flakesHornblende, Augite and Olivine (Mafic)- Hornblende is one of the group of minerals called amphiboles which are particular common in intermediate rocks.- Augite belongs to the pyroxene group of minerals and is one of the main minerals in mafic and ultra mafic rocks.- Olivine is found in some mafic rocks and ultramafic rocks, it will only form when the magma is under saturated in silica.Hornblende (Amphibole)(Mafic)- Hardness 5.5- Black- Two cleavage plains 120 degrees - VitreousAugite (Pyroxene)(Mafic)- Hardness 5.5- Black or dark Green- Two cleavage plains at 90 degrees- VitreousOlivine (Mafic)- Hardness 6.5- Light Green- No Cleavage - Vitreous LustreIgneous Rock Classification TableCrystal Grain SizeCross Section Of Volcanic AreaGlassy TextureIs lava flows in to the sea, calling can be very rapid, in minutes on the outside of the flow whilst the inside could still be molten. This is why some pillow lava show a layered structure with glass on the outside and fine crystals inside. Where cooling is rapid, there may be no time for crystals to form. Obsidian cools in this way, it looks black because light will not pass though it but in a thin section it is a clear glass.PegmatitesA pegmatite is a igneous rock that has exceptionally large crystals. The crystals are normally larger than a few CM and can often be 10s of cm or even meters long. Pegmatites form in the last stages of crystallisation from the water rich residue magma. The pegmatite crystals are usually quartz, k feldspar and muscovite grow in a supersaturated solution. Pegmatite can produce large crystals in a short geological time period.Equigranular-Means that all the crystals are of equal size but may all be fine, medium or coarse. The grain size is relevant to the time spent cooling so the longer cooling time the large the crystal. Fine grained crystals will have been formed rapidly at the surface are extruded. -Medium grained crystal formed by slow cooling below the surface at hypabyssal which is sallow depths in the crust no more than 10km.Coarse grained crystal will have been formed very slowly at deep depths below the surface know as plutonic.-However an intrusion that cooled 2km below the surface will have medium grained crystals but will also have fine grained crystals at the edge were the chilled margin cooled quickly.- A lava flow that cooled at the surface will have fine grained crystals but if it is very thick then the middle of the flow may have medium grained crystals.Vesicular- Vesicular textures are where gas bubbles are trapped in the lava as it cools rapidly, leaving holes where the gas was. - The holes are called vesicles are usually oval in shape and are also elongated parallel in the direction of flow. - The gas rises so most vesicles are found at the top of a lava flow or sometimes at the edge of an intrusion. Is commonly found in basalt and pumice.Amygdaloidal- The amygdaloidal texture is formed when the holes are later infilled by minerals deposited by the ground water. Is porous which allows water to flow through it. - The ground water contains calcium carbonate so calcite will be precipitated in the holes. This can happen over millions of years after the minerals was formed is mainly either calcite or quartz however others may also be found. Each infilled hole is called an amygdale.- Both are around 10mm however can be larger.Flow BandingFlow banding occurs where layers of dark(mafic biotite) and light (silicic quartz )minerals form due to the separation of minerals within in silicic lava flows. They will be aligned parallel to the flow direction, though they may often be contorted(twisted out of normal shape)because the lava flow was vicious so flowed slowly, often found in Rhyolite.Porphyritic Textures- A porphyritic texture forms when there is two stages of cooling to a rocks formation resulting in two different crystal sizes. - The large crystals are called phenocrysts and form first by cooling slowly. They are surrounded by a finer groundmass which cooled quickly. The texture can be found in any igneous rock but is most common in porphyritic basalt and porphyritic granite even though they cooled at different depths. - In porphyritic basalt the phenocrysts often plagioclase feldspar start to form slowly in the magma chamber below the volcano, when the eruption occurs magma and plagioclase crystals are erupted to the surface where rapid cooling occurs and forms the fine grained crystals of the ground mass. - The phenocrysts in a porphyritic granite, often potassium feldspar start to form at very slowly at great depths perhaps 30 km. The magma and feldspar crystals move up within the crusts to form a batholith. The rest of the magma then cools very slowly to form the coarse grained crystals of the groundmass.PoikiliticTexture which has small randomly orientated crystals which are enclosed by larger crystals.Granite- >66% silica - Silicic - Light Colour - Major intrusion plutonic - Coarse Grained > 5MM- Main Minerals Quartz, K feldspar, and biotite and plagioclase feldspar (NA)Granodiorite- >66% silica to 52-66%- Intermediate boundary - Major intrusion Plutonic - Coarse Grained >5MM- Light colour - Main Minerals K feldspar, Plagioclase Feldspar, Biotite and HornblendeRhyolite- >66% silica - Silicic - Flow banding found - Volcanic Extrusive - Fine grained <1mm- Light in colour - Main Minerals Quartz, K feldspar, and biotite and plagioclase feldspar (NA)Pumice- >66% silica - Silicic - Volcanic Extrusive - Fine grained <1mm- Light in colour - Main Minerals Quartz, K feldspar, and biotite and plagioclase feldspar (NA)Obsidian- >66% silica - Silicic - Volcanic Extrusive - Glassy- Light in colour - Main Minerals Quartz, K feldspar, and biotite and plagioclase feldspar (NA)Diorite- 52-66% silica - Intermediate - Major Intrusion Plutonic - Coarse grained >5mm - Light in colour - Main Minerals are potassium feldspar, plagioclase feldspar, biotite and hornblende.Andesite- 52-66% silica - Intermediate - Volcanic Extrusive- Fine Grained <1mm- Light in colour - Main Minerals are potassium feldspar, plagioclase feldspar, biotite and hornblende.Gabbro- 45-52% silica - Mafic - Major Intrusion Plutonic - Coarse grained >5mm - Darker in colour - Main Minerals are Plagioclase Feldspar (Ca), Augite and olivineDolerite- 45-52% silica - Mafic - Minor intrusion hypabyssal - Medium Grained 1-5mm - Darker in colour - Main Minerals are Plagioclase Feldspar (Ca), Augite and olivineBasalt- 45-52% silica - Mafic - Volcanic Extrusive- Fine Grained <1mm - Darker in colour - Main Minerals are Plagioclase Feldspar (Ca), Augite and olivinePeridotite- <45% silica - Ultra Mafic - Major Intrusion plutonic - Coarse grained >5mm - Darker in colour - Main Minerals Augite and OlivineMafic Magma At Divergent Plate Boundaries- Divergent plate margins are rarely seen at the surface as MOR are on the deep ocean floor.- Oceanic crust is thin below the MOR with mantle rock just 5mk below.- Partial melting of ultramafic peridotite from the upper mantle produces mafic magmas.Divergent PlateIs where two plates are moving apart and magma is rising between them.Partical meltingOccurs where some of the minerals in a rock melt to form a magmaMafic Magma at hotspots- A similar process occurs at hotspots where mantle plumes rise from deep in the mantle and results in partial melting of mafic material.- Convection in the mantle slowly transports heat from the core to earths surface.- Mantle plumes carry the heat upwards in a narrow rising column of hot material.- Which spreads out when the plume reaches the rigid lithosphere .- At this shallow lower pressures allow particle melting of the mantle peridotite to form large amounts of basaltic magma that may erupt not the surface.- If the plume provides a continuous supply of magma in a fixed location it from a hot spot.- As the lithosphere moves over this fixed hotspot due to plate tectonics, the eruption of magma on to the surface forms a chain of islands parallel to to the movement of the plates.Silicic lava formation At Convergent plate marginsContinental - Continental - Where to continents move together and converge neither continent will subduct.- However the high pressures and weight of sediments which ave been deformed to form fold mountains combine to form the base of the crust downwards.- As a result the moho is at its deepest below the highest fold mountains.- Particle melting at the base of the continental crust will produce silicic magma.- As the continental crust is silicic and starts to melt at 800 degrees this is the temperature below the mountains due to the geothermal gradient.- As the magma rises it intrudes to form granite batholiths.- There are no volcanoes as the magma is to viscous to make it to the surface.Intermediate lava formation at convergent plate boundariesContinental - Oceanic - Where plates converge and the oceanic plate subduct due to it higher density of 2.9g/cm3 particle melting occur and produce magma.- If the plate subduct and the magma rises quickly then at shallow depths then it will basaltic. Often the magma will rise through the silicic continental crust which may cause particle melting.- The rising temperatures may be at temperatures greater than 1000 degrees and silicic material melts at just 800.- This results in the mixing of silicic and mafic melts to give an intermediate magma.- The two components have different viscosities so mixing is difficult.- Some of the magma will reach the surface to form intermediate volcanoes however most will be intruded to form granite batholiths.Bowens Reactivity Series- Magma is the mixture of magma melted and mixed together with volatiles and water.- The initial composition of the magma may be silicic or mafic but the concept of differentiation shows how different rocks can be produced from a single magma.- The results of bowens experiment give us the the order in which minerals crystallise in a magma.The Discontinuous Series- The left hand side of the diagram is called the Discontinuous Series.- All these minerals are mafic and rich in iron and magnesiums with silica.- In a mafic magma, olivine be the first mafic mineral to form at high temperatures greater than 1500.- As the temperature decreases , Pyroxene(augite) then amphibole (hornblende) and finally biotite.- If cooling takes place slowly then the early formed high temperature minerals react with the magma to form the next mineral down the series.- For example olivine reacts with magma to form pyroxene if there is enough silica present.- if the magma is cooled quickly when it is erupted into a volcano then the reaction will not have time to occur and olivine will be persevered.- Often the reaction of one mineral with the next will be incomplete and the reaction rim will be seen around the crystals.Continous Series- The right hand side of the diagram is the Continuous Series, showing the crystallisation of plagioclase feldspar.- Plagioclase is calcium (Ca) rich at high temperatures and sodium (Na) rich at low temperatures, with intermediate composition of 50% calcium and 50 % sodium at temperatures in between.- Plagioclase is continuously reacting with the liquids to form a more Na rich crystal as the temperature decreases.- Sometimes individual crystals of plagioclase show zoning, the centre of the crystal being Ca rich whilst the towards the edge it is more Na rich plagioclase and poorer in Ca.Plagioclase feldspar- Knowing that Ca rich plagioclase is only found in mafic and ultra mafic rocks whilst Na rich plagioclase is found in silicic and intermediate rock means that they can be used in the classification of ingenious rocks.Low Temperature Minerals- When the two reaction series converge at a low temperature, minerals remain which will not react with the liquid.- The final group of minerals to crystallise are the felsic minerals which are silicic rich. These are potassium feldspar followed by muscovite mica and finally quartz at a temperature of about 700 C.Importance of bowens reactivity- Mafic rocks form at high temperatures as they contain olivine, pyroxene and Ca rich plagioclase.- Silicic rocks form at low temperatures as they contain quartz,muscovite, k feldspar, NA rich plagioclase and some biotite.- The minerals that form at lower temperatures at the end of the reactivity series are most stable at earths surface because they are formed closest to low temperature surface environment. As a results the most common mineral in sedimentary rocks in quartz.- The high temperature minerals are most unstable and quickest to weather at the surface.Magmatic Differentiation- Is a number of processes that cause a magma to evolve into magmas of different compositions. This leads to different igneous rocks being produced from a single parent magma. A mafic magma may crystallise to form ultramafic ,mafic, intermediate or even silicic rocks.Fractional Cristallisation- As olivine and pyroxene form at high temperatures, they use the iron and magnesium from the magma. - The high temperature plagioclase crystals ate rich in calcium.- This results in the magma becoming depleted in iron,magnesium and calcium.- The remaining liquid is enriched in silica, potassium, sodium and water because the early formed minerals are poor in these elements.- Overtime the composition of the magma changes from the original.Gravity Settling- Generally crystals will be denser than the liquid in which they are suspended so will settle out.- Early formed minerals with a higher density than the surrounding liquid such as olivine sink to the bottom to form a layer at the base of the intrusion.- Gravity settling removes the crystals from the remaining liquid.- A layer of dense early formed minerals at the base of an intrusion or magma chamber is known a cumulate layer.Filter Pressing- During the crystallisation of magma, there is a point where crystals and liquid exists in a slushy mass.- Due to the weight of overlying crystals, the liquid gets squeezed our to form a separate layer above.- The liquid is depleted in in the elements incorporated into the early formed minerals and enriched in the elements which form felsic minerals.If the parent magma is mafic ?- If the parent magma is mafic then in theory it will produce - Peridotite at the base of the intrusion which is rich in dense olivine.- Gabbro forming the main part of the intrusion - Diorite may form towards the top of the intrusion - Granite may form form veins or thin layer at the top of the intrusion.Major Layered Intrusions- These are large mafic or ultramafic igneous intrusions which cooled slowly below the surface so there was time form them to form distinct layers.- Gravity settling is the main process in the formation of layers of magnetite, chromite and platinum.The Palisade Sill- The palisade cell in new jersey is over 300m thick and was intruded into triassic sediments at a depth of about 3 km.- 1. The only parts of the sill to cool rapidly are the upper and lower edges which where in contact with the cold country rock. These chilled margins have fine grained crystals and most importantly have the same composition as the original magma because they cooled before differentiation could take place. The rock is basalt.- 2. As the main part of the intrusion began to crystallise, the early formed olivine crystals began to sink by gravity settling. Olivine has as density between 3.8g/cm3 compared to the mafic lava of 3.0g.cm3. the olivine layer form a layer 10m thick at the base of the intrusion just above the chilled margin.-3. Crystallisation will take place from both the top and the bottom of the sill as the crystals grew in cooler areas. The main rock forming the intrusion is medium grained dolerite. The last part of the intrusion to crystallise is about 200m above the base and is coarse grained Gabbro because it cooled slowly. As a result of fractionation the composition is lower in mafic minerals than the original composition because the gam is depleted in iron and magnesium. It is rich in plagioclase as the last part of magma is enriched in silica.Intrusions- Intrusive igneous rocks are those that crystallise below the earth surface.- Intrusions are described as concordant where they are intruded along bedding planes and discordant where they are intruded and cut across needing planes.- When magma is is moving up through country rock the intrusion will follow any line of weakness.- This could be a fault, joint or bedding plane.Minor intrusions- Vary a lot in size - Cool at hypabyssal depths - Most sills and dykes are composed of media grained mafic rock dolerite except along the margins where chilling by finer rained country rock will form basalt.- Sills and Dykes that have Granite as source will be made of porphyry or micro granite which are both medium grained silicic rocks.Sill- Sills are sheet like intrusions that are concordant and parallel to the beds.- Some sills occasionally cut across the beds in step from one bed to another to form transgressive sills.- They are generally irregular with variable widths and sinuous outcrops.- They are usually intruded along bedding planes.- Sills are intruded when fluid pressure is so greta that the underlying magma actually lifts the overlying rocks.- This means that sills usually from at shallow depths in the earth where the weight of overlying rock is not to great.Dyke- Dykes are sheet like intrusions which discordant and often vertical.- They range in size from a few cm to more than 100m thick and commonly 1-2m across.- As most dykes are vertical they from straight lines in an outcrop forming long thin features.- They are often intruded along the zones of weakness in the country rock such as faults or joints.- Dykes are commonly feeder vents under volcanoes so may have a radial pattern.Major Intrusions- Cool plutonic deep below the earth surface - The most common form of major intrusion is a batholith - The Peru-Chili batholith is 4500km long - Most batholiths are discordant where they are intruded into country rock.- The outcrop of many batholiths is roughly circular in shape with steep sides.- Batholiths are mainly granite in composition although they can be composed of diorite or granodiorite. All of which are coarse grained.- They could very slowly at 5-30km deepFormation of granite magmas- Most batholiths are intruded at convergent plate boundaries where they from the core of fold mountains which have resulted from plate collision.- High temperature mafic magmas will rise up through the crust and the heat from these will partially melt the continental crust.- Partical melting produces silicic magma, which rises because it is less dense than the rock it was produced from.- Silicic magma is viscous and therefore rises through the crusts slowly.- It is difficult for it to mix with other magmas as the viscosity is so different.- Batholiths are huge bodies of magma usually formed by repeated intrusions of magma into the same area.- As the magma rises it generates more magma through stoping and assimilation.Stoping and assimilation- At shallow depths of around 10k, the crust is cold and brittle and batholiths may intruded by stoping.- Magma moves upwards along joins , faults and bedding planes separating masses of country rock.- Eventually pieces of country rock are detached and settle into the magma were they are known as xenoliths.- Now new space is created during stoping as the magma simply fills the space formerly occupied by the country rock.- As the xenoliths fall into the magma most will be assimilated as they gradually melt to produce more magma.Chilled margin- Is where the igneous rock has cooled rapidly so it has fine crystals.- May be a few cm or m wide - Closest to the country rockBaked Margin- Is where the country rock has been heated by the intrusion and altered.- The rock are recrystallised by heat and have been contact metamorphosed.- Sugary texture, harder and lighter in colour - Depending on the size of the intrusion the baked margin can be a few cm to m in width.Metamorphic Aureole- Large area around batholiths where the rock have been metamorphosed- Batholiths as major intrusions heat a much large zone of country rock so that a metamorphic aureole can be 100s of m to km wide.- The rock in the aureole ate altered by contact metamorphism to produce new ,metamorphic rocks.- If the batholith is intruded into country rock of shale there is a clear sequences of changes that take place.- Closest to the intrusion where the heat is greatest for longer the rocks will be totally recrystallised to form hornfel.(metamorphic rock)- Further away from the intrusion the rock will be recrystallised to form a rock containing the metamorphic mineral andalusite.- In the zone just inside the metamorphic aureole where the heat was least, recrystallisation is partial so spotted rock forms.- The width depends on size and temperature of the intrusion and the dip of sides.The difference between intrusive sills and extrusive lava flows.- Sills have two chilled margins due to contact with cool country rock from both above and below.- Lava flow only has one clear chilled margin below.**************************************** - Sills have two baked margins both above and below because the sill heats all the country rock around it.- A lava flow only has one baked margin below the lava flow and none above as when it formed there was only air above.****************************************- Sill Xenoliths from rocks above and below the sill as the sill rips up material.- Lava flow No xenoliths from above the sill maybe some from below.****************************************- Sill Medium average crystal size as hypabyssal and cooled slowly.- Lava flow Fine grained crystals as cooled quickly as volcanic.****************************************- Sill may show differentiation of magma of the sills cools slow and is thick.- Lava flow may have flow banding or phenocrysts, may be aligned parallel to the direction of flow.****************************************- Sills mostly composed of dolerite - Lava flows most common rock is basalt ****************************************- Rare vesicles for sills- Lava flows have common vesicles in the upper part and may become amygdale which filled in with minerals ****************************************- A sill will have no weathering on the upper surface.- A lava flow may have a reddened surface or even an ancient soil if the flow was chemically weathered.Volcanic gasses- All atmospheric gasses apart from photosynthetic oxygen was released by volcanoes.- The gases are dissolved in the magma whilst its at high pressure at depth then as pressure decreases nearer the surface the gases are released by an eruption.- The main gases are water vapour, Co2 , nitrogen and sulphur dioxide.- Rain can be acidic close to volcanoes as the sulphur mixes with water condensation.Lava flows- Lava flows from recent eruptions can be very distinctive but ancient lavas are more difficult to recognise as they usually alike the surface patterns of rubbly blocks and flow patterns.Mafic Lavas- Mafic lavas are of low viscosity and flows of basalt, they are thin and wide spread over km's because they are fluid.- They cool to form AA lavas with rough blocky, jagged surfaces and Pahoehoe flows which are smooth and have a ropy surface.- The pahoehoe flows are less viscous than AA flows and as the lava cools it becomes even more viscous so that pahoehoe flow may become an AA.- Erupting lavas may have a temperature of 1000 to 1200c but most do not flow very fast .- If lavas cool underrated pillow lava may form.AA lava FlowPahoehoe lava flowIntermediate and silica lava flows- Viscous flows of andesite are irregular and tend to be limited around the cone. Silica flows of rhyolite are rear as they are very viscous so they tend to be thick but in a small area.- Very stickily lava flows can lava domes within in he crater and often shows flow banding.Pyroclastic Material- Magma can be explosively or forcefully ejected into the atmosphere as particles called pyroclasts.- Ash is the smallest particles size and is less than 2mm in size and forms pyroclastic rock tuff when consolidated.- Lapilli are particles which are 2mm to 64 mm and form Lapilli tuff.- Bombs and blocks are the coarsest particles over 64 mm in size and form pyroclastic rock agglomerates close to the crater of the volcano.- Nuee ardent are gaseous magma that form the fast moving pyroclastic flows that can trace several km and cool to form the rock ignimbrite.VolcanoIs a vent at the earths surface which magma and other volcanic material is ejected through.Pyroclastic FlowIs a hot mixture of pyroclastic material and gases. A nuee andante is a typical pyroclastic flow.Pumice- Pumice has already been described as a silicic igneous rock.- It is light so it can travel long distance form the volcano like the pyroclasts.Distribution By grain size- Coarse bombs and blocks are dropped close to the venue and are therefore circular pattern around the vent.- The finer pyroclastic material will be carried further away from the volcano and could cover hundreds or even 1000s of km.- The ash gets thinner and thinner further way from form the vent.IsopachyteIs a line joining points of equal thickness of a deposits such as ash. The maps are called isopach mapsDistribution by wind- Where the wind blows in the prevailing directions during an eruption the ash will be deposited mainly on the leeward side of the volcano.- The has cloud could be carried the wind over high distances and if it gets into the jet stream then it could go right around the world.- The higher the winds velocity the further the ash can eb carried.Distribution by energy blast- The most obvious relationship is that the greater the energy blast the further away from the volcano the pyroclasts will be found.- However it is likely that the blast energy will be directed in one direction so that even very close to the volcanoes ether could be very little effect if the blast was in a different direction.Lahars- Lahars are mudflows of wet ash and volcanic debris that flow rapidly down a mountain side.- Volcanic activity can cause rapid melting of snow which produces melt water.- The meltwater surges down the mountain side picking up pyroclastic material and sediment.- Can identify likely lahar paths by gradients and historical deposits.Distribution of lavas by viscosity- The viscosity or resistance of flow is important as it determines how the lava flow all behave.- It control the length of the lava flows, the velocity at which they flow and shape of the volcano.Highly viscous rhyolite and andesite lavas- Volcano will have steep sides - Eruptions are infrequent - Lava flows more slowly, are short in length and tend to be thick.- Trapped gasses may escape explosively - There are explosive eruptions and tuffs and pyroclastic flows form.Basalt lavas with a low viscosity- The volcano will have shallow sides, but wherever the slopes are steeper the flow will speed up.- Eruptions will be frequent - Lava flows easily forming long flows in channel tubes - Gases are easily released - Eruptions are rarely pyroclastic and are usually quiet - Cooler basaltic lava is more viscousMafic Volcanoes- The viscosity of the magma is lower because the silica content is lower so basaltic lava flows faster.- The gas content of the magma is higher but the low viscosity of the magma allows gas to escape so that the eruptions are quiet and non explosive.- Eruptions are frequent sometimes daily but often every few years.- The activity is described as effusive classified as Hawaiian - Occur at divergent plate boundaries or hotspots.Shield volcanoes- Have gentle sloping slopes of less than 10 degrees and a roughly circular shape around a central vent.- Composed of thin basalt lava flows built up form a central point and fissure eruptions on the flanks of the volcano.- The low viscosity of the lava allows it to the lava to travel down the side of the volcano on a gentle slope but as it cools and becomes more viscous it thickens up and builds up on the lower flanks forming a steeper lower slope.- Very little pyroclastic material is found within a shield volcano.Fissure eruptions-Are where magma reaches the surface along long linear cracks or fissures.- Can occur at the MOR - Vast amount of gases mainly silica dioxide is released which are believed to effect the climate.-Columnar Jointing- Where lava cools when the flows are more than 3m thick the inside of the flow will cool steadily(weeks) and outside will cool quickly (days).- Hexagonal columns form in the centre of these flows as it contacts during cooling.- Contraction causes tension cracks to form between each cooling centre.Submarine Eruptions- When lava is erupted underwater the outer skin cools quickly whilst the inside is still molten.- Pressure of more lava behind causes the front to break through to form a new pillow shape.- Pillow lavas are recognised by their characteristics of a rounded shape.- Each pillow has a rounded top and a sagging bottom so pillow lavas can be used as a way up indicator to identify the youngest rock.- Vesicles may be present towards the upper outer edge of the pillows and the spaces between pillows may be infilled with fine glassy minerals.Volcanic explosivity Index- The VEI is a way to describe the relative size and magnitude of a eruption.- It is an index of 0 - 8 increasing in explosivity- Each increase is an increase in a factor of 10Explosive Volcanoes- Strato Volcanos - intermediate and silicic- High gas content, however viscous lava does not allow gases to escape and so they bud up forming explosive eruptions - Infrequent eruptions - Convergent plate boundaries where subduction occursStrato Volcanoes- Conical shape however irregular in shape due to collapse and explosive damage.- When lava is silicic it may be so viscous that it hardly flows at all pilling up on the vent to from a volcanic dome.- High gas content so can result in nuee andanteCaldera- Is a large volcanic circular depression casted by violent explosions and the collapse of the cone.1) A series of volcanic explosive eruptions of pyroclastic flows, ash and pumice remove large volumes of magma.2) The magma chamber starts to empty of magma as the magma is erupted and the top of the volcano begins to collapse down into the weekend area below.3) The entire cone collapse and it may causes a tsunami of the volcano is coastal.Where is the magma chamber- The size of the magma chamber can affect the eruption.- If the chamber where the magma is stored is small the eruption is likely to short .- Mostly areas where the crust of mantle has be parochially meltedGeysers and hot springs- Geysers are hot springs which from a column of water and steam is explosively discharged at intervals.- Largest geysers erupt unto 200m high - Hot springs are common in volcanic areas as ground water is heated by magma at depths, convection causes the gas rich super heated water to rise.- As it rises the pressure decreases and flash boiling may result in the water exploding upwards.- the water drains back into the ground to from the cycle against.Predicting Eruptions - Historic patterns- Some erupt frequently some do not - It may be possible to predict when an eruption is due - Analysing the composition and distribution and volume of dates pyroclastic material helps to predict the patterns and predict future eruptionsGround Deformation- Swelling of the volcano suggest that magma is moving upwards under the volcano.- The rate of swelling is measured by tilt meters and gps that can accurately measure the vertical and horizontal movements.Thermal imagery can also detect using infrared movement just below the earths surfaceGas emissions- As magma nears the surface the it pressure decreases and gave escapes.- Sulfur dioxide is one of the main components of volcanic gases and increasing amounts being released suggests that magma is nearing the surface.- There may also be changes in gas composition between co2 and so2Seismicity- Earthquakes commonly provide the easiest warning as they prepare to erupt.- Earthquake swarms often proceed eruptions - Short period of earthquakes caused by the fracture of brittle rocks as magma forces its way up.- Long periods of earthquakes as the gas pressure increases in the magma chamber.- Harmonic tremors as the magma moves upwards vibrating in the vent.Risk Analysis- Knowledge abut present topology used - Hazards mapping showing zones of danger expected - Lava flows generally move slowly so rarely kill but destroy propter and buildings.- Blast damage can be destructive close to the volcanoes, flattening trees and killing people- Ash fall can effect areas far from the volcanoes causing damage to property from the weight of roofs.- Pyroclastic flows are hot and travel rapidly but are likely confined to valleys. Are unpredictable and responsible for may deaths.- Lahars - can be generated from pyroclastic flows or debris that avalanche down. They can move rapidly and be very destructive and are mainly limited to valleys but can effect area far away from the volcano.Benefits from living with volcanoes- Geothermal power from hot springs caused by the volcanic activity, used fro heating homes and businesses, renewable and sustainable.- Fertile soils, lava and some volcanic ashes weathers rapidly in tropical climates and forms deep fertile soil layers, rich in minerals .- Minerals, volcanic activity concentrates some elects which can have volcanic value such as sulphur and nickels and iron metals around black smokers.Volcanic activity affecting claimte- As volcanoes erupt they blast large amount of gases including sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere.- These sulphur dioxide particles can reach the stratosphere which can convert into sulphuric ACID PARTICLES. - They reflect energy coming from the sun and prevent its rays from eating earth causing global cooling.- Can stay on the stratosphere for 304 years -Weather > acid rain - Block out sunlight and gases can trap heat in causing the climate to increase in temperature.Flickr Creative Commons ImagesSome images used in this set are licensed under the Creative Commons through Flickr.com.Click to see the original works with their full license.PumiceObsidianPumiceLaharsAdvertisementUpgrade to remove ads

Igneous rock (derived from the Latin word ignis meaning fire), or magmatic rock, is one of the three main rock types, the others being sedimentary and metamorphic. Igneous rock is formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. The magma can be derived from partial melts of existing rocks in either a planet's mantle or crust. Typically, the melting is caused by one or more of three processes: an increase in temperature, a decrease in pressure, or a change in composition. Solidification into rock occurs either below the surface as intrusive rocks or on the surface as extrusive rocks. Igneous rock may form with crystallization to form granular, crystalline rocks, or without crystallization to form natural glasses.

Geological significance
Igneous and metamorphic rocks make up 90–95% of the top 16 km of the Earth's crust by volume.[1] Igneous rocks form about 15% of the Earth's current land surface.[note 1] Most of the Earth's oceanic crust is made of igneous rock.
Igneous rocks are also geologically important because:

their minerals and global chemistry give information about the composition of the mantle, from which some igneous rocks are extracted, and the temperature and pressure conditions that allowed this extraction, and/or of other pre-existing rock that melted;
their absolute ages can be obtained from various forms of radiometric dating and thus can be compared to adjacent geological strata, allowing a time sequence of events;
their features are usually characteristic of a specific tectonic environment, allowing tectonic reconstitutions (see plate tectonics);
in some special circumstances they host important mineral deposits (ores): for example, tungsten, tin, and uranium are commonly associated with granites and diorites, whereas ores of chromium and platinum are commonly associated with gabbros.

Geological setting




Forming of igneous rock


In terms of modes of occurrence, igneous rocks can be either intrusive (plutonic and hypabyssal) or extrusive (volcanic).
Intrusive




Close-up of granite (an intrusive igneous rock) exposed in Chennai, India.


Intrusive igneous rocks are formed from magma that cools and solidifies within the crust of a planet, surrounded by pre-existing rock (called country rock); the magma cools slowly and, as a result, these rocks are coarse-grained. The mineral grains in such rocks can generally be identified with the naked eye. Intrusive rocks can also be classified according to the shape and size of the intrusive body and its relation to the other formations into which it intrudes. Typical intrusive formations are batholiths, stocks, laccoliths, sills and dikes. When the magma solidifies within the earth's crust, it cools slowly forming coarse textured rocks, such as granite, gabbro, or diorite.
The central cores of major mountain ranges consist of intrusive igneous rocks, usually granite. When exposed by erosion, these cores (called batholiths) may occupy huge areas of the Earth's surface.
Intrusive igneous rocks that form at depth within the crust are termed plutonic (or abyssal) rocks and are usually coarse-grained. Intrusive igneous rocks that form near the surface are termed subvolcanic or hypabyssal rocks and they are usually medium-grained. Hypabyssal rocks are less common than plutonic or volcanic rocks and often form dikes, sills, laccoliths, lopoliths, or phacoliths.
Extrusive




Extrusive igneous rock is made from lava released by volcanoes






Sample of basalt (an extrusive igneous rock), found in Massachusetts


Extrusive igneous rocks, also known as volcanic rocks, are formed at the crust's surface as a result of the partial melting of rocks within the mantle and crust. Extrusive igneous rocks cool and solidify quicker than intrusive igneous rocks. They are formed by the cooling of molten magma on the earth's surface. The magma, which is brought to the surface through fissures or volcanic eruptions, solidifies at a faster rate. Hence such rocks are smooth, crystalline and fine-grained. Basalt is a common extrusive igneous rock and forms lava flows, lava sheets and lava plateaus. Some kinds of basalt solidify to form long polygonal columns. The Giant's Causeway in Antrim, Northern Ireland is an example.
The molten rock, with or without suspended crystals and gas bubbles, is called magma. It rises because it is less dense than the rock from which it was created. When magma reaches the surface from beneath water or air, it is called lava. Eruptions of volcanoes into air are termed subaerial, whereas those occurring underneath the ocean are termed submarine. Black smokers and mid-ocean ridge basalt are examples of submarine volcanic activity.
The volume of extrusive rock erupted annually by volcanoes varies with plate tectonic setting. Extrusive rock is produced in the following proportions:[3]

divergent boundary: 73%
convergent boundary (subduction zone): 15%
hotspot: 12%.

Magma that erupts from a volcano behaves according to its viscosity, determined by temperature, composition, crystal content and the amount of silica. High-temperature magma, most of which is basaltic in composition, behaves in a manner similar to thick oil and, as it cools, treacle. Long, thin basalt flows with pahoehoe surfaces are common. Intermediate composition magma, such as andesite, tends to form cinder cones of intermingled ash, tuff and lava, and may have a viscosity similar to thick, cold molasses or even rubber when erupted. Felsic magma, such as rhyolite, is usually erupted at low temperature and is up to 10,000 times as viscous as basalt. Volcanoes with rhyolitic magma commonly erupt explosively, and rhyolitic lava flows are typically of limited extent and have steep margins, because the magma is so viscous.
Felsic and intermediate magmas that erupt often do so violently, with explosions driven by the release of dissolved gases—typically water vapour, but also carbon dioxide. Explosively erupted pyroclastic material is called tephra and includes tuff, agglomerate and ignimbrite. Fine volcanic ash is also erupted and forms ash tuff deposits, which can often cover vast areas.
Because lava usually cools and crystallizes rapidly, it is usually fine-grained. If the cooling has been so rapid as to prevent the formation of even small crystals after extrusion, the resulting rock may be mostly glass (such as the rock obsidian). If the cooling of the lava happened more slowly, the rock would be coarse-grained.
Because the minerals are mostly fine-grained, it is much more difficult to distinguish between the different types of extrusive igneous rocks than between different types of intrusive igneous rocks. Generally, the mineral constituents of fine-grained extrusive igneous rocks can only be determined by examination of thin sections of the rock under a microscope, so only an approximate classification can usually be made in the field.
Classification
Igneous rocks are classified according to mode of occurrence, texture, mineralogy, chemical composition, and the geometry of the igneous body.
The classification of the many types of different igneous rocks can provide us with important information about the conditions under which they formed. Two important variables used for the classification of igneous rocks are particle size, which largely depends on the cooling history, and the mineral composition of the rock. Feldspars, quartz or feldspathoids, olivines, pyroxenes, amphiboles, and micas are all important minerals in the formation of almost all igneous rocks, and they are basic to the classification of these rocks. All other minerals present are regarded as nonessential in almost all igneous rocks and are called accessory minerals. Types of igneous rocks with other essential minerals are very rare, and these rare rocks include those with essential carbonates.
In a simplified classification, igneous rock types are separated on the basis of the type of feldspar present, the presence or absence of quartz, and in rocks with no feldspar or quartz, the type of iron or magnesium minerals present. Rocks containing quartz (silica in composition) are silica-oversaturated. Rocks with feldspathoids are silica-undersaturated, because feldspathoids cannot coexist in a stable association with quartz.
Igneous rocks that have crystals large enough to be seen by the naked eye are called phaneritic; those with crystals too small to be seen are called aphanitic. Generally speaking, phaneritic implies an intrusive origin; aphanitic an extrusive one.
An igneous rock with larger, clearly discernible crystals embedded in a finer-grained matrix is termed porphyry. Porphyritic texture develops when some of the crystals grow to considerable size before the main mass of the magma crystallizes as finer-grained, uniform material.
Igneous rocks are classified on the basis of texture and composition. Texture refers to the size, shape, and arrangement of the mineral grains or crystals of which the rock is composed.
Texture

Main article: Rock microstructure
Texture is an important criterion for the naming of volcanic rocks. The texture of volcanic rocks, including the size, shape, orientation, and distribution of mineral grains and the intergrain relationships, will determine whether the rock is termed a tuff, a pyroclastic lava or a simple lava.
However, the texture is only a subordinate part of classifying volcanic rocks, as most often there needs to be chemical information gleaned from rocks with extremely fine-grained groundmass or from airfall tuffs, which may be formed from volcanic ash.
Textural criteria are less critical in classifying intrusive rocks where the majority of minerals will be visible to the naked eye or at least using a hand lens, magnifying glass or microscope. Plutonic rocks also tend to be less texturally varied and less prone to gaining structural fabrics. Textural terms can be used to differentiate different intrusive phases of large plutons, for instance porphyritic margins to large intrusive bodies, porphyry stocks and subvolcanic dikes (apophyses). Mineralogical classification is most often used to classify plutonic rocks. Chemical classifications are preferred to classify volcanic rocks, with phenocryst species used as a prefix, e.g. "olivine-bearing picrite" or "orthoclase-phyric rhyolite".

Basic classification scheme for igneous rocks on their mineralogy. If the approximate volume fractions of minerals in the rock are known, the rock name and silica content can be read off the diagram. This is not an exact method, because the classification of igneous rocks also depends on other components than silica, yet in most cases it is a good first guess.


Chemical classification and Petrology




Total alkali versus silica classification scheme (TAS) as proposed in Le Maitre's 2002 Igneous Rocks - A classification and glossary of terms[4]:237


Igneous rocks can be classified according to chemical or mineralogical parameters.
Chemical: total alkali-silica content (TAS diagram) for volcanic rock classification used when modal or mineralogic data is unavailable:

felsic igneous rocks containing a high silica content, greater than 63% SiO2 (examples granite and rhyolite)
intermediate igneous rocks containing between 52 – 63% SiO2 (example andesite and dacite)
mafic igneous rocks have low silica 45 – 52% and typically high iron – magnesium content (example gabbro and basalt)
ultramafic rock igneous rocks with less than 45% silica. (examples picrite, komatiite and peridotite)
alkalic igneous rocks with 5 – 15% alkali (K2O + Na2O) content or with a molar ratio of alkali to silica greater than 1:6. (examples phonolite and trachyte)

Chemical classification also extends to differentiating rocks that are chemically similar according to the TAS diagram, for instance;

Ultrapotassic; rocks containing molar K2O/Na2O >3
Peralkaline; rocks containing molar (K2O + Na2O)/ Al2O3 >1
Peraluminous; rocks containing molar (K2O + Na2O)/ Al2O3 <1

An idealized mineralogy (the normative mineralogy) can be calculated from the chemical composition, and the calculation is useful for rocks too fine-grained or too altered for identification of minerals that crystallized from the melt. For instance, normative quartz classifies a rock as silica-oversaturated; an example is rhyolite. In an older terminology, silica oversaturated rocks were called silicic or acidic where the SiO2 was greater than 66% and the family term quartzolite was applied to the most silicic. A normative feldspathoid classifies a rock as silica-undersaturated; an example is nephelinite.
History of classification
In 1902, a group of American petrographers proposed that all existing classifications of igneous rocks should be discarded and replaced by a "quantitative" classification based on chemical analysis. They showed how vague, and often unscientific, much of the existing terminology was and argued that as the chemical composition of an igneous rock was its most fundamental characteristic, it should be elevated to prime position.
Geological occurrence, structure, mineralogical constitution—the hitherto accepted criteria for the discrimination of rock species—were relegated to the background. The completed rock analysis is first to be interpreted in terms of the rock-forming minerals which might be expected to be formed when the magma crystallizes, e.g., quartz feldspars, olivine, akermannite, Feldspathoids, magnetite, corundum, and so on, and the rocks are divided into groups strictly according to the relative proportion of these minerals to one another.[5][6]
Mineralogical classification
For volcanic rocks, mineralogy is important in classifying and naming lavas. The most important criterion is the phenocryst species, followed by the groundmass mineralogy. Often, where the groundmass is aphanitic, chemical classification must be used to properly identify a volcanic rock.
Mineralogic contents – felsic versus mafic

felsic rock, highest content of silicon, with predominance of quartz, alkali feldspar and/or feldspathoids: the felsic minerals; these rocks (e.g., granite, rhyolite) are usually light coloured, and have low density.
mafic rock, lesser content of silicon relative to felsic rocks, with predominance of mafic minerals pyroxenes, olivines and calcic plagioclase; these rocks (example, basalt, gabbro) are usually dark coloured, and have a higher density than felsic rocks.
ultramafic rock, lowest content of silicon, with more than 90% of mafic minerals (e.g., dunite).

For intrusive, plutonic and usually phaneritic igneous rocks (where all minerals are visible at least via microscope), the mineralogy is used to classify the rock. This usually occurs on ternary diagrams, where the relative proportions of three minerals are used to classify the rock.
The following table is a simple subdivision of igneous rocks according to both their composition and mode of occurrence.

Example of classification
Granite is an igneous intrusive rock (crystallized at depth), with felsic composition (rich in silica and predominately quartz plus potassium-rich feldspar plus sodium-rich plagioclase) and phaneritic, subeuhedral texture (minerals are visible to the unaided eye and commonly some of them retain original crystallographic shapes).
Magma origination
The Earth's crust averages about 35 kilometers thick under the continents, but averages only some 7–10 kilometers beneath the oceans. The continental crust is composed primarily of sedimentary rocks resting on a crystalline basement formed of a great variety of metamorphic and igneous rocks, including granulite and granite. Oceanic crust is composed primarily of basalt and gabbro. Both continental and oceanic crust rest on peridotite of the mantle.
Rocks may melt in response to a decrease in pressure, to a change in composition (such as an addition of water), to an increase in temperature, or to a combination of these processes.
Other mechanisms, such as melting from a meteorite impact, are less important today, but impacts during the accretion of the Earth led to extensive melting, and the outer several hundred kilometers of our early Earth was probably an ocean of magma. Impacts of large meteorites in the last few hundred million years have been proposed as one mechanism responsible for the extensive basalt magmatism of several large igneous provinces.
Decompression
Decompression melting occurs because of a decrease in pressure.[7]
The solidus temperatures of most rocks (the temperatures below which they are completely solid) increase with increasing pressure in the absence of water. Peridotite at depth in the Earth's mantle may be hotter than its solidus temperature at some shallower level. If such rock rises during the convection of solid mantle, it will cool slightly as it expands in an adiabatic process, but the cooling is only about 0.3 °C per kilometer. Experimental studies of appropriate peridotite samples document that the solidus temperatures increase by 3 °C to 4 °C per kilometer. If the rock rises far enough, it will begin to melt. Melt droplets can coalesce into larger volumes and be intruded upwards. This process of melting from the upward movement of solid mantle is critical in the evolution of the Earth.
Decompression melting creates the ocean crust at mid-ocean ridges. It also causes volcanism in intraplate regions, such as Europe, Africa and the Pacific sea floor. There, it is variously attributed either to the rise of mantle plumes (the "Plume hypothesis") or to intraplate extension (the "Plate hypothesis").[8]
Effects of water and carbon dioxide
The change of rock composition most responsible for the creation of magma is the addition of water. Water lowers the solidus temperature of rocks at a given pressure. For example, at a depth of about 100 kilometers, peridotite begins to melt near 800 °C in the presence of excess water, but near or above about 1,500 °C in the absence of water.[9] Water is driven out of the oceanic lithosphere in subduction zones, and it causes melting in the overlying mantle. Hydrous magmas composed of basalt and andesite are produced directly and indirectly as results of dehydration during the subduction process. Such magmas, and those derived from them, build up island arcs such as those in the Pacific Ring of Fire. These magmas form rocks of the calc-alkaline series, an important part of the continental crust.
The addition of carbon dioxide is relatively a much less important cause of magma formation than the addition of water, but genesis of some silica-undersaturated magmas has been attributed to the dominance of carbon dioxide over water in their mantle source regions. In the presence of carbon dioxide, experiments document that the peridotite solidus temperature decreases by about 200 °C in a narrow pressure interval at pressures corresponding to a depth of about 70 km. At greater depths, carbon dioxide can have more effect: at depths to about 200 km, the temperatures of initial melting of a carbonated peridotite composition were determined to be 450 °C to 600 °C lower than for the same composition with no carbon dioxide.[10] Magmas of rock types such as nephelinite, carbonatite, and kimberlite are among those that may be generated following an influx of carbon dioxide into mantle at depths greater than about 70 km.
Temperature increase
Increase in temperature is the most typical mechanism for formation of magma within continental crust. Such temperature increases can occur because of the upward intrusion of magma from the mantle. Temperatures can also exceed the solidus of a crustal rock in continental crust thickened by compression at a plate boundary. The plate boundary between the Indian and Asian continental masses provides a well-studied example, as the Tibetan Plateau just north of the boundary has crust about 80 kilometers thick, roughly twice the thickness of normal continental crust. Studies of electrical resistivity deduced from magnetotelluric data have detected a layer that appears to contain silicate melt and that stretches for at least 1,000 kilometers within the middle crust along the southern margin of the Tibetan Plateau.[11] Granite and rhyolite are types of igneous rock commonly interpreted as products of the melting of continental crust because of increases in temperature. Temperature increases also may contribute to the melting of lithosphere dragged down in a subduction zone.
Magma evolution




Schematic diagrams showing the principles behind fractional crystallisation in a magma. While cooling, the magma evolves in composition because different minerals crystallize from the melt. 1: olivine crystallizes; 2: olivine and pyroxene crystallize; 3: pyroxene and plagioclase crystallize; 4: plagioclase crystallizes. At the bottom of the magma reservoir, a cumulate rock forms.




Main article: Igneous differentiation


Most magmas only entirely melt for small parts of their histories. More typically, they are mixes of melt and crystals, and sometimes also of gas bubbles. Melt, crystals, and bubbles usually have different densities, and so they can separate as magmas evolve.
As magma cools, minerals typically crystallize from the melt at different temperatures (fractional crystallization). As minerals crystallize, the composition of the residual melt typically changes. If crystals separate from the melt, then the residual melt will differ in composition from the parent magma. For instance, a magma of gabbroic composition can produce a residual melt of granitic composition if early formed crystals are separated from the magma. Gabbro may have a liquidus temperature near 1,200 °C, and the derivative granite-composition melt may have a liquidus temperature as low as about 700 °C. Incompatible elements are concentrated in the last residues of magma during fractional crystallization and in the first melts produced during partial melting: either process can form the magma that crystallizes to pegmatite, a rock type commonly enriched in incompatible elements. Bowen's reaction series is important for understanding the idealised sequence of fractional crystallisation of a magma.
Magma composition can be determined by processes other than partial melting and fractional crystallization. For instance, magmas commonly interact with rocks they intrude, both by melting those rocks and by reacting with them. Magmas of different compositions can mix with one another. In rare cases, melts can separate into two immiscible melts of contrasting compositions.
There are relatively few minerals that are important in the formation of common igneous rocks, because the magma from which the minerals crystallize is rich in only certain elements: silicon, oxygen, aluminium, sodium, potassium, calcium, iron, and magnesium. These are the elements that combine to form the silicate minerals, which account for over ninety percent of all igneous rocks. The chemistry of igneous rocks is expressed differently for major and minor elements and for trace elements. Contents of major and minor elements are conventionally expressed as weight percent oxides (e.g., 51% SiO2, and 1.50% TiO2). Abundances of trace elements are conventionally expressed as parts per million by weight (e.g., 420 ppm Ni, and 5.1 ppm Sm). The term "trace element" is typically used for elements present in most rocks at abundances less than 100 ppm or so, but some trace elements may be present in some rocks at abundances exceeding 1,000 ppm. The diversity of rock compositions has been defined by a huge mass of analytical data—over 230,000 rock analyses can be accessed on the web through a site sponsored by the U. S. National Science Foundation (see the External Link to EarthChem).
Etymology
The word "igneous" is derived from the Latin ignis, meaning "of fire". Volcanic rocks are named after Vulcan, the Roman name for the god of fire. Intrusive rocks are also called "plutonic" rocks, named after Pluto, the Roman god of the underworld.

Igneous rock (derived from the Latin word ignis meaning fire), or magmatic rock, is one of the three main rock types, the others being sedimentary and metamorphic. Igneous rock is formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. The magma can be derived from partial melts of existing rocks in either a planet's mantle or crust. Typically, the melting is caused by one or more of three processes: an increase in temperature, a decrease in pressure, or a change in composition. Solidification into rock occurs either below the surface as intrusive rocks or on the surface as extrusive rocks. Igneous rock may form with crystallization to form granular, crystalline rocks, or without crystallization to form natural glasses.

Geological significance
Igneous and metamorphic rocks make up 90–95% of the top 16 km of the Earth's crust by volume.[1] Igneous rocks form about 15% of the Earth's current land surface.[note 1] Most of the Earth's oceanic crust is made of igneous rock.
Igneous rocks are also geologically important because:

their minerals and global chemistry give information about the composition of the mantle, from which some igneous rocks are extracted, and the temperature and pressure conditions that allowed this extraction, and/or of other pre-existing rock that melted;
their absolute ages can be obtained from various forms of radiometric dating and thus can be compared to adjacent geological strata, allowing a time sequence of events;
their features are usually characteristic of a specific tectonic environment, allowing tectonic reconstitutions (see plate tectonics);
in some special circumstances they host important mineral deposits (ores): for example, tungsten, tin, and uranium are commonly associated with granites and diorites, whereas ores of chromium and platinum are commonly associated with gabbros.

Geological setting




Forming of igneous rock


In terms of modes of occurrence, igneous rocks can be either intrusive (plutonic and hypabyssal) or extrusive (volcanic).
Intrusive




Close-up of granite (an intrusive igneous rock) exposed in Chennai, India.


Intrusive igneous rocks are formed from magma that cools and solidifies within the crust of a planet, surrounded by pre-existing rock (called country rock); the magma cools slowly and, as a result, these rocks are coarse-grained. The mineral grains in such rocks can generally be identified with the naked eye. Intrusive rocks can also be classified according to the shape and size of the intrusive body and its relation to the other formations into which it intrudes. Typical intrusive formations are batholiths, stocks, laccoliths, sills and dikes. When the magma solidifies within the earth's crust, it cools slowly forming coarse textured rocks, such as granite, gabbro, or diorite.
The central cores of major mountain ranges consist of intrusive igneous rocks, usually granite. When exposed by erosion, these cores (called batholiths) may occupy huge areas of the Earth's surface.
Intrusive igneous rocks that form at depth within the crust are termed plutonic (or abyssal) rocks and are usually coarse-grained. Intrusive igneous rocks that form near the surface are termed subvolcanic or hypabyssal rocks and they are usually medium-grained. Hypabyssal rocks are less common than plutonic or volcanic rocks and often form dikes, sills, laccoliths, lopoliths, or phacoliths.
Extrusive




Extrusive igneous rock is made from lava released by volcanoes






Sample of basalt (an extrusive igneous rock), found in Massachusetts


Extrusive igneous rocks, also known as volcanic rocks, are formed at the crust's surface as a result of the partial melting of rocks within the mantle and crust. Extrusive igneous rocks cool and solidify quicker than intrusive igneous rocks. They are formed by the cooling of molten magma on the earth's surface. The magma, which is brought to the surface through fissures or volcanic eruptions, solidifies at a faster rate. Hence such rocks are smooth, crystalline and fine-grained. Basalt is a common extrusive igneous rock and forms lava flows, lava sheets and lava plateaus. Some kinds of basalt solidify to form long polygonal columns. The Giant's Causeway in Antrim, Northern Ireland is an example.
The molten rock, with or without suspended crystals and gas bubbles, is called magma. It rises because it is less dense than the rock from which it was created. When magma reaches the surface from beneath water or air, it is called lava. Eruptions of volcanoes into air are termed subaerial, whereas those occurring underneath the ocean are termed submarine. Black smokers and mid-ocean ridge basalt are examples of submarine volcanic activity.
The volume of extrusive rock erupted annually by volcanoes varies with plate tectonic setting. Extrusive rock is produced in the following proportions:[3]

divergent boundary: 73%
convergent boundary (subduction zone): 15%
hotspot: 12%.

Magma that erupts from a volcano behaves according to its viscosity, determined by temperature, composition, crystal content and the amount of silica. High-temperature magma, most of which is basaltic in composition, behaves in a manner similar to thick oil and, as it cools, treacle. Long, thin basalt flows with pahoehoe surfaces are common. Intermediate composition magma, such as andesite, tends to form cinder cones of intermingled ash, tuff and lava, and may have a viscosity similar to thick, cold molasses or even rubber when erupted. Felsic magma, such as rhyolite, is usually erupted at low temperature and is up to 10,000 times as viscous as basalt. Volcanoes with rhyolitic magma commonly erupt explosively, and rhyolitic lava flows are typically of limited extent and have steep margins, because the magma is so viscous.
Felsic and intermediate magmas that erupt often do so violently, with explosions driven by the release of dissolved gases—typically water vapour, but also carbon dioxide. Explosively erupted pyroclastic material is called tephra and includes tuff, agglomerate and ignimbrite. Fine volcanic ash is also erupted and forms ash tuff deposits, which can often cover vast areas.
Because lava usually cools and crystallizes rapidly, it is usually fine-grained. If the cooling has been so rapid as to prevent the formation of even small crystals after extrusion, the resulting rock may be mostly glass (such as the rock obsidian). If the cooling of the lava happened more slowly, the rock would be coarse-grained.
Because the minerals are mostly fine-grained, it is much more difficult to distinguish between the different types of extrusive igneous rocks than between different types of intrusive igneous rocks. Generally, the mineral constituents of fine-grained extrusive igneous rocks can only be determined by examination of thin sections of the rock under a microscope, so only an approximate classification can usually be made in the field.
Classification
Igneous rocks are classified according to mode of occurrence, texture, mineralogy, chemical composition, and the geometry of the igneous body.
The classification of the many types of different igneous rocks can provide us with important information about the conditions under which they formed. Two important variables used for the classification of igneous rocks are particle size, which largely depends on the cooling history, and the mineral composition of the rock. Feldspars, quartz or feldspathoids, olivines, pyroxenes, amphiboles, and micas are all important minerals in the formation of almost all igneous rocks, and they are basic to the classification of these rocks. All other minerals present are regarded as nonessential in almost all igneous rocks and are called accessory minerals. Types of igneous rocks with other essential minerals are very rare, and these rare rocks include those with essential carbonates.
In a simplified classification, igneous rock types are separated on the basis of the type of feldspar present, the presence or absence of quartz, and in rocks with no feldspar or quartz, the type of iron or magnesium minerals present. Rocks containing quartz (silica in composition) are silica-oversaturated. Rocks with feldspathoids are silica-undersaturated, because feldspathoids cannot coexist in a stable association with quartz.
Igneous rocks that have crystals large enough to be seen by the naked eye are called phaneritic; those with crystals too small to be seen are called aphanitic. Generally speaking, phaneritic implies an intrusive origin; aphanitic an extrusive one.
An igneous rock with larger, clearly discernible crystals embedded in a finer-grained matrix is termed porphyry. Porphyritic texture develops when some of the crystals grow to considerable size before the main mass of the magma crystallizes as finer-grained, uniform material.
Igneous rocks are classified on the basis of texture and composition. Texture refers to the size, shape, and arrangement of the mineral grains or crystals of which the rock is composed.
Texture

Main article: Rock microstructure
Texture is an important criterion for the naming of volcanic rocks. The texture of volcanic rocks, including the size, shape, orientation, and distribution of mineral grains and the intergrain relationships, will determine whether the rock is termed a tuff, a pyroclastic lava or a simple lava.
However, the texture is only a subordinate part of classifying volcanic rocks, as most often there needs to be chemical information gleaned from rocks with extremely fine-grained groundmass or from airfall tuffs, which may be formed from volcanic ash.
Textural criteria are less critical in classifying intrusive rocks where the majority of minerals will be visible to the naked eye or at least using a hand lens, magnifying glass or microscope. Plutonic rocks also tend to be less texturally varied and less prone to gaining structural fabrics. Textural terms can be used to differentiate different intrusive phases of large plutons, for instance porphyritic margins to large intrusive bodies, porphyry stocks and subvolcanic dikes (apophyses). Mineralogical classification is most often used to classify plutonic rocks. Chemical classifications are preferred to classify volcanic rocks, with phenocryst species used as a prefix, e.g. "olivine-bearing picrite" or "orthoclase-phyric rhyolite".

Basic classification scheme for igneous rocks on their mineralogy. If the approximate volume fractions of minerals in the rock are known, the rock name and silica content can be read off the diagram. This is not an exact method, because the classification of igneous rocks also depends on other components than silica, yet in most cases it is a good first guess.


Chemical classification and Petrology




Total alkali versus silica classification scheme (TAS) as proposed in Le Maitre's 2002 Igneous Rocks - A classification and glossary of terms[4]:237


Igneous rocks can be classified according to chemical or mineralogical parameters.
Chemical: total alkali-silica content (TAS diagram) for volcanic rock classification used when modal or mineralogic data is unavailable:

felsic igneous rocks containing a high silica content, greater than 63% SiO2 (examples granite and rhyolite)
intermediate igneous rocks containing between 52 – 63% SiO2 (example andesite and dacite)
mafic igneous rocks have low silica 45 – 52% and typically high iron – magnesium content (example gabbro and basalt)
ultramafic rock igneous rocks with less than 45% silica. (examples picrite, komatiite and peridotite)
alkalic igneous rocks with 5 – 15% alkali (K2O + Na2O) content or with a molar ratio of alkali to silica greater than 1:6. (examples phonolite and trachyte)

Chemical classification also extends to differentiating rocks that are chemically similar according to the TAS diagram, for instance;

Ultrapotassic; rocks containing molar K2O/Na2O >3
Peralkaline; rocks containing molar (K2O + Na2O)/ Al2O3 >1
Peraluminous; rocks containing molar (K2O + Na2O)/ Al2O3 <1

An idealized mineralogy (the normative mineralogy) can be calculated from the chemical composition, and the calculation is useful for rocks too fine-grained or too altered for identification of minerals that crystallized from the melt. For instance, normative quartz classifies a rock as silica-oversaturated; an example is rhyolite. In an older terminology, silica oversaturated rocks were called silicic or acidic where the SiO2 was greater than 66% and the family term quartzolite was applied to the most silicic. A normative feldspathoid classifies a rock as silica-undersaturated; an example is nephelinite.
History of classification
In 1902, a group of American petrographers proposed that all existing classifications of igneous rocks should be discarded and replaced by a "quantitative" classification based on chemical analysis. They showed how vague, and often unscientific, much of the existing terminology was and argued that as the chemical composition of an igneous rock was its most fundamental characteristic, it should be elevated to prime position.
Geological occurrence, structure, mineralogical constitution—the hitherto accepted criteria for the discrimination of rock species—were relegated to the background. The completed rock analysis is first to be interpreted in terms of the rock-forming minerals which might be expected to be formed when the magma crystallizes, e.g., quartz feldspars, olivine, akermannite, Feldspathoids, magnetite, corundum, and so on, and the rocks are divided into groups strictly according to the relative proportion of these minerals to one another.[5][6]
Mineralogical classification
For volcanic rocks, mineralogy is important in classifying and naming lavas. The most important criterion is the phenocryst species, followed by the groundmass mineralogy. Often, where the groundmass is aphanitic, chemical classification must be used to properly identify a volcanic rock.
Mineralogic contents – felsic versus mafic

felsic rock, highest content of silicon, with predominance of quartz, alkali feldspar and/or feldspathoids: the felsic minerals; these rocks (e.g., granite, rhyolite) are usually light coloured, and have low density.
mafic rock, lesser content of silicon relative to felsic rocks, with predominance of mafic minerals pyroxenes, olivines and calcic plagioclase; these rocks (example, basalt, gabbro) are usually dark coloured, and have a higher density than felsic rocks.
ultramafic rock, lowest content of silicon, with more than 90% of mafic minerals (e.g., dunite).

For intrusive, plutonic and usually phaneritic igneous rocks (where all minerals are visible at least via microscope), the mineralogy is used to classify the rock. This usually occurs on ternary diagrams, where the relative proportions of three minerals are used to classify the rock.
The following table is a simple subdivision of igneous rocks according to both their composition and mode of occurrence.

Example of classification
Granite is an igneous intrusive rock (crystallized at depth), with felsic composition (rich in silica and predominately quartz plus potassium-rich feldspar plus sodium-rich plagioclase) and phaneritic, subeuhedral texture (minerals are visible to the unaided eye and commonly some of them retain original crystallographic shapes).
Magma origination
The Earth's crust averages about 35 kilometers thick under the continents, but averages only some 7–10 kilometers beneath the oceans. The continental crust is composed primarily of sedimentary rocks resting on a crystalline basement formed of a great variety of metamorphic and igneous rocks, including granulite and granite. Oceanic crust is composed primarily of basalt and gabbro. Both continental and oceanic crust rest on peridotite of the mantle.
Rocks may melt in response to a decrease in pressure, to a change in composition (such as an addition of water), to an increase in temperature, or to a combination of these processes.
Other mechanisms, such as melting from a meteorite impact, are less important today, but impacts during the accretion of the Earth led to extensive melting, and the outer several hundred kilometers of our early Earth was probably an ocean of magma. Impacts of large meteorites in the last few hundred million years have been proposed as one mechanism responsible for the extensive basalt magmatism of several large igneous provinces.
Decompression
Decompression melting occurs because of a decrease in pressure.[7]
The solidus temperatures of most rocks (the temperatures below which they are completely solid) increase with increasing pressure in the absence of water. Peridotite at depth in the Earth's mantle may be hotter than its solidus temperature at some shallower level. If such rock rises during the convection of solid mantle, it will cool slightly as it expands in an adiabatic process, but the cooling is only about 0.3 °C per kilometer. Experimental studies of appropriate peridotite samples document that the solidus temperatures increase by 3 °C to 4 °C per kilometer. If the rock rises far enough, it will begin to melt. Melt droplets can coalesce into larger volumes and be intruded upwards. This process of melting from the upward movement of solid mantle is critical in the evolution of the Earth.
Decompression melting creates the ocean crust at mid-ocean ridges. It also causes volcanism in intraplate regions, such as Europe, Africa and the Pacific sea floor. There, it is variously attributed either to the rise of mantle plumes (the "Plume hypothesis") or to intraplate extension (the "Plate hypothesis").[8]
Effects of water and carbon dioxide
The change of rock composition most responsible for the creation of magma is the addition of water. Water lowers the solidus temperature of rocks at a given pressure. For example, at a depth of about 100 kilometers, peridotite begins to melt near 800 °C in the presence of excess water, but near or above about 1,500 °C in the absence of water.[9] Water is driven out of the oceanic lithosphere in subduction zones, and it causes melting in the overlying mantle. Hydrous magmas composed of basalt and andesite are produced directly and indirectly as results of dehydration during the subduction process. Such magmas, and those derived from them, build up island arcs such as those in the Pacific Ring of Fire. These magmas form rocks of the calc-alkaline series, an important part of the continental crust.
The addition of carbon dioxide is relatively a much less important cause of magma formation than the addition of water, but genesis of some silica-undersaturated magmas has been attributed to the dominance of carbon dioxide over water in their mantle source regions. In the presence of carbon dioxide, experiments document that the peridotite solidus temperature decreases by about 200 °C in a narrow pressure interval at pressures corresponding to a depth of about 70 km. At greater depths, carbon dioxide can have more effect: at depths to about 200 km, the temperatures of initial melting of a carbonated peridotite composition were determined to be 450 °C to 600 °C lower than for the same composition with no carbon dioxide.[10] Magmas of rock types such as nephelinite, carbonatite, and kimberlite are among those that may be generated following an influx of carbon dioxide into mantle at depths greater than about 70 km.
Temperature increase
Increase in temperature is the most typical mechanism for formation of magma within continental crust. Such temperature increases can occur because of the upward intrusion of magma from the mantle. Temperatures can also exceed the solidus of a crustal rock in continental crust thickened by compression at a plate boundary. The plate boundary between the Indian and Asian continental masses provides a well-studied example, as the Tibetan Plateau just north of the boundary has crust about 80 kilometers thick, roughly twice the thickness of normal continental crust. Studies of electrical resistivity deduced from magnetotelluric data have detected a layer that appears to contain silicate melt and that stretches for at least 1,000 kilometers within the middle crust along the southern margin of the Tibetan Plateau.[11] Granite and rhyolite are types of igneous rock commonly interpreted as products of the melting of continental crust because of increases in temperature. Temperature increases also may contribute to the melting of lithosphere dragged down in a subduction zone.
Magma evolution




Schematic diagrams showing the principles behind fractional crystallisation in a magma. While cooling, the magma evolves in composition because different minerals crystallize from the melt. 1: olivine crystallizes; 2: olivine and pyroxene crystallize; 3: pyroxene and plagioclase crystallize; 4: plagioclase crystallizes. At the bottom of the magma reservoir, a cumulate rock forms.




Main article: Igneous differentiation


Most magmas only entirely melt for small parts of their histories. More typically, they are mixes of melt and crystals, and sometimes also of gas bubbles. Melt, crystals, and bubbles usually have different densities, and so they can separate as magmas evolve.
As magma cools, minerals typically crystallize from the melt at different temperatures (fractional crystallization). As minerals crystallize, the composition of the residual melt typically changes. If crystals separate from the melt, then the residual melt will differ in composition from the parent magma. For instance, a magma of gabbroic composition can produce a residual melt of granitic composition if early formed crystals are separated from the magma. Gabbro may have a liquidus temperature near 1,200 °C, and the derivative granite-composition melt may have a liquidus temperature as low as about 700 °C. Incompatible elements are concentrated in the last residues of magma during fractional crystallization and in the first melts produced during partial melting: either process can form the magma that crystallizes to pegmatite, a rock type commonly enriched in incompatible elements. Bowen's reaction series is important for understanding the idealised sequence of fractional crystallisation of a magma.
Magma composition can be determined by processes other than partial melting and fractional crystallization. For instance, magmas commonly interact with rocks they intrude, both by melting those rocks and by reacting with them. Magmas of different compositions can mix with one another. In rare cases, melts can separate into two immiscible melts of contrasting compositions.
There are relatively few minerals that are important in the formation of common igneous rocks, because the magma from which the minerals crystallize is rich in only certain elements: silicon, oxygen, aluminium, sodium, potassium, calcium, iron, and magnesium. These are the elements that combine to form the silicate minerals, which account for over ninety percent of all igneous rocks. The chemistry of igneous rocks is expressed differently for major and minor elements and for trace elements. Contents of major and minor elements are conventionally expressed as weight percent oxides (e.g., 51% SiO2, and 1.50% TiO2). Abundances of trace elements are conventionally expressed as parts per million by weight (e.g., 420 ppm Ni, and 5.1 ppm Sm). The term "trace element" is typically used for elements present in most rocks at abundances less than 100 ppm or so, but some trace elements may be present in some rocks at abundances exceeding 1,000 ppm. The diversity of rock compositions has been defined by a huge mass of analytical data—over 230,000 rock analyses can be accessed on the web through a site sponsored by the U. S. National Science Foundation (see the External Link to EarthChem).
Etymology
The word "igneous" is derived from the Latin ignis, meaning "of fire". Volcanic rocks are named after Vulcan, the Roman name for the god of fire. Intrusive rocks are also called "plutonic" rocks, named after Pluto, the Roman god of the underworld.

Igneous rock (derived from the Latin word ignis meaning fire), or magmatic rock, is one of the three main rock types, the others being sedimentary and metamorphic. Igneous rock is formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. The magma can be derived from partial melts of existing rocks in either a planet's mantle or crust. Typically, the melting is caused by one or more of three processes: an increase in temperature, a decrease in pressure, or a change in composition. Solidification into rock occurs either below the surface as intrusive rocks or on the surface as extrusive rocks. Igneous rock may form with crystallization to form granular, crystalline rocks, or without crystallization to form natural glasses.

Geological significance
Igneous and metamorphic rocks make up 90–95% of the top 16 km of the Earth's crust by volume.[1] Igneous rocks form about 15% of the Earth's current land surface.[note 1] Most of the Earth's oceanic crust is made of igneous rock.
Igneous rocks are also geologically important because:

their minerals and global chemistry give information about the composition of the mantle, from which some igneous rocks are extracted, and the temperature and pressure conditions that allowed this extraction, and/or of other pre-existing rock that melted;
their absolute ages can be obtained from various forms of radiometric dating and thus can be compared to adjacent geological strata, allowing a time sequence of events;
their features are usually characteristic of a specific tectonic environment, allowing tectonic reconstitutions (see plate tectonics);
in some special circumstances they host important mineral deposits (ores): for example, tungsten, tin, and uranium are commonly associated with granites and diorites, whereas ores of chromium and platinum are commonly associated with gabbros.

Geological setting




Forming of igneous rock


In terms of modes of occurrence, igneous rocks can be either intrusive (plutonic and hypabyssal) or extrusive (volcanic).
Intrusive

Intrusive igneous rocks are formed from magma that cools and solidifies within the crust of a planet, surrounded by pre-existing rock (called country rock); the magma cools slowly and, as a result, these rocks are coarse-grained. The mineral grains in such rocks can generally be identified with the naked eye. Intrusive rocks can also be classified according to the shape and size of the intrusive body and its relation to the other formations into which it intrudes. Typical intrusive formations are batholiths, stocks, laccoliths, sills and dikes. When the magma solidifies within the earth's crust, it cools slowly forming coarse textured rocks, such as granite, gabbro, or diorite.
The central cores of major mountain ranges consist of intrusive igneous rocks, usually granite. When exposed by erosion, these cores (called batholiths) may occupy huge areas of the Earth's surface.
Intrusive igneous rocks that form at depth within the crust are termed plutonic (or abyssal) rocks and are usually coarse-grained. Intrusive igneous rocks that form near the surface are termed subvolcanic or hypabyssal rocks and they are usually medium-grained. Hypabyssal rocks are less common than plutonic or volcanic rocks and often form dikes, sills, laccoliths, lopoliths, or phacoliths.
Extrusive




Extrusive igneous rock is made from lava released by volcanoes






Sample of basalt (an extrusive igneous rock), found in Massachusetts


Extrusive igneous rocks, also known as volcanic rocks, are formed at the crust's surface as a result of the partial melting of rocks within the mantle and crust. Extrusive igneous rocks cool and solidify quicker than intrusive igneous rocks. They are formed by the cooling of molten magma on the earth's surface. The magma, which is brought to the surface through fissures or volcanic eruptions, solidifies at a faster rate. Hence such rocks are smooth, crystalline and fine-grained. Basalt is a common extrusive igneous rock and forms lava flows, lava sheets and lava plateaus. Some kinds of basalt solidify to form long polygonal columns. The Giant's Causeway in Antrim, Northern Ireland is an example.
The molten rock, with or without suspended crystals and gas bubbles, is called magma. It rises because it is less dense than the rock from which it was created. When magma reaches the surface from beneath water or air, it is called lava. Eruptions of volcanoes into air are termed subaerial, whereas those occurring underneath the ocean are termed submarine. Black smokers and mid-ocean ridge basalt are examples of submarine volcanic activity.
The volume of extrusive rock erupted annually by volcanoes varies with plate tectonic setting. Extrusive rock is produced in the following proportions:[3]

divergent boundary: 73%
convergent boundary (subduction zone): 15%
hotspot: 12%.

Magma that erupts from a volcano behaves according to its viscosity, determined by temperature, composition, crystal content and the amount of silica. High-temperature magma, most of which is basaltic in composition, behaves in a manner similar to thick oil and, as it cools, treacle. Long, thin basalt flows with pahoehoe surfaces are common. Intermediate composition magma, such as andesite, tends to form cinder cones of intermingled ash, tuff and lava, and may have a viscosity similar to thick, cold molasses or even rubber when erupted. Felsic magma, such as rhyolite, is usually erupted at low temperature and is up to 10,000 times as viscous as basalt. Volcanoes with rhyolitic magma commonly erupt explosively, and rhyolitic lava flows are typically of limited extent and have steep margins, because the magma is so viscous.
Felsic and intermediate magmas that erupt often do so violently, with explosions driven by the release of dissolved gases—typically water vapour, but also carbon dioxide. Explosively erupted pyroclastic material is called tephra and includes tuff, agglomerate and ignimbrite. Fine volcanic ash is also erupted and forms ash tuff deposits, which can often cover vast areas.
Because lava usually cools and crystallizes rapidly, it is usually fine-grained. If the cooling has been so rapid as to prevent the formation of even small crystals after extrusion, the resulting rock may be mostly glass (such as the rock obsidian). If the cooling of the lava happened more slowly, the rock would be coarse-grained.
Because the minerals are mostly fine-grained, it is much more difficult to distinguish between the different types of extrusive igneous rocks than between different types of intrusive igneous rocks. Generally, the mineral constituents of fine-grained extrusive igneous rocks can only be determined by examination of thin sections of the rock under a microscope, so only an approximate classification can usually be made in the field.
Classification
Igneous rocks are classified according to mode of occurrence, texture, mineralogy, chemical composition, and the geometry of the igneous body.
The classification of the many types of different igneous rocks can provide us with important information about the conditions under which they formed. Two important variables used for the classification of igneous rocks are particle size, which largely depends on the cooling history, and the mineral composition of the rock. Feldspars, quartz or feldspathoids, olivines, pyroxenes, amphiboles, and micas are all important minerals in the formation of almost all igneous rocks, and they are basic to the classification of these rocks. All other minerals present are regarded as nonessential in almost all igneous rocks and are called accessory minerals. Types of igneous rocks with other essential minerals are very rare, and these rare rocks include those with essential carbonates.
In a simplified classification, igneous rock types are separated on the basis of the type of feldspar present, the presence or absence of quartz, and in rocks with no feldspar or quartz, the type of iron or magnesium minerals present. Rocks containing quartz (silica in composition) are silica-oversaturated. Rocks with feldspathoids are silica-undersaturated, because feldspathoids cannot coexist in a stable association with quartz.
Igneous rocks that have crystals large enough to be seen by the naked eye are called phaneritic; those with crystals too small to be seen are called aphanitic. Generally speaking, phaneritic implies an intrusive origin; aphanitic an extrusive one.
An igneous rock with larger, clearly discernible crystals embedded in a finer-grained matrix is termed porphyry. Porphyritic texture develops when some of the crystals grow to considerable size before the main mass of the magma crystallizes as finer-grained, uniform material.
Igneous rocks are classified on the basis of texture and composition. Texture refers to the size, shape, and arrangement of the mineral grains or crystals of which the rock is composed.
Texture

Main article: Rock microstructure
Texture is an important criterion for the naming of volcanic rocks. The texture of volcanic rocks, including the size, shape, orientation, and distribution of mineral grains and the intergrain relationships, will determine whether the rock is termed a tuff, a pyroclastic lava or a simple lava.
However, the texture is only a subordinate part of classifying volcanic rocks, as most often there needs to be chemical information gleaned from rocks with extremely fine-grained groundmass or from airfall tuffs, which may be formed from volcanic ash.
Textural criteria are less critical in classifying intrusive rocks where the majority of minerals will be visible to the naked eye or at least using a hand lens, magnifying glass or microscope. Plutonic rocks also tend to be less texturally varied and less prone to gaining structural fabrics. Textural terms can be used to differentiate different intrusive phases of large plutons, for instance porphyritic margins to large intrusive bodies, porphyry stocks and subvolcanic dikes (apophyses). Mineralogical classification is most often used to classify plutonic rocks. Chemical classifications are preferred to classify volcanic rocks, with phenocryst species used as a prefix, e.g. "olivine-bearing picrite" or "orthoclase-phyric rhyolite".

Basic classification scheme for igneous rocks on their mineralogy. If the approximate volume fractions of minerals in the rock are known, the rock name and silica content can be read off the diagram. This is not an exact method, because the classification of igneous rocks also depends on other components than silica, yet in most cases it is a good first guess.


Chemical classification and Petrology




Total alkali versus silica classification scheme (TAS) as proposed in Le Maitre's 2002 Igneous Rocks - A classification and glossary of terms[4]:237


Igneous rocks can be classified according to chemical or mineralogical parameters.
Chemical: total alkali-silica content (TAS diagram) for volcanic rock classification used when modal or mineralogic data is unavailable:

felsic igneous rocks containing a high silica content, greater than 63% SiO2 (examples granite and rhyolite)
intermediate igneous rocks containing between 52 – 63% SiO2 (example andesite and dacite)
mafic igneous rocks have low silica 45 – 52% and typically high iron – magnesium content (example gabbro and basalt)
ultramafic rock igneous rocks with less than 45% silica. (examples picrite, komatiite and peridotite)
alkalic igneous rocks with 5 – 15% alkali (K2O + Na2O) content or with a molar ratio of alkali to silica greater than 1:6. (examples phonolite and trachyte)

Chemical classification also extends to differentiating rocks that are chemically similar according to the TAS diagram, for instance;

Ultrapotassic; rocks containing molar K2O/Na2O >3
Peralkaline; rocks containing molar (K2O + Na2O)/ Al2O3 >1
Peraluminous; rocks containing molar (K2O + Na2O)/ Al2O3 <1

An idealized mineralogy (the normative mineralogy) can be calculated from the chemical composition, and the calculation is useful for rocks too fine-grained or too altered for identification of minerals that crystallized from the melt. For instance, normative quartz classifies a rock as silica-oversaturated; an example is rhyolite. In an older terminology, silica oversaturated rocks were called silicic or acidic where the SiO2 was greater than 66% and the family term quartzolite was applied to the most silicic. A normative feldspathoid classifies a rock as silica-undersaturated; an example is nephelinite.
History of classification
In 1902, a group of American petrographers proposed that all existing classifications of igneous rocks should be discarded and replaced by a "quantitative" classification based on chemical analysis. They showed how vague, and often unscientific, much of the existing terminology was and argued that as the chemical composition of an igneous rock was its most fundamental characteristic, it should be elevated to prime position.
Geological occurrence, structure, mineralogical constitution—the hitherto accepted criteria for the discrimination of rock species—were relegated to the background. The completed rock analysis is first to be interpreted in terms of the rock-forming minerals which might be expected to be formed when the magma crystallizes, e.g., quartz feldspars, olivine, akermannite, Feldspathoids, magnetite, corundum, and so on, and the rocks are divided into groups strictly according to the relative proportion of these minerals to one another.[5][6]
Mineralogical classification
For volcanic rocks, mineralogy is important in classifying and naming lavas. The most important criterion is the phenocryst species, followed by the groundmass mineralogy. Often, where the groundmass is aphanitic, chemical classification must be used to properly identify a volcanic rock.
Mineralogic contents – felsic versus mafic

felsic rock, highest content of silicon, with predominance of quartz, alkali feldspar and/or feldspathoids: the felsic minerals; these rocks (e.g., granite, rhyolite) are usually light coloured, and have low density.
mafic rock, lesser content of silicon relative to felsic rocks, with predominance of mafic minerals pyroxenes, olivines and calcic plagioclase; these rocks (example, basalt, gabbro) are usually dark coloured, and have a higher density than felsic rocks.
ultramafic rock, lowest content of silicon, with more than 90% of mafic minerals (e.g., dunite).

For intrusive, plutonic and usually phaneritic igneous rocks (where all minerals are visible at least via microscope), the mineralogy is used to classify the rock. This usually occurs on ternary diagrams, where the relative proportions of three minerals are used to classify the rock.
The following table is a simple subdivision of igneous rocks according to both their composition and mode of occurrence.

Example of classification
Granite is an igneous intrusive rock (crystallized at depth), with felsic composition (rich in silica and predominately quartz plus potassium-rich feldspar plus sodium-rich plagioclase) and phaneritic, subeuhedral texture (minerals are visible to the unaided eye and commonly some of them retain original crystallographic shapes).
Magma origination
The Earth's crust averages about 35 kilometers thick under the continents, but averages only some 7–10 kilometers beneath the oceans. The continental crust is composed primarily of sedimentary rocks resting on a crystalline basement formed of a great variety of metamorphic and igneous rocks, including granulite and granite. Oceanic crust is composed primarily of basalt and gabbro. Both continental and oceanic crust rest on peridotite of the mantle.
Rocks may melt in response to a decrease in pressure, to a change in composition (such as an addition of water), to an increase in temperature, or to a combination of these processes.
Other mechanisms, such as melting from a meteorite impact, are less important today, but impacts during the accretion of the Earth led to extensive melting, and the outer several hundred kilometers of our early Earth was probably an ocean of magma. Impacts of large meteorites in the last few hundred million years have been proposed as one mechanism responsible for the extensive basalt magmatism of several large igneous provinces.
Decompression
Decompression melting occurs because of a decrease in pressure.[7]
The solidus temperatures of most rocks (the temperatures below which they are completely solid) increase with increasing pressure in the absence of water. Peridotite at depth in the Earth's mantle may be hotter than its solidus temperature at some shallower level. If such rock rises during the convection of solid mantle, it will cool slightly as it expands in an adiabatic process, but the cooling is only about 0.3 °C per kilometer. Experimental studies of appropriate peridotite samples document that the solidus temperatures increase by 3 °C to 4 °C per kilometer. If the rock rises far enough, it will begin to melt. Melt droplets can coalesce into larger volumes and be intruded upwards. This process of melting from the upward movement of solid mantle is critical in the evolution of the Earth.
Decompression melting creates the ocean crust at mid-ocean ridges. It also causes volcanism in intraplate regions, such as Europe, Africa and the Pacific sea floor. There, it is variously attributed either to the rise of mantle plumes (the "Plume hypothesis") or to intraplate extension (the "Plate hypothesis").[8]
Effects of water and carbon dioxide
The change of rock composition most responsible for the creation of magma is the addition of water. Water lowers the solidus temperature of rocks at a given pressure. For example, at a depth of about 100 kilometers, peridotite begins to melt near 800 °C in the presence of excess water, but near or above about 1,500 °C in the absence of water.[9] Water is driven out of the oceanic lithosphere in subduction zones, and it causes melting in the overlying mantle. Hydrous magmas composed of basalt and andesite are produced directly and indirectly as results of dehydration during the subduction process. Such magmas, and those derived from them, build up island arcs such as those in the Pacific Ring of Fire. These magmas form rocks of the calc-alkaline series, an important part of the continental crust.
The addition of carbon dioxide is relatively a much less important cause of magma formation than the addition of water, but genesis of some silica-undersaturated magmas has been attributed to the dominance of carbon dioxide over water in their mantle source regions. In the presence of carbon dioxide, experiments document that the peridotite solidus temperature decreases by about 200 °C in a narrow pressure interval at pressures corresponding to a depth of about 70 km. At greater depths, carbon dioxide can have more effect: at depths to about 200 km, the temperatures of initial melting of a carbonated peridotite composition were determined to be 450 °C to 600 °C lower than for the same composition with no carbon dioxide.[10] Magmas of rock types such as nephelinite, carbonatite, and kimberlite are among those that may be generated following an influx of carbon dioxide into mantle at depths greater than about 70 km.
Temperature increase
Increase in temperature is the most typical mechanism for formation of magma within continental crust. Such temperature increases can occur because of the upward intrusion of magma from the mantle. Temperatures can also exceed the solidus of a crustal rock in continental crust thickened by compression at a plate boundary. The plate boundary between the Indian and Asian continental masses provides a well-studied example, as the Tibetan Plateau just north of the boundary has crust about 80 kilometers thick, roughly twice the thickness of normal continental crust. Studies of electrical resistivity deduced from magnetotelluric data have detected a layer that appears to contain silicate melt and that stretches for at least 1,000 kilometers within the middle crust along the southern margin of the Tibetan Plateau.[11] Granite and rhyolite are types of igneous rock commonly interpreted as products of the melting of continental crust because of increases in temperature. Temperature increases also may contribute to the melting of lithosphere dragged down in a subduction zone.
Magma evolution

While cooling, the magma evolves in composition because different minerals crystallize from the melt. 1: olivine crystallizes; 2: olivine and pyroxene crystallize; 3: pyroxene and plagioclase crystallize; 4: plagioclase crystallizes. At the bottom of the magma reservoir, a cumulate rock forms.




Main article: Igneous differentiation


Most magmas only entirely melt for small parts of their histories. More typically, they are mixes of melt and crystals, and sometimes also of gas bubbles. Melt, crystals, and bubbles usually have different densities, and so they can separate as magmas evolve.
As magma cools, minerals typically crystallize from the melt at different temperatures (fractional crystallization). As minerals crystallize, the composition of the residual melt typically changes. If crystals separate from the melt, then the residual melt will differ in composition from the parent magma. For instance, a magma of gabbroic composition can produce a residual melt of granitic composition if early formed crystals are separated from the magma. Gabbro may have a liquidus temperature near 1,200 °C, and the derivative granite-composition melt may have a liquidus temperature as low as about 700 °C. Incompatible elements are concentrated in the last residues of magma during fractional crystallization and in the first melts produced during partial melting: either process can form the magma that crystallizes to pegmatite, a rock type commonly enriched in incompatible elements. Bowen's reaction series is important for understanding the idealised sequence of fractional crystallisation of a magma.
Magma composition can be determined by processes other than partial melting and fractional crystallization. For instance, magmas commonly interact with rocks they intrude, both by melting those rocks and by reacting with them. Magmas of different compositions can mix with one another. In rare cases, melts can separate into two immiscible melts of contrasting compositions.
There are relatively few minerals that are important in the formation of common igneous rocks, because the magma from which the minerals crystallize is rich in only certain elements: silicon, oxygen, aluminium, sodium, potassium, calcium, iron, and magnesium. These are the elements that combine to form the silicate minerals, which account for over ninety percent of all igneous rocks. The chemistry of igneous rocks is expressed differently for major and minor elements and for trace elements. Contents of major and minor elements are conventionally expressed as weight percent oxides (e.g., 51% SiO2, and 1.50% TiO2). Abundances of trace elements are conventionally expressed as parts per million by weight (e.g., 420 ppm Ni, and 5.1 ppm Sm). The term "trace element" is typically used for elements present in most rocks at abundances less than 100 ppm or so, but some trace elements may be present in some rocks at abundances exceeding 1,000 ppm. The diversity of rock compositions has been defined by a huge mass of analytical data—over 230,000 rock analyses can be accessed on the web through a site sponsored by the U. S. National Science Foundation (see the External Link to EarthChem).
Etymology
The word "igneous" is derived from the Latin ignis, meaning "of fire". Volcanic rocks are named after Vulcan, the Roman name for the god of fire. Intrusive rocks are also called "plutonic" rocks, named after Pluto, the Roman god of the underworld.

Igneous rock (derived from the Latin word ignis meaning fire), or magmatic rock, is one of the three main rock types, the others being sedimentary and metamorphic. Igneous rock is formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. The magma can be derived from partial melts of existing rocks in either a planet's mantle or crust. Typically, the melting is caused by one or more of three processes: an increase in temperature, a decrease in pressure, or a change in composition. Solidification into rock occurs either below the surface as intrusive rocks or on the surface as extrusive rocks. Igneous rock may form with crystallization to form granular, crystalline rocks, or without crystallization to form natural glasses.

Geological significance
Igneous and metamorphic rocks make up 90–95% of the top 16 km of the Earth's crust by volume.[1] Igneous rocks form about 15% of the Earth's current land surface.[note 1] Most of the Earth's oceanic crust is made of igneous rock.
Igneous rocks are also geologically important because:

their minerals and global chemistry give information about the composition of the mantle, from which some igneous rocks are extracted, and the temperature and pressure conditions that allowed this extraction, and/or of other pre-existing rock that melted;
their absolute ages can be obtained from various forms of radiometric dating and thus can be compared to adjacent geological strata, allowing a time sequence of events;
their features are usually characteristic of a specific tectonic environment, allowing tectonic reconstitutions (see plate tectonics);
in some special circumstances they host important mineral deposits (ores): for example, tungsten, tin, and uranium are commonly associated with granites and diorites, whereas ores of chromium and platinum are commonly associated with gabbros.

Geological setting




Forming of igneous rock


In terms of modes of occurrence, igneous rocks can be either intrusive (plutonic and hypabyssal) or extrusive (volcanic).
Intrusive

Intrusive igneous rocks are formed from magma that cools and solidifies within the crust of a planet, surrounded by pre-existing rock (called country rock); the magma cools slowly and, as a result, these rocks are coarse-grained. The mineral grains in such rocks can generally be identified with the naked eye. Intrusive rocks can also be classified according to the shape and size of the intrusive body and its relation to the other formations into which it intrudes. Typical intrusive formations are batholiths, stocks, laccoliths, sills and dikes. When the magma solidifies within the earth's crust, it cools slowly forming coarse textured rocks, such as granite, gabbro, or diorite.
The central cores of major mountain ranges consist of intrusive igneous rocks, usually granite. When exposed by erosion, these cores (called batholiths) may occupy huge areas of the Earth's surface.
Intrusive igneous rocks that form at depth within the crust are termed plutonic (or abyssal) rocks and are usually coarse-grained. Intrusive igneous rocks that form near the surface are termed subvolcanic or hypabyssal rocks and they are usually medium-grained. Hypabyssal rocks are less common than plutonic or volcanic rocks and often form dikes, sills, laccoliths, lopoliths, or phacoliths.
Extrusive




Extrusive igneous rock is made from lava released by volcanoes






Sample of basalt (an extrusive igneous rock), found in Massachusetts


Extrusive igneous rocks, also known as volcanic rocks, are formed at the crust's surface as a result of the partial melting of rocks within the mantle and crust. Extrusive igneous rocks cool and solidify quicker than intrusive igneous rocks. They are formed by the cooling of molten magma on the earth's surface. The magma, which is brought to the surface through fissures or volcanic eruptions, solidifies at a faster rate. Hence such rocks are smooth, crystalline and fine-grained. Basalt is a common extrusive igneous rock and forms lava flows, lava sheets and lava plateaus. Some kinds of basalt solidify to form long polygonal columns. The Giant's Causeway in Antrim, Northern Ireland is an example.
The molten rock, with or without suspended crystals and gas bubbles, is called magma. It rises because it is less dense than the rock from which it was created. When magma reaches the surface from beneath water or air, it is called lava. Eruptions of volcanoes into air are termed subaerial, whereas those occurring underneath the ocean are termed submarine. Black smokers and mid-ocean ridge basalt are examples of submarine volcanic activity.
The volume of extrusive rock erupted annually by volcanoes varies with plate tectonic setting. Extrusive rock is produced in the following proportions:[3]

divergent boundary: 73%
convergent boundary (subduction zone): 15%
hotspot: 12%.

Magma that erupts from a volcano behaves according to its viscosity, determined by temperature, composition, crystal content and the amount of silica. High-temperature magma, most of which is basaltic in composition, behaves in a manner similar to thick oil and, as it cools, treacle. Long, thin basalt flows with pahoehoe surfaces are common. Intermediate composition magma, such as andesite, tends to form cinder cones of intermingled ash, tuff and lava, and may have a viscosity similar to thick, cold molasses or even rubber when erupted. Felsic magma, such as rhyolite, is usually erupted at low temperature and is up to 10,000 times as viscous as basalt. Volcanoes with rhyolitic magma commonly erupt explosively, and rhyolitic lava flows are typically of limited extent and have steep margins, because the magma is so viscous.
Felsic and intermediate magmas that erupt often do so violently, with explosions driven by the release of dissolved gases—typically water vapour, but also carbon dioxide. Explosively erupted pyroclastic material is called tephra and includes tuff, agglomerate and ignimbrite. Fine volcanic ash is also erupted and forms ash tuff deposits, which can often cover vast areas.
Because lava usually cools and crystallizes rapidly, it is usually fine-grained. If the cooling has been so rapid as to prevent the formation of even small crystals after extrusion, the resulting rock may be mostly glass (such as the rock obsidian). If the cooling of the lava happened more slowly, the rock would be coarse-grained.
Because the minerals are mostly fine-grained, it is much more difficult to distinguish between the different types of extrusive igneous rocks than between different types of intrusive igneous rocks. Generally, the mineral constituents of fine-grained extrusive igneous rocks can only be determined by examination of thin sections of the rock under a microscope, so only an approximate classification can usually be made in the field.
Classification
Igneous rocks are classified according to mode of occurrence, texture, mineralogy, chemical composition, and the geometry of the igneous body.
The classification of the many types of different igneous rocks can provide us with important information about the conditions under which they formed. Two important variables used for the classification of igneous rocks are particle size, which largely depends on the cooling history, and the mineral composition of the rock. Feldspars, quartz or feldspathoids, olivines, pyroxenes, amphiboles, and micas are all important minerals in the formation of almost all igneous rocks, and they are basic to the classification of these rocks. All other minerals present are regarded as nonessential in almost all igneous rocks and are called accessory minerals. Types of igneous rocks with other essential minerals are very rare, and these rare rocks include those with essential carbonates.
In a simplified classification, igneous rock types are separated on the basis of the type of feldspar present, the presence or absence of quartz, and in rocks with no feldspar or quartz, the type of iron or magnesium minerals present. Rocks containing quartz (silica in composition) are silica-oversaturated. Rocks with feldspathoids are silica-undersaturated, because feldspathoids cannot coexist in a stable association with quartz.
Igneous rocks that have crystals large enough to be seen by the naked eye are called phaneritic; those with crystals too small to be seen are called aphanitic. Generally speaking, phaneritic implies an intrusive origin; aphanitic an extrusive one.
An igneous rock with larger, clearly discernible crystals embedded in a finer-grained matrix is termed porphyry. Porphyritic texture develops when some of the crystals grow to considerable size before the main mass of the magma crystallizes as finer-grained, uniform material.
Igneous rocks are classified on the basis of texture and composition. Texture refers to the size, shape, and arrangement of the mineral grains or crystals of which the rock is composed.
Texture

Main article: Rock microstructure
Texture is an important criterion for the naming of volcanic rocks. The texture of volcanic rocks, including the size, shape, orientation, and distribution of mineral grains and the intergrain relationships, will determine whether the rock is termed a tuff, a pyroclastic lava or a simple lava.
However, the texture is only a subordinate part of classifying volcanic rocks, as most often there needs to be chemical information gleaned from rocks with extremely fine-grained groundmass or from airfall tuffs, which may be formed from volcanic ash.
Textural criteria are less critical in classifying intrusive rocks where the majority of minerals will be visible to the naked eye or at least using a hand lens, magnifying glass or microscope. Plutonic rocks also tend to be less texturally varied and less prone to gaining structural fabrics. Textural terms can be used to differentiate different intrusive phases of large plutons, for instance porphyritic margins to large intrusive bodies, porphyry stocks and subvolcanic dikes (apophyses). Mineralogical classification is most often used to classify plutonic rocks. Chemical classifications are preferred to classify volcanic rocks, with phenocryst species used as a prefix, e.g. "olivine-bearing picrite" or "orthoclase-phyric rhyolite".

Basic classification scheme for igneous rocks on their mineralogy. If the approximate volume fractions of minerals in the rock are known, the rock name and silica content can be read off the diagram. This is not an exact method, because the classification of igneous rocks also depends on other components than silica, yet in most cases it is a good first guess.


Chemical classification and Petrology




Total alkali versus silica classification scheme (TAS) as proposed in Le Maitre's 2002 Igneous Rocks - A classification and glossary of terms[4]:237


Igneous rocks can be classified according to chemical or mineralogical parameters.
Chemical: total alkali-silica content (TAS diagram) for volcanic rock classification used when modal or mineralogic data is unavailable:

felsic igneous rocks containing a high silica content, greater than 63% SiO2 (examples granite and rhyolite)
intermediate igneous rocks containing between 52 – 63% SiO2 (example andesite and dacite)
mafic igneous rocks have low silica 45 – 52% and typically high iron – magnesium content (example gabbro and basalt)
ultramafic rock igneous rocks with less than 45% silica. (examples picrite, komatiite and peridotite)
alkalic igneous rocks with 5 – 15% alkali (K2O + Na2O) content or with a molar ratio of alkali to silica greater than 1:6. (examples phonolite and trachyte)

Chemical classification also extends to differentiating rocks that are chemically similar according to the TAS diagram, for instance;

Ultrapotassic; rocks containing molar K2O/Na2O >3
Peralkaline; rocks containing molar (K2O + Na2O)/ Al2O3 >1
Peraluminous; rocks containing molar (K2O + Na2O)/ Al2O3 <1

An idealized mineralogy (the normative mineralogy) can be calculated from the chemical composition, and the calculation is useful for rocks too fine-grained or too altered for identification of minerals that crystallized from the melt. For instance, normative quartz classifies a rock as silica-oversaturated; an example is rhyolite. In an older terminology, silica oversaturated rocks were called silicic or acidic where the SiO2 was greater than 66% and the family term quartzolite was applied to the most silicic. A normative feldspathoid classifies a rock as silica-undersaturated; an example is nephelinite.
History of classification
In 1902, a group of American petrographers proposed that all existing classifications of igneous rocks should be discarded and replaced by a "quantitative" classification based on chemical analysis. They showed how vague, and often unscientific, much of the existing terminology was and argued that as the chemical composition of an igneous rock was its most fundamental characteristic, it should be elevated to prime position.
Geological occurrence, structure, mineralogical constitution—the hitherto accepted criteria for the discrimination of rock species—were relegated to the background. The completed rock analysis is first to be interpreted in terms of the rock-forming minerals which might be expected to be formed when the magma crystallizes, e.g., quartz feldspars, olivine, akermannite, Feldspathoids, magnetite, corundum, and so on, and the rocks are divided into groups strictly according to the relative proportion of these minerals to one another.[5][6]
Mineralogical classification
For volcanic rocks, mineralogy is important in classifying and naming lavas. The most important criterion is the phenocryst species, followed by the groundmass mineralogy. Often, where the groundmass is aphanitic, chemical classification must be used to properly identify a volcanic rock.

felsic rock, highest content of silicon, with predominance of quartz, alkali feldspar and/or feldspathoids: the felsic minerals; these rocks (e.g., granite, rhyolite) are usually light coloured, and have low density.
mafic rock, lesser content of silicon relative to felsic rocks, with predominance of mafic minerals pyroxenes, olivines and calcic plagioclase; these rocks (example, basalt, gabbro) are usually dark coloured, and have a higher density than felsic rocks.
ultramafic rock, lowest content of silicon, with more than 90% of mafic minerals (e.g., dunite).

For intrusive, plutonic and usually phaneritic igneous rocks (where all minerals are visible at least via microscope), the mineralogy is used to classify the rock. This usually occurs on ternary diagrams, where the relative proportions of three minerals are used to classify the rock.
The following table is a simple subdivision of igneous rocks according to both their composition and mode of occurrence.

Example of classification
Granite is an igneous intrusive rock (crystallized at depth), with felsic composition (rich in silica and predominately quartz plus potassium-rich feldspar plus sodium-rich plagioclase) and phaneritic, subeuhedral texture (minerals are visible to the unaided eye and commonly some of them retain original crystallographic shapes).
Magma origination
The Earth's crust averages about 35 kilometers thick under the continents, but averages only some 7–10 kilometers beneath the oceans. The continental crust is composed primarily of sedimentary rocks resting on a crystalline basement formed of a great variety of metamorphic and igneous rocks, including granulite and granite. Oceanic crust is composed primarily of basalt and gabbro. Both continental and oceanic crust rest on peridotite of the mantle.
Rocks may melt in response to a decrease in pressure, to a change in composition (such as an addition of water), to an increase in temperature, or to a combination of these processes.
Other mechanisms, such as melting from a meteorite impact, are less important today, but impacts during the accretion of the Earth led to extensive melting, and the outer several hundred kilometers of our early Earth was probably an ocean of magma. Impacts of large meteorites in the last few hundred million years have been proposed as one mechanism responsible for the extensive basalt magmatism of several large igneous provinces.
Decompression
Decompression melting occurs because of a decrease in pressure.[7]
The solidus temperatures of most rocks (the temperatures below which they are completely solid) increase with increasing pressure in the absence of water. Peridotite at depth in the Earth's mantle may be hotter than its solidus temperature at some shallower level. If such rock rises during the convection of solid mantle, it will cool slightly as it expands in an adiabatic process, but the cooling is only about 0.3 °C per kilometer. Experimental studies of appropriate peridotite samples document that the solidus temperatures increase by 3 °C to 4 °C per kilometer. If the rock rises far enough, it will begin to melt. Melt droplets can coalesce into larger volumes and be intruded upwards. This process of melting from the upward movement of solid mantle is critical in the evolution of the Earth.
Decompression melting creates the ocean crust at mid-ocean ridges. It also causes volcanism in intraplate regions, such as Europe, Africa and the Pacific sea floor. There, it is variously attributed either to the rise of mantle plumes (the "Plume hypothesis") or to intraplate extension (the "Plate hypothesis").[8]
Effects of water and carbon dioxide
The change of rock composition most responsible for the creation of magma is the addition of water. Water lowers the solidus temperature of rocks at a given pressure. For example, at a depth of about 100 kilometers, peridotite begins to melt near 800 °C in the presence of excess water, but near or above about 1,500 °C in the absence of water.[9] Water is driven out of the oceanic lithosphere in subduction zones, and it causes melting in the overlying mantle. Hydrous magmas composed of basalt and andesite are produced directly and indirectly as results of dehydration during the subduction process. Such magmas, and those derived from them, build up island arcs such as those in the Pacific Ring of Fire. These magmas form rocks of the calc-alkaline series, an important part of the continental crust.
The addition of carbon dioxide is relatively a much less important cause of magma formation than the addition of water, but genesis of some silica-undersaturated magmas has been attributed to the dominance of carbon dioxide over water in their mantle source regions. In the presence of carbon dioxide, experiments document that the peridotite solidus temperature decreases by about 200 °C in a narrow pressure interval at pressures corresponding to a depth of about 70 km. At greater depths, carbon dioxide can have more effect: at depths to about 200 km, the temperatures of initial melting of a carbonated peridotite composition were determined to be 450 °C to 600 °C lower than for the same composition with no carbon dioxide.[10] Magmas of rock types such as nephelinite, carbonatite, and kimberlite are among those that may be generated following an influx of carbon dioxide into mantle at depths greater than about 70 km.
Temperature increase
Increase in temperature is the most typical mechanism for formation of magma within continental crust. Such temperature increases can occur because of the upward intrusion of magma from the mantle. Temperatures can also exceed the solidus of a crustal rock in continental crust thickened by compression at a plate boundary. The plate boundary between the Indian and Asian continental masses provides a well-studied example, as the Tibetan Plateau just north of the boundary has crust about 80 kilometers thick, roughly twice the thickness of normal continental crust. Studies of electrical resistivity deduced from magnetotelluric data have detected a layer that appears to contain silicate melt and that stretches for at least 1,000 kilometers within the middle crust along the southern margin of the Tibetan Plateau.[11] Granite and rhyolite are types of igneous rock commonly interpreted as products of the melting of continental crust because of increases in temperature. Temperature increases also may contribute to the melting of lithosphere dragged down in a subduction zone.
Magma evolution

While cooling, the magma evolves in composition because different minerals crystallize from the melt. 1: olivine crystallizes; 2: olivine and pyroxene crystallize; 3: pyroxene and plagioclase crystallize; 4: plagioclase crystallizes. At the bottom of the magma reservoir, a cumulate rock forms.




Main article: Igneous differentiation


Most magmas only entirely melt for small parts of their histories. More typically, they are mixes of melt and crystals, and sometimes also of gas bubbles. Melt, crystals, and bubbles usually have different densities, and so they can separate as magmas evolve.
As magma cools, minerals typically crystallize from the melt at different temperatures (fractional crystallization). As minerals crystallize, the composition of the residual melt typically changes. If crystals separate from the melt, then the residual melt will differ in composition from the parent magma. For instance, a magma of gabbroic composition can produce a residual melt of granitic composition if early formed crystals are separated from the magma. Gabbro may have a liquidus temperature near 1,200 °C, and the derivative granite-composition melt may have a liquidus temperature as low as about 700 °C. Incompatible elements are concentrated in the last residues of magma during fractional crystallization and in the first melts produced during partial melting: either process can form the magma that crystallizes to pegmatite, a rock type commonly enriched in incompatible elements. Bowen's reaction series is important for understanding the idealised sequence of fractional crystallisation of a magma.
Magma composition can be determined by processes other than partial melting and fractional crystallization. For instance, magmas commonly interact with rocks they intrude, both by melting those rocks and by reacting with them. Magmas of different compositions can mix with one another. In rare cases, melts can separate into two immiscible melts of contrasting compositions.
There are relatively few minerals that are important in the formation of common igneous rocks, because the magma from which the minerals crystallize is rich in only certain elements: silicon, oxygen, aluminium, sodium, potassium, calcium, iron, and magnesium. These are the elements that combine to form the silicate minerals, which account for over ninety percent of all igneous rocks. The chemistry of igneous rocks is expressed differently for major and minor elements and for trace elements. Contents of major and minor elements are conventionally expressed as weight percent oxides (e.g., 51% SiO2, and 1.50% TiO2). Abundances of trace elements are conventionally expressed as parts per million by weight (e.g., 420 ppm Ni, and 5.1 ppm Sm). The term "trace element" is typically used for elements present in most rocks at abundances less than 100 ppm or so, but some trace elements may be present in some rocks at abundances exceeding 1,000 ppm. The diversity of rock compositions has been defined by a huge mass of analytical data—over 230,000 rock analyses can be accessed on the web through a site sponsored by the U. S. National Science Foundation (see the External Link to EarthChem).
Etymology
The word "igneous" is derived from the Latin ignis, meaning "of fire". Volcanic rocks are named after Vulcan, the Roman name for the god of fire. Intrusive rocks are also called "plutonic" rocks, named after Pluto, the Roman god of the underworld.

Igneous rock (derived from the Latin word ignis meaning fire), or magmatic rock, is one of the three main rock types, the others being sedimentary and metamorphic. Igneous rock is formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. The magma can be derived from partial melts of existing rocks in either a planet's mantle or crust. Typically, the melting is caused by one or more of three processes: an increase in temperature, a decrease in pressure, or a change in composition. Solidification into rock occurs either below the surface as intrusive rocks or on the surface as extrusive rocks. Igneous rock may form with crystallization to form granular, crystalline rocks, or without crystallization to form natural glasses.

Geological significance
Igneous and metamorphic rocks make up 90–95% of the top 16 km of the Earth's crust by volume.[1] Igneous rocks form about 15% of the Earth's current land surface.[note 1] Most of the Earth's oceanic crust is made of igneous rock.
Igneous rocks are also geologically important because:

their minerals and global chemistry give information about the composition of the mantle, from which some igneous rocks are extracted, and the temperature and pressure conditions that allowed this extraction, and/or of other pre-existing rock that melted;
their absolute ages can be obtained from various forms of radiometric dating and thus can be compared to adjacent geological strata, allowing a time sequence of events;
their features are usually characteristic of a specific tectonic environment, allowing tectonic reconstitutions (see plate tectonics);
in some special circumstances they host important mineral deposits (ores): for example, tungsten, tin, and uranium are commonly associated with granites and diorites, whereas ores of chromium and platinum are commonly associated with gabbros.

Geological setting




Forming of igneous rock


In terms of modes of occurrence, igneous rocks can be either intrusive (plutonic and hypabyssal) or extrusive (volcanic).
Intrusive

Intrusive igneous rocks are formed from magma that cools and solidifies within the crust of a planet, surrounded by pre-existing rock (called country rock); the magma cools slowly and, as a result, these rocks are coarse-grained. The mineral grains in such rocks can generally be identified with the naked eye. Intrusive rocks can also be classified according to the shape and size of the intrusive body and its relation to the other formations into which it intrudes. Typical intrusive formations are batholiths, stocks, laccoliths, sills and dikes. When the magma solidifies within the earth's crust, it cools slowly forming coarse textured rocks, such as granite, gabbro, or diorite.
The central cores of major mountain ranges consist of intrusive igneous rocks, usually granite. When exposed by erosion, these cores (called batholiths) may occupy huge areas of the Earth's surface.
Intrusive igneous rocks that form at depth within the crust are termed plutonic (or abyssal) rocks and are usually coarse-grained. Intrusive igneous rocks that form near the surface are termed subvolcanic or hypabyssal rocks and they are usually medium-grained. Hypabyssal rocks are less common than plutonic or volcanic rocks and often form dikes, sills, laccoliths, lopoliths, or phacoliths.
Extrusive




Extrusive igneous rock is made from lava released by volcanoes






Sample of basalt (an extrusive igneous rock), found in Massachusetts


Extrusive igneous rocks, also known as volcanic rocks, are formed at the crust's surface as a result of the partial melting of rocks within the mantle and crust. Extrusive igneous rocks cool and solidify quicker than intrusive igneous rocks. They are formed by the cooling of molten magma on the earth's surface. The magma, which is brought to the surface through fissures or volcanic eruptions, solidifies at a faster rate. Hence such rocks are smooth, crystalline and fine-grained. Basalt is a common extrusive igneous rock and forms lava flows, lava sheets and lava plateaus. Some kinds of basalt solidify to form long polygonal columns. The Giant's Causeway in Antrim, Northern Ireland is an example.
The molten rock, with or without suspended crystals and gas bubbles, is called magma. It rises because it is less dense than the rock from which it was created. When magma reaches the surface from beneath water or air, it is called lava. Eruptions of volcanoes into air are termed subaerial, whereas those occurring underneath the ocean are termed submarine. Black smokers and mid-ocean ridge basalt are examples of submarine volcanic activity.
The volume of extrusive rock erupted annually by volcanoes varies with plate tectonic setting. Extrusive rock is produced in the following proportions:[3]

divergent boundary: 73%
convergent boundary (subduction zone): 15%
hotspot: 12%.

Magma that erupts from a volcano behaves according to its viscosity, determined by temperature, composition, crystal content and the amount of silica. High-temperature magma, most of which is basaltic in composition, behaves in a manner similar to thick oil and, as it cools, treacle. Long, thin basalt flows with pahoehoe surfaces are common. Intermediate composition magma, such as andesite, tends to form cinder cones of intermingled ash, tuff and lava, and may have a viscosity similar to thick, cold molasses or even rubber when erupted. Felsic magma, such as rhyolite, is usually erupted at low temperature and is up to 10,000 times as viscous as basalt. Volcanoes with rhyolitic magma commonly erupt explosively, and rhyolitic lava flows are typically of limited extent and have steep margins, because the magma is so viscous.
Felsic and intermediate magmas that erupt often do so violently, with explosions driven by the release of dissolved gases—typically water vapour, but also carbon dioxide. Explosively erupted pyroclastic material is called tephra and includes tuff, agglomerate and ignimbrite. Fine volcanic ash is also erupted and forms ash tuff deposits, which can often cover vast areas.
Because lava usually cools and crystallizes rapidly, it is usually fine-grained. If the cooling has been so rapid as to prevent the formation of even small crystals after extrusion, the resulting rock may be mostly glass (such as the rock obsidian). If the cooling of the lava happened more slowly, the rock would be coarse-grained.
Because the minerals are mostly fine-grained, it is much more difficult to distinguish between the different types of extrusive igneous rocks than between different types of intrusive igneous rocks. Generally, the mineral constituents of fine-grained extrusive igneous rocks can only be determined by examination of thin sections of the rock under a microscope, so only an approximate classification can usually be made in the field.
Classification
Igneous rocks are classified according to mode of occurrence, texture, mineralogy, chemical composition, and the geometry of the igneous body.
The classification of the many types of different igneous rocks can provide us with important information about the conditions under which they formed. Two important variables used for the classification of igneous rocks are particle size, which largely depends on the cooling history, and the mineral composition of the rock. Feldspars, quartz or feldspathoids, olivines, pyroxenes, amphiboles, and micas are all important minerals in the formation of almost all igneous rocks, and they are basic to the classification of these rocks. All other minerals present are regarded as nonessential in almost all igneous rocks and are called accessory minerals. Types of igneous rocks with other essential minerals are very rare, and these rare rocks include those with essential carbonates.
In a simplified classification, igneous rock types are separated on the basis of the type of feldspar present, the presence or absence of quartz, and in rocks with no feldspar or quartz, the type of iron or magnesium minerals present. Rocks containing quartz (silica in composition) are silica-oversaturated. Rocks with feldspathoids are silica-undersaturated, because feldspathoids cannot coexist in a stable association with quartz.
Igneous rocks that have crystals large enough to be seen by the naked eye are called phaneritic; those with crystals too small to be seen are called aphanitic. Generally speaking, phaneritic implies an intrusive origin; aphanitic an extrusive one.
An igneous rock with larger, clearly discernible crystals embedded in a finer-grained matrix is termed porphyry. Porphyritic texture develops when some of the crystals grow to considerable size before the main mass of the magma crystallizes as finer-grained, uniform material.
Igneous rocks are classified on the basis of texture and composition. Texture refers to the size, shape, and arrangement of the mineral grains or crystals of which the rock is composed.
Texture

Main article: Rock microstructure
Texture is an important criterion for the naming of volcanic rocks. The texture of volcanic rocks, including the size, shape, orientation, and distribution of mineral grains and the intergrain relationships, will determine whether the rock is termed a tuff, a pyroclastic lava or a simple lava.
However, the texture is only a subordinate part of classifying volcanic rocks, as most often there needs to be chemical information gleaned from rocks with extremely fine-grained groundmass or from airfall tuffs, which may be formed from volcanic ash.
Textural criteria are less critical in classifying intrusive rocks where the majority of minerals will be visible to the naked eye or at least using a hand lens, magnifying glass or microscope. Plutonic rocks also tend to be less texturally varied and less prone to gaining structural fabrics. Textural terms can be used to differentiate different intrusive phases of large plutons, for instance porphyritic margins to large intrusive bodies, porphyry stocks and subvolcanic dikes (apophyses). Mineralogical classification is most often used to classify plutonic rocks. Chemical classifications are preferred to classify volcanic rocks, with phenocryst species used as a prefix, e.g. "olivine-bearing picrite" or "orthoclase-phyric rhyolite".

Basic classification scheme for igneous rocks on their mineralogy. If the approximate volume fractions of minerals in the rock are known, the rock name and silica content can be read off the diagram. This is not an exact method, because the classification of igneous rocks also depends on other components than silica, yet in most cases it is a good first guess.


Chemical classification and Petrology




Total alkali versus silica classification scheme (TAS) as proposed in Le Maitre's 2002 Igneous Rocks - A classification and glossary of terms[4]:237


Igneous rocks can be classified according to chemical or mineralogical parameters.
Chemical: total alkali-silica content (TAS diagram) for volcanic rock classification used when modal or mineralogic data is unavailable:

felsic igneous rocks containing a high silica content, greater than 63% SiO2 (examples granite and rhyolite)
intermediate igneous rocks containing between 52 – 63% SiO2 (example andesite and dacite)
mafic igneous rocks have low silica 45 – 52% and typically high iron – magnesium content (example gabbro and basalt)
ultramafic rock igneous rocks with less than 45% silica. (examples picrite, komatiite and peridotite)
alkalic igneous rocks with 5 – 15% alkali (K2O + Na2O) content or with a molar ratio of alkali to silica greater than 1:6. (examples phonolite and trachyte)

Chemical classification also extends to differentiating rocks that are chemically similar according to the TAS diagram, for instance;

Ultrapotassic; rocks containing molar K2O/Na2O >3
Peralkaline; rocks containing molar (K2O + Na2O)/ Al2O3 >1
Peraluminous; rocks containing molar (K2O + Na2O)/ Al2O3 <1

An idealized mineralogy (the normative mineralogy) can be calculated from the chemical composition, and the calculation is useful for rocks too fine-grained or too altered for identification of minerals that crystallized from the melt. For instance, normative quartz classifies a rock as silica-oversaturated; an example is rhyolite. In an older terminology, silica oversaturated rocks were called silicic or acidic where the SiO2 was greater than 66% and the family term quartzolite was applied to the most silicic. A normative feldspathoid classifies a rock as silica-undersaturated; an example is nephelinite.
History of classification
In 1902, a group of American petrographers proposed that all existing classifications of igneous rocks should be discarded and replaced by a "quantitative" classification based on chemical analysis. They showed how vague, and often unscientific, much of the existing terminology was and argued that as the chemical composition of an igneous rock was its most fundamental characteristic, it should be elevated to prime position.
Geological occurrence, structure, mineralogical constitution—the hitherto accepted criteria for the discrimination of rock species—were relegated to the background. The completed rock analysis is first to be interpreted in terms of the rock-forming minerals which might be expected to be formed when the magma crystallizes, e.g., quartz feldspars, olivine, akermannite, Feldspathoids, magnetite, corundum, and so on, and the rocks are divided into groups strictly according to the relative proportion of these minerals to one another.[5][6]
Mineralogical classification
For volcanic rocks, mineralogy is important in classifying and naming lavas. The most important criterion is the phenocryst species, followed by the groundmass mineralogy. Often, where the groundmass is aphanitic, chemical classification must be used to properly identify a volcanic rock.
Mineralogic contents – felsic versus mafic

felsic rock, highest content of silicon, with predominance of quartz, alkali feldspar and/or feldspathoids: the felsic minerals; these rocks (e.g., granite, rhyolite) are usually light coloured, and have low density.
mafic rock, lesser content of silicon relative to felsic rocks, with predominance of mafic minerals pyroxenes, olivines and calcic plagioclase; these rocks (example, basalt, gabbro) are usually dark coloured, and have a higher density than felsic rocks.
ultramafic rock, lowest content of silicon, with more than 90% of mafic minerals (e.g., dunite).

For intrusive, plutonic and usually phaneritic igneous rocks (where all minerals are visible at least via microscope), the mineralogy is used to classify the rock. This usually occurs on ternary diagrams, where the relative proportions of three minerals are used to classify the rock.
The following table is a simple subdivision of igneous rocks according to both their composition and mode of occurrence.

Example of classification
Granite is an igneous intrusive rock (crystallized at depth), with felsic composition (rich in silica and predominately quartz plus potassium-rich feldspar plus sodium-rich plagioclase) and phaneritic, subeuhedral texture (minerals are visible to the unaided eye and commonly some of them retain original crystallographic shapes).
Magma origination
The Earth's crust averages about 35 kilometers thick under the continents, but averages only some 7–10 kilometers beneath the oceans. The continental crust is composed primarily of sedimentary rocks resting on a crystalline basement formed of a great variety of metamorphic and igneous rocks, including granulite and granite. Oceanic crust is composed primarily of basalt and gabbro. Both continental and oceanic crust rest on peridotite of the mantle.
Rocks may melt in response to a decrease in pressure, to a change in composition (such as an addition of water), to an increase in temperature, or to a combination of these processes.
Other mechanisms, such as melting from a meteorite impact, are less important today, but impacts during the accretion of the Earth led to extensive melting, and the outer several hundred kilometers of our early Earth was probably an ocean of magma. Impacts of large meteorites in the last few hundred million years have been proposed as one mechanism responsible for the extensive basalt magmatism of several large igneous provinces.
Decompression
Decompression melting occurs because of a decrease in pressure.[7]
The solidus temperatures of most rocks (the temperatures below which they are completely solid) increase with increasing pressure in the absence of water. Peridotite at depth in the Earth's mantle may be hotter than its solidus temperature at some shallower level. If such rock rises during the convection of solid mantle, it will cool slightly as it expands in an adiabatic process, but the cooling is only about 0.3 °C per kilometer. Experimental studies of appropriate peridotite samples document that the solidus temperatures increase by 3 °C to 4 °C per kilometer. If the rock rises far enough, it will begin to melt. Melt droplets can coalesce into larger volumes and be intruded upwards. This process of melting from the upward movement of solid mantle is critical in the evolution of the Earth.
Decompression melting creates the ocean crust at mid-ocean ridges. It also causes volcanism in intraplate regions, such as Europe, Africa and the Pacific sea floor. There, it is variously attributed either to the rise of mantle plumes (the "Plume hypothesis") or to intraplate extension (the "Plate hypothesis").[8]
Effects of water and carbon dioxide
The change of rock composition most responsible for the creation of magma is the addition of water. Water lowers the solidus temperature of rocks at a given pressure. For example, at a depth of about 100 kilometers, peridotite begins to melt near 800 °C in the presence of excess water, but near or above about 1,500 °C in the absence of water.[9] Water is driven out of the oceanic lithosphere in subduction zones, and it causes melting in the overlying mantle. Hydrous magmas composed of basalt and andesite are produced directly and indirectly as results of dehydration during the subduction process. Such magmas, and those derived from them, build up island arcs such as those in the Pacific Ring of Fire. These magmas form rocks of the calc-alkaline series, an important part of the continental crust.
The addition of carbon dioxide is relatively a much less important cause of magma formation than the addition of water, but genesis of some silica-undersaturated magmas has been attributed to the dominance of carbon dioxide over water in their mantle source regions. In the presence of carbon dioxide, experiments document that the peridotite solidus temperature decreases by about 200 °C in a narrow pressure interval at pressures corresponding to a depth of about 70 km. At greater depths, carbon dioxide can have more effect: at depths to about 200 km, the temperatures of initial melting of a carbonated peridotite composition were determined to be 450 °C to 600 °C lower than for the same composition with no carbon dioxide.[10] Magmas of rock types such as nephelinite, carbonatite, and kimberlite are among those that may be generated following an influx of carbon dioxide into mantle at depths greater than about 70 km.
Temperature increase
Increase in temperature is the most typical mechanism for formation of magma within continental crust. Such temperature increases can occur because of the upward intrusion of magma from the mantle. Temperatures can also exceed the solidus of a crustal rock in continental crust thickened by compression at a plate boundary. The plate boundary between the Indian and Asian continental masses provides a well-studied example, as the Tibetan Plateau just north of the boundary has crust about 80 kilometers thick, roughly twice the thickness of normal continental crust. Studies of electrical resistivity deduced from magnetotelluric data have detected a layer that appears to contain silicate melt and that stretches for at least 1,000 kilometers within the middle crust along the southern margin of the Tibetan Plateau.[11] Granite and rhyolite are types of igneous rock commonly interpreted as products of the melting of continental crust because of increases in temperature. Temperature increases also may contribute to the melting of lithosphere dragged down in a subduction zone.
Magma evolution




Schematic diagrams showing the principles behind fractional crystallisation in a magma. While cooling, the magma evolves in composition because different minerals crystallize from the melt. 1: olivine crystallizes; 2: olivine and pyroxene crystallize; 3: pyroxene and plagioclase crystallize; 4: plagioclase crystallizes. At the bottom of the magma reservoir, a cumulate rock forms.




Main article: Igneous differentiation


Most magmas only entirely melt for small parts of their histories. More typically, they are mixes of melt and crystals, and sometimes also of gas bubbles. Melt, crystals, and bubbles usually have different densities, and so they can separate as magmas evolve.
As magma cools, minerals typically crystallize from the melt at different temperatures (fractional crystallization). As minerals crystallize, the composition of the residual melt typically changes. If crystals separate from the melt, then the residual melt will differ in composition from the parent magma. For instance, a magma of gabbroic composition can produce a residual melt of granitic composition if early formed crystals are separated from the magma. Gabbro may have a liquidus temperature near 1,200 °C, and the derivative granite-composition melt may have a liquidus temperature as low as about 700 °C. Incompatible elements are concentrated in the last residues of magma during fractional crystallization and in the first melts produced during partial melting: either process can form the magma that crystallizes to pegmatite, a rock type commonly enriched in incompatible elements. Bowen's reaction series is important for understanding the idealised sequence of fractional crystallisation of a magma.
Magma composition can be determined by processes other than partial melting and fractional crystallization. For instance, magmas commonly interact with rocks they intrude, both by melting those rocks and by reacting with them. Magmas of different compositions can mix with one another. In rare cases, melts can separate into two immiscible melts of contrasting compositions.
There are relatively few minerals that are important in the formation of common igneous rocks, because the magma from which the minerals crystallize is rich in only certain elements: silicon, oxygen, aluminium, sodium, potassium, calcium, iron, and magnesium. These are the elements that combine to form the silicate minerals, which account for over ninety percent of all igneous rocks. The chemistry of igneous rocks is expressed differently for major and minor elements and for trace elements. Contents of major and minor elements are conventionally expressed as weight percent oxides (e.g., 51% SiO2, and 1.50% TiO2). Abundances of trace elements are conventionally expressed as parts per million by weight (e.g., 420 ppm Ni, and 5.1 ppm Sm). The term "trace element" is typically used for elements present in most rocks at abundances less than 100 ppm or so, but some trace elements may be present in some rocks at abundances exceeding 1,000 ppm. The diversity of rock compositions has been defined by a huge mass of analytical data—over 230,000 rock analyses can be accessed on the web through a site sponsored by the U. S. National Science Foundation (see the External Link to EarthChem).
Etymology
The word "igneous" is derived from the Latin ignis, meaning "of fire". Volcanic rocks are named after Vulcan, the Roman name for the god of fire. Intrusive rocks are also called "plutonic" rocks, named after Pluto, the Roman god of the underworld.

Q:

What is exfoliation geology?



A:
Exfoliation geology is a type of rock weathering where the rock's layers peel off in whole sheets instead of grain by grain. Large-scale exfoliation occurs due to the mechanics of gravity on a curved surface, while small-scale exfoliation is due to chemical weathering.

Q:
Where can metamorphic rocks be found?


A:
Metamorphic rocks are most often found in mountainous regions though they can be seen wherever there are signs of geological upheaval in an area. This type of rock is formed by the transformation of another rock type, a change that is usually triggered by tremendous heat, pressure or other violent phenomena. The forces that cause metamorphic rocks to form are so great that they change not only the appearance but also the chemical composition of an existing rock.

Q:
What is layered rock called?


A:
Rock composed of layered bands of sediment is called sedimentary rock. Erosion creates sand, clay, silt and other sediment. Sediment builds up, and with the passage of time, the layers are compacted and cemented together to form sedimentary rock.

Q:
Why is a diamond so hard?


A:
The molecular structure of a diamond makes it hard, as diamonds are comprised of carbon atoms linked closely together in a lattice structure. The atoms are linked tightly via covalent bonds wherein two atoms share an electron. A tetrahedral unit is composed of five carbon atoms, with one carbon atom sharing electrons with the other four. An extremely strong molecule is formed from the tetrahedral bonding of five carbon atoms.

Q:
How is quartz mined?


A:
The Encyclopedia of Arkansas explains that commercial mining of quartz is rare and occasionally consists of the use of explosives to first expose the quartz, followed by the operation of small hand tools such as chisels and rock picks to extract portions of the mineral from a quarry. Quartz is quite sensitive to temperature changes, so miners prefer not to use explosives unless absolutely necessary.

Q:
How is a plateau formed?


A:
A plateau is formed by a process of geological uplift, either due to the collision of continental plates, pressure from magma below or the burial of land by volcanic lava and ash flows, resulting in a high, flat surface. These are very similar to processes that give rise to mountains and mountain ranges. The only major difference is that a plateau is flat while mountains are peaked.

Q:
What is the difference between soil and sand?


A:
Soil is made up of liquids, solids and gases that form on the surface of land, while sand is a natural material that consists of at least 85 percent sand-sized particles. Soil consists mostly of organic matter, such as decomposing animals and plants and minerals. The most common sand found throughout the world is made up of quartz, or silicon dioxide.

Q:
How are minerals formed?


A:
Minerals are formed under a variety of conditions, including when molten materials cool, when liquids evaporate or cool and under high temperatures and pressures. Minerals are found in the earth's crust and mantle, and many were created when feldspar and quartz reacted with other materials during the formation of the planet.

Bet you
            didn’t know that. . .


            Aggregates are the only
            mineral commodity produced in every state in the union.
            Every year more than two billion tons of this material
            are used in the United States. 


            In other words, approximately eight
            tons of aggregates are used for every American each year.
            That’s 16,000 pounds or a total of 107 average sized
            people standing on the scale at one time!
            

Imagine life without . . .

 
 
 

            highways · paint · plastics · medicines ·
            glass · driveways · concrete sidewalks ·
            bridges · wallboard · vinyl · brick and stone
            buildings and homes · concrete blocks · roofing
            tiles · asphalt shingles · minerals for
            agriculture

.. all these things are
            made possible with crushed stone products ..


 
 








AND . . .



            More than a million
            employees and their families 
            rely on the country’s
            construction materials industries for their livelihoods.
            Many live and work in your community. Thousands of
            other folks rely on this resource and industry to make
            possible other things like schools, hospitals, and
            airports. Rogers Group employs 1,700 people and does
            business in 5 states and numerous communities.



            Rogers Group and our industry maintain a strong
            commitment to safety and health at our workplaces. We
            comply with stringent federal, state, and local
            regulations. Our safety and health training programs have
            helped us develop a knowledgeable workforce. With a
            history of outstanding safety records, 34 of our
            locations had zero accidents this past year
            alone.


 
Did
            you realize . . .




            Many of our people
            are quite often active leaders in the community, involved
            with local schools, civic groups, community projects, and
            organizations like Little League.

            . . . Rogers Group
            emphasizes aesthetics and environmental considerations.
            We have won many industry and community awards for our
            site beautification efforts in providing dust and noise
            control, landscaping, truck routing, and attractive
            entrance designs. 
 

 

            . . . and that crushed stone is becoming a critical tool
            used to protect our environment. Erosion control programs
            require stone. Water and sewer facilities use stone and
            sand for filtration systems. Utility power plants use
            crushed stone to reduce sulfur dioxide that produces acid
            rain. Rogers Group has been nationally recognized for our
            environmental efforts. 
 
 
            . . . and outstanding community developments occur as a
            result of quarry reclamation. Local and state parks,
            wildlife areas, and golf courses are just some of the
            many beautiful places you can visit because of a quarry. 
 




. . . Finally, every small town,every big city, and every road and building
in them are built with stone!

Q:
What are igneous rocks used for?







A:

Quick Answer
Igneous rocks are often used for construction because of their durability. Igneous rocks can also be separated to access the various valuable metals and minerals inside them. Igneous rocks form as magma comes to or near the surface of the Earth; cooling and hardening because of its distance from the inner parts of the Earth where magma forms.

Full Answer
 Almost 95 percent of the surface of the Earth is composed of igneous rock, and scientists have found more than 700 different types of igneous rocks. Pumice is an igneous rock with many cosmetic applications. Because of its gently abrasive nature, it is used as an ingredient in toothpaste, as well as some other cosmetic products. It also often goes into the mix when manufacturing cement. With regard to construction, basalt is one of the most durable igneous rocks and often plays a role in construction projects.
For more impressive structures ranging from gravestones, counter tops and statues to large buildings serving as public landmarks, granite has long been a popular choice. It has a glassy texture that allows the beautiful colors from within to shine through and catch the eye. For those looking for the silver, chromium, gold and other precious metals inside rocks, gabbro is a popular choice.

Basfiber® - Chopped Fiber

Our concrete-grade basalt chopped fiber is specially designed for production of fiber reinforced concrete to provide outstanding performance in a wide range of applications. This basalt  chopped fiber is produced with a special sizing agent to provide good compatibility with different types of concretes and easy mixing even at high  content.  Kamenny Vek  provides various  types  of yarns and woven fabrics for fire protection, thermal and sound  insulation. Basfiber® has higher sound  insulation properties, 150°C more heat  resistance than glass fibers.  Advanced basalt UD-tapes are ideally suited for renovation of old concrete  structures and for reinforcing of concrete walls.  Basfiber® significantly outperforms synthetic materials by their  ability to withstand low temperatures that is extremely  important for roads and  highways in the north regions.

BasGrid™ - 100mm,25mm,04mm square grids or custom shapesGeoGrids

Basalt BasGrid™ is designed for reinforcing road and highway overlays to prolong  the pavement life span by reducing the effects of cracking caused by traffic loading, age, hardening and temperature cycling. Pavement life between  maintenance can be prolonged significantly.  Basalt  reinforcing mesh makes it possible to reduce thickness of asphalt  or  concrete pavement up to 20%. Typical paving temperatures will not cause any loss of  strength or distortion which may occur with other synthetic material. Follow the Link for more information about BasGrid™ and Geo Grids. http://www.basfiber.com/src/geotextile.pdf 

ReforceTech Products - MiniBars™

MiniBars™ - Basalt FRP Macrofiber by ReforceTech  Unique new macrofiber made from 0.65mm thin Basalt FRP wires are available in long (43mm) lengths for concrete and short (20mm) for grout and mortar mixes.  In contrast to microfiber that is used primarily for shrinkage crack control during curing at early ages, these macrofibers will significantly enhance both Flexural Tensile (FTS) and Average Residual Strength (ARS), often allowing the complete elimination of WWR mesh and light structural rebar.  We call it “Pre-Reinforced™” concrete!  Compared to steel fiber, MiniBars™ can be mixed at much higher dosages and still be pumped without clogging equipment.  Finishing without exposing the fibers is also easy as they stay suspended in the matrix below the surface.  In addition to concrete slabs on grade or structure, MiniBar™ mixes have been used very successfully in a variety of wall applications including cast-in-place and precast architectural facades, insulated wall panels, structural (shear) walls and privacy barriers.  Any concrete in an exposed or marine environment is a prime use for MiniBar™ reinforced concrete.  Accelerated aging tests show high resistance to both alkaline and acid environments.  Unlike steel fibers, MiniBars™ will never rust and cause aesthetic or structural problems.  Projects using MiniBars™ have shown up to 20% savings in overall cost when considering both materials and labor.  The cross section of the members can often be reduced because concrete cover normally required for steel is not necessary.  There is no labor to fabricate and place reinforcing, just pour or pump the MiniBar™ Pre-Reinforced™ concrete in the forms and finish.  BasBar™ Basalt FRP Reinforcing Bars by ReforceTech  This non-metallic rebar is twice as strong as steel, but only 25% of the weight, so smaller bars can be used and shipping costs are greatly reduced.  ReforceTech uses a new manufacturing process that is certified by Det Norske Veritas (DNV) and ISO 9008.  Bars are available in standard US and custom metric sizes and shapes.  We also have available for engineers the first Basalt FRP Design Guide based on ACI 440.1R-06 that includes all the specific coefficients for Basalt in addition to other types of fiber.  Please e-mail us to receive your copy  In addition to straight and bent bars, we also offer custom pre-tied (taped) cages or mesh.GALEN Composites ​ROCKBAR® / MESH GRIDS / Composite  Wall TiesComposite  rebar (BFRP) produced using a pultrusion method  from 2.5mm through 25mm in various shapes and sizes to meet your specifications. Please keep in mind, all bent shapes must be ordered and bent at the factory at the time the bar is produced.  Absolute corrosion resistance, alkali resistance;Forecasted durability exceeds 75 years;Less maintenance, reduction of costs for current maintenance and repair;Reduction of transportation costs;Easy to install.BFRP or GFRP can't be field bent.In addition to straight and bent bars, we also offer custom cages or mesh.

In  Partnership with  Brevard Achievement Center  the manufacturing of custom Basalt Grids we can custom make all your Basalt Grids for your applications!We at BPG LLC are exciting about this opportunity to work with our community  and provide meaningful work for many people and to provide many products that can be used around the country.   Grids can be produced in the USA by our partnership with the Brevard Achievement Center,  with them as our partner we are using Adults with disabilities and making them productive. They look forward to meet your needs with specialty grids.
