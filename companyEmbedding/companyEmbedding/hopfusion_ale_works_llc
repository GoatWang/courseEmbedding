“Good beer with lots of community style seating”


Reviewed 3 weeks ago




Beers can be purchased individually or by the flight. They have two preset flights (their signature series or year round beers, and the ex-girlfriend flight of their fruited beers - Feisty Blonde, Feisty Brunette, Feisty Redhead, and Thorny Blonde) or you can do a custom one. In addition to their core four brews you are rewarded with many taproom only selections. I especially liked their Feisty Redhead, a cherry/hibiscus ale, and their Zombie Crack, a pecan bourbon barrel stout. Fruit beers and stouts seemed to be their main focus on my visit, and I only saw one IPA on tap.There was lots of community style seating available, inside and outside on their deck. People had brought small children and there were board games available. Several people had also brought dogs and I even saw one in the taproom.

Great beer. Tried a flight of their beer which is better than most microbrews. They had a live band which was awesome. We enjoyed being able to set outside and play a board game.

“Had Some Beers on the Deck”


Reviewed May 7, 2017




HopFusion brews beer/ale.We were at HopFusion with my cousin and her husband. We had a couple of beers out on the deck. The weather was nice, the beers were good, it was a fun time. It was easy to talk and relax.We did not have any food. I don't even know if they serve food. I think they allow guests to bring food to eat on the deck with their beers (but check with the staff before you try it).I would go back.

About




  
 
 
 

Creativity is at the heart of everything we do at HopFusion Ale Works. We are excited by innovation and art, and we decided to fuse those concepts into our brewery.Our founders, Macy Moore and Matt Hill, are passionate about both. They firmly believe that craft brew is an experience, not just a beer. It’s about community and friends. And, they feel that providing a forum for the arts at the brewery brings that experience alive.Macy and Matt both began their award-winning craft brew journey as home brewers, with over a decade of experience between them. Macy developed a passion for the art of light-bodied ales, while Matt’s passion tends towards the darker-bodied ales and barleywines.In a nutshell, HopFusion Ale Works is about good friends, fantastic art, enjoying the ride of life (preferably on a bicycle)…and great craft beer.

Hopfusion Ale Works  $500000  Financing. Macy Moore  Released Dec 31  SEC Filing

			in Private Financing News 












Share with your friendsYour NameYour EmailRecipient EmailEnter a MessageI read this article and found it very interesting, thought it might be interesting for you. The article is called Hopfusion Ale Works  $500000  Financing. Macy Moore  Released Dec 31  SEC Filing and is was published by Octafinance.com at http://www.octafinance.com/hopfusion-ale-works-500000-financing-macy-moore-released-dec-31-sec-filing/325999/.CaptchaSubmit
Hopfusion Ale Works Financing
Hopfusion Ale Works, Llc, Limited Liability Company just filed form D regarding $500,000 equity financing. This is a new filing. Hopfusion Ale Works, Llc is expected to fundraise $500,000 in this fundraising offer. The total private financing amount was $500,000. This form was filed on 2015-12-31. The reason for the financing was: Assumes revenues from operations will be adequate to pay salaries and other service compensation to Item 3 persons and that none of proceeds from offering will be used for that purpose.. The fundraising still has about $500,000 more and is not closed yet. We have to wait more to see if the offering will be fully taken.
 Hopfusion Ale Works is based in Texas. The filler’s business is not disclosed. The D form was submitted by Macy Moore Manager. The company was incorporated in 2015. The filler’s address is: 200 East Broadway Street, Fort Worth, Tx, Texas, 76104. Macy Moore is the related person in the form and it has address: 200 East Broadway Street, Fort Worth, Tx, Texas, 76104. Link to Hopfusion Ale Works Filing: 000166209015000001.
Analysis of Hopfusion Ale Works Offering
On average, firms in the not disclosed sector, sell 67.77 % of the total offering amount. Hopfusion Ale Works sold 0.00 % of the offering. The financing is still open. The average investment floor size for companies in all industries in our database is $3.05 million. The offering was 100.00 % smaller than the average of $3.05 million. Of course this should not be seen as negative. Startups raise funds for different reasons and needs. The minimum investment for this offering was set at $10000. If you know more about the reasons for the financing, please comment below.
What is Form D? What It Is Used For
Form D disclosures could be used to track and understand better your competitors. The information in Form D is usually highly confidential for ventures and startups and they don’t like revealing it. This is because it reveals amount raised or planned to be raised as well as reasons for the financing. This could help competitors. Entrepreneurs usually want to keep their financing a ‘secret’ so they can stay in stealth mode for longer.
Why Fundraising Reporting Is Good For Hopfusion Ale Works Also
The Form D signed by Macy Moore might help Hopfusion Ale Works, Llc’s sector. First, it helps potential customers feel more safe to deal with a firm that is well financed. The odds are higher that it will stay in the business. Second, this could attract other investors such as venture-capital firms, funds and angels. Third, positive PR effects could even bring leasing firms and venture lenders.
