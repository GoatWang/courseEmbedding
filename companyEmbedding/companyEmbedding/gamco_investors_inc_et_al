Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in Item 8 to this report.  Introduction  On November 30, 2015 (the "Spin-Off Date"), GBL distributed to its stockholders all of the outstanding common stock of Associated Capital Group, Inc. ("AC") and its subsidiaries along with certain cash and other assets (the "Spin-off"). AC owns and operates, directly or indirectly, the alternatives and the institutional research businesses previously owned and operated by GBL. In the Spin-off, each holder of GAMCO's Class A Common Stock ("Class A Stock") of record as of 5:00 p.m. New York City time on November 12, 2015 (the "Record Date"), received one share of AC Class A common stock for each share of GAMCO Class A Stock held on the Record Date. Each record holder of GAMCO's Class B Stock received one share of AC Class B common stock for each share of GAMCO Class B Stock held on the Record Date. Subsequent to the Spin-off, GAMCO no longer consolidates the financial results of AC for the purposes of its own financial reporting and the historical financial results of AC have been reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented through the Spin-off Date. Historical AUM have similarly been adjusted to remove AUM managed by AC.  Our revenues are highly correlated to the level of AUM and fees associated with our various investment products, rather than our own corporate assets. AUM, which are directly influenced by the level and changes of the overall equity markets, can also fluctuate through acquisitions, the creation of new products, the addition of new accounts or the loss of existing accounts. Since various equity products have different fees, changes in our business mix may also affect revenues. At times, the performance of our equity products may differ markedly from popular market indices, and this can also impact our revenues. It is our belief that general stock market trends will have the greatest impact on our level of AUM and hence, revenues.  As of December 31, 2016, we had $39.7 billion of AUM. We conduct our investment advisory business principally through: GAMCO (Institutional and Private Wealth Management), and Funds Advisor (Funds). We also are a distributor of our open-end funds through our broker-dealer subsidiary G.distributors.  Organizational Chart  Subsequent to the Spin-off, this is the current organizational chart of the Company.

                                         its first in a series of actively managed, non-transparent exchange traded managed funds ("ETMFs"). Gabelli Media Mogul will invest primarily in the media industry; specifically in companies that were spun-off from Dr. John Malone's Liberty Media Corporation ("Liberty Media") as constituted in 2001, including companies formed through subsequent mergers of those spin-offs and companies in which Liberty Media and its successors have invested.  � On August 15, 2016, the Company issued a $110 million five year convertible note to Cascade Investment, L.L.C. in a private transaction. The note has a coupon of 4.5% and is convertible into GBL Class A common stock at $55 per share.  � On September 2, 2016, GAMCO completed the initial public offering of The Gabelli Go Anywhere Trust, the Company's 15th closed-end fund. This newly organized closed-end fund initially traded on the NYSE MKT as a $100 combination consisting of one preferred share at $40 and three common shares at $19 each under the symbol GGO.C. This innovative offering demonstrates the flexibility of the closed-end fund structure. Separate trading on the NYSE MKT for the common shares ("GGO") and the Series A Preferred shares ("GGO.A") commenced on November 2, 2016.  � 2016 was the first full year of advising the Bancroft Fund, and Ellsworth Growth and Income Fund. The Dinsmore team now manages over $350 million in AUM across three closed-end funds. 2016 was also the first full year of advising The Gabelli Value Plus+ Trust, our first London Stock Exchange listed closed-end fund. The Fund had $171 million of AUM at December 31, 2016.  � Net debt improved from $262.4 million at December 31, 2015 to $156.9 million at December 31, 2016.  Overview  Consolidated Statements of Income  Investment advisory and incentive fees, which are based on the amount and composition of AUM in our Funds, Institutional and Private Wealth Management accounts, represent our largest source of revenues. In addition to the general level and trends of the stock market, growth in revenues depends on good investment performance, which influences the value of existing AUM as well as contributes to higher investment and lower redemption rates and facilitates the ability to attract additional investors while maintaining current fee levels. Growth in AUM is also dependent on being able to access various distribution channels, which is usually based on several factors, including performance and service. A majority of our cash inflows to mutual fund products have come through third party distribution programs, including NTF programs. We have also been engaged to act as a sub-advisor for other much larger financial services companies with much larger sales distribution organizations. These sub-advisory clients are subject to business combinations that may result in the termination of the relationship. The loss of a sub-advisory relationship could have a significant impact on our financial results in the future.  Advisory fees from the open-end funds, closed-end funds and sub-advisory accounts are computed daily or weekly based on average net assets. Advisory fees from Institutional and Private Wealth Management clients are generally computed quarterly based on account values as of the end of the preceding quarter. These revenues are based on AUM which is highly correlated to the stock market and can vary in direct proportion to movements in the stock market and the level of sales compared with redemptions, financial market conditions and the fee structure for AUM. Revenues derived from the equity-oriented portfolios generally have higher management fee rates than fixed income portfolios.  We also receive incentive fees from certain Institutional and Private Wealth Management clients, which are based upon meeting or exceeding a specific benchmark index or indices. These fees are recognized at the end of the stipulated contract period, which may be quarterly or annually, for the respective account. Management fees on assets attributable to a majority of the closed-end preferred shares are earned at year-end if the total return to common shareholders of the closed-end fund for the calendar year exceeds the dividend rate of the preferred shares. These fees are recognized at the end of the measurement period.  Distribution fees and other income primarily include distribution fee revenue earned in accordance with Rule 12b-1 of the Company Act, as amended, along with sales charges and underwriting fees associated with the sale of the mutual funds plus other revenues. Distribution fees fluctuate based on the level of AUM and the amount and type of mutual funds sold directly by G.distributors or through various distribution channels.  Compensation costs include variable and fixed compensation and related expenses paid to officers, portfolio managers, sales, trading, research and all other professional staff. Variable compensation paid to sales personnel and portfolio management generally represents 40% of revenues and is the largest component of total compensation costs. Distribution costs include marketing, product distribution and promotion costs. Management fee is incentive-based and entirely variable compensation in the amount of 10% of the aggregate pre-tax profits which is paid to Mr. Gabelli or his designee for acting as CEO pursuant to his 2008 Employment Agreement so long as he is an executive of GBL and devotes the substantial majority of his working time to the business. Other operating expenses include general and administrative operating costs.  Other income and expenses include net gains and losses from investments (which includes both realized and unrealized gains and losses from trading securities), interest and dividend income, and interest expense. Net gains and losses from investments are derived from our proprietary investment portfolio consisting of various public and private investments.  Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the share of net income attributable to the minority stockholders, as reported on a separate company basis, of our consolidated majority-owned subsidiaries and net income attributable to third party limited partners of certain partnerships and offshore funds we consolidate. Please refer to Note A in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.  Income/(loss) on discontinued operations, net of taxes represents the results of the businesses and assets that were part of the Spin-off of AC. Please refer to Note P in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.  Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition  We ended the 2016 year with approximately $77.1 million in cash and investments. The $77.1 million consists of $39.8 million cash and cash equivalents, primarily invested in our 100% U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund, $0.1 million invested in common stocks and available for sale ("AFS") securities of $37.2 million. Of the $37.2 million of AFS securities, $37.1 million represent our investment in shares of Westwood Holdings Group.  The face value of our debt consisted of $100 million of a 4% PIK Note due to AC, $110 million of a 4.5% convertible note due August 15, 2021 and $24.2 million of 5.875% senior notes due June 1, 2021.  Equity was a negative $166.6 million on December 31, 2016 compared to a negative $276.3 million on December 31, 2015.  We filed a shelf registration with the SEC in 2015 which, among other things, provides us the flexibility to sell any combination of senior and subordinate debt securities, convertible debt securities, equity securities (including common and preferred stock), and other securities up to a total amount of $500 million. The shelf is available through April 10, 2018, at which time it may be renewed.  Our primary short-term goal is to use our liquid resources to pay down our existing debt. As a secondary goal, we will look to opportunistically and strategically grow operating income at what we consider a margin of safety. We will also consider alternatives to return capital to our shareholders including stock repurchases and dividends.

Equity AUM were $37.9 billion on December 31, 2016, 2.2% above the $37.1 billion on December 31, 2015. We earn incentive fees for certain institutional client assets, assets attributable to certain preferred issues for our closed-end funds and our GDL Fund

                                         As of December 31, 2016, assets with incentive based fees were $2.5 billion, 7.4% below the $2.7 billion on December 31, 2015. The majority of these assets have calendar year-end measurement periods; therefore, our incentive fees are primarily recognized in the fourth quarter when the uncertainty is removed at the end of the annual measurement period.  Operating Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015  Revenues Total revenues were $353.0 million in 2016, $28.0 million or 7.3% lower than the total revenues of $381.0 million in 2015. The change in total revenues by revenue component was as follows (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, Increase (decrease) 2016 2015 $ % Investment advisory $ 293.1 $ 325.6 $ (32.5 ) (10.0 )% Incentive fees 15.4 4.4 11.0 250.0 Distribution fees and other income 44.5 51.0 (6.5 ) (12.7 ) Total revenues $ 353.0 $ 381.0 $ (28.0 ) (7.3 )%  Investment Advisory and Incentive Fees: Investment advisory fees, which comprised 83.0% of total revenues in 2016, are directly influenced by the level and mix of average AUM. Average total AUM declined 10.0% to $38.9 billion in 2016 as compared to $43.2 billion in 2015. Average equity AUM fell 10.6% to $37.2 billion in 2016 from $41.6 billion in 2015, primarily from net outflows. Incentive fees, which comprised 4.4% of total revenues in 2016, result from our ability to either generate an absolute return in a portfolio or meet or exceed a specific benchmark index or indices and can vary significantly from one period to another. Incentive fees were higher in 2016 as a greater number of portfolios exceeded their respective benchmarks as compared to 2015.  Fund revenues decreased $14.9 million or 7.0%, to $199.3 million, driven by lower average AUM. Revenue from open-end funds decreased $21.9 million, or 14.4%, to $130.0 million from the prior year as average AUM in 2016 decreased $2.2 billion, or 12.6%, to $15.2 billion from the $17.4 billion in 2014. Closed-end fund revenues increased $7.0 million, or 11.2%, to $69.3 million from the prior year and was comprised of an increase of $7.8 million in incentive fees on certain closed-end fund AUM partially reduced by a decrease of $0.8 million in investment advisory fees attributable to lower average AUM. Revenue from Institutional and Private Wealth Management accounts, excluding incentive fees, which are generally billed on beginning quarter AUM, decreased $11.7 million, or 10.3%, principally due to lower billable AUM levels throughout the course of 2016. Incentive fees earned on certain accounts increased by $1.7 million. In 2016, average AUM in our equity Institutional and Private Wealth Management business decreased $2.1 billion, or 11.1%, for the year to $16.8 billion.  Distribution Fees and Other Income: Distribution fees and other income decreased $6.5 million, or 12.7%, to $44.5 million in 2016 from $51.0 million in 2015. Lower distribution fees of $41.0 million in 2016 versus $47.7 million for the prior year, principally as a result of decreased average AUM in our open-end equity mutual funds of 13.7%, offset by an increase of $0.2 million in fees from the sale of load shares of mutual funds and other income, contributed to this decrease.  Expenses  Stock based compensation: Stock based compensation was $4.0 million in 2016, a decrease of $5.9 million, as compared to $9.9 million in 2015. The decrease primarily results from the acceleration of 130,650 RSAs during 2015 for an additional expense of $3.5 million that would have been recognized in future years.  Management Fee: In 2016 management fee expense decreased to $6.5 million versus $15.5 million in 2015. Management fee expense is incentive-based and entirely variable in the amount of 10% of the aggregate pre-tax profits which is paid to Mr. Gabelli (or his designee) in accordance with his employment agreement. Most importantly the December 2015 RSU agreement reduced the management fee by $12.4 million in 2016. (see page 34)  Distribution Costs: Distribution costs, which include marketing, promotion and distribution costs decreased $7.8 million, or 15.0%, to $44.2 million in 2016 from $52.0 million in 2015 driven by a decrease in average open-end equity mutual funds AUM of 13.7%.  Other Operating Expenses: Our other operating expenses were $23.9 million in 2016 compared to $19.2 million in 2015, an increase of $4.7 million or 24.4%. The largest components of this increase were additional donated securities expense of $1.6 million and an increase to the research services fee of $1.5 million.  Operating Income and Margin  Operating income before management fee was $198.3 million for the year ended of 2016, versus $163.5 million in the prior year. Operating margin before management fee was 56.2% in the 2016 period versus 42.9% in the 2015 period. The reconciliation of operating income before management fee and operating margin before management fee, both of which are non-GAAP measures to their respective GAAP measures, is provided at the end of this section.  Other Income and Expense  Interest expense increased $4.1 million to $12.7 million in 2016, from $8.6 million in 2015 primarily related to the higher average amount of debt outstanding in 2016 versus 2015.  In 2015, the Board of Directors of GBL again adopted a Shareholder Designated Charitable Contribution program on behalf of all registered Class A and Class B shareholders. Under the programs the Board approved a $0.25 per share contribution, resulting in a charge of $6.4 million in 2015.  Income Taxes  Shareholder Compensation and Initiatives During 2016, we returned $13.2 million of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. We returned to shareholders a total of $0.08 per share in regular quarterly cash dividends in 2016 totaling $2.4 million. During 2015, we returned $34.7 million of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. We returned to shareholders a total of $0.28 per share in regular quarterly cash dividends totaling $7.5 million.  Through our stock buyback program, we repurchased 348,687 and 426,628 shares in 2016 and 2015, respectively, for approximately $10.8 million and $27.2 million, or $30.88 and $63.85 per share, respectively (For 2015, 413,228 shares were at an average investment of $64.86 per share prior to the distribution of AC on November 30, 2015 and 13,400 shares were at an average price of $32.56 following the distribution of AC). Approximately 233,000 shares remain authorized under our stock buyback program at December 31, 2016. Since our IPO we have repurchased 9,901,340 shares for a total investment of $438.8 million, or $44.32 per share.  Weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in 2016 and 2015 were 30.2 million and 25.7 million, respectively.  Operating income before management fee expense is used by management for purposes of evaluating its business operations. We believe this measure is useful in illustrating the operating results of the Company as management fee expense is based on pre-tax income before management fee expense, which includes non-operating items including investment gains and losses from the Company's proprietary investment portfolio and interest expense. We believe that an investor would find this useful in analyzing the business operations of the Company without the impact of the non-operating items such as trading and investment portfolios or interest expense.  Reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP:   2016 2015 Revenues $ 353,000 $ 380,976 Operating Income 191,796 147,949 Add back: management fee expense 6,518 15,503 Operating income before management fee $ 198,314 $ 163,452 Operating margin 54.3 % 38.8 % Operating margin before management fee 56.2 % 42.9 %  Operating Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014 Revenues Total revenues were $381.0 million in 2015, $40.9 million or 9.7% lower than the total revenues of $421.9 million in 2014. The change in total revenues by revenue component was as follows (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, Increase (decrease) 2015 2014 $ % . . .
