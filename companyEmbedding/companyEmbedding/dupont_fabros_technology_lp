(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. We caution investors that any forward-looking statements presented in this report, or which management may make orally or in writing from time to time, are based on management's beliefs and assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. When used, the words "anticipate," "believe," "expect," "intend," "may," "might," "plan," "estimate," "project," "should," "will," "result" and similar expressions, which do not relate solely to historical matters, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance, which may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. We caution you that while forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future performance and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on past forward-looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends.  Overview   another DLR merger subsidiary will be merged with and into the OP, and the OP will become a subsidiary of DLR (the "Partnership Merger" and, together with the Company Merger, the "Mergers").  Pursuant to the terms and conditions in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Mergers:   each common unit of partnership interests in the OP will be converted into the right to receive 0.545 common units in the DLR OP, or, in the alternative, each unit holder may elect to redeem his or her units and receive 0.545 shares of DLR common stock for each unit; and  Table of Contents   each share of DFT's Series C Preferred Stock will be converted into the right to receive one share of a newly designated class of preferred stock of DLR, which will have substantially similar rights, privileges, preferences and interests as DFT's 6.625% Series C Preferred Stock.  The consummation of the Mergers is subject to certain customary closing conditions, including, among others, approval of the Company Merger by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock, approval of the issuance of DLR common stock in connection with the Company Merger by a majority of the votes cast by the holders of DLR common stock, the absence of certain legal impediments to the consummation of the Mergers, the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed by DLR in connection with the Mergers, approval for listing on the New York Stock Exchange of the shares of DLR common stock to be issued in connection with the Company Merger, the absence of a material adverse effect on either DLR or us and compliance by the DLR parties and us with each party's respective obligations under the Merger Agreement. The obligations of the parties to consummate the Mergers are not subject to any financing condition or the receipt of any financing by the DLR parties. There can be no assurance that the proposed transaction will be consummated.   The weighted average remaining term of our commenced leases was 5.0 years; and   We served five of the Fortune 25 and 21 of the Fortune 1000, which includes private or foreign enterprises of equivalent size.  Our data centers are strategically located in three major population centers with a history of strong demand for wholesale data center space - Northern Virginia, suburban Chicago, Illinois and Santa Clara, California. We have acquired property in three new markets:   the greater Toronto area, where we have commenced development of the first phase of the facility; the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area, where we have commenced pre-development activities; and   the Phoenix, Arizona market.  Each of our current and expansion markets has significant electrical power availability and hubs of extensive fiber network connectivity. As of June 30, 2017, we owned the following properties:   Six phases of existing data center facilities under development;   Two data center facilities with a phase or phases available for future development; and   Parcels of land held for future development of six data centers.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

BUSINESS, (ii) AT THE TIME OF THE COMMENCEMENT AND
CONSUMMATION OF THE EXCHANGE OFFER THE UNDERSIGNED HAS NOT ENTERED
INTO ANY ARRANGEMENT OR UNDERSTANDING WITH ANY PERSON TO

RESALE OF THE EXCHANGE NOTES. BY TENDERING ORIGINAL NOTES PURSUANT
TO THE EXCHANGE OFFER AND EXECUTING THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL, OR
EFFECTING DELIVERY OF AN AGENT’S MESSAGE IN LIEU THEREOF, A
HOLDER OF ORIGINAL NOTES THAT IS A BROKER-DEALER REPRESENTS AND
AGREES, CONSISTENT WITH CERTAIN INTERPRETIVE LETTERS ISSUED BY THE
STAFF OF THE DIVISION OF CORPORATION FINANCE OF THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION TO THIRD PARTIES, THAT (A) SUCH ORIGINAL
NOTES HELD BY THE BROKER-DEALER ARE HELD ONLY AS A NOMINEE, OR
(B) SUCH ORIGINAL NOTES WERE ACQUIRED BY SUCH BROKER-DEALER
FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT AS A RESULT OF MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES OR
OTHER TRADING ACTIVITIES AND IT WILL DELIVER THE PROSPECTUS (AS
AMENDED OR SUPPLEMENTED FROM TIME TO TIME) MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS
OF THE SECURITIES ACT IN CONNECTION WITH ANY RESALE OF SUCH
EXCHANGE NOTES (PROVIDED THAT, BY SO ACKNOWLEDGING AND BY
DELIVERING A PROSPECTUS, SUCH BROKER-DEALER WILL NOT BE DEEMED TO
ADMIT THAT IT IS AN “UNDERWRITER” WITHIN THE MEANING OF
THE SECURITIES ACT).

THE COMPANY HAS AGREED THAT, SUBJECT
TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT, THE
PROSPECTUS, AS IT MAY BE AMENDED OR SUPPLEMENTED FROM TIME TO TIME,
MAY BE USED BY A PARTICIPATING BROKER-DEALER (AS DEFINED BELOW) IN
CONNECTION WITH RESALES OF EXCHANGE NOTES RECEIVED IN EXCHANGE FOR
ORIGINAL NOTES, WHERE SUCH ORIGINAL NOTES WERE ACQUIRED BY SUCH
PARTICIPATING BROKER-DEALER FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT AS A RESULT OF
MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES OR OTHER TRADING ACTIVITIES, FOR A PERIOD
ENDING ON THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE DATE ON WHICH THE EXCHANGE
OFFER REGISTRATION STATEMENT IS DECLARED EFFECTIVE OR, IF EARLIER,
THE DATE ON WHICH A BROKER-DEALER IS NO LONGER REQUIRED TO DELIVER
A PROSPECTUS IN CONNECTION WITH MARKET-MAKING OR OTHER TRADING
ACTIVITIES. IN THAT


REGARD, EACH BROKER-DEALER WHO ACQUIRED ORIGINAL
NOTES FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT AS A RESULT OF MARKET-MAKING OR OTHER
TRADING ACTIVITIES (A “PARTICIPATING BROKER-DEALER”),
BY TENDERING SUCH ORIGINAL NOTES AND EXECUTING THIS LETTER OF
TRANSMITTAL, OR EFFECTING DELIVERY OF AN AGENT’S MESSAGE IN
LIEU THEREOF, AGREES THAT, UPON RECEIPT OF NOTICE FROM THE COMPANY
OF THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY EVENT OR THE DISCOVERY OF ANY FACT THAT
MAKES ANY STATEMENT CONTAINED IN THE PROSPECTUS UNTRUE IN ANY
MATERIAL RESPECT OR THAT CAUSES THE PROSPECTUS TO OMIT TO STATE A
MATERIAL FACT NECESSARY IN ORDER TO MAKE THE STATEMENTS CONTAINED
THEREIN, IN LIGHT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THEY WERE MADE,
NOT MISLEADING OR OF THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN OTHER EVENTS
SPECIFIED IN THE REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT, SUCH PARTICIPATING
BROKER-DEALER WILL SUSPEND THE SALE OF EXCHANGE NOTES PURSUANT TO
THE PROSPECTUS UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS AMENDED OR SUPPLEMENTED THE
PROSPECTUS TO CORRECT SUCH MISSTATEMENT OR OMISSION AND HAS
FURNISHED COPIES OF THE AMENDED OR SUPPLEMENTED PROSPECTUS TO THE
PARTICIPATING BROKER-DEALER OR THE COMPANY HAS GIVEN NOTICE THAT
THE SALE OF THE EXCHANGE NOTES MAY BE RESUMED, AS THE CASE MAY BE.
IF THE COMPANY GIVES SUCH NOTICE TO SUSPEND THE SALE OF THE
EXCHANGE NOTES, THEY SHALL EXTEND THE ONE-YEAR PERIOD REFERRED TO
ABOVE DURING WHICH PARTICIPATING BROKER-DEALERS ARE ENTITLED TO USE
THE PROSPECTUS IN CONNECTION WITH THE RESALE OF EXCHANGE NOTES BY
THE NUMBER OF DAYS DURING THE PERIOD FROM AND INCLUDING THE DATE OF
THE GIVING OF SUCH NOTICE TO AND INCLUDING THE DATE WHEN
PARTICIPATING BROKER-DEALERS SHALL HAVE RECEIVED COPIES OF THE
SUPPLEMENTED OR AMENDED PROSPECTUS NECESSARY TO PERMIT RESALES OF
THE EXCHANGE NOTES OR TO AND INCLUDING THE DATE ON WHICH THE
COMPANY HAS GIVEN NOTICE THAT THE SALE OF EXCHANGE NOTES MAY BE
RESUMED, AS THE CASE MAY BE.

AS A RESULT, A PARTICIPATING
BROKER-DEALER WHO INTENDS TO USE THE PROSPECTUS IN CONNECTION WITH
RESALES OF EXCHANGE NOTES RECEIVED IN EXCHANGE FOR ORIGINAL NOTES
PURSUANT TO THE EXCHANGE OFFER MUST NOTIFY THE COMPANY, OR CAUSE
THE COMPANY TO BE NOTIFIED, ON OR PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION DATE,
THAT IT IS A PARTICIPATING BROKER-DEALER. SUCH NOTICE MAY BE GIVEN
IN THE SPACE PROVIDED ABOVE OR MAY BE DELIVERED TO THE EXCHANGE
AGENT AT THE ADDRESS SET FORTH IN THE PROSPECTUS IN THE SECTION
ENTITLED “THE EXCHANGE OFFER” UNDER THE HEADING
“EXCHANGE AGENT.”

The undersigned will, upon request,
execute and deliver any additional documents deemed by the Company
to be necessary or desirable to complete the sale, assignment and
transfer of the Original Notes tende

your clients for whom you hold Original Notes regarding the

clients for whom you hold Original Notes registered in your name or
in the name of your nominee, or who hold Original Notes registered
in their own names, we are enclosing the following
documents:

1. A Prospectus dated
            ,
2010;

2. The Letter of Transmittal for
your use and for the information (or the use, where relevant) of
your clients;

3. A Notice of Guaranteed Delivery
to be used to accept the Exchange Offer if certificates for
Original Notes are not immediately available or time will not
permit all required documents to reach the Exchange Agent (as
defined below) prior to the Expiration Date (as defined below) or
if the procedure for book-entry transfer cannot be completed on a
timely basis;

4. A form of letter that may be sent
to your clients for whose account you hold Original Notes
registered in your name or the name of your nominee, with space
provided for obtaining such clients’ instructions with regard

5. Return envelopes addressed to The
Bank of New York Mellon, the exchange agent for Original Notes (the
“Exchange Agent”).

YOUR PROMPT ACTION IS REQUESTED. THE

PURSUANT TO THE EXCHANGE OFFER MAY BE WITHDRAWN AT ANY TIME BEFORE
THE EXPIRATION DATE.

Prospectus.

If holders of Original Notes wish to

on a timely basis, a tender may be effected by following the
guaranteed delivery procedures described in the Prospectus in the
section entitled “The Exchange Offer” under the heading
“Guaranteed Delivery Procedures.”

The Company will, upon request,
reimburse brokers, dealers, commercial banks and trust companies
for reasonable and necessary costs and expenses incurred by them in
forwarding the Prospectus and the related documents to the
beneficial owners of Original Notes held by them as nominee or in a

SECURITY & COMPLIANCE
Your IT infrastructure means everything to your business. We make it our mission to keep it physically safe and secure.  

 



 
Home > Features > Security & Compliance 






 
Maximum Protection
Security on Site
Each data center entrance is monitored 24x7x365 by officers in our Security Operations Center (SOC), which is enclosed in ballistic-grade glass and has direct visibility into the main lobby area, as well as the loading dock area. Some DFT facilities offer added protection with exterior fences, gated access, as well as natural and man-made obstructions placed around the facility to prevent vehicular penetration.  
The DFT SOC is staffed around the clock by Security Officers who are responsible for asset protection through management of access control, recurring foot patrols and video surveillance.
All visitors to DFT data centers must present a current government-issued ID prior to entering. The main areas within our data centers have numerous security challenge points, including access card and biometric authentication at a portal entrance to our data center area. DFT proactively monitors its premises, as well as your individual space within our facility, using CCTV camera surveillance. Video footage is retained for a minimum of 95 days.
As a DFT customer, you also have options for additional security measures, including:
Gallery fencing installed in your computer room to separate DFT-maintained areas from your critical asset area
Biometric authentication to access your computer room
Designated areas within your space(s) that restrict access to equipment
Limited access to pre-authorized personnel only
Committed to Compliance
Physical security is just the beginning. Many DFT data centers are ISO 27001 certified and all are SSAE 16 compliant, and we assist our clients with compliance and security-related audits, such as HIPAA, PCI, FedRAMP and others.
Moving ahead, you can count on us to work toward and earn the certifications that will matter to your industry.

CONNECTIVITY
Ensuring a secure, steady connection to your customers, partners and the world.

 



 
Home > Features > Connectivity 






 
Connect Your Way
Multiple network providers are available at each DFT data center to keep you connected to your customers and business partners while supporting your applications and critical IT infrastructure.
A carrier-neutral, network-agnostic data center provider, DFT offers you network connectivity through multiple network carriers, including dark fiber providers and lit carriers. We have relationships with 40 network carriers, two globally leading Internet Exchanges (IXPs) and multiple cloud service providers. If your network carrier of choice is not already onsite, we can invite them to establish their presence in a DFT data center on your behalf.
Each DFT data center features a multi-lateral underground conduit system, owned and operated by DFT. The fiber-optic cables enter the data center via multiple underground Points of Entry (POEs) for added security and diversity—leading to a centralized Meet-Me-Room (MMR) and customer computer rooms.
DFT offers a range of options to meet your connectivity requirements, whether you wish to connect to a network carrier of your choice, peer your traffic on an Internet Exchange or take advantage of dark fiber in one of our campus environments.
Whether you’re looking to directly connect with a network carrier of your choice or connect to an IXP within a data center or across a campus, DFT’s diverse dark fiber connectivity offers you the flexibility and scalability you need. Dark fiber delivers on the promise of high-performance, scalability, network reliability, redundancy and low latency.
No matter what your network strategy and requirements may be, DFT can enable you to achieve your goals. Our data centers are designed to facilitate easy installation and feature redundant options for you and your carriers via our various network service offerings. This ensures your business is always connected.

More...Did you know ?Multiples charts provide an effective way to quickly analyze a company's valuation over a period of time, and compare it against the valuation of another company, a personal list, or a market index. About Market MultiplesMany methods can be used to value a company. In reality, business valuation is often a combination of these different approaches. One of the most widely used quantitative methods is the market multiples method. The market valuation is utilized generally as a primary market input, to provide an objective starting point for the valuation. Put simply, this method multiplies the sales or profits of a business by an industry averaged multiplier to calculate the Market Value of the business.Current multiples include:- Historical multiples based on standardized financials for the last completed fiscal period: Last, Last Twelve Months (LTM);- Forward multiples based on consensus estimates for the current fiscal period and next ones: Next Twelve Months (NTM), FY0, FY1.Current multiples based on per-share metrics (such as earnings per share or book value per share) are calculated using the last closing price, while current multiples based on company-level metrics (such as net sales, EBIT or EBITDA) are calculated using the current market cap or EV (Enterprise Value).
