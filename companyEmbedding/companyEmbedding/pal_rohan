Muscle Machines In Retail - Piece O' Cake...

						in Muscle Machines 






 
 
we are thrilled that the MM can now be found in the market after an agonizingly long wait prior to finding a new home with maisto.
to be able to have product at retail 6 months after our deal was finalized is remarkable given some of the obstacles we had.
but the product is there, not without a couple of hiccups along the way.
