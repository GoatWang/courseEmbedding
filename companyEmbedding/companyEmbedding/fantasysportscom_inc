What Our Customers Are Saying



Jeff S.
Love it !! Extremely helpful for drafting at the last minute. If I had paid 20 dollars for it, I would have won it twice back. Thank you guys for a solid app.


Ben L.
I use this as a good guide to start my lineups. Shows me who to pick when i have to cut back on pay.


rtloughlin
If you're not using this app someone else in your league knows more than you do...


James L.
Great starting point You can use the lineups they give you and you could still win but I use it as a starting point and mix it in with my research and it's def worth getting trust me


Adam S.
Very useful I use this as a guide instead of a steadfast lineup creator, but it gives you useful combinations based on the players you like or don't like.


Michael W.
Nice Great way to find that player you may have overlooked or not thought of and it gives you nice lineups to work with to.


Chris M.
Great app. Have used it several times to get my lineup the little bit extra to win. It's helps to have their projections as well as some value picks.


Ryan W.
Great app It is updated often and is pretty good at projecting points.


Bret S.
Amazing The quickest and easiest way to find steals on Draftkings. I use it every day.


Kevin M.
Very insightful Daily fantasy player on multiple sites and this app is helpful on them all.


Rich P.
App Mad kool.. great app to have. Not hard to use. Hope to get the year subscription soon.. I recommend this app. Very helpful in dfs. Let's all get a share of these $$$$$ its plenty for all.. All it takes is a min to get you win!!! Good Luck winning every one.

Carl P.
My lineups have seen a vast increase in points


William P.
Great for help in generating lineups with option to love/hate players and projections which you can adjust if you feel their too high or too low


Eric S.
Excellent! This app is amazing, especially when your on the fly. Both the Fanduel and DraftKings version are very reliable and detailed, with tons of bonus information that will help you get that edge your looking for. The recent updates have made things more user friendly than before. Keep it up guys. Well done! 5 STARS!


Tom C.
Helps you make decisions with confidence This is the only daily app that gets me consistent results. Against sharks this is a no brainer.


Bobby F.
Great lineups Can't reveal my method but using lineups from this app along with the secret sauce have turned my season around...I'm plus 670.00 in four weeks just playing contests with smaller fees


Daniel B.
Absolute best No other app comes even close.


Billy A.
Great app Helps cut down research time. Only $3 a week is nothing when your winning in DFS I don't watch NBA but I profit most in it because of this app.. The losers must be complaining about a measly 3 bucks. Thanks for the help!!


Deandre W.
Enjoy using this app it gives good information and it also helped me to win numerous of times.


Jon P.
Love it Fantastic way to help build lineups for dfs.


Rick L.
Solid app I've done a little better since using this app. Give it a try


Roger J.
Great app!!!!! Since I been using it I have seen my scores going up, now just need the bankroll to go up!!!!!


Chris E.
Spend money to make money Considering what they give you and compared to other sites. Its a great deal. Wish it was free , but worth the investment


koncretegudda
Just gotta trust it This app is not bad at all the layout is amazing, if you play more 5050 games you have a higher chance of winning they always produce pretty good lineups sometimes you just have to play them I noticed that.


Dan C.
Awesome Lineup Gen Would be even better of there was a way to export the lineups to be able to import into FanDuel
