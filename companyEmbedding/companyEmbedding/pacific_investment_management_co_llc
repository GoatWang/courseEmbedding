Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Pacific Investment Management Company, LLC (commonly called PIMCO), is an American investment management firm headquartered in Newport Beach, California, with over 2,000 employees working in 13 offices across 12 countries, and $1.51 trillion in assets under management as of 30 June 2016. The company provides mutual funds and other portfolio management and asset allocation solutions for millions of investors worldwide. PIMCO offers a broad list of investment strategies that encompass the entire risk spectrum and capital structure, including core bonds and credit, structured credit, alternatives, real assets, equities and currencies.
PIMCO oversees investments on behalf of millions of clients, including retirement savers, public and private pension plans, educational institutions, central banks and government agencies, foundations and endowments and financial intermediaries among others.
The firm, a prominent thought leader in the financial markets, is known to have coined and popularized the phrase "The New Normal" in the aftermath of the subprime mortgage crisis in 2009. "The new normal" as a standalone phrase has a long history dating to the post-First World War era and then seeing a new resurgence in use in the post 9/11 era.[3] More recently, PIMCO introduced "The New Neutral" thesis to characterize a period of lower but stable economic growth, and interest rates to remain lower than historically for a longer period of time.
In April 2015, PIMCO announced the hire of former Federal Reserve Chairman, Dr. Ben Bernanke as a Senior Advisor, following in the footsteps of predecessor Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan.

Leadership[edit]
PIMCO appointed Emmanuel Roman as CEO effective 1 November 2016, succeeding Douglas M. Hodge,[4] and the firm's President is Jay Jacobs. Dan Ivascyn, Group Chief Investment Officer (CIO),[5] broadly oversees portfolio management and investment strategy. There are also five other CIOs: Andrew Balls, CIO Global Fixed Income; Mark Kiesel, CIO Global Credit; Scott Mather, CIO U.S. Core Strategies; Marc Seidner, CIO Non-traditional Strategies; and Mihir Worah, CIO Real Return and Asset Allocation.
History[edit]
The firm was founded in 1971,[1] launching with $12 million of assets. Previously, PIMCO had functioned as a unit of Pacific Life Insurance Co., managing separate accounts for that insurer's clients. In 2000, PIMCO was acquired by Allianz SE, a large global financial services company based in Munich, Germany, but the firm continues to operate as an autonomous subsidiary of Allianz.
On 26 September 2014, it was announced that Bill Gross, Co-founder and Former Chief Investment Officer (dubbed the "Bond King" in the investment arena), was stepping down to join Janus Capital Group.[1]

Pacific Investment Management Company, LLC (commonly called PIMCO), is an American investment management firm headquartered in Newport Beach, California, with over 2,000 employees working in 13 offices across 12 countries, and $1.51 trillion in assets under management as of 30 June 2016. The company provides mutual funds and other portfolio management and asset allocation solutions for millions of investors worldwide. PIMCO offers a broad list of investment strategies that encompass the entire risk spectrum and capital structure, including core bonds and credit, structured credit, alternatives, real assets, equities and currencies.
PIMCO oversees investments on behalf of millions of clients, including retirement savers, public and private pension plans, educational institutions, central banks and government agencies, foundations and endowments and financial intermediaries among others.
The firm, a prominent thought leader in the financial markets, is known to have coined and popularized the phrase "The New Normal" in the aftermath of the subprime mortgage crisis in 2009. "The new normal" as a standalone phrase has a long history dating to the post-First World War era and then seeing a new resurgence in use in the post 9/11 era.[3] More recently, PIMCO introduced "The New Neutral" thesis to characterize a period of lower but stable economic growth, and interest rates to remain lower than historically for a longer period of time.
In April 2015, PIMCO announced the hire of former Federal Reserve Chairman, Dr. Ben Bernanke as a Senior Advisor, following in the footsteps of predecessor Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan.

Leadership[edit]
PIMCO appointed Emmanuel Roman as CEO effective 1 November 2016, succeeding Douglas M. Hodge,[4] and the firm's President is Jay Jacobs. Dan Ivascyn, Group Chief Investment Officer (CIO),[5] broadly oversees portfolio management and investment strategy. There are also five other CIOs: Andrew Balls, CIO Global Fixed Income; Mark Kiesel, CIO Global Credit; Scott Mather, CIO U.S. Core Strategies; Marc Seidner, CIO Non-traditional Strategies; and Mihir Worah, CIO Real Return and Asset Allocation.
History[edit]
The firm was founded in 1971,[1] launching with $12 million of assets. Previously, PIMCO had functioned as a unit of Pacific Life Insurance Co., managing separate accounts for that insurer's clients. In 2000, PIMCO was acquired by Allianz SE, a large global financial services company based in Munich, Germany, but the firm continues to operate as an autonomous subsidiary of Allianz.
On 26 September 2014, it was announced that Bill Gross, Co-founder and Former Chief Investment Officer (dubbed the "Bond King" in the investment arena), was stepping down to join Janus Capital Group.[1]

Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.
