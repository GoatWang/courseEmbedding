Commitment to Action 



The NALCAB Catalyst Fund



Commitment by


    National Association for Latino Community Asset Builders  





In 2015, NALCAB, National Association for Latino Community Asset Builders, committed to launching the NALCAB Catalyst Fund and deploying $25 million to strengthen underserved communities by creating affordable housing opportunities. The Fund will directly acquire real estate assets, sourcing potential investments from NALCAB Network developers. The acquisition strategy is aimed at producing or preserving 470 units of affordable housing that creates access to employment, education and health resources, during this commitment. After rehabbing homes, the Fund will seek to sell single-family units to well-prepared homebuyers, prioritizing sales to tenants already in place. The disposition strategy is aimed at long-term affordability and avoiding involuntary displacement of low-income people. The development of the NALCAB Catalyst Fund is made possible with support from the JP Morgan Chase Foundation and the Ford Foundation and the deep experience of nonprofit developers in the NALCAB Network.

Details

NALCAB, National Association for Latino Community Asset Builders, commits to launching the NALCAB Catalyst Fund and deploying $25 million to strengthen underserved and distressed communities by creating affordable housing opportunities that open paths to economic opportunity for low-income and minority individuals.  The Fund will invest in the acquisition and total development costs for single family and small multifamily projects in order to serve households with a mix of incomes and produce a financial return.  The Fund seeks to finance and develop housing that will serve as a launching point for economic mobility by providing family stability and access to employment, education, and health care resources, through the proximity to resources, the transit-orientation of the site and direct services provided by non-profit partners.  The development of the NALCAB Catalyst Fund is made possible with support from the JP Morgan Chase Foundation and the Ford Foundation and the deep experience of nonprofit developers in the NALCAB Network.  
Acquisition Strategy: The Fund will directly acquire real estate assets, sourcing potential investments from NALCAB Network developers. The acquisition strategy is aimed at producing or preserving affordable housing that creates access to employment, education and health resources. The typical investments will range from $1.5 million to $4 million, and NALCAB anticipates 7 - 10 separate deals totally 470 units of housing (single family and multifamily).  NALCAB has already identified an actionable pipeline of potential investments within the NALCAB Network, including in TX, AZ, CO, NM, NV, and IL.  NALCAB will underwrite projects to ensure that potential investments demonstrate the ability to meet the financial return and impact expectations that have been established for the Fund.  Other key criteria for selecting investments include the following:  analysis of take-out scenarios; favorable market analysis; the existence of a pipeline of buyers/renters; development capacity of the local partner; physical condition of properties and cost estimates on rehabilitation; past performance of rental acquisitions; the projected performance of the project in an environment of increasing interest rates; avoiding an undue concentration of investment in any given market or with any given developer partner.
Implementation Strategy: NALCAB will manage the fund through a subsidiary company, building on NALCABs infrastructure and drawing on expertise from CPLC.  The Fund will engage highly experienced NALCAB Network developers for development, management, broker and homebuyer counseling services.  NALCAB will select developer partners and projects based on the partners experience developing substantially similar projects in the same local market.  
Disposition Strategy:  After rehabbing homes, the Fund will seek to sell single-family units to well-prepared homebuyers, prioritizing sales to tenants already in place. NALCAB Network Developers will have first right of refusal to purchase multifamily rental units. The disposition strategy is aimed at long-term affordability and avoiding involuntary displacement of low-income people.
Risk Mitigation: NALCAB will provide other investors with a 5% loss protection utilizing funding already committed by the JP Morgan Chase Foundation. The Fund will remain in first position in local level transactions ensuring direct recourse to real estate collateral.  The strong market knowledge and relationships of the local non-profit developer-partners will also be crucial for minimizing operational risks and leveraging take-out subsidy from local municipalities to ensure long-term affordability, including first-time homebuyer assistance and financing for the non-profit to purchase the rental portfolio from the Fund.
By working closely with a highly experienced and well-coordinated network of nonprofit developers, including the four partner organizations on this Commitment, the Catalyst Fund will realize significant competitive advantages, which will support rapid deployment of capital and enhance social impact.  These developers have deep understanding of their local markets and specific experience developing the targeted housing types.  By utilizing this developer network, the Catalyst Fund will be able to leverage market intelligence and existing local relationships as well as provide housing counseling and other services for tenants and buyers.
2015 Q3
Capitalization: NALCAB Network Investors, LLC makes an initial $2.6 million equity investment utilizing funds provided by the JP Morgan Chase Foundation.
Deployment: The Fund makes its first acquisition, deploying $2 million.  
2015 Q4
Capitalization: NALCAB Catalyst Fund completes its initial closing with investors in the amount of $10 million.
Deployment: The Fund makes its first acquisition, deploying $2 million.  
2016 Q1
Deployment: The Fund makes its second and third acquisitions, deploying $6 million (for a total of $8 million).
Impact: Construction/rehab ongoing.  
2016 Q2
Capitalization: NALCAB Catalyst Fund completes its second closing with investors in the amount of $5 million.
Deployment: The Fund makes its second and third acquisitions, deploying $5 million (for a total of $7 million).
Impact: First units leased. Construction/rehab ongoing.  
2016 Q3
Capitalization: NALCAB Catalyst Fund completes its final closing with investors in the amount of $7.4 million. Capitalization completed.
Deployment: The Fund makes its fourth acquisition, deploying $4 million (for a total of $12 million).  
2016 Q4
Deployment: The Fund makes its fifth and sixth acquisitions, deploying $5 million (for a total of $17 million).  
2017 Q1
Deployment: The Fund makes its seventh acquisitions, deploying $4 million (for a total of $21 million).  
2017 Q2
Deployment: The Fund makes its eighth and ninth acquisitions, deploying $4 million (for a total of $25 million).  Deployment completed.
This is framed as a two-year commitment between formation of the fund and full deployment of the capital.  The Fund has a term of five years from the final closing and will generate impact in communities throughout this period.   While the exact mix of rental and for sale housing will be determined by the properties that are ultimately acquired, NALCAB estimates that 50 units in small multifamily buildings will be leased and 420 single family units will be sold.  Of the 420 single family units, 220 will be leased for a period of time prior to sale.  NALCAB estimates that half of the families accessing these housing opportunities will be low income (earning less than 80% of area median income) and 75% will be moderate income (earning less than 100% of area median income).  This effort will also result in approximately $12 million in contracts for small, local businesses and will create 250 full-time, temporary jobs and 300 part-time temporary jobs, all in the construction and real estate industries.


    Background  

Place has a strong determining influence on ones economic opportunity, health, and education. The foreclosure crisis and ensuing recession badly damaged the promise of economic mobility for people of color and younger families; the people who represent the future of our nations economy.  The Pew Research Centers Social and Demographic Trends project reported that median household wealth among Hispanics fell from $18,359 in 2005 to $6,325 in 2009, a 66% drop driven by foreclosure and plummeting home values. Research from the Federal Reserve of St. Louis documents that younger families (headed by someone younger than 40) lost significantly larger portions of their wealth in the recession than older families, primarily due to mortgage debt and declining housing values.
The devastating impact of the recession on the balance sheets of working-class families is now calcifying into a structural economic problem.  The Pew Research Center reported in December 2014 that, even as the economic recovery has begun to mend asset prices, not all households have benefited alike, and wealth inequality has widened along racial and ethnic lines.  It is imperative for the health of the American economy to reverse these trends in communities of color and particularly among Latinos, our nations fastest growing demographic segment.
Affordable housing that connects families to economic opportunity, healthy environments and educational advancement is critical for addressing this challenge.  The reality of decreased public investment in affordable housing, coupled with appreciating real estate values, is making it increasingly difficult to develop affordable housing.  With less public investment, private investments will play a greater role in financing affordable housing.  There is a pressing need to develop mechanisms that better connect private impact capital with actionable opportunities to develop affordable housing in places that connect diverse communities of color to opportunity.


    Partnership Opportunities  

September 2016
The NALCAB Catalyst Fund presents impact investors with the opportunity to invest equity and/ or debt (in the form of program related investments) for a term of five years from final closing. The Fund seeks to achieve an approximate mix of 70% equity to 30% debt in the capitalization. A grant from the JP Morgan Chase Foundation has allowed NALCAB and three of its member organizations to make a seed equity investment of $2.6 million.
The NALCAB Catalyst Fund will work closely with nonprofit developers in the NALCAB Network to identify and acquire real estate that matches the Funds guidelines.  Local organizations will have the opportunity to provide services including development, property management, brokering and/or housing counseling.


Progress Reports

September 2016
With seed funding from the JPMorgan Chase Foundation and additional support from the Ford Foundation, NALCAB created NALCAB Network Investors, LLC (NNI, LLC), a fund capitalized at $2.6 million, which is jointly owned by NALCAB and three of its CDFI member organizations. NALCAB has also created a subsidiary fund management company called Escalera Community Investments to manage NNI, LLC. The partners have secured two small multifamily properties that provide 23 affordable units and a commercial lease opportunity in neighborhoods with appreciating real estate prices and which provide low-income people with access to jobs, health services and quality education. They are moving through due diligence conversations with a range of potential investors and, in 2016, NNI, LLC and a variety of other investors will establish the NALCAB Catalyst Fund. The two deals already secured by NNI, LLC will be "initial investments" for the Catalyst Fund and they demonstrate how the investment strategy works in completed deals.
