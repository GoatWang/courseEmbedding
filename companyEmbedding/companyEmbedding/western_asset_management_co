History[edit]
Early years (1971-1986)[edit]
Western Asset Management Company was founded in October 1971 by United California Bank (which later became First Interstate), and became an SEC-registered investment advisor in December of that year. In December 1986, Western Asset was acquired by Legg Mason, Inc., and is now an independent affiliate of that firm that operates as an autonomous investment management company.
Expansion (1996-present)[edit]
In February 1996, Legg Mason acquired Lehman Brothers Global Asset Management Limited, based in London, to broaden Western Asset's non-dollar capabilities. Now known as Western Asset Management Company Limited, it operates as the firm’s London office. To enhance its presence in Asia, Western Asset Management Company Pte. Ltd. was established in Singapore.
In December 2003, the fixed-income division of Rothschild Asset Management (Singapore) Limited was acquired by Legg Mason and merged into the existing operation. To further develop Western Asset's capabilities and global presence, Legg Mason acquired a substantial part of Citigroup's asset management business in exchange for its brokerage and capital markets business. As part of the transaction, Western Asset gained new offices in New York, São Paulo, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Melbourne, in addition to related staff and assets.
In December 2011, Western Asset opened a representative office in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates to further expand its global footprint and better serve clients located in the region.

History[edit]
Early years (1971-1986)[edit]
Western Asset Management Company was founded in October 1971 by United California Bank (which later became First Interstate), and became an SEC-registered investment advisor in December of that year. In December 1986, Western Asset was acquired by Legg Mason, Inc., and is now an independent affiliate of that firm that operates as an autonomous investment management company.
Expansion (1996-present)[edit]
In February 1996, Legg Mason acquired Lehman Brothers Global Asset Management Limited, based in London, to broaden Western Asset's non-dollar capabilities. Now known as Western Asset Management Company Limited, it operates as the firm’s London office. To enhance its presence in Asia, Western Asset Management Company Pte. Ltd. was established in Singapore.
In December 2003, the fixed-income division of Rothschild Asset Management (Singapore) Limited was acquired by Legg Mason and merged into the existing operation. To further develop Western Asset's capabilities and global presence, Legg Mason acquired a substantial part of Citigroup's asset management business in exchange for its brokerage and capital markets business. As part of the transaction, Western Asset gained new offices in New York, São Paulo, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Melbourne, in addition to related staff and assets.
In December 2011, Western Asset opened a representative office in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates to further expand its global footprint and better serve clients located in the region.

Overview 















Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 provides that money market funds may not acquire any security other than a “weekly liquid asset” unless, immediately following such purchase, at least 30% of its total assets would be invested in weekly liquid assets. In addition, the Rule provides that taxable money market funds may not acquire any security other than a “daily liquid asset” unless, immediately following such purchase, at least 10% of its total assets would be invested in daily liquid assets.
Daily Liquid Assets include (i) cash; (ii) direct obligations of the U.S. Government; and (iii) securities that will mature or are subject to a demand feature that is exercisable and payable within one business Day. May include the effect of receivables from pending sales and payables from pending purchases.

		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. The Fund may impose a fee upon sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time. 
 The Fund's yield may be affected by changes in interest rates and changes in credit ratings. Certain investors may be subject to the Federal Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), and state and local taxes may apply. Capital gains, if any, are fully taxable. Please see the Fund's prospectus for additional fund specific risks.

 Performance 






Performance








IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: The performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results, and current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown.  Average annual total returns and calendar year returns assumes reinvestment of all distributions at net asset value and the deduction of all fund expenses. Performance would have been lower if fees had not been reimbursed or waived in various periods. Performance for other share classes will vary due to differences in sales charge structure and class expenses. All classes of shares are not available through all distribution channels.
The Current SEC 7-day yield represents net interest income generated by the investments for the past 7 days and assumes that the same income is generated each week over a 365-day period. The 7-day yield more closely reflects current fund earnings than does total returns. Yields for other share classes may vary due to differences in sales charge structure and class expenses. The Fund's yields reflect expense reimbursements or fee waivers, if any; absent these expense reimbursements and/or fee waivers, performance would have been lower.

**Gross expenses are the Fund's total annual operating expenses for the share class(es) shown.  Net expenses for Class(es) Investor & Select reflect contractual fee waivers and/or reimbursements, where these reductions reduce the Fund's gross expenses, which cannot be terminated prior to Dec 31, 2018 without Board consent.

 Holdings 






Holdings









IMPORTANT HOLDINGS INFORMATION: The information shown above relates to Tax Free Reserves Portfolio ("the Portfolio"), the registered investment company in which the Fund invests all of its investable assets. The Funds utilize a master/feeder structure by investing all of their assets in a master portfolio. Assets are reported at the master portfolio level. As of the period ended April 30, 2016, the data in the “Value” column represents the market value of the Portfolio’s investments.  For those periods prior to April 30, 2016, the data in the “Value” column represents the amortized cost value. 
The Portfolio's investments are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value, in accordance with Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The amortized cost method of valuation involves valuing portfolio securities at their cost and thereafter assuming a constant amortization to maturity of any discount or premium.
The Portfolio's use of amortized cost is subject to its compliance with certain conditions as specified by Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act. The Portfolio continues to meet the requirements of Rule 2a-7 that permit it to utilize amortized cost to value its securities.
Portfolio holdings are subject to change at any time. Percentages are based on total investments. This information is provided for information purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to purchase or sell any security.
Derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance.

Weighted Average Maturity (WAM) is a weighted average of all the maturities of the securities held in a fund. WAM for money market funds can be used as a measure of sensitivity to interest rate changes. Generally, the longer the maturity, the greater the sensitivity. Weighted Average Life (WAL) is the weighted average of the life of the securities held in a fund or portfolio and can be used as a measure of sensitivity to changes in liquidity and/or credit risk. Generally, the higher the value, the greater the sensitivity. However, unlike WAM, WAL does not include interest rate resets in its calculation. Effective Maturity is a measure of a bond's maturity which takes into consideration the possibility that the issuer may call the bond before its maturity date.
