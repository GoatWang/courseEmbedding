 Owl Technology







Data diodes are hardware based, bound by the laws of physics and not susceptible to zero day vulnerabilities or any other hacks. These solutions are data and network agnostic, have been deployed across a range of industries and are recommended by the Department of Homeland Security. Being data agnostic we can move files, streaming video, TCP/IP, UDP, database records, historians, sensor data, high-res images, system backups, personnel records and many other types of data; along with industrial protocols like Modbus and OPC.  And our network independence lets us work on unclassified, secret and top secret networks for government solutions and IT and OT (Operations Technology) networks for our commercial and industrial customers.We offer all-in-one solutions with a standard 19” 1U rackmount form factor and a DIN rail form factor for industrial environments.  We also offer server based solutions that utilize off-the-shelf servers populated with our data diode cards.Designed to be scalable, new software licenses and modules allow end-users to increase bandwidth, add-on new interfaces, and support new protocols.

Our penetration testing mimics real-world attempts at infiltrating your network and includes testing wired and wireless networks, facility security, and susceptibility to phishing attacks. In addition, we’ll work with you to develop information security policies and procedures that are based on industry best practices yet remain well-suited to your business, culture, and management style. Ultimately, our cybersecurity work can help you implement changes to strengthen your entire company, from critical data confidentiality, integrity, and availability to regulatory compliance.
