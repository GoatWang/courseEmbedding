Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

Why Invest with U.S. Bank







U.S. Bank HomeInvestments and Wealth ManagementInvestment ManagementInvestment ManagementProfessionally managed options can open the investment world to you.OverviewIs It Right for Me?How to Get StartedFAQsToday's investment markets provide more opportunity than ever before, but the seemingly endless array of investment options can overwhelm individuals trying to make informed investment decisions on their own.
Financial professionals at U.S. Bank and U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc. offer a consultative approach to investment management. An advisor works as your partner in helping you understand the options available in today’s wide-ranging investment marketplace. Your advisor builds the investment process around you, your goals and individual circumstances that affect your approach to money management and investing.
By gaining a comprehensive understanding of you as an investor, your advisor is able to create a customized investment strategy that is consistent with your goals. The centerpiece of that plan is a personalized asset allocation strategy. You can choose from a variety of professionally managed investment programs.
Here’s an overview of each phase of the investment management cycle: See more
We start by creating your personal profile. This involves analyzing your financial needs and goals, considering your current situation and investment time frame, as well as your attitudes about investment risk.
Next, we develop your asset allocation strategy. We'll work together to develop an investment strategy, based on your profile, to allocate your assets. A well-diversified portfolio may combine different types of assets to attempt to achieve specific investment goals while potentially reducing overall portfolio risk.
Then we implement your portfolio. To set your plan in motion, we'll screen and recommend a combination of investment products based on how their performance and risk characteristics align with your circumstances and goals. You can choose from a full range of investment options, including:                

Stocks, bonds and mutual funds
Fixed- and variable-rate annuities
Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and Unit Investment Trusts (UITs)
Professionally-managed portfolios

Read about financial contributions from product partners for mutual funds, fixed annuities and variable annuities.

We manage your portfolio on an ongoing basis. Working with you, we'll continuously monitor your portfolio’s performance. Modifications, including rebalancing, can be made to the portfolio based on developments in the market.
We'll review progress regularly. You'll hear from your advisor on a regular basis throughout the year. You’ll also receive regular performance reports and information alerting you to changes in your portfolio and factors that may affect your financial goals and investment strategy.
 Like a good tax advisor or an attorney, a trusted financial professional can help you stay on track – and help simplify your life. Professionally managed investment portfolios take a disciplined approach to investing, but provide the flexibility to choose your level of involvement in the investment decision-making process.
By working with financial professionals at either U.S. Bank or U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc., you may benefit from:

Peace of mind in knowing that your investments are being managed and monitored by an experienced professional;
Investment strategies tailored to your specific goals and circumstances;
Ongoing support and monitoring of your investment progress;
The flexibility to modify your investment strategy as your needs and goals evolve; and
More time for you to spend on other aspects of your life.
To make informed decisions about your financial future, you need to understand your options. Knowledgeable professionals at U.S. Bank and U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc. can help simplify your financial life by creating a customized plan and monitoring its progress for you. What are the strategies for successful investing?It’s important to know who you are as an investor and what you want your portfolio to accomplish. The key steps include:

Identifying specific financial goals. These may include funding a child’s higher education, your own retirement, the purchase of a home, starting a business or other goals that are important to you.
Assessing the amount of time you have to achieve each goal. Setting time frames for each of your goals is key because it can help determine how long your money can keep working for you.
Understanding your own risk tolerance. Some investors are risk takers by nature while others are very conservative, but many fall somewhere in between. Age, personality, investment experience and financial circumstance can all affect your tolerance for risk.
Determining your asset allocation – in other words, the mix of assets you want to own across various classes of investments. Diversification may help reduce your overall risk. Your asset allocation strategy should support your goals while being consistent with your risk tolerance level.
Taking the time to review your overall portfolio performance, keeping your eye on the big picture. If your portfolio begins to drift from your asset allocation strategy, you may consider rebalancing your portfolio to maintain your long-term investment strategy.
Making adjustments to your portfolio if your needs and circumstances change.
Why do I need to diversify my portfolio?A diversified portfolio spreads investment dollars out over a variety of asset classes and/or different securities. The goal of diversification is to help protect the value of your overall portfolio against a decline of price in a single security and/or a market sector. For example, some investors own a mix of stocks and bonds, with the expectation that in times when stock markets decline, bonds will perform better, helping to minimize the volatility of the overall portfolio. The different asset classes may counterbalance one another to help reduce short-term fluctuation in the portfolio. Of course, asset allocation and diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.Why is it important to focus on asset allocation as part of the investment process?Studies show that asset allocation has the single largest impact on your account’s overall performance.  According to 1990 Nobel Prize winner Harry Markowitz’s “Modern Portfolio Theory”, almost 92% of investment returns are the result of how assets are allocated among different classes, while only 2% are due to the specific stocks and bonds you choose to buy within each asset class.  Asset allocation may have a more significant affect on performance returns than industry weighting, stock selection, market timing or any other portfolio management decision.How often should I make adjustments to my asset allocation?Your asset allocation should reflect your current investment objectives, but it is also a long-term commitment. If your objectives and investment timeframe have not changed, you may not want to make adjustments to your asset mix. This is true even if short-term developments in the market are not working to your benefit. But if things have changed, the investment mix that suited you when you began investing may not be appropriate today.  Major changes in your personal life, financial situation and time horizon can all be reasons to reconsider your asset allocation strategy.What does it mean to rebalance a portfolio and why is that important?Your asset allocation strategy is based on specific objectives for investment return consistent with your acceptable level of risk. If over time the performance of certain types of assets held in your portfolio dramatically stray from expected return levels, it’s possible that you may find that you are significantly over-invested or under-invested in specific asset classes. For example, if due to strong performance, a planned 15% weighting of international stocks in your portfolio grows to a 20% weighting, you may suddenly be taking on significantly more risk by owning more international stocks than your original allocation called for. If that occurs, you may consider rebalancing assets in your portfolio to the weighting specified in your original asset allocation strategy.Is there a cost to having my investments professionally managed?Yes. Your advisor will discuss the costs involved before you decide to become a client.What products are available within these managed accounts?Depending on your specific situation, portfolios may include all types of mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), individual stocks, bonds and other securities or other types of investments available on the open market. Part of the process of working with an investment advisor is to determine which products may fit your asset allocation strategy.

                  Turnover is calculated by taking the # of new holdings (initial purchases) + the # of positions sold out of (not just reduced) divided by the total # of holdings for the quarter.
                
[2]:
                  Alt Turnover is calculated by taking either the total MV of new purchases or
                   the MV of securities sold, whichever is less,
                   divided by the total MV of the fund.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

			Before you invest in a Section 529 plan, request the plan's official statement from your Financial Solutions Advisor and read it carefully. The official statement contains more complete information, including investment objectives, charges, expenses and risks of investing in the 529 plan, which you should consider carefully before investing. You should also consider whether your home state or your beneficiary's home state offers any state tax or other benefits that are only available for investments in such state's 529 plan. Section 529 plans are not guaranteed by any state or federal agency.

1 To be eligible for favorable tax treatment afforded to any earnings portion of withdrawals from Section 529 accounts, such withdrawals must be used for "qualified higher education expenses," as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Any earnings withdrawn that are not used for such expenses are subject to federal income tax and may be subject to a 10% additional federal tax, as well as applicable state and local income taxes. 
			
2 Section 529 plans are established by various states and are offered to residents of all states. Depending on the laws of the customer's home state, favorable tax treatment for investing in a Section 529 plan may be limited to investments made in a Section 529 plan offered by the customer's home state. Neither Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated nor any of its subsidiaries are tax or legal advisors. We suggest you consult your personal tax or legal advisor before making tax or legal-related investment decisions.

Frequently Asked Questions 




What is an IRA?


							An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) may provide either a tax-deferred or tax-free way for you to save for retirement.  There are many different types of IRAs but Roth, Traditional and Rollover IRAs are the most common.
						






How does an IRA work?


							IRAs rely on long-term, tax-deferred compounding to provide your retirement savings the opportunity to grow more quickly than in a taxable account.  When you earn interest, receive a dividend or sell an investment (such as a mutual fund) for a gain, you don't pay taxes that year on the earnings.  Instead, all taxes are deferred until you withdraw those earnings in retirement.
						






Why is an IRA important now?


							In retirement you may need as much as 100% of your current after-tax income (take-home pay) minus any amount you are saving for retirement each year.  This makes it all the more important to start saving sooner rather than later, and an IRA can help you get started.
						






What are the ways I can invest in an IRA?


							You can choose from investment products such as mutual funds, stocks, bonds and ETFs, as well as bank products like CDs and money market savings.
						






What are the contribution deadlines?

You can make contributions to an IRA for a given tax year until the tax return filing deadline of the following year.






How do I convert to a Roth IRA?

A Roth IRA Conversion could help grow your retirement assets federally income tax-free. To help you convert to a Merrill Edge Roth IRA, call us at 888.637.3343 for one-on-one assistance and we'll guide you every step of the way. We're here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.






What are my options for converting a 401(k) to an IRA?

You have several choices when it comes to your old 401(k). Typically known as a rollover IRA, you can opt to transfer your money into an IRA. Another option is keeping the current 401(k) with your old employer or transfer it to a new employer plan.

Frequently Asked Questions 




SEP IRA



Do I have to contribute annually?
                                No. A SEP IRA gives you the flexibility to decide each year whether to contribute and at what rate. That could mean contributing more during profitable years and less or nothing at all during less profitable years.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SEP IRA?
                                SEP IRAs have little to no paperwork and administration and don't require filing with the IRS. Plus, a Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you get started.
                            
Is there investment research I can review? 
                                Yes. As a Merrill Edge client, you get access to BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research (rated #1 by Institutional InvestorFootnote 2)-as well as research from other industry leaders-to gain investing knowledge and market
                                insights that can help inform your investment strategy.
                            




SIMPLE IRA



Is there a mandatory employer match? 
                                Yes. With a SIMPLE IRA, you must contribute either 2% of compensation for each eligible employee, regardless of participation, or a dollar-for-dollar match of employee salary deferral contributions, capped at 3% of compensation (which may be reduced to as low as 1% in any two years during a 5-year period).
                            
What if my business grows beyond 100 employees?
                                You may need to consider establishing a small business 401(k) plan when your business grows to more than 100 employees. A Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you consider your options. Please note: If you decide to establish a 401(k) plan, you would stop contributions to the SIMPLE IRA plan and then start the 401(k). Participants that have been in the SIMPLE IRA plan for over two years may roll their SIMPLE IRA assets over to the new 401(k) if it allows for rollovers. Before making any decisions, you should speak with your tax and legal advisor about your situation and the requirements for terminating a plan and establishing a new one.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SIMPLE IRA? 
                                We have many ways to make managing your retirement plan easier. Our Merrill Lynch E-Contribs for Small Business Retirement Accounts™ provides small business owners with a convenient web-based solution for making contributions to retirement plan accounts, while the Automated Investment Program provides a systematic way to invest in mutual funds on a schedule based on your needs.
                                
                                SIMPLE IRA contributions will be made through your payroll company and you will be required to send an annual notice to your employees. You do not file IRS Form 5500 as you would with a 401(k) plan.

 One Man's 9-Minute Secret to Retiring Rich  by Investing Daily Staff - May 1, 2017     Years ago Jim Fink knew he’d need to make a change if he was ever going to retire.
It's a similar problem a lot of Americans are dealing with as they approach retirement.
He had a good job, was squirreling away money in his IRA, and investing in stocks—but wasn’t really getting anywhere.
The piddly returns he was making that way seemed like a waste of time. He needed something better.
Luckily Jim worked at an office building in Chicago, close to the financial district.
One day he ran into a "trader" who shared an approach that would go on to change Jim's life forever.
So Jim started experimenting with the approach he learned...
Before long he was generating extra monthly income like $1,200, $1,800, and $2,100... and all in a matter of weeks!
His nest egg began to grow exponentially, and before long he had turned a mere $50,000 into a massive $5.3 million.
Now, years later, Jim trades full-time—and lets independent-minded investors follow the exact approach he's now perfected.
It’s an easy, step-by-step process that takes just 9 minutes to per week.
Best of all, unlike many risky approaches to making money, there's a built-in safety net unique to his strategy that can make it safer than traditional investing.
In fact, safety-loving Warren Buffett pulled in $4.7 billion following this exact approach not too long ago.
The full story behind how Jim makes his trades is right here.
