For projects with a total cost of $25,000 and up, a contractor must be licensed as a Prime Contractor, or Subcontractor. Masonry contractors must be licensed to do projects with a total of $100,000 and up. 
Coleman, Ronald F currently holds license 29285 , which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Tennessee?



Contractors in Tennessee are required to pass a business and law exam, and must submit a letter of reference to prove work experience before they can be licensed. 











Your liability risk when hiring Coleman, Ronald F



Contractors in Tennessee must carry both general liability and workers compensation insurance. Request a copy of current insurance certificates before any work begins.











Financial recourse when hiring Coleman, Ronald F



Licensed contractors in Tennessee must obtain a surety bond before performing construction work on residential properties. A home owner may file a claim against this bond to recoup losses or damages incurred during the construction project.











What else should I know before hiring Coleman, Ronald F



In order to become licensed in Tennessee, contractors must submit a reviewed or audited financial statement prepared by a licensed independent accounting firm. To obtain an unlimited license, the contractor must show $300,000 in working capital.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Tennessee, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
