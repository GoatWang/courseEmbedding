NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Trian Fund Management, L.P. (“Trian”), whose investment funds 
      beneficially own approximately $3.3 billion of shares of The Procter & 
      Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) (“P&G” or the “Company”), today filed a 
      preliminary proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
      for the election of Nelson Peltz, its Chief Executive Officer and 
      Founding Partner, to P&G’s Board of Directors at the 2017 Annual Meeting 
      of Shareholders. As one of P&G’s largest shareholders, and given P&G’s 
      disappointing results over the past decade, Trian has a keen interest in 
      helping the Company address the challenges it is facing, which include:
    


Weak Total Shareholder Returns – 
      Over the past decade, P&G has underperformed relative to both its peers 
      and the S&P 500.1 Over a 10-year period, P&G’s total 
      return to shareholders was less than half that of its peers and has been 
      in the bottom quartile over most recent time frames.2 Trian 
      believes P&G needs to address the factors contributing to this 
      consistent underperformance, including:
    

Deteriorating Market Share – 
      Over the past five years, P&G’s organic sales growth has decelerated and 
      the Company has lost market share across most of its categories.3



        Organic sales and volume growth have been well below that of 
        traditional large-cap consumer packaged goods peers.
      

        Disruptive and existential threats are impacting the entire consumer 
        packaged goods industry, including changes in technology and consumer 
        behavior, and P&G must act with the greatest possible urgency to 
        address the market share it is losing to both its peers and smaller 
        local competitors, who are adapting to industry changes more 
        effectively than P&G.
      


Excessive Cost and Bureaucracy – 
      P&G management acknowledges the need to reduce cost and bureaucracy,4 
      but it is clear to Trian that these critical issues have not been 
      sufficiently addressed.
    


        Trian’s analysis shows that P&G’s $10 billion cost-cutting program, 
        launched in 2012, has had no discernible impact on profits or sales 
        growth.

        

            To the extent savings were reinvested to drive growth, there was 
            little impact on organic volume growth, which was among the worst 
            in class relative to peers from 2012 to 2016, and market shares 
            declined.
          

            Savings did not drive earnings growth given that operating profit 
            was essentially flat from 2012 to 2016.5




        Although P&G has stated that it has identified up to $13 billion of 
        additional cost savings, given the Company’s track record, Trian is 
        concerned that this initiative will be as ineffective as the 2012 
        program in driving sales growth, earnings growth and shareholder value 
        creation.
      

        P&G has an overly complex organizational structure and a slow moving 
        and insular culture.

        

            Structural and organizational bureaucracy prevents management from 
            identifying and responding to commercial opportunities in a timely 
            manner, hinders product innovation and dampens sales growth.6





      While P&G leadership says they are addressing the underperformance 
      issue, shareholders have heard similar promises in the past and results 
      have not improved. Trian believes P&G must take decisive action that 
      goes above and beyond what P&G has presently committed to do.
    

Adding Nelson Peltz to the Board Will Help P&G 
      Address These Challenges – Trian believes that Mr. 
      Peltz’s significant expertise and long track record of working 
      successfully with management teams and boards to turn around consumer 
      companies and drive sustainable long-term shareholder value will be 
      invaluable to P&G as it works to overcome its challenges.
    


        At consumer companies where Mr. Peltz has served on the Board of 
        Directors, earnings-per-share growth has outpaced the S&P 5007 
        by an average of 780 basis points annually.8


        Total shareholder returns at consumer companies where Mr. Peltz has 
        served on the Board of Directors have outperformed the S&P 500 by an 
        average of 880 basis points annually.9



      Trian believes that P&G’s challenges stem in large part from its 
      organizational structure and culture, which can be highly resistant to 
      change. Therefore, it is Trian’s strong view that the addition of a 
      motivated independent director that has a material ownership stake and 
      relevant industry experience can be a valuable resource for overcoming 
      the root causes of these challenges.
    

What Trian is NOT Pushing For – 
      Trian believes strongly in P&G’s potential, and as a long-term 
      shareowner, its objective is to create sustainable long term shareholder 
      value for all P&G shareholders. That means Trian is:
    


        NOT advocating for the break-up of the Company
      

        NOT suggesting that the CEO be replaced
      

        NOT seeking to replace directors
      

        NOT advocating taking on excessive leverage
      

        NOT seeking to cut pension benefits
      

        NOT suggesting that research & development, marketing expense or 
        capital expenditures be reduced
      


      Trian has made the decision to nominate Mr. Peltz for election to the 
      Board at the 2017 Annual Meeting so that he can act as a catalyst for 
      faster and more significant change at P&G. In connection with this 
      nomination, Trian has filed a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC 
      and launched the website www.RevitalizePG.com, 
      which contains a brief shareholder presentation and other materials.
    

      “Trian believes the job of a highly engaged shareowner in the boardroom 
      is to foster a true sense of ownership among directors and inspire the 
      board to take decisive and timely action to create sustainable, 
      long-term value for both the company and its shareholders,” said Mr. 
      Peltz. “As a member of the Board, it would be my goal to help improve 
      performance by increasing sales and profits and regaining lost market 
      share. I also believe the Board must address the company’s structure and 
      culture. I can add far more value operating within the P&G boardroom 
      than by merely looking in from the outside.”
    

      Wishing to avoid a proxy contest, Trian had numerous constructive 
      meetings and discussions with P&G management and a few Board members 
      over the course of the past four months. Trian is disappointed that the 
      Company has rejected Trian’s request to expand the Board by adding Mr. 
      Peltz, who would be a representative of all shareholders. Trian still 
      hopes to avoid the distraction of a proxy contest for the sake of all 
      constituencies. However, it feels compelled to advocate for the changes 
      it believes are necessary at P&G in order to enhance long-term value and 
      return P&G to its position as the best-in-class consumer packaged goods 
      company in terms of growing both market share and financial performance. 
      Should Mr. Peltz be elected to a seat on P&G’s Board at its Annual 
      Meeting, as a director, his first action would be to propose that the 
      Board immediately re-appoint to the Board whichever current director has 
      not been re-elected.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements


      This press release contains forward-looking statements. All statements 
      contained in this press release that are not clearly historical in 
      nature or that necessarily depend on future events are forward-looking,

      materially different from any future results, performance or 
      achievements expressed or implied by such projected results and 
      statements. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with 
      respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market

      light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the projected results 
      and forward-looking statements included in this press release, the

NOTES


1 References to the S&P 500 throughout this press release 
      refer to the S&P 500 Total Return Index, which includes the price 
      changes of all underlying stocks and all dividends reinvested. S&P 500 
      data is obtained from Bloomberg using the SPX ticker with the inclusion 
      of dividend re-investment.2 Source: Capital IQ, SEC 
      filings and annual reports. Total shareholder return of the S&P 500, the 
      Company and its peers measured through June 15, 2017, one day before 
      rumors surfaced of Trian seeking P&G Board representation. Trian 
      considers the Company’s peers to include Beiersdorf, Church & Dwight, 
      Clorox, Colgate, Edgewell Personal Care, Henkel, Kimberly-Clark, 
      L’Oreal, Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever. We believe this peer group is 
      relevant because each is domiciled in the United States or Europe, has a 
      significant market capitalization and generates a significant portion of 
      its sales in categories in which P&G competes.3 
      Source: Company SEC filings. The Company’s organic sales growth was 0% 
      in FY2016 and 2% year-to-date in FY2017, compared with a compound annual 
      growth rate of 4% for organic sales from FY2006 through FY2011. In 
      addition, the Company’s volume growth has trailed the average volume 
      growth of its peers which disclose this data in four out of the five 
      most recently completed years (indicating a loss of market share).4 
      As referenced above, P&G announced a goal to reduce costs by $10 billion 
      dollars by 2016 at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York Conference 
      held on February 23, 2013. In addition, P&G identified an additional 
      savings opportunity of up to $13 billion at the Deutsche Bank Global 
      Consumer Conference held on June 15, 2017.5 Source: 
      Company SEC filings. From FY2012 through FY 2016, the Company grew sales 
      volumes at a compound annual growth rate of 0.6% and grew operating 
      profit at a compound annual growth rate of -0.1%.6 
      Trian believes that P&G’s organizational structure is overly “matrixed,” 
      which we believe impedes growth by adding unnecessary complexity and 
      cost. We understand that there are three overlapping organizational 
      structures at P&G (Global Business Units as defined by category, Selling 
      and Marketing Operations, and Corporate Functions), and in our view, 
      these overlapping structures obscure accountability, increase 
      bureaucracy and slow decision-making and impede sales growth and market 
      shares.7 We highlight the S&P 500 here only as a widely 
      recognized index, however, for various reasons the performance of the 
      index and that of Trian’s Engaged Consumer Investments (defined in 
      footnote 8 below) may not be comparable. While Trian believes that 
      earnings per share growth at Trian’s Engaged Consumer Investments was 
      attributable in large part to the cumulative effects of the 
      implementation of operational and strategic initiatives during the 
      period of Trian’s active involvement and beyond, there is no objective 
      method to confirm what portion of such growth was attributable to 
      Trian’s efforts and what may have been attributable to other factors. 
      This press release does not provide the performance of Trian’s funds or 
      the performance of individual fund investments.8 
      Represents average annual adjusted EPS growth outperformance in Trian’s 
      “Engaged Consumer Investments versus the S&P 500’s annual EPS growth 
      during the time that Trian held the investment. Trian’s Engaged Consumer 
      Investments” includes all of Trian’s food, beverage, restaurant, and 
      retail-focused portfolio companies across all of our equity investment 
      vehicles since inception that were held for one year or longer and where 
      Trian also (x) had a designee or nominee on the Board, (y) was a 
      Schedule 13D filer, and/or (z) wrote a “white paper” and met with 
      management. Such investments do not represent all of the investments 
      purchased or sold for Trian’s clients and it should not be assumed that 
      any or all of these investments were or will be profitable.9 
      Represents average total shareholder return (TSR) outperformance for the 
      relevant companies vs. the S&P 500’s TSR from the date of Trian’s first 
      purchase through the earlier of June 20, 2017, or the last day that the 
      company’s shares were publicly traded. The TSR analysis reflects the 
      change in the stock price of each of Trian’s Engaged Consumer 
      Investments plus the effect of dividends received over the relevant time 
      period. The TSR outperformance figures should not be construed as an 
      indication of the performance of the funds managed by Trian and it 
      should not be assumed that any or all of Trian’s Engaged Consumer 
      Investments were or will be profitable in any of the funds managed by 
      Trian.

Trian Partners Nominates Nelson Peltz for Election to Procter & Gamble Board


   Trian Fund Management, L.P. (“Trian”), whose investment funds beneficially own approximately $3.3 billion of shares of The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) (“P&G” or the “Company”), today filed a preliminary proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the election of Nelson Peltz, its Chief Executive Officer and Founding Partner, to P&G’s Board of Directors at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. As one of P&G’s largest shareholders, and given P&G’s disappointing results over the past decade, Trian has a keen interest in helping the Company address the challenges it is facing, which include: 
 



      Trian Fund Management, L.P. (“Trian”), whose investment funds 
      beneficially own approximately $3.3 billion of shares of The Procter & 
      Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) (“P&G” or the “Company”), today filed a 
      preliminary proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
      for the election of Nelson Peltz, its Chief Executive Officer and 
      Founding Partner, to P&G’s Board of Directors at the 2017 Annual Meeting 
      of Shareholders. As one of P&G’s largest shareholders, and given P&G’s 
      disappointing results over the past decade, Trian has a keen interest in 
      helping the Company address the challenges it is facing, which include:
    Weak Total Shareholder Returns – 
      Over the past decade, P&G has underperformed relative to both its peers 
      and the S&P 500.1 Over a 10-year period, P&G’s total 
      return to shareholders was less than half that of its peers and has been 
      in the bottom quartile over most recent time frames.2 Trian 
      believes P&G needs to address the factors contributing to this 
      consistent underperformance, including:
    



Deteriorating Market Share – 
      Over the past five years, P&G’s organic sales growth has decelerated and 
      the Company has lost market share across most of its categories.3
        Organic sales and volume growth have been well below that of 
        traditional large-cap consumer packaged goods peers.
      
        Disruptive and existential threats are impacting the entire consumer 
        packaged goods industry, including changes in technology and consumer 
        behavior, and P&G must act with the greatest possible urgency to 
        address the market share it is losing to both its peers and smaller 
        local competitors, who are adapting to industry changes more 
        effectively than P&G.
      Excessive Cost and Bureaucracy – 
      P&G management acknowledges the need to reduce cost and bureaucracy,4 
      but it is clear to Trian that these critical issues have not been 
      sufficiently addressed.
    
        Trian’s analysis shows that P&G’s $10 billion cost-cutting program, 
        launched in 2012, has had no discernible impact on profits or sales 
        growth.

        
            To the extent savings were reinvested to drive growth, there was 
            little impact on organic volume growth, which was among the worst 
            in class relative to peers from 2012 to 2016, and market shares 
            declined.
          
            Savings did not drive earnings growth given that operating profit 
            was essentially flat from 2012 to 2016.5
        Although P&G has stated that it has identified up to $13 billion of 
        additional cost savings, given the Company’s track record, Trian is 
        concerned that this initiative will be as ineffective as the 2012 
        program in driving sales growth, earnings growth and shareholder value 
        creation.
      
        P&G has an overly complex organizational structure and a slow moving 
        and insular culture.

        
            Structural and organizational bureaucracy prevents management from 
            identifying and responding to commercial opportunities in a timely 
            manner, hinders product innovation and dampens sales growth.6
      While P&G leadership says they are addressing the underperformance 
      issue, shareholders have heard similar promises in the past and results 
      have not improved. Trian believes P&G must take decisive action that 
      goes above and beyond what P&G has presently committed to do.
    Adding Nelson Peltz to the Board Will Help P&G 
      Address These Challenges – Trian believes that Mr. 
      Peltz’s significant expertise and long track record of working 
      successfully with management teams and boards to turn around consumer 
      companies and drive sustainable long-term shareholder value will be 
      invaluable to P&G as it works to overcome its challenges.
    
        At consumer companies where Mr. Peltz has served on the Board of 
        Directors, earnings-per-share growth has outpaced the S&P 5007 
        by an average of 780 basis points annually.8
        Total shareholder returns at consumer companies where Mr. Peltz has 
        served on the Board of Directors have outperformed the S&P 500 by an 
        average of 880 basis points annually.9
      Trian believes that P&G’s challenges stem in large part from its 
      organizational structure and culture, which can be highly resistant to 
      change. Therefore, it is Trian’s strong view that the addition of a 
      motivated independent director that has a material ownership stake and 
      relevant industry experience can be a valuable resource for overcoming 
      the root causes of these challenges.
    What Trian is NOT Pushing For – 
      Trian believes strongly in P&G’s potential, and as a long-term 
      shareowner, its objective is to create sustainable long term shareholder 
      value for all P&G shareholders. That means Trian is:
    
        NOT advocating for the break-up of the Company
      
        NOT suggesting that the CEO be replaced
      
        NOT seeking to replace directors
      
        NOT advocating taking on excessive leverage
      
        NOT seeking to cut pension benefits
      
        NOT suggesting that research & development, marketing expense or 
        capital expenditures be reduced
      
      Trian has made the decision to nominate Mr. Peltz for election to the 
      Board at the 2017 Annual Meeting so that he can act as a catalyst for 
      faster and more significant change at P&G. In connection with this 
      nomination, Trian has filed a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC 
      and launched the website www.RevitalizePG.com, 
      which contains a brief shareholder presentation and other materials.
    
      “Trian believes the job of a highly engaged shareowner in the boardroom 
      is to foster a true sense of ownership among directors and inspire the 
      board to take decisive and timely action to create sustainable, 
      long-term value for both the company and its shareholders,” said Mr. 
      Peltz. “As a member of the Board, it would be my goal to help improve 
      performance by increasing sales and profits and regaining lost market 
      share. I also believe the Board must address the company’s structure and 
      culture. I can add far more value operating within the P&G boardroom 
      than by merely looking in from the outside.”
    
      Wishing to avoid a proxy contest, Trian had numerous constructive 
      meetings and discussions with P&G management and a few Board members 
      over the course of the past four months. Trian is disappointed that the 
      Company has rejected Trian’s request to expand the Board by adding Mr. 
      Peltz, who would be a representative of all shareholders. Trian still 
      hopes to avoid the distraction of a proxy contest for the sake of all 
      constituencies. However, it feels compelled to advocate for the changes 
      it believes are necessary at P&G in order to enhance long-term value and 
      return P&G to its position as the best-in-class consumer packaged goods 
      company in terms of growing both market share and financial performance. 
      Should Mr. Peltz be elected to a seat on P&G’s Board at its Annual 
      Meeting, as a director, his first action would be to propose that the 
      Board immediately re-appoint to the Board whichever current director has 
      not been re-elected.

      Officer and a director of Avery, Inc., which primarily engaged in the 
      manufacture and sale of specialty chemicals through Uniroyal Chemical

    Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
      This press release contains forward-looking statements. All statements 
      contained in this press release that are not clearly historical in 
      nature or that necessarily depend on future events are forward-looking, 
      and the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “potential,” “could,” 
      “opportunity,” “estimate,” “plan,” and similar expressions are generally 
      intended to identify forward-looking statements. The projected results 
      and statements contained in this press release that are not historical 
      facts are based on current expectations, speak only as of the date of 
      this press release and involve risks, uncertainties and other factors 
      that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be 
      materially different from any future results, performance or 
      achievements expressed or implied by such projected results and 
      statements. Assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with 
      respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market 
      conditions and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or 
      impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond the 
      control of Trian Partners. Although Trian Partners believes that the 
      assumptions underlying the projected results or forward-looking 
      statements are reasonable as of the date of this press release, any of 
      the assumptions could be inaccurate and therefore, there can be no 
      assurance that the projected results or forward-looking statements 
      included in this press release will prove to be accurate and therefore 
      actual results could differ materially from those set forth in, 
      contemplated by, or underlying those forward-looking statements. In 
      light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the projected results 
      and forward-looking statements included in this press release, the 
      inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation 
      as to future results or that the objectives and strategic initiatives 
      expressed or implied by such projected results and forward-looking 
      statements will be achieved. Trian Partners will not undertake and 
      specifically declines any obligation to disclose the results of any 
      revisions that may be made to any projected results or forward-looking 
      statements in this press release to reflect events or circumstances 
      after the date of such projected results or statements or to reflect the 
      occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.
    Additional Information
      Trian Partners, together with other Participants, intend to file with 
      the SEC a definitive proxy statement and an accompanying proxy card to 
      be used to solicit proxies in connection with the 2017 annual meeting of 
      shareholders of the Company, including any adjournments or postponements 
      thereof or any special meeting that may be called in lieu thereof (the 
      “2017 Annual Meeting”). Information relating to the participants in such 
      proxy solicitation (the “Participants”) has been included in a 
      preliminary proxy statement filed by Trian Partners and the other

      Annual Meeting when they become available because they will contain 
      important information, including additional information relating to the 
      Participants. When completed and available, Trian Partners’ and the 
      other Participants’ definitive proxy statement and a form of proxy will 
      be mailed to shareholders of the Company. These materials and other 
      materials filed by Trian Partners and the other Participants in 
      connection with the solicitation of proxies will be available at no 
      charge at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. 
      The definitive proxy statement (when available) and other relevant 
      documents filed by Trian Partners and the other Participants with the 
      SEC will also be available, without charge, by directing a request to 
      Trian Partners’ proxy solicitor, Innisfree M&A Incorporated, 501 Madison

    NOTES1 References to the S&P 500 throughout this press release 
      refer to the S&P 500 Total Return Index, which includes the price 
      changes of all underlying stocks and all dividends reinvested. S&P 500 
      data is obtained from Bloomberg using the SPX ticker with the inclusion 
      of dividend re-investment.2 Source: Capital IQ, SEC 
      filings and annual reports. Total shareholder return of the S&P 500, the 
      Company and its peers measured through June 15, 2017, one day before 
      rumors surfaced of Trian seeking P&G Board representation. Trian 
      considers the Company’s peers to include Beiersdorf, Church & Dwight, 
      Clorox, Colgate, Edgewell Personal Care, Henkel, Kimberly-Clark, 
      L’Oreal, Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever. We believe this peer group is 
      relevant because each is domiciled in the United States or Europe, has a 
      significant market capitalization and generates a significant portion of 
      its sales in categories in which P&G competes.3 
      Source: Company SEC filings. The Company’s organic sales growth was 0% 
      in FY2016 and 2% year-to-date in FY2017, compared with a compound annual 
      growth rate of 4% for organic sales from FY2006 through FY2011. In 
      addition, the Company’s volume growth has trailed the average volume 
      growth of its peers which disclose this data in four out of the five 
      most recently completed years (indicating a loss of market share).4 
      As referenced above, P&G announced a goal to reduce costs by $10 billion 
      dollars by 2016 at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York Conference 
      held on February 23, 2013. In addition, P&G identified an additional 
      savings opportunity of up to $13 billion at the Deutsche Bank Global 
      Consumer Conference held on June 15, 2017.5 Source: 
      Company SEC filings. From FY2012 through FY 2016, the Company grew sales 
      volumes at a compound annual growth rate of 0.6% and grew operating 
      profit at a compound annual growth rate of -0.1%.6 
      Trian believes that P&G’s organizational structure is overly “matrixed,” 
      which we believe impedes growth by adding unnecessary complexity and 
      cost. We understand that there are three overlapping organizational 
      structures at P&G (Global Business Units as defined by category, Selling 
      and Marketing Operations, and Corporate Functions), and in our view, 
      these overlapping structures obscure accountability, increase 
      bureaucracy and slow decision-making and impede sales growth and market 
      shares.7 We highlight the S&P 500 here only as a widely 
      recognized index, however, for various reasons the performance of the 
      index and that of Trian’s Engaged Consumer Investments (defined in 
      footnote 8 below) may not be comparable. While Trian believes that 
      earnings per share growth at Trian’s Engaged Consumer Investments was 
      attributable in large part to the cumulative effects of the 
      implementation of operational and strategic initiatives during the 
      period of Trian’s active involvement and beyond, there is no objective 
      method to confirm what portion of such growth was attributable to 
      Trian’s efforts and what may have been attributable to other factors. 
      This press release does not provide the performance of Trian’s funds or 
      the performance of individual fund investments.8 
      Represents average annual adjusted EPS growth outperformance in Trian’s 
      “Engaged Consumer Investments versus the S&P 500’s annual EPS growth 
      during the time that Trian held the investment. Trian’s Engaged Consumer 
      Investments” includes all of Trian’s food, beverage, restaurant, and 
      retail-focused portfolio companies across all of our equity investment 
      vehicles since inception that were held for one year or longer and where 
      Trian also (x) had a designee or nominee on the Board, (y) was a 
      Schedule 13D filer, and/or (z) wrote a “white paper” and met with 
      management. Such investments do not represent all of the investments 
      purchased or sold for Trian’s clients and it should not be assumed that 
      any or all of these investments were or will be profitable.9 
      Represents average total shareholder return (TSR) outperformance for the 
      relevant companies vs. the S&P 500’s TSR from the date of Trian’s first 
      purchase through the earlier of June 20, 2017, or the last day that the 
      company’s shares were publicly traded. The TSR analysis reflects the 
      change in the stock price of each of Trian’s Engaged Consumer 
      Investments plus the effect of dividends received over the relevant time 
      period. The TSR outperformance figures should not be construed as an 
      indication of the performance of the funds managed by Trian and it 
      should not be assumed that any or all of Trian’s Engaged Consumer 
      Investments were or will be profitable in any of the funds managed by 
      Trian.

P&G Responds To Trian Fund Management, L.P.






Business Wire




Jul 17, 2017 12:29 PM EDT













 




























































  The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) today issued the following statement in response to Trian Fund Management, L.P.:  P&G's Board and management team are committed to enhancing value for all shareholders and will continue to take actions to achieve this objective. P&G is actively executing its strategy to achieve balanced, sustainable long-term growth and value creation. Over the past two years, P&G has accomplished the most significant portfolio transformation in its history, having divested, discontinued, or consolidated more than 100 brands and simplified its product portfolio from 16 to 10 categories. At the same time, the Company has established a new standard of excellence for product performance, packaging and commercial execution, and is further strengthening its organization design, culture and accountability to ensure the strongest and most efficient operational performance across the organization. Today, P&G is a leaner, more agile, more accountable and more efficient organization with leadership positions in 10 large, structurally attractive categories.  The Company also continues to execute on bold productivity initiatives, having delivered more than $10 billion in savings over the past five fiscal years, with plans to deliver up to an additional $10 billion over the next five fiscal years. From reducing the number of manufacturing sites and simplifying its manufacturing platforms, to streamlining agency costs and refining its geographic footprint, the Company's initiatives are enhancing value across the organization. In addition to driving cost savings, these productivity programs have led to an increase of more than two points in operating margin over the past four years. At the same time, P&G is committed to continued productivity improvement and cost savings that provide the fuel for innovation and investments needed to accelerate and sustain faster top-line growth. For example, the Company will reinvest savings to improve product formulations and packaging, sales coverage and media programs, as well as product sampling and in-store and online demand creation. P&G will also invest in consumer value equations, correcting value gaps and quickly responding to competitive challenges as they emerge throughout the year.
