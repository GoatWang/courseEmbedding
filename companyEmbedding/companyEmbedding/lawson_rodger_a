      at upcoming Annual Meeting of Stockholders

 NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      E*TRADE Financial Corporation (NASDAQ: ETFC) today announced that its

      Board of Directors intends to appoint Rodger A. Lawson as Chairman to

      replace Frank J. Petrilli immediately following the 2013 Annual Meeting

      of Stockholders, subject to the re-election of Mr. Lawson at the Annual

      Meeting. Mr. Petrilli, who has served as Chairman since January 2012 and

      also as Interim CEO of the Company from August 2012 through January

      2013, advised the Board that he does not wish to stand for re-election.

      Mr. Petrilli will remain a director until the Annual Meeting of

      Stockholders, scheduled for May 9, 2013.

    

Mr. Lawson, who was appointed to the E*TRADE Board of Directors in

      February 2012, brings over 30 years of experience in the financial

      services industry, having most recently served as President of Fidelity

      Investments. Mr. Lawson also served as Lead Independent Director from

      August 2012 to January 2013, during which time Mr. Petrilli was Chairman

      and Interim CEO of the Company.

    


      "I am grateful to accept this role, and look forward to continuing to

      serve the Company and its stockholders in this new capacity," Mr. Lawson

      commented. "I am particularly encouraged about the direction of E*TRADE

      under CEO Paul Idzik, and feel the Company is on the right path to

      creating long-term value for its stockholders."

    


      "E*TRADE is a fantastic franchise, and I have been honored to serve as

      Chairman and Interim CEO during such a pivotal time in the Company's

      history," said Mr. Petrilli. "My decision to not stand for re-election

      was a difficult one, but reflects my other business and time

      commitments. I believe that Paul Idzik is well equipped to lead E*TRADE

      forward and that Rodger Lawson will make an excellent Chairman. I look

      forward to watching all of E*TRADE's success as an investor and

      customer."

    

Ronald D. Fisher, who has been a member of E*TRADE's Board since October

      2000, has also notified the Board that he will not stand for

      re-election, due to his expanded responsibilities as President of

      SoftBank Holdings, Inc. Mr. Fisher will also remain a director until the

      Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

    

Mr. Lawson continued, "On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank

      Frank and Ron for their commitment and dedication over the past years."

Rodger Lawson

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Rodger Lawson is a British-born, American. He previously held high level positions at Prudential Financial, Van Eck Global and Fidelity Investments.
Education and career[edit]
Lawson returned to Fidelity in August 2007 on the eve of one of worst Financial meltdowns.[1] Chairman Edward "Ned" C. Johnson 3rd has been credited for bringing Lawson back to steer Fidelity through financial crisis. Lawson's management style and several of his key hires have increased Fidelity's profile as one of the most trusted and sound financial firms.
Lawson retired from Fidelity Investments in early 2010.[2] He was appointed to the UnitedHealth Group Board of Directors on February 10, 2011,[3] and the E*Trade Board of Directors on February 10, 2012.[4]
