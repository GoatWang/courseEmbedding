Global macro - Wikipedia





















 






Global macro

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Global macro is an investment strategy based on the interpretation and prediction of large-scale events related to national economies, history, and international relations. The strategy typically employs forecasts and analysis of interest rate trends, international trade and payments, political changes, government policies, inter-government relations, and other broad systemic factors.

Other definitions[edit]
A noted example of what is now called a Global Macro strategy was George Soros' profitable sale of the pound sterling in 1992 prior to the European Rate Mechanism debacle.[1]:225[2]
In the 2010 Opalesque Roundtable[3] discussion of global macro, hedge fund manager John Burbank discussed the increasing importance and shift of private and institutional investors toward more global macro strategies. Burbank defined global macro as "having a reason to be long or short something that is bigger than a fundamental stock view."
Global macro trading[edit]
Global macro trading strategies are based on educated guesses about the macroeconomic developments of the world. Mike Novogratz, former president of Fortress Investment Group, runs a global investment management firm with total assets under management of approximately $41.6 billion and $4.3 billion in a global macrohedge fund in 2015 discussed global macro trading in his video interview.[4] Novogratz described global macro strategies as monitoring these macroeconomic stories, such as global imbalances, business cycles, the survival of the Euro, and changing growth models of emerging economies. He says that there is an inherent difference between global macro fund managers and traditional equity managers. Most long/short equity managers started in research as analysts and look to follow these macroeconomic stories based on what positions they believe in and stock positions they rely on.
On the other hand, global macro traders and managers focus primarily on the risk side of trading. For macro traders and managers, the primary element in decision-making is risk, because when investing in such a speculative world there are so many risk factors and moving data points that they must take into account. Macro traders are not fundamentalists; they rely on risk management and staying liquid to avoid a liquidity crisis. In 2007 and 2008, with the credit bubble where there was a long period of low volatility and illiquidity, many global macro funds found themselves with liquidity problems.
Types of the strategy[edit]
Neil Azous, the Founder and Managing Member of Rareview Macro LLC, explains that Global Macro Trading is grouped into three strategies: Discretionary, Commodity Trading Advisor (CTA)/Managed Futures, and Systematic. As noted by Azous:

Discretionary Macro execute their strategies by deploying directional positions at the asset class level to express a positive or negative top-down view on a market. Of all of the strategies, discretionary macro provides the most flexibility, including the ability to express either long or short views, across any asset class, and in any region.
CTA/Managed Futures use products very similar to those that discretionary macro managers trade. However, the methodology in which they arrive at those long or short positions are very different. CTA’s apply priced-based trend-following algorithms to the trading of futures contracts.
Systematic Macro is a hybrid between discretionary macro and CTA/managed futures. The signals that are used to enter into positions are based upon fundamental analysis, similar to discretionary macro, but the deployment of those trades is based on a systematic, or model-driven process, as is the case with CTAs.

Global macro

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Global macro is an investment strategy based on the interpretation and prediction of large-scale events related to national economies, history, and international relations. The strategy typically employs forecasts and analysis of interest rate trends, international trade and payments, political changes, government policies, inter-government relations, and other broad systemic factors.

Other definitions[edit]
A noted example of what is now called a Global Macro strategy was George Soros' profitable sale of the pound sterling in 1992 prior to the European Rate Mechanism debacle.[1]:225[2]
In the 2010 Opalesque Roundtable[3] discussion of global macro, hedge fund manager John Burbank discussed the increasing importance and shift of private and institutional investors toward more global macro strategies. Burbank defined global macro as "having a reason to be long or short something that is bigger than a fundamental stock view."
Global macro trading[edit]
Global macro trading strategies are based on educated guesses about the macroeconomic developments of the world. Mike Novogratz, former president of Fortress Investment Group, runs a global investment management firm with total assets under management of approximately $41.6 billion and $4.3 billion in a global macrohedge fund in 2015 discussed global macro trading in his video interview.[4] Novogratz described global macro strategies as monitoring these macroeconomic stories, such as global imbalances, business cycles, the survival of the Euro, and changing growth models of emerging economies. He says that there is an inherent difference between global macro fund managers and traditional equity managers. Most long/short equity managers started in research as analysts and look to follow these macroeconomic stories based on what positions they believe in and stock positions they rely on.
On the other hand, global macro traders and managers focus primarily on the risk side of trading. For macro traders and managers, the primary element in decision-making is risk, because when investing in such a speculative world there are so many risk factors and moving data points that they must take into account. Macro traders are not fundamentalists; they rely on risk management and staying liquid to avoid a liquidity crisis. In 2007 and 2008, with the credit bubble where there was a long period of low volatility and illiquidity, many global macro funds found themselves with liquidity problems.
Types of the strategy[edit]
Neil Azous, the Founder and Managing Member of Rareview Macro LLC, explains that Global Macro Trading is grouped into three strategies: Discretionary, Commodity Trading Advisor (CTA)/Managed Futures, and Systematic. As noted by Azous:

Discretionary Macro execute their strategies by deploying directional positions at the asset class level to express a positive or negative top-down view on a market. Of all of the strategies, discretionary macro provides the most flexibility, including the ability to express either long or short views, across any asset class, and in any region.
CTA/Managed Futures use products very similar to those that discretionary macro managers trade. However, the methodology in which they arrive at those long or short positions are very different. CTA’s apply priced-based trend-following algorithms to the trading of futures contracts.
Systematic Macro is a hybrid between discretionary macro and CTA/managed futures. The signals that are used to enter into positions are based upon fundamental analysis, similar to discretionary macro, but the deployment of those trades is based on a systematic, or model-driven process, as is the case with CTAs.

Alternatives
Whether you are seeking additional diversification, sources of income, greater return potential or a reduction in overall volatility, Invesco's expertise in alternatives can help institutional clients identify the right investment strategies for their portfolio objectives.


Bank Loans
Bank loans' floating rates make them an attractive source of yield to consider in a rising rate environment. They also have historically low correlations to traditional bonds, making them a potential diversifier for a fixed income allocation.



Commodities
Commodities have historically outperformed in inflationary environments. Also, they can add diversification benefits to portfolios due to their historically low correlations to both equities and bonds. 



Currency
Currencies can provide diversification to a portfolio. Currency returns have historically had low correlation to stock and bond returns, and may help mitigate portfolio volatility.



Diversified Alternatives
Diversified alternatives strategies typically target equity-like returns with significantly lower volatility. They provide exposure to multiple alternatives in a single investment. 



Equity Market Neutral 
Equity market neutral strategies use offsetting long and short stock positions in an attempt to limit non-stock-specific risk. They seek to provide positive returns above cash, regardless of market environment, and typically with lower volatility than the broad market.



Global Macro
Global macro strategies base their investment decisions on macro views of various markets around the world. They may take long and short positions within and across such asset classes as equities, fixed income and currencies. These strategies seek to provide consistent returns in all market environments. They target equity-like returns with lower volatility.



Hedged Equity
Hedged equity strategies may use derivative instruments or other investment techniques in an effort to control volatility or protect against losses. They seek to reduce an investor's exposure to volatility while also enhancing returns. 



Infrastructure and MLPs
Infrastructure strategies can provide diversification as well as a stable income stream and natural hedge against inflation as revenue is adjusted. Because MLPs must distribute most of their cash on a quarterly basis, they may offer high income potential while diversifying equity portfolios.



Long/Short Equity
Long/short equity strategies seek to mitigate portfolio volatility and provide protection against downside risk. They can also provide diversification.



Private Equity
Private equity strategies offer the potential for above-average returns, low long-term correlations with other asset classes and lower volatility.



Real Estate
Real estate can provide diversification to a portfolio, with low correlation to other major asset classes as well as global property markets that have relatively low correlations with each other. Real estate can offer yields that have low correlation to corporate and government bonds. This asset class may also offer inflation-hedging characteristics.



Risk-Balanced
Also known as risk parity strategies, these portfolios are constructed so that each asset contributes a relatively equal amount of risk to the strategic allocation of the portfolio. These portfolios may also include a tactical overlay that allows managers to opportunistically adjust the strategic allocation. This approach seeks to limit the effect that one underperforming asset may have on overall strategy performance. The goal is to mitigate portfolio volatility and protect against downside risk.



Stressed and Distressed Credit
Opportunistic credit platform that focuses primarily on stressed and distressed credit with a specific preference for small capitalization and middle market companies. Investment style primarily focuses on the purchase of private debt at a discount to par while targeting mid- to high-teens gross returns.

The Fund
Unconstrained to a traditional benchmark, this Fund is one of the industry's longest-running absolute return strategies. Implements a flexible approach to investing long and short in foreign markets, providing global exposure that may help counterbalance  performance swings in conventional holdings.



The Approach
Eaton Vance applies its global macroeconomic and political research process in directing Fund investments. This time-tested process informs long and short positions in sovereign asset classes, such as foreign currencies and sovereign credit markets. Mana gers consider relative risk and return in managing exposures.



The Features
A flexible mandate translates into investment opportunities in both improving and deteriorating markets. Historically has provided a low volatility, strong, risk-adjusted performance experience. Historically low beta may help the Fund complement traditio nal holdings. Managed by Eaton Vance, a global investing leader.







 

 OverviewRelative to traditional markets, historically this fund has had: lower volatility, limited drawdown and lower beta.1

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market vola tility, the Fund's current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value (NAV) with all distributions reinvested. Returns for other classes of shares offe red by the Fund are different. Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative. Total return prior to the commencement of Class A Shares reflects returns of the Global Macro Portfolio into which it invests. Prior returns are adjusted to reflect  any applicable sales charge (but were not adjusted for other expenses). If adjusted for other expenses, returns would be lower. Max Sales Charge: 4.75%.

Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. Fund primarily invests in an affiliated investment company (Portfolio) with the same objective(s) and policies as the Fund and may also invest d irectly. References to investments are to the aggregate holdings of the Fund and the Portfolio.


About Risk: 
The Fund employs an "absolute return" investment approach, benchmarking itself to an index of cash instruments and seeking to achieve returns that are largely independent of broad movements in stocks and bonds. Investments in foreign instruments or curre ncies can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other conditions. In emerging or frontier countries, these risks may be more significant. An imbalance in supp ly and demand in the income market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. Investments in income securities may be affected by changes in the cr editworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer's ability to make principal and interest payments. De rivative instruments can be used to take both long and short positions, be highly volatile, result in economic leverage (which can increase both the risk and return potential of the Fund), and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying inst rument on which the derivative is based, such as counterparty, correlation and liquidity risk. If a counterparty is unable to honor its commitments, the value of Fund shares may decline and/or the Fund could experience delays in the return of collateral  or other assets held by the counterparty. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. The value of commodities investments will generally be affected by overall market movements and factors specific to a particul ar industry or commodity, including weather, embargoes, tariffs, or health, political, international and regulatory developments. Because the Fund may invest significantly in a particular geographic region or country, value of Fund shares may fluctuate m ore than a fund with less exposure to such areas. Investments rated below investment grade (typically referred to as "junk") are generally subject to greater price volatility and illiquidity than higher-rated investments.
A nondiversified fund may be subject to greater risk by investing in a smaller number of investments than a diversified fund. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment pra ctices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considere d a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding  consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.The Overall Morningstar Rat ing for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns,  60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most  weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.©2017 Morningstar. All  Rights Reserved.

4. The Morningstar Nontraditional Bond Category includes funds that pursue strategies divergent in one or more ways from conventional practice in the broader bond-fund universe. This includes funds that invest in bonds with an absolute return focus, which s eek to avoid losses and produce returns uncorrelated to the overall bond market, and funds with unconstrained mandates. Typically these strategies tactically manage allocations and often utilize derivatives.
5. SEC 30-day yield is a standardized measure based on the estimated yield to maturity of a fund's investments over a 30-day period and is based on the maximum offer price at the date specified. The SEC 30-day yield is not based on the distributions made by  the fund, which may differ. Distribution Rate at NAV is calculated by dividing the last distribution paid per share (annualized) by NAV. The Fund's monthly distribution may be comprised of ordinary income, net realized capital gains and returns of capit al.
6. A portion of the Fund's returns may be comprised of return of capital or short term capital gains. The Fund will determine the tax characteristics of all Fund distributions after the end of the calendar year and will provide shareholders such information  at that time. Please consult your tax advisor for further information.

Ratings are based on Moody's, S&P or Fitch, as applicable. If securities are rated differently by the ratings agencies, the higher rating is applied. Ratings, which are subject to change, apply to the creditworthiness of the issuers of the underlying sec urities and not to the Fund or its shares. Credit ratings measure the quality of a bond based on the issuer's creditworthiness, with ratings ranging from AAA, being the highest, to D, being the lowest based on S&P's measures. Ratings of BBB or higher by  S&P or Fitch (Baa or higher by Moody's) are considered to be investment-grade quality. Credit ratings are based largely on the ratings agency's analysis at the time of rating. The rating assigned to any particular security is not necessarily a reflection  of the issuer's current financial condition and does not necessarily reflect its assessment of the volatility of a security's market value or of the liquidity of an investment in the security. Holdings designated as "Not Rated" are not rated by the nati onal ratings agencies stated above.

Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. Fund primarily invests in an affiliated investment company (Portfolio) with the same objective(s) and policies as the Fund and may also invest d irectly. References to investments are to the aggregate holdings of the Fund and the Portfolio.


About Risk: 
The Fund employs an "absolute return" investment approach, benchmarking itself to an index of cash instruments and seeking to achieve returns that are largely independent of broad movements in stocks and bonds. Investments in foreign instruments or curre ncies can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other conditions. In emerging or frontier countries, these risks may be more significant. An imbalance in supp ly and demand in the income market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. Investments in income securities may be affected by changes in the cr editworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer's ability to make principal and interest payments. De rivative instruments can be used to take both long and short positions, be highly volatile, result in economic leverage (which can increase both the risk and return potential of the Fund), and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying inst rument on which the derivative is based, such as counterparty, correlation and liquidity risk. If a counterparty is unable to honor its commitments, the value of Fund shares may decline and/or the Fund could experience delays in the return of collateral  or other assets held by the counterparty. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. The value of commodities investments will generally be affected by overall market movements and factors specific to a particul ar industry or commodity, including weather, embargoes, tariffs, or health, political, international and regulatory developments. Because the Fund may invest significantly in a particular geographic region or country, value of Fund shares may fluctuate m ore than a fund with less exposure to such areas. Investments rated below investment grade (typically referred to as "junk") are generally subject to greater price volatility and illiquidity than higher-rated investments.
A nondiversified fund may be subject to greater risk by investing in a smaller number of investments than a diversified fund. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment pra ctices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

 Insights & Analysis  Commentary
A Word On The Markets as of  Mar 31, 2017
The financial markets posted widespread gains in the first quarter. Key themes driving the broad rally included optimism about Trump's pro-growth agenda, stronger European economic data and improving sentiment on emerging markets.
Surveys of U.S. consumer and business confidence surged to multi-year highs on expectations that the new administration's policies would accelerate GDP growth. However, measures of "hard" economic activity, such as retail sales and capital spending, had  yet to show similar strength. At its mid-March policy meeting, the Federal Reserve kept its 2017 growth forecast at 2.1% but raised interest rates 0.25% as its preferred inflation metric, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, neared th e central bank's 2% target. On March 31, the government reported that the PCE climbed at an annual pace of 2.1% in February — the first time it had exceeded 2% in nearly five years.
Outside the U.S., the U.K. economy remained resilient following the June 2016 "Brexit" vote, with unemployment falling to its lowest level since 1975. Eurozone unemployment also continued to decline and manufacturing activity picked up across the region,  despite heightened political uncertainty. Emerging markets experienced robust investor inflows due to several factors, including attractive valuations and a weakening in the U.S. dollar.
In this environment, the global equity market registered a strong gain, led by emerging markets. Returns were also positive — albeit more modest — for local currency and U.S. dollar-denominated emerging market sovereign debt, and for U.S. cre dit. The Treasury yield curve flattened, as short rates rose and long rates dipped slightly. Falling oil prices contributed to a loss in the broad commodity market.


Performance Summary 
Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return Fund and Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return Advantage Fund outperformed their benchmark, the BofA Merrill Lynch 3 Month U.S. Treasury Bill Index (the Index),2 at net asset value during the quarter.

By risk factor, currency exposure was the top contributor to Fund performance, followed by rates and sovereign credit. Commodity investments also gained, led by a short in oil. The equity sleeve had minimal impact on Global Macro Absolute Return Fund but  was a slight detractor in Global Macro Absolute Return Advantage Fund. Corporate credit hurt performance for both Funds.
In terms of regions, Eastern Europe was the top contributor to Fund performance and Western Europe was the next-largest contributor. The favorable results in Eastern Europe were due to currency, sovereign credit and rates exposures, including long positi ons in the Russian ruble and Russian rates. Russia's economy has been recovering and inflation has fallen more quickly than expected, prompting the central bank to cut interest rates and signal more rate cuts in 2017. Long investments in Cypriot and Turk ish sovereign credit boosted returns in the region as well. In Western Europe, a strong gain from long exposure to the Icelandic krona versus the euro drove results in the region.
Latin America also positively impacted returns, helped by rates and sovereign credit exposures. Notable contributors included a long rates position in Colombia, where the central bank eased policy, and a long sovereign credit position in Brazil, where ec onomic improvement led a major ratings agency to raise its credit outlook on the country. The Dollar Bloc added a modest amount of value in Global Macro Absolute Return Advantage Fund; however, its performance was flat in Global Macro Absolute Return Fun d. Within the Dollar Bloc, a long in Australian rates was a plus, while a short in the Canadian dollar detracted.
Asia, as well as the Middle East and Africa region, dampened results. Although rates exposure was positive in Asia, the gain was overshadowed by currency investments, particularly a short in the Chinese yuan. Currency, rates and sovereign credit detracte d in the Middle East and Africa, including shorts in the Omani rial, Israeli rates and South African sovereign credit.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market vola tility, the Fund's current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value (NAV) with all distributions reinvested. Returns for other classes of shares offe red by the Fund are different. Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative. Total return prior to the commencement of Class A Shares reflects returns of the Global Macro Portfolio into which it invests. Prior returns are adjusted to reflect  any applicable sales charge (but were not adjusted for other expenses). If adjusted for other expenses, returns would be lower. Max Sales Charge: 4.75%.

Contributors 
Factors contributing to the Fund's performance during the quarter:

At the individual position level, the long in the Icelandic krona versus the euro added significant value. Despite retreating in March, the krona strengthened against the euro over the full quarter amid a tourism boom in Iceland that is fueling strong ec onomic growth. Long investments in the Russian ruble and Turkish sovereign credit were also especially helpful. Other top contributors included long positions in the Colombian peso and Indonesian rupiah, which performed well amid broad U.S. dollar weakne ss. Following its rapid fourth-quarter rise, the dollar declined in response to concerns about how quickly Trump's pro-growth policies would be implemented given Congressional opposition.



Detractors 
Factors detracting from the Fund's performance during the quarter:

Consistent with U.S. dollar weakness, the list of detractors was dominated by short currency positions. Chief among these were shorts in the Chinese yuan, Omani rial, euro and Mexican peso.



Investment Outlook And Fund Positioning 
We expect a wide range of potential investment outcomes due to the change in U.S. political leadership. While markets appear to have priced in fiscal spending, lower taxes and less regulation, trade policy remains a key factor that will have a significan t impact on the global economy and the individual countries the team covers. Beyond the United States, China's capital account management and multiple European elections are likely to drive volatility in financial markets, and further consolidation in oi l markets may continue to stress those Middle East producers with inadequate fiscal capacity to absorb lower commodity prices. Against this backdrop, we have positioned the Funds to be more sensitive to country-level factors rather than broad macro facto rs as we expect country-level factors to be the main drivers of their performance going forward.
At quarter-end, both Funds' foreign currency positioning was net long. Long U.S. dollar and euro positions versus select emerging and frontier market currencies balance the risk.
Credit spread duration was slightly negative for both Funds. Long sovereign credit positions in Turkey, Cyprus and El Salvador were somewhat offset by short sovereign credit positions in South Africa and Qatar, in addition to short broad European corpora te credit exposure.
U.S. interest-rate duration and non-U.S. interest-rate duration were less than one year for Global Macro Absolute Return Fund and near one year for Global Macro Absolute Return Advantage Fund. A long position in New Zealand rates and a short in Saudi Ara bian rates were the larger duration contributors to overall interest-rate sensitivity.

Global macro

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Global macro is an investment strategy based on the interpretation and prediction of large-scale events related to national economies, history, and international relations. The strategy typically employs forecasts and analysis of interest rate trends, international trade and payments, political changes, government policies, inter-government relations, and other broad systemic factors.

Other definitions[edit]
A noted example of what is now called a Global Macro strategy was George Soros' profitable sale of the pound sterling in 1992 prior to the European Rate Mechanism debacle.[1]:225[2]
In the 2010 Opalesque Roundtable[3] discussion of global macro, hedge fund manager John Burbank discussed the increasing importance and shift of private and institutional investors toward more global macro strategies. Burbank defined global macro as "having a reason to be long or short something that is bigger than a fundamental stock view."
Global macro trading[edit]
Global macro trading strategies are based on educated guesses about the macroeconomic developments of the world. Mike Novogratz, former president of Fortress Investment Group, runs a global investment management firm with total assets under management of approximately $41.6 billion and $4.3 billion in a global macrohedge fund in 2015 discussed global macro trading in his video interview.[4] Novogratz described global macro strategies as monitoring these macroeconomic stories, such as global imbalances, business cycles, the survival of the Euro, and changing growth models of emerging economies. He says that there is an inherent difference between global macro fund managers and traditional equity managers. Most long/short equity managers started in research as analysts and look to follow these macroeconomic stories based on what positions they believe in and stock positions they rely on.
On the other hand, global macro traders and managers focus primarily on the risk side of trading. For macro traders and managers, the primary element in decision-making is risk, because when investing in such a speculative world there are so many risk factors and moving data points that they must take into account. Macro traders are not fundamentalists; they rely on risk management and staying liquid to avoid a liquidity crisis. In 2007 and 2008, with the credit bubble where there was a long period of low volatility and illiquidity, many global macro funds found themselves with liquidity problems.
Types of the strategy[edit]
Neil Azous, the Founder and Managing Member of Rareview Macro LLC, explains that Global Macro Trading is grouped into three strategies: Discretionary, Commodity Trading Advisor (CTA)/Managed Futures, and Systematic. As noted by Azous:

Discretionary Macro execute their strategies by deploying directional positions at the asset class level to express a positive or negative top-down view on a market. Of all of the strategies, discretionary macro provides the most flexibility, including the ability to express either long or short views, across any asset class, and in any region.
CTA/Managed Futures use products very similar to those that discretionary macro managers trade. However, the methodology in which they arrive at those long or short positions are very different. CTA’s apply priced-based trend-following algorithms to the trading of futures contracts.
Systematic Macro is a hybrid between discretionary macro and CTA/managed futures. The signals that are used to enter into positions are based upon fundamental analysis, similar to discretionary macro, but the deployment of those trades is based on a systematic, or model-driven process, as is the case with CTAs.

Global macro is an investment strategy based on the interpretation and prediction of large-scale events related to national economies, history, and international relations. The strategy typically employs forecasts and analysis of interest rate trends, international trade and payments, political changes, government policies, inter-government relations, and other broad systemic factors.

Other definitions[edit]
A noted example of what is now called a Global Macro strategy was George Soros' profitable sale of the pound sterling in 1992 prior to the European Rate Mechanism debacle.[1]:225[2]
In the 2010 Opalesque Roundtable[3] discussion of global macro, hedge fund manager John Burbank discussed the increasing importance and shift of private and institutional investors toward more global macro strategies. Burbank defined global macro as "having a reason to be long or short something that is bigger than a fundamental stock view."
Global macro trading[edit]
Global macro trading strategies are based on educated guesses about the macroeconomic developments of the world. Mike Novogratz, former president of Fortress Investment Group, runs a global investment management firm with total assets under management of approximately $41.6 billion and $4.3 billion in a global macrohedge fund in 2015 discussed global macro trading in his video interview.[4] Novogratz described global macro strategies as monitoring these macroeconomic stories, such as global imbalances, business cycles, the survival of the Euro, and changing growth models of emerging economies. He says that there is an inherent difference between global macro fund managers and traditional equity managers. Most long/short equity managers started in research as analysts and look to follow these macroeconomic stories based on what positions they believe in and stock positions they rely on.
On the other hand, global macro traders and managers focus primarily on the risk side of trading. For macro traders and managers, the primary element in decision-making is risk, because when investing in such a speculative world there are so many risk factors and moving data points that they must take into account. Macro traders are not fundamentalists; they rely on risk management and staying liquid to avoid a liquidity crisis. In 2007 and 2008, with the credit bubble where there was a long period of low volatility and illiquidity, many global macro funds found themselves with liquidity problems.
Types of the strategy[edit]
Neil Azous, the Founder and Managing Member of Rareview Macro LLC, explains that Global Macro Trading is grouped into three strategies: Discretionary, Commodity Trading Advisor (CTA)/Managed Futures, and Systematic. As noted by Azous:

Discretionary Macro execute their strategies by deploying directional positions at the asset class level to express a positive or negative top-down view on a market. Of all of the strategies, discretionary macro provides the most flexibility, including the ability to express either long or short views, across any asset class, and in any region.
CTA/Managed Futures use products very similar to those that discretionary macro managers trade. However, the methodology in which they arrive at those long or short positions are very different. CTA’s apply priced-based trend-following algorithms to the trading of futures contracts.
Systematic Macro is a hybrid between discretionary macro and CTA/managed futures. The signals that are used to enter into positions are based upon fundamental analysis, similar to discretionary macro, but the deployment of those trades is based on a systematic, or model-driven process, as is the case with CTAs.
