The Future Is Now: Disruptive Technology Trends in 2017 













As innovation continues to create new markets and challenge existing industries, Capital Group investment professionals share their insights on how disruptive technology can benefit investors in 2017.
Predictions many questioned from the movie “Back to the Future” came true in 2016, as the Cubs won the World Series and Nike began to offer self-lacing sneakers. Whether or not Nike’s power laces gain mainstream acceptance, the way we live and work is being enhanced by dramatic changes in technology.
Disruptive technologies are the result of new business models that are constantly innovating. Often their initial products or services appeal to only a small audience of customers. However, if they can evolve to offer higher quality at lower prices, they cause disruption by creating new markets and challenging existing industries.
“As investors, we need to understand not only the opportunities, but also the threats to incumbents,” notes Nick Grace, a Capital Group portfolio manager.
Cloud Computing Is Accelerating Disruptive Technologies
Cloud computing has been a hugely disruptive force over the past decade, driving innovation and, in turn, enabling new business models.
Many people have a hazy understanding of “the cloud” and whether it will keep their data secure. But most are already relying on cloud computing services when they use email, online banking and social media.
In reality, the cloud is a global network of massive facilities filled with hardware that runs software to store, manage and process data remotely. Cloud providers such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google now rent computing services over the internet. In fact, Amazon’s cloud-computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is the fastest-growing business in the history of technology services. AWS grew its revenue from $500 million in 2010 to nearly $5 billion in five years.





 The Cloud’s Potential Is Sky-High  Amazon Web Services is the fastest-growing business in the history of enterprise information technology  





    





Sources: Capital Group and SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) reported company financial filings. Data are estimates. 







This innovation has allowed large companies to reduce or eliminate the cost of maintaining their own data centers. Cloud providers also benefit startups by reducing their need to buy technology so they can focus on product development.
Cloud-computing businesses will continue to have strong investment potential, particularly when they are able to dispel remaining security concerns by demonstrating they offer higher standards at lower costs than corporate departments. “I think people are likely to be surprised by the accelerated rate at which information technology (IT) needs move to the cloud over the next three years,” says Capital Group portfolio manager Mark Casey.
In addition to helping launch new businesses and changing existing practices, the cloud is disrupting companies that sell computer hardware and software. By sharing resources in the cloud, companies no longer need to own computing power that may sit idle or quickly become obsolete.
Machine Learning Is Creating Cures
Cloud computing is increasingly enabling computers to teach themselves by analyzing massive amounts of data from the web, smartphones and other internet-connected devices. Common “machine learning” applications include those that train computers to understand speech and recognize images. Smartphone virtual assistants now respond to questions, and social media can tag names to photos.
Advances in machine learning are having a profound impact on the medical world as well. An example is a smartphone app that can detect skin cancer. Three years ago the technology was 81% accurate. Today, the app is even more precise — roughly equal to the diagnostic skills of a dermatologist.
Gene sequencing perhaps provides an even greater example. It took 10 years and $1 billion to sequence the first human genome. Now the cost of sequencing DNA is $1,000 and can be done in a few days; soon it will cost as little as $500 and take just one day. Doctors may then be able to diagnose an illness by comparing a patient’s DNA to databases that have already identified factors that contribute to the disease.
Machine learning is also supporting the data analysis that has been integral in the development of new drugs. These treatments can be personalized to target the specific nature of a patient’s illness based on their DNA. “These advances allow us to imagine curing diseases, not just treating them,” says Capital Group investment analyst Rich Wolf.
Many pharmaceutical companies are now spending more money on developing therapies, benefiting equipment suppliers with the technology to do the necessary research. However, drug companies that underinvest in disruptive innovation may need to acquire competitors with a stronger pipeline of potential treatments.
Self-Driving Cars Hit the Road
Going mobile used to mean going on the road, not online. The two activities merged with the creation of app-enabled car services, which have upended the traditional taxi business model by swiftly matching riders with drivers based on proximity and need. The services offer clean, owner-operated vehicles and convenient pickup arrangements at competitive prices. And usually with little or no wait time, even during peak ridership hours. But what could be the most disruptive technology thus far looks to be just around the corner with the introduction of autonomous, or self-driving, vehicles.
Many cars are already equipped with cameras and sensors to help drivers avoid potential accidents. Now, competition is developing not only between traditional automakers such as GM and Toyota, but also among technology companies like Apple and Google as they seek to put self-driving cars on the street as early as 2020.
In just two years, machine learning has increased by 10 times the distance driverless vehicles can travel. “However, it will take more time to develop fully autonomous cars that can safely operate under all road and weather conditions,” says Capital Group investment analyst Kaitlyn Murphy.
It is still too early to predict who is most likely to benefit from the use of autonomous cars — manufacturers or operators. Uber’s profits could very likely increase with the cost of the driver eliminated.
In addition, car-sharing services like Zipcar could reduce or even eliminate the need to own a vehicle. This may reduce auto sales by more than a million units annually over the next decade.
Investing in Disruptive Technologies
It could be argued that the most disruptive technologies are perhaps the ones we never expected and couldn’t imagine. Capital Group takes a long-term view of innovations, using fundamental research and a worldwide network of investment professionals to identify and analyze such trends and their impact on industries and companies as they evolve.
“That global and long-term perspective is what gives us the edge in terms of identifying companies best positioned to take advantage of those innovations,” says Mark. “I’m excited about the ongoing potential for technology innovation to make a meaningful difference in the quality of peoples’ lives, as well as in the investment opportunities in businesses that either pioneer those changes or benefit from those changes.”

Online Disruptive Technologies, Inc. Auditor Raises 'Going Concern' Doubt
Mar 31 17
Online Disruptive Technologies, Inc. filed its 10-K on Mar 31, 2017 for the period ending Dec 31, 2016. In this report its auditor, Meyers Norris Penny LLP - MNP LLP, gave an unqualified opinion expressing doubt that the company can continue as a going concern.


Online Disruptive Technologies Announces Asian Patents and Initial Test Results
Sep 13 16
Online Disruptive Technologies, Inc. announced that Savicell Diagnostic Ltd. has received patent approval from the Chinese and Japanese patent offices effective as of May 12, 2016 and July 29th, 2016 respectively. The technology has now received intellectual property protection with a patent approved in the United States, China and Japan. Furthermore, the patent process is ongoing in several other countries. The Savicell™ platform is a blood test designed for the early detection of disease. It is a broad platform with applications for cancer, autoimmune diseases, and infectious diseases. Immunotherapy, both for treating cancer and autoimmune diseases, is an example where metabolic shift profiles could indicate response to drug treatment. Initially, Savicell is focused on the multibillion-dollar cancer diagnosis market. Savicell deploys Well-Shield™ technology, a Liquid ImmunoBiopsy™ diagnostic platform. In contrast to existing technologies that evaluate secretions of cancer cells, Well-Shield's ImmunoBiopsy platform receives data directly from the immune system. Importantly, Well-Shield is different in that it is a functional test measuring the metabolic activation profile of the immune system as an indicator of disease status. As an immune system test, it is inherently suited for early detection. Disease intrusion and cell malformation, including cancer, are first detected by the immune system, which energizes to rid the body of the malignancy. The initial immune response to disease is intricate, deploying different metabolic pathways and subtypes of cells. The Well-Shield™ technology is designed to detect and interpret these differential metabolic responses. The need for simpler and more efficient processes for cancer detection has incentivized some 38 companies in the USA to work on creating liquid biopsies. In a 2015 report, investment bank Piper Jaffray valued the potential market for liquid biopsies at $29 billion just in the United States. Savicell conducted clinical work for tests specific to breast and lung cancers in multiple medical centers.

	News Release


	Online Disruptive Technologies Announces European Patent and additional Test Results



	LAS VEGAS, NEVADA--(Marketwired - Dec. 22, 2016)


	-


	 

	Online Disruptive Technologies, Inc. (OTC PINK:ONDR) (the "

	Company

	") is pleased to announce that its majority owned Israeli subsidiary, Savicell Diagnostic Ltd. ("

	Savicell

	"TM), has received patent approval from the European patent offices effective as of Sep 8, 2016 Title: "METHODS OF MONITORING AND ANALYZING METABOLIC ACTIVITY PROFILES DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC USES OF SAME". The technology has now received intellectual property protection with a patent approved in the United States, China, Japan and Europe. Furthermore, the patent process is ongoing in several other countries.


	The Savicell

	TM

	platform is a blood test designed for the early detection of disease. It is a broad platform with applications for cancer, autoimmune diseases, and infectious diseases. While our focus initially is on early diagnosis of disease, we believe our technology may have additional applications in drug response monitoring for therapies that impact immune response. Immunotherapy, both for treating cancer and autoimmune diseases, is an example where metabolic shift profiles could indicate response to drug treatment.


	Initially, Savicell is focused on the multibillion-dollar cancer diagnosis market. Savicell deploys Well-Shield

	TM

	technology, a Liquid ImmunoBiopsy

	TM

	diagnostic platform. In contrast to existing technologies that evaluate secretions of cancer cells, Well-Shield's ImmunoBiopsy platform receives data directly from the immune system. Importantly, Well-Shield is different in that it is a functional test measuring the metabolic activation profile of the immune system as an indicator of disease status. As an immune system test, it is inherently suited for early detection.


	Disease intrusion and cell malformation, including cancer, are first detected by the immune system, which energizes to rid the body of the malignancy. The initial immune response to disease is intricate, deploying different metabolic pathways and subtypes of cells. The Well-Shield

	TM

	technology is designed to detect and interpret these differential metabolic responses.


	The need for simpler and more efficient processes for cancer detection has incentivized some 38 companies in the USA to work on creating liquid biopsies. In a 2015 report, investment bank Piper Jaffray valued the potential market for liquid biopsies at $29 billion just in the United States.


	Savicell conducted additional tests with a promising cross-validation of 129 donors from our clinical study. This cohort includes 56 diseased donors, together with a control group of 73 age- and sex-matched healthy donors. This practice helps us control for sampling biases.

	Cross-validation (CV)

	Cross-validation (CV) – we let the algorithm train on a large subset of labeled donors, and then let it make a prediction on a small subset of unlabeled donors that were not in the training set. This process is repeated several times until every donor in the cohort is given a prediction.










	 















	We use several types of cross-validation: LOO – Leave one out – one donor is left out of the training set each iteration (total of n iterations), 20F – Stratified 20-fold CV – the cohort is split into 20 semi-equal-sized subsets; each subset, containing both sick and healthy donors, is left out once (total of 20 iterations). In addition, we run the algorithm once without cross-validation, meaning that the entire cohort is used for training and prediction. While we are pleased with these promising results, please note that results can change as we increase the cohort size.

	Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements


	Statements in this press release that are not strictly historical in nature are forward-looking statements. These statements are only predictions based on current information and expectations and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements in this press release include that our technology is designed to be deployed for early detection of diseases; that our technology may have additional applications in drug response monitoring for therapies that impact immune response, that the Well-Shield™ technology is designed to detect and interpret differential metabolic responses; that Well-Shield could help reduce the majority of the false positive results and that the potential market for liquid biopsies is $29 billion in the USA alone.; and that we have patent protection on our technology.  Actual events or results may differ materially from those projected in any of such statements due to various factors, including the risks and uncertainties inherent in drug and treatment discovery and development, which include, without limitation, the potential failure of development candidates to advance through clinical studies or demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical testing; our ability to retain key employees; our ability to finance development; and our ability to satisfy the rigorous regulatory requirements for new medical procedures. Good results in small trials and among limited cases does not necessarily lead to the same good results for large numbers or in the general public.  Competitors may develop better or cheaper alternatives to our products. Having patented technology does not guarantee that our patents may not be challenged, or that we may be infringing on the intellectual property of others. We may not be able to commercialize our product and even if we do, we may not realize any profit. The potential market may be much smaller than expected. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof.  All forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement and we undertake no obligation to revise or update this press release to reflect events or circumstances after today’s date. Readers should also refer to the risk factors disclosure outlined in our periodic reports filed from time-to-time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The Future Is Now: Disruptive Technology Trends in 2017 













As innovation continues to create new markets and challenge existing industries, Capital Group investment professionals share their insights on how disruptive technology can benefit investors in 2017.
Predictions many questioned from the movie “Back to the Future” came true in 2016, as the Cubs won the World Series and Nike began to offer self-lacing sneakers. Whether or not Nike’s power laces gain mainstream acceptance, the way we live and work is being enhanced by dramatic changes in technology.
Disruptive technologies are the result of new business models that are constantly innovating. Often their initial products or services appeal to only a small audience of customers. However, if they can evolve to offer higher quality at lower prices, they cause disruption by creating new markets and challenging existing industries.
“As investors, we need to understand not only the opportunities, but also the threats to incumbents,” notes Nick Grace, a Capital Group portfolio manager.
Cloud Computing Is Accelerating Disruptive Technologies
Cloud computing has been a hugely disruptive force over the past decade, driving innovation and, in turn, enabling new business models.
Many people have a hazy understanding of “the cloud” and whether it will keep their data secure. But most are already relying on cloud computing services when they use email, online banking and social media.
In reality, the cloud is a global network of massive facilities filled with hardware that runs software to store, manage and process data remotely. Cloud providers such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google now rent computing services over the internet. In fact, Amazon’s cloud-computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is the fastest-growing business in the history of technology services. AWS grew its revenue from $500 million in 2010 to nearly $5 billion in five years.

This innovation has allowed large companies to reduce or eliminate the cost of maintaining their own data centers. Cloud providers also benefit startups by reducing their need to buy technology so they can focus on product development.
Cloud-computing businesses will continue to have strong investment potential, particularly when they are able to dispel remaining security concerns by demonstrating they offer higher standards at lower costs than corporate departments. “I think people are likely to be surprised by the accelerated rate at which information technology (IT) needs move to the cloud over the next three years,” says Capital Group portfolio manager Mark Casey.
In addition to helping launch new businesses and changing existing practices, the cloud is disrupting companies that sell computer hardware and software. By sharing resources in the cloud, companies no longer need to own computing power that may sit idle or quickly become obsolete.
Machine Learning Is Creating Cures
Cloud computing is increasingly enabling computers to teach themselves by analyzing massive amounts of data from the web, smartphones and other internet-connected devices. Common “machine learning” applications include those that train computers to understand speech and recognize images. Smartphone virtual assistants now respond to questions, and social media can tag names to photos.
Advances in machine learning are having a profound impact on the medical world as well. An example is a smartphone app that can detect skin cancer. Three years ago the technology was 81% accurate. Today, the app is even more precise — roughly equal to the diagnostic skills of a dermatologist.
Gene sequencing perhaps provides an even greater example. It took 10 years and $1 billion to sequence the first human genome. Now the cost of sequencing DNA is $1,000 and can be done in a few days; soon it will cost as little as $500 and take just one day. Doctors may then be able to diagnose an illness by comparing a patient’s DNA to databases that have already identified factors that contribute to the disease.
Machine learning is also supporting the data analysis that has been integral in the development of new drugs. These treatments can be personalized to target the specific nature of a patient’s illness based on their DNA. “These advances allow us to imagine curing diseases, not just treating them,” says Capital Group investment analyst Rich Wolf.
Many pharmaceutical companies are now spending more money on developing therapies, benefiting equipment suppliers with the technology to do the necessary research. However, drug companies that underinvest in disruptive innovation may need to acquire competitors with a stronger pipeline of potential treatments.
Self-Driving Cars Hit the Road
Going mobile used to mean going on the road, not online. The two activities merged with the creation of app-enabled car services, which have upended the traditional taxi business model by swiftly matching riders with drivers based on proximity and need. The services offer clean, owner-operated vehicles and convenient pickup arrangements at competitive prices. And usually with little or no wait time, even during peak ridership hours. But what could be the most disruptive technology thus far looks to be just around the corner with the introduction of autonomous, or self-driving, vehicles.
Many cars are already equipped with cameras and sensors to help drivers avoid potential accidents. Now, competition is developing not only between traditional automakers such as GM and Toyota, but also among technology companies like Apple and Google as they seek to put self-driving cars on the street as early as 2020.
In just two years, machine learning has increased by 10 times the distance driverless vehicles can travel. “However, it will take more time to develop fully autonomous cars that can safely operate under all road and weather conditions,” says Capital Group investment analyst Kaitlyn Murphy.
It is still too early to predict who is most likely to benefit from the use of autonomous cars — manufacturers or operators. Uber’s profits could very likely increase with the cost of the driver eliminated.
In addition, car-sharing services like Zipcar could reduce or even eliminate the need to own a vehicle. This may reduce auto sales by more than a million units annually over the next decade.
Investing in Disruptive Technologies
It could be argued that the most disruptive technologies are perhaps the ones we never expected and couldn’t imagine. Capital Group takes a long-term view of innovations, using fundamental research and a worldwide network of investment professionals to identify and analyze such trends and their impact on industries and companies as they evolve.
“That global and long-term perspective is what gives us the edge in terms of identifying companies best positioned to take advantage of those innovations,” says Mark. “I’m excited about the ongoing potential for technology innovation to make a meaningful difference in the quality of peoples’ lives, as well as in the investment opportunities in businesses that either pioneer those changes or benefit from those changes.”
