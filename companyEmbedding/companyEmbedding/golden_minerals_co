2016 Golden Minerals Annual Report



Corporate Presentation
May  2017



 CORPORATE PROFILE
Golden Minerals Company is precious metals mining company, and we own the Velarde�a Properties and associated oxide and sulfide processing plants in the State of Durango, Mexico, the El Quevar advanced exploration property in the province of Salta, Argentina, and a diversified portfolio of precious metals and other mineral exploration properties located primarily in or near historical precious metals producing regions of Mexico. Our common stock is publicly traded on the Toronto and NYSE MKT stock exchanges.  more...


 PROJECTS
Golden Minerals owns the Velarde�a Properties in Durango State, Mexico, which were acquired in September 2011 and contain a significant high-grade silver and gold resource with lead and zinc base metals, and the resource remains open at depth. The company suspended mining and sulfide processing activities at Velarde�a in November 2015 due primarily to low silver and gold prices and lower average mill feed grades and gold recoveries than expected, which resulted in continuing net operating losses. The company intends to conserve the assets until such time as mining and processing plans and then-current precious metals prices indicate a sustainable positive operating margin at Velarde�a, or until we are able to locate, acquire and develop alternative mineral sources that could be economically mined and transported to the Velarde�a Properties for processing. The Properties contain a sulfide mill, an oxide mill (currently leased to Hecla Mining Company) and ample equipment that may be used to support nearby exploration and development activities.  more...


EXPERIENCED
                  MANAGEMENT 
Our management team has a proven track
                    record of experience in all areas of mineral resource development

Velardeña Properties














  

MILLS
The Velardeña Properties have two mills, each of which has its own tailings pond:

	A 300 tonne-per-day flotation sulfide mill located near the town of Velardeña 
              
 The sulfide mill includes lead, zinc, and pyrite flotation circuits which produce lead, zinc and pyrite concentrates from the sulfide ore
 Most of the silver is contained in the lead concentrate, while most of the gold has historically been in the pyrite concentrate


	A 550 tonne-per-day cyanide leach oxide mill with a Merrill Crowe precipitation circuit and flotation circuit, located adjacent to the Company's Chicago mine (see photo, right).  The oxide mill is presently leased to Hecla Mining Company, which began processing material at the plant in mid-December 2015.  The lease period runs until mid-year 2017 and is currently extendable until end-2018.

Exploration Properties














   

Golden Minerals controls a diversified portfolio of approximately 10 precious metals and other mineral exploration properties located primarily in or near historic precious metals producing regions of Mexico. In 2017 we plan to focus our exploration efforts primarily on the Santa Maria Mine located in the Parral District in Chihuahua State and the Rodeo property located approximately 80 kilometers west of the Velarde�a Properties in Durango.  

None of these properties have established proven or probable ore reserves.             
Santa Maria
In August 2014, we entered into an option agreement giving us the right to acquire for $1.2 million the Santa Maria mine, a privately held property comprised of a single mining claim of 18 hectares west of Hildalgo de Parral, Chihuahua State, Mexico. As of February 2017, the option agreement requires an additional $0.9 million to be paid to acquire 100 percent of the property.  Minimum payments of $0.1 million are due every April and October, and Golden Minerals has already advanced the minimum payments for 2017 to the property owners.  
During the first two quarters of 2016 we mined approximately 4,500 tonnes of material as a bulk sample with grades of approximately 235 gpt silver and 0.7 gpt gold. This material was substantially lower in grade than material mined in 2015 from the same vein. We processed the bulk sample through a toll milling facility, generating approximately 100 tonnes of concentrates containing approximately 22,000 ounces of silver and 44 ounces of gold.  The concentrates were sold to a third party for approximately $300,000 during the first two quarters of 2016 consisting of approximately 21,000 payable ounces of silver and 40 payable ounces of gold, which offset exploration costs. The average grade of 7,500 tons mined and processed in bulk samples since 2015 is 338 gpt silver and 0.7 gpt gold.  
In March 2017 a PEA was completed on our behalf by the engineering firm of Tetra Tech, based on an updated estimate of mineralized material. The PEA presents a base case assessment of developing Santa Maria's mineral deposit.  The PEA contemplates a 34-month underground mining operation at a mining rate of 200 tonnes per day using a combination of cut and fill and other mining techniques, and custom milling at a local third-party flotation mill.  Based on the assumptions in the PEA, we believe there may be potential to develop a small mining operation at Santa Maria. 
PEA highlights include: 

Post-tax net present value ("NPV") of $6.3 million and pre-tax internal rate of return of 84 percent at an 8 percent discount rate 
Total capital requirements of $1.2 million (initial capital $1.0 million, sustaining capital $0.2 million) 
Pre-production development time 10 to 11 months 
Life of mine ("LOM") 2.8 years 
Payback in month 16 
LOM free cash flow $8.2 million  
LOM silver production 2.0 Moz; LOM gold production 6.8 koz  
LOM average silver grade 332 grams per tonne ("gpt"); average gold grade 1.28 gpt 


Note:  PEA parameters assume prices of $1,222/oz gold, $17.30/oz silver and a discount rate of eight percent. Values above are approximate. All $ values in $US. 

In conjunction with the PEA, Tetra Tech completed an updated National Instrument 43-101 compliant mineral resource estimate at Santa Maria dated March 30, 2017.  Details are as follows:

In 2017 we plan to continue work related to optimizing mining plans for the project and obtaining permits for the potential mining operation as considered in the current PEA.  Permit applications have been submitted and are pending comment and acceptance.  We are also developing plans for additional exploration work to potentially expand the deposit.  However, no development decision has been made with respect to the project.

Rodeo  
Rodeo is a 1,900-hectare gold project located in Durango State, Mexico approximately 80 kilometers west of the Company's Velardeña properties and processing mills. Golden acquired the Rodeo property subject to a royalty interest due to La Cuesta International in the second quarter 2015, prior to which exploration by other companies identified a gold-bearing system exposed at surface.  
Golden conducted a 2,080-meter core drilling program at Rodeo in 2016. Partial results from the first round of drilling, released in September 2016, show a gold and silver bearing epithermal vein and breccia system with encouraging gold and silver values over an approximate 50 to 70 meter true width. The system is exposed at the top of a northwesterly striking ridge and dips steeply to the northeast. This could provide the possibility of open pit mining if we discover a deposit with sufficient tonnage of an appropriate grade and other characteristics to justify mining. The drill holes reported previously are spaced about 25 meters apart along 100 meters of the crest of the mineralized ridge. The drill holes are angle holes oriented at 55° to the southwest and cut the vein and breccia system at an angle of approximately 50°. Previous work has shown the mineralized system to be exposed at surface over about one kilometer of strike length.  
We completed the drill program in Q4 2016 and announced a Canadian National Instrument 43-101 compliant mineral resource estimate in January 2017.  Below are two resource estimates based on two processing scenarios and their respective cutoff grades and open-pit optimization models. Table 1 presents a mill grade resource that may be processed in the Company's existing oxide mill at Velardeña. This case provides a potentially shorter time to production and lower capital costs, since the Company owns the production mill located within trucking distance of the Rodeo property. Table 2 presents a heap leach case that could be a standalone operation, depending on leachability and costs of the standalone heap leach operation.

-   Rodeo resources per Tetra Tech NI 43-101  Technical Report dated January 2017.
Exploration and metallurgical work is anticipated to continue at Rodeo. If our exploration efforts are successful, material from this property could be trucked to the Velardeña oxide plant for processing after the third party lease has terminated.  La Cuesta holds a 2% net smelter return royalty on production from the claims up to a total payable amount of $5.0 million. Our agreement requires a minimum program of 1,000 meters of drilling before May 2017. 

Celaya 
The Celaya project totals 6,200 hectares encompassing a strongly developed alteration system on the main Mexico Silver Belt trend located approximately 10 kilometers east of the Plata Latina Naranjillo discovery and 45 kilometers southeast of and on trend with the historic Guanajuato District. Golden has conducted mapping and sampling activities at Celaya since 2012. We completed a 2,000 meter, three-hole drilling program in 2015 that identified epithermal gold and silver mineralization beneath a portion of the widespread clay-silica alteration on the claims comprising the Celaya project.  
In August 2016, Golden Minerals entered into an earn-in and joint venture agreement with a 100% owned Mexican subsidiary of Electrum Global Holdings, L.P., a privately owned company, related to Celaya.  Electrum has conducted extensive geologic mapping and sampling on the Celaya property. New targets have been identified and exploration drilling to test these targets began in December 2016.  
Details of the earn-in agreement are as follows: 
Golden Minerals received an upfront payment of $200,000 and Electrum has agreed to incur exploration expenditures totaling at least $0.5 million within the first year of the agreement, reduced by certain costs Electrum previously incurred on the property since December 2015 in its ongoing surface exploration program. Electrum, at its option, can elect to acquire an undivided 60% interest in a joint venture company to be formed to hold the Celaya project after incurring exploration expenditures totaling $2.5 million during the first three years of the agreement. Following the initial three year earn-in period the joint venture company would be formed to hold all project assets and a management committee would be formed with one representative of Golden Minerals and two representatives of Electrum. Electrum would serve as manager of the project. Golden would have the right to maintain its 40% interest in the Celaya project by funding its share of additional exploration or development expenditures. If Golden were to elect not to contribute to additional exploration or development expenditures after the initial earn-in period, Electrum, at its option, would have the right to earn an additional 20% interest in the joint venture company, for a total interest of 80%, by incurring an additional $2.5 million of exploration or development expenditures over a second three year period. Following the second earn-in period Golden Minerals would have the right to maintain its 20% interest in the Celaya project by funding its share of additional exploration or development expenditures or its interest can ultimately be converted into a 10% net profits interest. 
Zacatecas
            
Our 100% controlled Zacatecas silver and base metals project in Mexico is an exploration stage property that we have drilled in the past. Although we believe that the Zacatecas project may contain significant silver and other mineralization, we have not completed a mineralized material estimate or NI 43-101 resource study on the property.
The Zacatecas Mining District is located in the central part of Mexico, in the main Mexico Silver Belt. Our Zacatecas project surrounds the municipalities of Zacatecas, Veta Grande, Guadalupe, Pánuco, and Morelos in the state of Zacatecas, Mexico. We own approximately 149 concessions totaling approximately 7,900 hectares in the Zacatecas project.          
On April 28, 2016, Golden Minerals entered into an option agreement under which Santa Cruz Silver Mining Ltd. may acquire its interest in certain nonstrategic mineral claims located in the Zacatecas Mining District, Zacatecas, Mexico for a series of payments totaling $1.5 million.  Santa Cruz paid $0.2 million on signing the agreement.  In order to maintain its option and acquire the Zacatecas Properties, Santa Cruz is required to pay an additional $0.2 million in October 2016, six months after signing, plus additional amounts of $0.3 million, $0.3 million and $0.5 million due 12, 18 and 24 months after signing respectively. Santa Cruz has the right to terminate the option agreement at any time, and the agreement will terminate if Santa Cruz fails to make a payment when due.

Dr. Wallach's Organic Plant Derived Colloidal Minerals
We enjoy exclusive rights to the source material of our full-spectrum, organic, plant derived, colloidal minerals. Why is that important? Because it allows us to include what Dr. Wallach jokingly refers to as his “secret sauce” in nearly every supplement we offer. It is the tiny, trace mineral, minor mineral and rare earth mineral cofactors, after all, that permit the body to make optimal use of all the other nutrients ingested. The result is our products “work” whereas similar supplements from other companies often fall short.
Doc built his reputation and built his product line on a foundation of full-spectrum, organic, plant derived colloidal minerals. He pioneered the field. Now millions benefit from the awesome power of those tiny, little, workaholic, minerals!

Here are just a few of our “core” products that feature our organic, plant derived, colloidal minerals.

How does the Annual Paid Membership and Free 30 Day Trial work?


The Membership
By joining Thrive Market as an annual member, you’ll be joining hundreds of thousands of Americans across the country who are already enjoying wholesome products at wholesale prices. Because of the membership, we don’t have to mark up our products like other retailers and can pass along those savings to our members. As a result, the average member makes back their $59.95 annual membership fee (that’s just $5/month) in savings in just 2 orders. For each paid membership, Thrive Market provides a free membership to a family in need, teacher, veteran, or first responder. Together we can make healthy options affordable and accessible to everyone.


The Free 30 Day Trial
We’re so confident in the value of the annual membership, that we let new shoppers try Thrive Market for free for the first 30 days. We’ve found overwhelmingly that this allows first time Thrivers to shop, discover, save, and quickly see the value of becoming an annual paid member at just $59.95 for the full year.

Is your question more specific?

Yes
No

What is Thrive Gives?


Thrive Gives is our way of making healthy living affordable and accessible to everyone. We understand that paying our annual membership fee may not be possible for everyone, so for every paid membership we sell, we give a free membership to someone in need. Thrive Market members and Thrive Gives members enjoy the same access to wholesome products at wholesale prices. We distribute these free memberships through our Thrive Gives program and our nonprofit partners. Learn more  here.

From there, you can invite friends to join by email, Facebook, or by copying and sharing your unique referral link. For each person you invite who becomes a paid member, you'll earn $25 in Thrive Cash. There is no limit to the number of friends you can invite to join—the more the merrier!

2016 Golden Minerals Annual Report



Corporate Presentation
May  2017



 CORPORATE PROFILE
Golden Minerals Company is precious metals mining company, and we own the Velarde�a Properties and associated oxide and sulfide processing plants in the State of Durango, Mexico, the El Quevar advanced exploration property in the province of Salta, Argentina, and a diversified portfolio of precious metals and other mineral exploration properties located primarily in or near historical precious metals producing regions of Mexico. Our common stock is publicly traded on the Toronto and NYSE MKT stock exchanges.  more...


 PROJECTS
Golden Minerals owns the Velarde�a Properties in Durango State, Mexico, which were acquired in September 2011 and contain a significant high-grade silver and gold resource with lead and zinc base metals, and the resource remains open at depth. The company suspended mining and sulfide processing activities at Velarde�a in November 2015 due primarily to low silver and gold prices and lower average mill feed grades and gold recoveries than expected, which resulted in continuing net operating losses. The company intends to conserve the assets until such time as mining and processing plans and then-current precious metals prices indicate a sustainable positive operating margin at Velarde�a, or until we are able to locate, acquire and develop alternative mineral sources that could be economically mined and transported to the Velarde�a Properties for processing. The Properties contain a sulfide mill, an oxide mill (currently leased to Hecla Mining Company) and ample equipment that may be used to support nearby exploration and development activities.  more...


EXPERIENCED
                  MANAGEMENT 
Our management team has a proven track
                    record of experience in all areas of mineral resource development
                    including acquisition and exploration, permitting, construction,
                    ramp-up and optimization of production, commissioning,
                    operations, mine reclamation and closure. Our management
                    team has worked for major mining companies throughout the
                world. more...
