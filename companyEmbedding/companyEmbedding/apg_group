How They Work
Ultrasonic sensors work by sending sound waves that echo off of a target and return to the transmitter. The term ultrasonic means above human hearing, or any sound wave above 20 kHz. This method is quite accurate, and weâve developed a line of sensors with an accuracy of 0.25% of detected range.
Because the speed of sound is a constant, under fixed atmospheric conditions, the time from the sound burst to the return is measured and translated into a distance. The sensorâs microprocessor calculates the distance and converts it to a level indication, volume measurement, or a rate of flow. It also compensates for temperature, and filters the signal.
Common uses for ultrasonic level sensors are level, volume, and flow monitoring. Other uses include presence or absence detection, and object dimensioning.
Ultrasonic level sensors are typically quite small, low maintenance, and easy to ship and install. Each of our ultrasonic sensors have a microprocessor, which allows for more advanced control. In addition, they do not come in contact with the target substance, which avoids build-up and damage.
Ultrasonic sensors require an unobstructed air column between the sensor and the target. Anything that deflects or absorbs the signal, or acts as a false surface, may cause erroneous readings. This can result from physical obstructions, excessive foam, heavy vapors, thick dust and light powders.
A stilling pipe can be used to contain or guide the signal around obstructions, or to lessen surface foam. A more powerful sensor can also be used to strengthen the signal. However, our continuous float level transmitters, submersible pressure transducers, or level switches may be best in these scenarios. 

Features


Programming Ultrasonics To Fit Your Application
Learn More


Our ultrasonic level sensors are known for their field programmability. Within minutes, you can perfectly match your sensorâs parameters to your application, giving you unparalleled performance.
Most of our ultrasonic sensors are designed for use in level applications with ranges from as little as 4 inches to as much as 50 feet. They are used both indoors and out, capable of monitoring in cold and hot weather. Automatic temperature compensation is standard in each model.
Programming our ultrasonic level sensors is relatively easy, and is usually done well in under 30 minutes. This process is fairly straight forward, and our tech support is ready to help if you run into trouble.
There are three main settings you can adjust:

Pulse Strength & Sensitivity
Filtering & Response Time
Output & Trip Points

Pulse Strength & Sensitivity
The pulse strength control lets you fine tune sound wave bursts for optimal detection for your application. The sensitivity setting gives you control over how hard the sensor will listen for echoes. To put it simply, pulse strength is like volume control on a speaker, while sensitivity is like volume control on a hearing aid.
Adjusting the two is important. You want your pulse strength only as high as is necessary to get a good return signal. If you leave it on high all the time, it will wear down faster, just like a speaker can be blown out by too much volume. Unlike a speaker, the ultrasonic transducer - the part that makes and receives the sound waves - wonât blow out, but will wear down over time.
So if you have your pulse strength ramped up as high as you can just to get a good return signal, it means your sensors isnât powerful enough. You need a longer range ultrasonic so you can keep your pulse settings at a happy medium. This will give you a better signal and increase the lifespan of your level sensor.
Sensitivity settings are all about receiving the echoes. If you have to turn up your sensitivity too much, youâll start to pick up unwanted echoes and erroneous readings. Having to keep your sensitivity too high is a symptom of either a low pulse strength setting, a target that absorbs or dissipates your signal, or a sensor with too short a measurement range.
Balancing pulse strength and sensitivity is crucial to a reliable measurement and a durable sensor. The good news is, youâll likely be able to use AutoSense, which automatically adjusts pulse strength and sensitivity to optimum settings.
Filtering & Response Time
Filtering out unwanted echoes with your ultrasonic level sensor is easy with a few different settings. You can control the maximum and minimum detection distances, the averaging of your readings, and the response speed to changing levels.
Setting a maximum and minimum detection distance simply causes the sensor to ignore any echoes outside of that range. The minimum detection distance is really controlled by lengthening your blanking distance, which is a short distance right in front of the sensor face where nothing can be detected (see individual sensor specifications). The maximum distance setting is helpful if you ignore static or mobile objects in the distance.
Averaging your readings is a way to smooth out your level changes. Youâll need this feature unless you have a very slow moving, perfectly still surface to detect. Any amount of turbulence or uneven movement on the surface, and averaging becomes very valuable. Simply tell the sensor how many samples (singular readings) you want to average. The more samples you choose, the greater the smoothing effect.
Controlling the response speed to changing levels is very helpful for filtering out a lot of noise. This setting is called a window, or a set distance of your choosing in front of and behind the current distance reading. This is a moving window that follows the current accepted reading. Along with the window, youâll set the number of samples the sensor needs to detect out of the window before it validates as a new level. Essentially, youâre causing your sensor to double check the changes in the level before it serves it to you as an output.
Both averaging and the windows settings can speed up and slow down response time. If you have a fast moving target, then youâll want to be careful here. Lower averaging and a looser window is required to keep your readings caught up with rapid changes.
Output & Trip Points
Setting up your output on our ultrasonic level sensors is a simple process of defining your maximum and minimum output values. But it doesnât stop there! Our most popular series have the option to include 2 built in NPN trip points.
Trip points help you control pumps, alarms, and valves easily. Other manufacturers donât include trip points in their ultrasonic level sensors, forcing you to spend another couple hundred dollars on a module. We not only offer them built into the sensor, but we offer them at no additional cost.
Feature Rich vs Feature Starved
Some of our competitors want you to believe that their lower cost ultrasonic level sensors are just as good as our higher quality line. The fact is, they donât allow the programming of your sensor like we do. This means that youâll never know if their ultrasonic sensor will work for you. If it does, you lucked out. If it doesnât, thereâs nothing you can do about it.
Having the programming options on one of our ultrasonic level sensor ensures you can get the performance you expect. 

Applications
From time to time, we get some customers who try some very interesting things with ultrasonic sensors - even if we express some skepticism. Theyâve been used on everything from race cars to apple harvesters, some more successfully than others. But most of our ultrasonic level sensors are either used for liquid level, open channel flow, or for presence detection and object profiling, where they perform very well.
Liquid Level
The most popular application for ultrasonic level sensors is measuring level in a body of liquid, be it in a tank, well, pit, or lake. If the container is linear, then inferring a volume measurement is easy. In non-linear containers, a strapping chart is often used to adjust the reading to a volume as level rises and falls.
Our ultrasonic level sensors are quite accurate (0.25% of detected range), and suitable for most measurements outside of custody transfer applications. Most of our ultrasonics are designed specifically for level measurement. Refer to the specifications to make sure you find a sensor that will work well for you.
Solid Level
Another very popular application for ultrasonic sensors is solid level detection. This differs dramatically from liquid level detection because solids donât provide a flat, hard target. The target is often uneven and, soft. However, ultrasonic sensors still do a good job much of the time.
The trick is really to use a sensor with double the needed range. This gives you a much stronger signal that will provide a better echo for your sensor to measure. You may also need to angle the mount of the sensor to be perpendicular to the angle of repose.
Level measurement with solids has always been difficult. And while technologies new and old promise optimum performance, ultrasonics will remain a staple for continuous non-contact measurement.
Avoid using ultrasonic level sensors on light powders or especially dusty environments. The softness of light powders will absorb most of the sound signal, while dust will dissipate the signal in the air before it can return to the sensor. You may still opt to use an ultrasonic in a dusty environment if youâre willing to wait for a good level reading once the dust settles.
Open Channel Flow
Another great fit for our ultrasonic sensors is open channel flow. Open channels are a primary means of transporting, filtering, and metering water. Open channel flow monitoring is used in water treatment plants, in environmental monitoring, and in irrigation canals.
Our ultrasonic level sensors are commonly paired with an appropriate controller for flow calculations over open channels. They are preferred for their ruggedness in outdoor environments where reliability is paramount. Several of our models are a good fit for this application.
Presence Detection & Object Profiling
There are many technologies designed for detecting objects and controlling the movements of machines and robotics. Ultrasonic sensors are well suited for some of them. For example, did you know the automatic car wash industry relies heavily on ultrasonic sensors for detecting vehicles and controlling the movement of brushes?
Ultrasonic level sensors are good in many of these applications because of their ability to handle adverse conditions. Object detection required in dirty or wet environments where the targets are fairly slow moving is potentially a good fit for ultrasonic sensors. Our IRU-2000 series is designed for these applications.

FAQs


Do ultrasonic sensors work well outside?Will my parameters be saved after a blackout?Can I adjust the sound beam angle?Do you have any for hazardous locations?How can I adjust the ultrasonic settings for my application? 


Do ultrasonic sensors work well outside?
Yes, provided the temperature stays within the operating temperature range specified by your specific model.
You also need to be aware of the effects of temperature on the speed of sound, and how your sensor will attempt to compensate. Each of our ultrasonic sensors is equipped with automatic temperature compensation that keeps your sensor readings accurate as temperature changes. The features works very well, unless the temperature around your sensor is remarkably different than the temperature at the target surface.
When the temperature at the sensor is different than the surface temperature of your target, you have a temperature gradient that changes the speed of sound as it travels. This scenario should be avoided completely to ensure an accurate measurement. When using an ultrasonic sensor outside, protect it from heating up in the sun by keeping it in the shade and away from metal housings or covers. If you are having troubles with temperature gradients, you can turn off automatic temperature compensation and use periodic adjustments to the programming to improve accuracy to an acceptable level.
back to top 


Will my parameters be saved after a blackout?
Yes. Our ultrasonic sensors are equipped with a non-volatile memory. No data is lost when the unit is shut down, even during a power outage.
back to top 


Can I adjust the sound beam angle?
Yes. You can change the effective beam angle a little by adjusting the pulse and sensitivity parameters in your ultrasonic sensor programming software.
As you strengthen both the sound wave and the sensitivity to return signals, you increase the sensor's ability to pick up readings from a wider angle. As you weaken both the sound wave and the sensitivity, you reduce your sensor's ability to pick up return signals from wide angles. You're not actually changing the sound wave spread, but you are changing the power of the sound wave and the amplification of the returning echoes.

Do you have any for hazardous locations?
Yes. Here's a list:

We've made the process as straightforward as we can, but the power of these adjustments can certainly feel daunting. If you still need help, please give us a call and we'll walk you through the process.

How They Work
Our pressure transmitters, also known as pressure transducers, use piezoresistive technology to accurately measure pressure. This is based off of a small circuit called a Wheatstone bridge attached to the back of a diaphragm. As the diaphragm flexes from pressure, the resistance in the Wheatstone bridge (hereafter known as the âsensing elementâ) changes relative to pressure, providing a basis of measurement.
There are a few different methods of mounting the sensing element to the pressure transmitter diaphragm. Each has itâs own set of pros and cons. For example, some perform better in low pressure environments, others in high pressure. Weâll use the best method according to the configuration of your sensor.
Once the measurement is taken, the transmitter conditions the signal to the output you have chosen and sends it off to your control system. 

Features
While we only list a few pressure transducer families, each has a wide variety of configurable options when you purchase. These include options for:
outputs
pressure ranges
electrical connections and pin outs
and process fittings
Most allow you to adjust the zero and span in the field as well. 

Applications
APG pressure transmitters are used throughout industry, in both process and storage environments. Our PT-L families are built for industrial applications in pressure ranges up to 10,000 psi, and are suitable for both liquids and gasses. They are designed to provide accurate measurements and a long life expectancy at a low cost.
Our PT-400 family is designed for extreme environments. In particular, our heavy duty pressure transducers are designed to handle:
dirt & fine dust
water spray & washdowns
outdoors & inclement weather
hazardous locations
high vibration
Theyâre popular in the Oil & Gas industry where demanding conditions are further complicated by hazardous classified areas. In particular, our PT-400 pressure transmitters are well suited for applications with extreme vibration - where other pressure transducers tend to fall apart.

Yes. Our popular PT-400 model is commonly used in outdoor locations such as lift stations, oil rigs, and tank farms, and has built-in reverse polarity and surge protection compliant with IEC 61000-4-5. Our standard duty models are meant for indoor environments and do not have lightning protection.

Do you offer heavy duty pressure transducers for oil & gas?
Yes. The PT-400 is designed for outdoor use in harsh and hazardous conditions. It's hazardous location certifications include CSA Class 1, Div. 1, ATEX, and IECEx approvals for worldwide use. It's also built to withstand intense vibration common on oil rigs.

I just need a simple transducer - nothing fancy. What do you have?
We have two varieties of simple pressure transducers. Our PT-L9/13/14 series have a non-amplified mV/V output, is super compact, inexpensive, and great for anywhere you won't have a lot of electrical noise. Our PT-L1/L3/L10 series has an amplified output (VDC & 4-20mA), is compact, still inexpensive, and works better where electrical noise is more of a concern.
These models aren't beefed up for extremes like our larger PT-400, but they're just as reliable in controlled environments and often trusted in critical applications.

Why use MEMs instead of strain gages?
Different sensing elements have different pros and cons. The pros of a MEMs transducer is that it's more stable and costs less. However, strain gages and foil gages have their own set of pros that make them preferable in the right circumstances. Rest assured, we use whichever type of transducer that is most suitable for your application.

How often do your pressure transmitters need calibration?
We recommend having your pressure sensor calibrated at least once per year, or annually. However, most ISO 9001 compliant maintenance schedules are adequate. If you ever start to question your sensor's accuracy, have it calibrated. We can calibrate any of our own sensors. Contact us for a quote.
back to top 


What is the overpressure rating?
In general, the overpressure rating is 1.5X full scale range. But this changes based on the configuration and pressure range of your sensor. The higher the pressure range, the less overpressure you can get away with. Burst pressure is another important spec. This depends on the yield strength of the material used to make your pressure diaphragm. Consult with us on your specific model for more detail.

APG hereby objects to any Buyer terms and conditions, including those terms and conditions contained in Buyerâs purchase order or any other document issued by Buyer, that are inconsistent with or otherwise attempt to alter or modify these terms and conditions in any way, and such contrary or additional terms are hereby rejected and shall not be binding upon APG, and, in such event, these terms and conditions shall constitute a counter offer and shall not be effective as an acceptance of Buyerâs terms and conditions.  Buyerâs written acceptance of the price quotation and/or order acknowledgement or Buyerâs acceptance of the subject product or APGâs commencement of the services provided hereunder shall constitute Buyerâs unqualified acceptance of all of these terms and conditions.
2. Acceptance
Acceptance of orders by Automation Products Group, Inc. (APG) is subject to credit approval and other terms that may be set by APG.
3. Limited Warranty and Warranty Restrictions
APG warrants its products to be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service of the product for 24 months from the date of shipment from APG, unless otherwise specified by APG in writing. APGâs obligation under this warranty is limited to repairing or replacing (at APGâs sole option) any product that is covered by warranty and is found defective by APG in APGâs sole and absolute discretion, which shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer under this warranty. To obtain warranty coverage, the product alleged to be defective must be approved in advance by APG for return (see paragraph 4) then returned to APG, transportation prepaid, within the applicable warranty period. Buyer assumes all costs of removing, reinstalling, and shipping/transporting any alleged defective products to APG. For any product which is repaired or replaced under this warranty, the cost of returning such product to Buyer shall be paid by APG. For any product which is not found to be defective by APG in APGâs sole and absolute discretion, Buyer will be required to pay for return of such product. This warranty shall not apply to any product which has been subjected to modification, misuse, neglect, improper service, accidents of nature, or shipping damage.
THE FOREGOING WARRANTY IS IN LIEU OF AND EXCLUDES ALL OTHER WARRANTIES NOT EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN, WHETHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED BY OPERATION OF LAW OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
No representation or warranty, express or implied, made by any sales representative, distributor, or other agent or representative of APG which is not specifically set forth herein shall be binding upon APG, and will not form part of the contract between APG and Buyer.
The warranty is specifically limited to repairs at APG. Any requested onsite service will be provided at the sole expense of the Buyer at standard field service rates.
All APG products must be protected by properly rated electronic/electrical protection devices. APG shall not be liable for any damage due to improper electronic/electrical protection, engineering, or installation by the Buyer or third parties. Proper installation, operation, and maintenance of the product are the responsibility of the Buyer, and any failure to properly install, operate, or maintain the product will invalidate the warranty.
The warranty on repaired products or replacement products does not renew or extend the warranty expiration date and is expressly limited to the remaining warranty, if any, on the original product.
In the event the warranty service involves the replacement of a product or the replacement of a part, the replaced product or replaced part becomes the property of APG.
4. Returns/Restocks
Returns and allowances must be authorized by APG in advance, which authorization may be granted or withheld by APG in APGâs sole and absolute discretion. If a return is authorized, APG will assign a Return Material Authorization (RMA) number which must appear on all related papers and on the outside of the shipping carton. All returns are subject to final inspection and authorization by APG. Returns are subject to restocking charges as determined by APGâs customary practice.
ALL PRODUCTS RETURNED TO APG MUST BE CLEAN AND FREE OF ANY HAZARDOUS MATERIALS OR POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. Any product returned to APG that shows any evidence of hazardous material or potentially hazardous material, which determination shall be made by APG in APGâs sole and absolute discretion, may be disposed of by APG, and no refund or credit shall be provided to Buyer for said returned product.
All products returned to APG in exchange for a refund or credit of the purchase price become the property of APG.
5. Unclaimed Returns
If APG requests direction from Buyer with respect to returned products and Buyer fails to provide such direction in writing within 30 days of the request, then the product shall be deemed abandoned by the Buyer, shall become the property of APG, no credit shall be allowed for the return of the same, and no further action will be taken by APG with respect to the same.
6. APG Retained Rights
Tooling, set-up, fitting-up drawings, design information, and partial preparation charges, when invoiced, cover only part of the cost thereof to APG. Buyer does not acquire any right, title, or interest in any tooling, set-up, fitting-up drawings, design information, preparation, or invention resulting therefrom.
7. Limitation of Liability
The entire liability of APG and the exclusive remedy of Buyer shall be limited to the Limited Warranty set forth herein. In no event shall APGâs aggregate liability for any claim exceed the aggregate amount of the corresponding order. To the extent not prohibited by law, APG SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSSES OR EXPENSES DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING FROM THE SALE, HANDLING, IMPROPER APPLICATION OR USE OF THE PRODUCT OR FROM ANY OTHER CAUSE RELATING THERETO, LOSS OF INCOME, LOSS OF BUSINESS, DIMINUTION OF GOODWILL, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO BUYERâS USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PRODUCT, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY. APGâS LIABILITY HEREUNDER, IN ANY CASE, IS EXPRESSLY LIMITED TO THE REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT (AT APGâS OPTION) OF PRODUCT. BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT APG HAS ENTERED INTO THIS AGREEMENT TO SELL PRODUCT IN RELIANCE UPON THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN AND THAT THE SAME IS AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES.
8. Indemnification
Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless APG, its subsidiaries, affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, shareholders, and employees, from and against any and all damages, liabilities, actions, causes of action, suits, claims, demand, losses, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorney fees, disbursements and court costs) to the extent arising from or in connection with (i) the negligence or willful misconduct of Buyer, its agents, employees, representatives or contractors; (ii) use of a product in combination with equipment or software not supplied by APG where the product itself would not be infringing; (iii) APGâs compliance with designs, specifications, or instructions supplied to APG by Buyer; (iv) use of a product in an application, environment, or way for which it was not designed; or (v) modifications of a product by anyone other than APG without APGâs written approval.
9. Force Majeure Clause
Fulfillment of any order is contingent upon the availability of materials. APG shall not be liable for any delay in delivery or for non-delivery in whole or in part caused by the occurrence of any contingency beyond the control of either APG or its suppliers including, but not limited to, war, sabotage, acts of civil disobedience, failure or delay in transportation, act of any government or agency or subdivision thereof, judicial action, labor dispute, fire, accident, explosion, epidemic, quarantine, restrictions, storm, flood, Earthquake or acts of God, shortage of labor, fuel, raw material or machinery or technical failure. If any contingency occurs, APG may allocate production and deliveries among APGâs Buyers.
If APG, in its sole discretion, determines that APGâs performance hereunder would result in a loss to APG on this sale, as computed under APGâs normal accounting procedures, because of causes beyond APGâs control, then APG may terminate this agreement in whole or in part without liability for any delay in the delivery of or failure to deliver the goods sold hereunder.
10. Terms and Credit
For accounts with established credit (to be determined by APG in its sole and absolute discretion), payment shall be made Net 30 days after date of invoice, unless specifically agreed upon otherwise in writing by APG. For other accounts, payment is required with or prior to the order.
All invoices paid after the date due may be assessed a late payment service charge of 18% per annum or the maximum allowed by applicable law, whichever is lower. By acceptance of product, Buyer hereby grants APG a security interest in the product sold hereunder in accordance with the Uniform Commercial Code until the applicable invoice covering the product is paid in full, and APG shall have all rights and remedies of a secured party under applicable law.
Buyer shall be responsible for any and all collection costs, attorney fees, and other reasonable costs incurred by APG in pursuing collection of any past due amounts, including those incurred by APG in initiating a collection lawsuit, which amounts shall be added to the balance due by Buyer and paid by Buyer.
If, in APGâs sole judgment, Buyerâs financial condition at the time the product is ready for shipment does not justify the terms specified, APG reserves the right to change these terms or to require full or partial payment in advance. APG may, at any time, cancel and/or suspend performance of any order or require payment in cash, security, or other adequate assurance satisfactory to APG when, in APGâs opinion, the financial condition of Buyer or other grounds for insecurity warrant such action. All sales are subject to the approval of APGâs credit department.
11. Prices
APGâs prices are subject to change without notice. APGâs prices, unless earlier withdrawn or changed by APG, shall be open only to unqualified acceptance by Buyer, including unqualified acceptance of these terms and conditions. All prices are F.O.B. (Ex Works for foreign sales) APGâs offices, unless otherwise specified. APG prices are exclusive of all applicable taxes. Accordingly, in addition to the APG price, Buyer is responsible for payment of all applicable taxes (sales, use, value added, etc.) and Buyer agrees to immediately reimburse APG for any taxes relating to the product that APG is required to pay, if any
12. Risk of Loss and Title
Delivery shall occur and risk of loss or damage to the product shall pass to the Buyer upon delivery of the product to the carrier at the point of shipment. Transportation shall be at Buyerâs sole risk and expense, and any claim for loss or damage in transit shall be against and made to the carrier only.
Title of the product shall not pass to the Buyer until APG has received payment in full for the product and all other sums due to APG from the Buyer on any account. Until transfer of title in the product, Buyer shall ensure that the product is kept safe, secure and insured, and identified as APG property.
13. Delivery
The anticipated delivery date is the best estimate possible based upon current and anticipated manufacturing capabilities of when the product will be shipped, and APG will use its best efforts to meet said delivery dates. However, any such dates are intended to be approximate and time shall not be of the essence with respect to such delivery. APG assumes no liability for loss, damage, or consequential damages due to delays. Order cancellations must be agreed to in advance, and, if agreed to, may be subject to cancellation fees to cover work in progress.
14. Choice of Law and Venue
The commercial relationship and all transactions between APG and Buyer shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Utah, USA, without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law. APG and Buyer hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any appropriate court of the State of Utah, USA, to resolve any disputes or controversies which may arise between APG and Buyer.
15. Default Remedies
Upon default by Buyer, Buyer agrees to reimburse APG all attorney fees and court costs incurred by APG in connection therewith. Buyer agrees that any of the following shall constitute an event of default which shall enable APG, at its option, to cancel any unexecuted portion of any order, or to exercise any right or remedy which it may have by law: (a) the failure of Buyer to perform any term or condition contained herein; (b) any failure of Buyer to give required notice; (c) the insolvency of Buyer or its failure to pay debts as they mature, an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, the appointment of a receiver for Buyer, or the filing of any bankruptcy petition; (d) the death, incompetence, dissolution or termination of Buyer; (e) if APG, in good faith, believes that Buyerâs prospect of performance under this Agreement is materially impaired. All rights and remedies of APG herein are in addition to, and shall not exclude, any rights or remedies that APG may have by law.
16. General Provisions
Any cause of action arising from this agreement, or breach of it, must be commenced within one year after the event giving rise to the cause of action occurs. APG has the right to correct any stenographical or clerical errors in any of the writings issued by it. These terms and conditions of sale constitute a complete and exclusive statement of the terms and conditions of the sale of the goods by APG to Buyer. There are no other promises, conditions, understandings, representations, or warranties. This agreement may be modified only in writing signed by APG. No waiver of any right will be effective against APG unless supported by consideration and expressly stated in the writing signed by APG. The failure of APG to enforce any right will not be construed as a waiver of APGâs rights to performance in the future. Buyer may not assign any rights to, or delegate any performance owed under, the agreement without the written consent of APG. APG shall have the right to credit toward Buyerâs account any sums which may now or hereafter be owed to Buyer by APG.

Such printed materials and publications have been carefully checked for accuracy and are thought to be fully consistent with the product described. However, such printed materials and publications will not form part of the contract between the parties, will not bind APG in any way, and APG makes no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, about the completeness, accuracy, reliability, suitability, or availability with respect to the same for any purpose. APG does not assume liability for the contents of such printed and/or published materials or for the use of any products described therein. APG reserves the right to make changes to products and/or printed or published materials without further notification.

Courseware
If you are a training provider or an organization interested in delivering your own training,  APG courseware is available for licensed purchases. Your candidate instructors will go through an instructor certification process to ensure that the candidate is capable and has the experience to effectively deliver specific courses. This process also allows APG to explain particular aspects of the courseware and allows the candidate instructor to ask questions about the courseware, both of which lead to the most successful curriculum delivery experience possible.
If you are interested in participating in our curriculum licensing and instructor certification programs, please contact APG Sales for more information.

History
Building on a legacy of engineering experience and excellence.
Aircraft Performance Group (APG) is a flight operations engineering firm based in Castle Rock, Colorado and founded in 1999. The firmâs primary product and service focus is on takeoff, landing, and weight and balance services for airline and corporate operators.
From 1981 to 1995, APGâs founders operated Aircraft Performance Unlimited, Inc., an airline-engineering firm that provided a complete, integrated, airline-dispatch system that quickly grew to support over 65 airlines around the world. In 1995, Jeppesen, a Times Mirror Company, acquired Aircraft Performance Unlimited and fully integrated it into their service offerings.
Sensing the need for flight operations engineering expertise and services in the corporate aviation market, our founders then created APG. Bringing airline operations experience and adapting service solutions to the corporate aviation market, APG has grown quickly to become one of the leading service providers in the market. Today, APG apps and services are used by pilots and aircraft operators at dozens of airlines and on more than 5000 corporate aircraft from around the world.

Dutch pension system and solidarity pension

We concur with our clients: we believe in the power of the Dutch pension system. Making collective agreements on a solidarity basis and proportionally distributing the costs and risks affords millions of Dutch people higher financial security on retirement.










Dutch pension system and solidarity pension

Solidarity between co-workers and generations is the power of the pension system. The costs and risks are shared by a large group. Our ambition is to support this system with our knowledge and expertise. We actively assist in developing its innovation, ensuring that the system continues to benefit future generations, for example by supporting four professorships.
APG is a pension provider organizing the pensions for 4.5 million people on behalf of its clients. For our clients, we provide the retirement plans of one in every five families in the Netherlands. A responsible task that we are aware of every day. In everything we do, we keep our final goal in mind: realizing a good and affordable pension at a reasonable rate for as many people as possible. Now and in the future.
