First Quarter Net Income Increased 41%
First Quarter New Order Sales Increased 14%
First Quarter Online Sales Increased 12%

DELRAY BEACH, Fla., July  24, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  PetMed Express, Inc. (NASDAQ:PETS) today announced its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2017.  Net income was $9.3 million, or $0.45 diluted per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to net income of $6.6 million, or $0.32 diluted per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, a 41% increase to net income.  Net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 were $79.7 million, compared to $72.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, an increase of 10%.  New order sales increased 14%, to $15.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to $13.3 million for the same quarter in the prior year.  The Company's online sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 were approximately 84% of all sales compared to 82% for the same quarter the prior year, with online sales increasing 12%. 
Menderes Akdag, CEO and President, commented: "We were encouraged with increases in both new order and reorder sales during the quarter, along with an accelerated increase to net income for the second consecutive quarter.  This increase to net income can be attributed to increased revenue with a shift in sales to higher margin items.  Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 34.5% for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to 31.0% for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.  During the quarter ended June 30, 2017, we acquired approximately 169,000 new customers, compared to 158,000 new customers acquired in the same quarter the prior year.  Average order value increased to $87 for the quarter compared to $82 for the same quarter the prior year.  For the remainder of fiscal 2018 we will continue to focus on increasing sales and improving our service levels."
The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share on the Company's common stock.  The dividend will be payable on August 18, 2017, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 7, 2017.  The Company intends to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends; however, the declaration and payment of future dividends is discretionary and will be subject to a determination by the Board of Directors each quarter following its review of the Company's financial performance.
This morning at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time, Mr. Akdag will host a conference call to review the quarter's financial results.  To access the call, which is open to the public, please dial (888) 455-1758 (toll free) or (203) 827-7025.  Callers will be required to supply PETMEDS as the passcode.  For those unable to participate in the live event, the call will be available for replay from 10:00 A.M. on July 24, 2017 until August 7, 2017 at 11:59 P.M.  To access the replay, call (866) 431-7851 (toll free) or (203) 369-0968, and enter passcode 5500.

  For Immediate Release  Chicago, IL -July 20, 2017 - Stocks in this week's article include Sanderson Farms Inc. (NASDAQ:     SAFM   - Free Report ) , American Woodmark Corp. ( NASDAQ:     AMWD   - Free Report ),TJX Companies Inc. (NYSE:     TJX   - Free Report  ), Best Buy Co. Inc. ( NYSE:     BBY   - Free Report  ) and PetMed Express Inc. (NASDAQ:     PETS   - Free Report )  .   5 Top-Ranked Stocks Emerge as DuPont Winners   Return on equity is one of the most sought-after metrics for an investment. The metric enables investors to differentiate between a profit-churner and a profit-burner. It is a profitability ratio that measures the earnings that a company generates from its equity. To shortlist these gems, one can look at the DuPont technique to analyze the basic ROE at an advanced level. Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components: ROE = Net Income/Equity    Net Income / Equity = (Net Income / Sales) * (Sales / Assets) * (Assets / Equity)    ROE = Profit Margin * Asset Turnover Ratio * Equity Multiplier   Importance of Du Pont    Although one can't play down the importance of normal ROE calculation, the fact remains that it doesn't always provide a complete picture. The DuPont analysis, on the other hand, allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE. It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover. For example, high-end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods, which rely on higher turnover.  In fact, it also sheds light on the company's leverage status, which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains. A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt. Thus, the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load. So, an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio. This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock. Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company's financials. However, looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task. Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis.  Screening Parameters    • Profit Margin more than or equal to 3:  As the name suggests, it is a measure of how profitably the business is running. Generally, it is the key contributor to ROE.    • Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2:  It allows an investor to assess management's efficiency in using assets to drive sales.    • Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3:  It's an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets.    • Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2:  Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment.    • Current Price more than $5  : This screens out the low priced stocks. However, when looking for lower priced stocks, this criterion can be removed.    Here are five of 20 stocks that made it through the screen:  Sanderson Farms Inc. (NASDAQ:     SAFM   - Free Report ) :  This Zacks Rank #1 company is a poultry processing company. Its Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 5%. You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here   .  American Woodmark Corp. ( NASDAQ:     AMWD   - Free Report ):  The Zacks Rank #2 company manufactures and distributes kitchen cabinets and vanities for remodeling. Its Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 18%.  TJX Companies Inc. (NYSE:     TJX   - Free Report ):  It is the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashion in the U.S. and worldwide. Its Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 18%. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2.  Best Buy Co. Inc. ( NYSE:     BBY   - Free Report ):  The company is a leading retailer with a Zacks Rank #1 and a VGM score of A. Its Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 2%.  PetMed Express Inc. (NASDAQ:     PETS   - Free Report ):    This is the largest pet pharmacy, delivering prescription and non-prescription pet medications.

Mad Money with Jim Cramer

Cramer's lightning round: I don't usually like the sector, but this biotech's got the goods

It's that time again! Jim Cramer rang the lightning round bell, which means he gave his take on caller favorite stocks at rapid speed:
Novocure Limited: "I've been endorsing this one. I usually don't get behind these that much, but I know that this company's got a really terrific product and I would stick with it even though it has had a big move. I have not felt that way about a lot of these biotechs."
AeroVironment: "Unmanned [Aircraft Systems], we like Unmanned very, very much. Let me throw in that General Dynamics, which has been my fave, cracked $200 today."

PetMed Express: "This is at the heart of my humanization of pets story like Idexx Labs. I can't back away from it now, even though it's run, because it's a long term secular theme."
ON Semiconductor: "Candidly, not my fave. I have to just be honest with you. My charitable trust bought the stock Wednesday of Broadcom, symbol AVGO. I think it represents a better buy."
GNC Holdings: "Sell, sell, sell. No. I don't like it."
Under Armour: "Let's give them a break. The stock has bottomed. We know we called that at $18, so we're right on that. But Nike had a really great quarter. [Nike CEO] Mark Parker, who, by the way, is always welcome to be my co-host if not just a guest, has done a great job, so I'm going to say you have to do Nike here."
Portola Pharmaceuticals: "I think it's real. I think Portola's got the right pharmaceuticals. It's a spec, but I think it's real. We've looked at it."
NextEra Energy: "NextEra's one of the great growth utilities. We've been behind it all the way. I think it's terrific."
O'Reilly Automotive: "O'Reilly's just been taken to the woodshed 900 times this week and they still don't like it. You have to wait until after Amazon Prime Day if you want to speculate. I've had it with these stocks. There's just been too much bloodshed. I do not want to be involved with the eviscerated, fusillade, fire, shooting range, whatever you want to call it, that are the auto parts."

Founded in 1996, 1-800-PetMeds is America’s largest pet pharmacy delivering prescription and non-prescription pet medications and other health products for dogs and cats direct to the customer. 1-800-PetMeds markets its products through national advertising campaigns, which direct customers to order by phone or on the Internet and to aim to increase the recognition of the PetMed’s family of brand names. 1-800-PetMeds provides an attractive alternative for obtaining pet medications in terms of convenience, price, ease of ordering, and rapid home delivery.
At this time, I would now like to turn the call over to the company’s Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Bruce Rosenbloom. Sir, you may now begin.
Bruce Rosenbloom
Thank you. I’d like to welcome everybody here today. Before I turn the call over to Mendo Akdag, our President and Chief Executive Officer, I would like to remind everyone that the first portion of this conference call will be listen-only until the question-and-answer session, which will be later in the call.
Also, certain information that will be included in this press conference may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or the Securities and Exchange Commission that may involve a number of risks and uncertainties. These statements are based on our beliefs as well as assumptions we have used based upon information currently available to us.
Because these statements reflect our current views concerning future events, these statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Actual future results may vary significantly based on a number of factors that may cause the actual results or events to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these statements. We have identified various risk factors associated with our operations in our most recent annual report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Now let me introduce today’s speaker, Mendo Akdag, the President and Chief Executive Officer of 1-800-PetMeds. Mendo?
Mendo Akdag
Thank you, Bruce. Welcome, and thank you for joining us. Today, we will review the highlights of our financial results. We’ll compare our first fiscal quarter ended on June 30, 2017 to last year’s quarter ended on June 30, 2016.
For the first fiscal quarter ended on June 30, 2017, sales were $79.7 million compared to sales of $72.5 million for the same period the prior year, an increase of 10%. The increase in sales was due to increases in new order and reorder sales.
Our average order value was approximately $87 for the quarter compared to $82 for the same quarter last year. For the first fiscal quarter, net income was $9.3 million or $0.45 diluted per share compared to $6.6 million or $0.32 diluted per share for the same quarter last year, an increase to net income of 41%. The accelerated increase in net income was mainly due to higher gross profit margins.

Reorder sales increased by 9% to $64.5 million for the quarter compared to reorder sales of $59.2 million for the same quarter last year.
We acquired approximately 169,000 new customers in our first fiscal quarter compared to 158,000 for the same period the prior year. Approximately 84% of our sales were generated on our Web site for the quarter compared to 82% for the same period last year, which resulted in a 12% increase in ROI sales for the quarter.
The seasonality in our business is due to the proportional flea, tick and heartworm medications in our product mix. Spring and summer are considered peak seasons with fall and winter being the off seasons.
For the first fiscal quarter, our gross profit as a percent of sales was 34.5% compared to 31% for the same period a year ago. The shift in sales to higher margin items, the trend we had seen in the March quarter, continued in the June quarter.
Our general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales was down to 7.8% compared to 8.4% for the same period last year. We were able to leverage the G&A with increased sales.
We spent $6.3 million in advertising for the quarter compared to $5.8 million for the same quarter the prior year, an increase of about 9%. The advertising cost of acquiring a customer was approximately the same $37 compared to the same quarter a year ago.
We had $68.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $23 million in inventory with no debt as of June 30, 2017. Net cash from operations for the quarter was $13.9 million compared to $13.1 million for the same period last year.
This ends the financial review. Operator, we are ready to take questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from the line of Kevin Ellich from Craig-Hallum. Sir, your line now is open.
Kevin Ellich
Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, Mendo. I guess starting off with the revenue growth 10%, we’ve seen a nice acceleration here. I guess what are you guys expecting for the rest of the year? In the press release, you talk about focusing on increasing sales and improving service levels. What are you doing? And then where do you think revenue growth can go?
Mendo Akdag
We anticipate spending more on advertising compared to the last fiscal year. So we’re going to be a bit more aggressive on advertising. So hopefully that should continue helping new order sales. There’s an increase in customer retention compared to last year which had a positive impact. So we’ll see if that continues.
Kevin Ellich
And it is all still just online or are you doing anything else? I know you guys cut out TV advertising. But have you shifted the strategy at all?
Mendo Akdag
No. The strategy is the same as last year.
Kevin Ellich
Great. And then gross margins were up 350 basis points again this quarter. We saw that continuation. You commented on the higher margin item shift and that trend continuing. When you talk higher margin items, are we talking prescription medications, is it more specifically – are we seeing growth in the oral flea and tick products, how are the generic OTC topicals trending? Any color on that front?
READ  North Myrtle Beach fire crews save 3 pets from kitchen fireMendo Akdag
All I can tell you is there’s a shift of new generation medications and I’m going to leave it at that.
Kevin Ellich
Okay. That’s fine. And then average order value was up as well pretty nicely I think and is that a function of customers ordering more products in their orders or are you seeing higher priced products being placed?
Mendo Akdag
Higher priced items – there’s a shift to higher priced items.
Kevin Ellich
Okay. And I assume —
Mendo Akdag
Higher margin items are also higher priced.
Kevin Ellich
Yes, that’s what I thought. And then, Bruce, just one quick one for you. G&A, you guys are doing a nice job on the leverage. What are the main drivers of the G&A leverage and how much do you have to go on that front?
Bruce Rosenbloom
As you know, we spent a significant amount of money in our new infrastructure last year. So we have a significant amount of capacity to grow the business in our current facility. So as far as leveraging G&A, if things go well on the revenue front or we’re able to decrease revenue, that should have a positive impact on G&A leverage in the future.
Kevin Ellich
Okay. And then lastly, are you seeing any increase in competition either from the online channel or retail, Mendo?
Mendo Akdag
I would say it’s similar to last year.
Kevin Ellich
Great. Thanks, guys.
Mendo Akdag
You’re welcome.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Erin Wright from Credit Suisse. Your line now is open.
Erin Wright
Great. Thanks. A follow up to one of Kevin’s questions, the last one on competitive landscape, but can you just speak more broadly to kind of what you’re seeing from both retail and online competitors, and also comment on the broader industry consolidation? Do you expect the consolidation to continue and do you view this as an opportunity or a challenge for you? If you could comment on that, that would be great. Thanks.
Mendo Akdag
As far as the competition is concerned, they’re more focused on over-the-counter medications. So that’s why we are seeing the competition both brick and mortar and online. And as far as the M&As in the industry, it appears it’s going to continue, if you’re guess is as good as mine. But it depends on really what they do differently, if anything. So it remains to be seen.
Erin Wright
Okay. Thanks. And then I noticed in one of your recent filings a comment around kind of an opportunity to directly order or partner from manufacturers. Are you seeing any sort of change in your relationships with any sort of direct manufacturers, meaning are they more willing to just work with you directly?
Mendo Akdag
Our vendor relationships are proprietary and confidential, so I’m not at liberty to discuss it. I assume the disclosure is probably saying that we are always attempting working on getting direct relationships.
Erin Wright
Is it safe to assume then the vast majority is still going through distribution?
Mendo Akdag
I’m not going to comment. As I said, our vendor relationships are proprietary and confidential.
Erin Wright
Okay, great. Thank you.
Mendo Akdag
You’re welcome.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is coming from the line of Anthony Lebiedzinski of Sidoti & Company. Sir, your line now is open.
READ  Charlotte man accused of setting girlfriend's home on fire with pets insideAnthony Lebiedzinski
Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. So, Mendo or Bruce whoever, but I think Mendo you commented about the increased customer retention. What would you attribute that to? Any specific reasons that you can cite?
Mendo Akdag
Probably better service. We have a new infrastructure or I believe our speed of service delivery has improved since we moved to the new facility, so that’s helping. So I will say our service levels are better this year than last year.
Anthony Lebiedzinski
Okay. So just a follow up on that. So what is the average time now that the customer gets delivery of their shipment versus a year ago?
Mendo Akdag
It’s really before the shipment, how long it’s taking has been reduced. The average time of all the shipment is about the same. A slight improvement, probably half a day improvement I would say compared to last year.
Anthony Lebiedzinski
Okay. That’s helpful. And as far as new customer acquisition costs you said was flat versus a year ago. Broadly speaking, do you expect that to be stable or to go up or to go down? Anything you can comment on that, that’d be helpful.
Mendo Akdag
It really will depend on what the competition does and what the availability of advertising is, so it’s difficult to answer that. It depends only if the cost goes up.
Anthony Lebiedzinski
Okay. I think that’s all I have for now. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. At the moment, sir, we don’t have any further questions on queue. You may proceed.
Mendo Akdag
Thank you. In fiscal 2018, we are focusing on continuing to increase sales and improve our service levels. This wraps us today’s conference call. Thank you for joining us. Operator, this ends the conference call.
Operator

        Doesn't work
I've had my dog on the Plus version to prevent worms 
Well guess who had to go to the emergency vet for the bloody stool caused by worms
She's been on the prevention form months and has never missed a dose. She was negative before we began treatment so she had to have contracted the worms ON her medicine. 
Of course I go to call the manufacturers and there is absolutely no way to contact them. I'm sick over this and so is my pup.

Q&A









            I have a 4.5 lb. 5month little toy poodle.  Is your smallest dose save to give her?
        


Asked by: Gail

            Yes, this medication is safe to give to your dog, as there is no weight limit. You will give the smallest dose of the blue box (up to 25lbs) once a month. Hope this helps.

            How do I use a written RX from my vet for Heart guard for my dogs?
        


Asked by: Gracie

            When you purchase the product from us, you can either have your Vet fax over the script or you can scan us a copy or fax it over yourself. If you have further questions/concerns, I would contact our customer service department and they will help guide you. Toll free 1-800-738-6337. Hope this helps.

            My dog has food allergies. He is on a grain free and poultry free diet. &nbsp;Can he take this medicine?
        


Asked by: Dawn2017

            It is not certain what this product is made with, as the manufacturer does not list it. You may want to call the manufacturer for specific ingredients. These are beef flavored and do not contain poultry though, but they could be processed in a factory where other grain or poultry products were used. Hope this helps.

            I am a few days late giving my dogs their heart guard.   My 35 pound dog is the only one that doesn't get the brown Pk.   That's all I have right now, is it ok for her to get a larger dose this time?
        


Asked by: Angela

            Hello,
It would depend on the weight of your other dog. I would consult with your vet before taking any action.
Thank you,

        Better product for my dog than other brands
I had my chihuahua on "the other" leading brand and he was constantly scratching for weeks after application.  My vet recommended I try Frontline because it has a completely different formulation.  No more scratching and it seems to work as well as other brands.

        Best flea repellent
I've used this for all my dogs as it is the best flea repellent. Especially, since I've had (and currently have) dogs that are great at spitting out any type of oral medication.  And that's even when the meds are coated in peanut butter or cheese.

        Important part of flea allergy regimen!
My beagle, Zephyr, has a serious flea allergy.  If she gets bitten she runs a fever, her skin turns bright red, her ears swell to 3 times their normal thickness, & she becomes very lethargic.  Even with the help of antihistamines it takes her a week to get back to normal.  I now have her on a regimen of Frontline, followed by another flea product 2 weeks later, then back to Frontline again.  This is NOT something anyone should try without specific advice from a veterinarian, but I sure am glad that we have Frontline to help keep her allergy under control.  My other dog, Jasper, uses just Frontline & he is flea free & happy.

        Works well in Hawaii, Does not work in SC
My dog is 11 years old and when we lived in south caroline, I had to get advantix and then, advantix II.  However, Frontline plus works here.  I think it really depends on your area and how bad the fleas get. I recently tried the generic brand and the smell is bad.  I'll be going back to the Frontline plus!

        Frontline
Have used Frontline for my dogs for many years....it no longer works!  Vet said the fleas have become immune to it.  Had to switch to another product.

            My dog is 22-24 pounds. I got her the 5-22 pound box because I did not want to put the stronger one on her since she's right on the border. She is an italian greyhound so she has very little fur. Is this okay?
        


Asked by: Kate

            We can only advise to administer the medication the way the manufacturer intended, which is by weight class. If your pet is over 22lbs there is no guarantee that she will fully protected if you are using the 5-22lb weight class.

            My puppy is 2.16 lb i think she has flees, &nbsp;because she itches alot. &nbsp;It seems you don't have one for puppy. &nbsp;Can i still use the one for 5 lb ? Would it hurt her?&nbsp;
        


Asked by: reb 5

            Frontline has not been approved for puppies that small.  Advantage II is a little better, but still, the minimum weight is 3 pounds.  A better choice for now would be Capstar tablets.  They are approved for puppies 4 weeks old and older and there is no minimum weight.  It will kill all the fleas that get on your puppy, but only lasts for 24 hours so you may need to give additional tablets every couple of days until your puppy is large enough for one of the other products.

            My cat weighs 20lbs and it seems like only 1 dose doesn't work. Can i use 2 would it hurt him? I put it on him about 2 weeks ago
        


Asked by: Michelle

            Adult fleas that are living ON your pet are the last 5% of the lifecycle and population of the flea. Seriously, if you find one adult flea on your pet and they spend any amount of time indoors, you have A LOT of fleas in your house (eggs, larvae, pupae). Hit them hard and go all out. Treat all pets at the same time. Vacuum everything. Throw the vacuum bags directly in a trash bag and close it. Bomb the whole house. Do the same thing in a month (and continue if needed). It sounds like a lot of work (and money), but trust me it will end up being 10x that if you don't.

Asked by: Robby

            We are very sorry, we do not have a way of checking the size by the lot number. However if the application is still in the foil package the maximum size is printed on the back.

Operator
Welcome to the PetMed Express, Inc. doing business as 1-800-PetMeds Conference Call to review the financial results for the First Fiscal Quarter ended on June 30, 2017. At the request of the company, this conference call is being recorded.
Founded in 1996, 1-800-PetMeds is America’s largest pet pharmacy delivering prescription and non-prescription pet medications and other health products for dogs and cats direct to the customer. 1-800-PetMeds markets its products through national advertising campaigns, which direct customers to order by phone or on the Internet and to aim to increase the recognition of the PetMed’s family of brand names. 1-800-PetMeds provides an attractive alternative for obtaining pet medications in terms of convenience, price, ease of ordering, and rapid home delivery.
At this time, I would now like to turn the call over to the company’s Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Bruce Rosenbloom. Sir, you may now begin.
Bruce Rosenbloom
Thank you. I’d like to welcome everybody here today. Before I turn the call over to Mendo Akdag, our President and Chief Executive Officer, I would like to remind everyone that the first portion of this conference call will be listen-only until the question-and-answer session, which will be later in the call.
Also, certain information that will be included in this press conference may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or the Securities and Exchange Commission that may involve a number of risks and uncertainties. These statements are based on our beliefs as well as assumptions we have used based upon information currently available to us.
Because these statements reflect our current views concerning future events, these statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Actual future results may vary significantly based on a number of factors that may cause the actual results or events to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these statements. We have identified various risk factors associated with our operations in our most recent annual report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Now let me introduce today’s speaker, Mendo Akdag, the President and Chief Executive Officer of 1-800-PetMeds. Mendo?
Mendo Akdag
Thank you, Bruce. Welcome, and thank you for joining us. Today, we will review the highlights of our financial results. We’ll compare our first fiscal quarter ended on June 30, 2017 to last year’s quarter ended on June 30, 2016.
For the first fiscal quarter ended on June 30, 2017, sales were $79.7 million compared to sales of $72.5 million for the same period the prior year, an increase of 10%. The increase in sales was due to increases in new order and reorder sales.
Our average order value was approximately $87 for the quarter compared to $82 for the same quarter last year. For the first fiscal quarter, net income was $9.3 million or $0.45 diluted per share compared to $6.6 million or $0.32 diluted per share for the same quarter last year, an increase to net income of 41%. The accelerated increase in net income was mainly due to higher gross profit margins. 
New order sales increased by 14% to $15.2 million for the quarter compared to $13.3 million for the same quarter the prior year. Reorder sales increased by 9% to $64.5 million for the quarter compared to reorder sales of $59.2 million for the same quarter last year.

We acquired approximately 169,000 new customers in our first fiscal quarter compared to 158,000 for the same period the prior year. Approximately 84% of our sales were generated on our Web site for the quarter compared to 82% for the same period last year, which resulted in a 12% increase in ROI sales for the quarter.
The seasonality in our business is due to the proportional flea, tick and heartworm medications in our product mix. Spring and summer are considered peak seasons with fall and winter being the off seasons.
For the first fiscal quarter, our gross profit as a percent of sales was 34.5% compared to 31% for the same period a year ago. The shift in sales to higher margin items, the trend we had seen in the March quarter, continued in the June quarter.
Our general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales was down to 7.8% compared to 8.4% for the same period last year. We were able to leverage the G&A with increased sales.
We spent $6.3 million in advertising for the quarter compared to $5.8 million for the same quarter the prior year, an increase of about 9%. The advertising cost of acquiring a customer was approximately the same $37 compared to the same quarter a year ago.
We had $68.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $23 million in inventory with no debt as of June 30, 2017. Net cash from operations for the quarter was $13.9 million compared to $13.1 million for the same period last year.
This ends the financial review. Operator, we are ready to take questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from the line of Kevin Ellich from Craig-Hallum. Sir, your line now is open.
Kevin Ellich
Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, Mendo. I guess starting off with the revenue growth 10%, we’ve seen a nice acceleration here. I guess what are you guys expecting for the rest of the year? In the press release, you talk about focusing on increasing sales and improving service levels. What are you doing? And then where do you think revenue growth can go?
Mendo Akdag
We anticipate spending more on advertising compared to the last fiscal year. So we’re going to be a bit more aggressive on advertising. So hopefully that should continue helping new order sales. There’s an increase in customer retention compared to last year which had a positive impact. So we’ll see if that continues.
Kevin Ellich
And it is all still just online or are you doing anything else? I know you guys cut out TV advertising. But have you shifted the strategy at all?
Mendo Akdag
No. The strategy is the same as last year.
Kevin Ellich
Great. And then gross margins were up 350 basis points again this quarter. We saw that continuation. You commented on the higher margin item shift and that trend continuing. When you talk higher margin items, are we talking prescription medications, is it more specifically – are we seeing growth in the oral flea and tick products, how are the generic OTC topicals trending? Any color on that front?
Mendo Akdag
All I can tell you is there’s a shift of new generation medications and I’m going to leave it at that.
Kevin Ellich
Okay. That’s fine. And then average order value was up as well pretty nicely I think and is that a function of customers ordering more products in their orders or are you seeing higher priced products being placed?
Mendo Akdag
Higher priced items – there’s a shift to higher priced items.
Kevin Ellich
Okay. And I assume --
Mendo Akdag
Higher margin items are also higher priced.
Kevin Ellich
Yes, that’s what I thought. And then, Bruce, just one quick one for you. G&A, you guys are doing a nice job on the leverage. What are the main drivers of the G&A leverage and how much do you have to go on that front?

Bruce Rosenbloom
As you know, we spent a significant amount of money in our new infrastructure last year. So we have a significant amount of capacity to grow the business in our current facility. So as far as leveraging G&A, if things go well on the revenue front or we’re able to decrease revenue, that should have a positive impact on G&A leverage in the future.
Kevin Ellich
Okay. And then lastly, are you seeing any increase in competition either from the online channel or retail, Mendo?
Mendo Akdag
I would say it’s similar to last year.
Kevin Ellich
Great. Thanks, guys.
Mendo Akdag
You’re welcome.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Erin Wright from Credit Suisse. Your line now is open.
Erin Wright
Great. Thanks. A follow up to one of Kevin’s questions, the last one on competitive landscape, but can you just speak more broadly to kind of what you’re seeing from both retail and online competitors, and also comment on the broader industry consolidation? Do you expect the consolidation to continue and do you view this as an opportunity or a challenge for you? If you could comment on that, that would be great. Thanks.
Mendo Akdag
As far as the competition is concerned, they’re more focused on over-the-counter medications. So that’s why we are seeing the competition both brick and mortar and online. And as far as the M&As in the industry, it appears it’s going to continue, if you’re guess is as good as mine. But it depends on really what they do differently, if anything. So it remains to be seen.
Erin Wright
Okay. Thanks. And then I noticed in one of your recent filings a comment around kind of an opportunity to directly order or partner from manufacturers. Are you seeing any sort of change in your relationships with any sort of direct manufacturers, meaning are they more willing to just work with you directly?
Mendo Akdag
Our vendor relationships are proprietary and confidential, so I’m not at liberty to discuss it. I assume the disclosure is probably saying that we are always attempting working on getting direct relationships.
Erin Wright
Is it safe to assume then the vast majority is still going through distribution?
Mendo Akdag
I’m not going to comment. As I said, our vendor relationships are proprietary and confidential.
Erin Wright
Okay, great. Thank you.
Mendo Akdag
You’re welcome.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is coming from the line of Anthony Lebiedzinski of Sidoti & Company. Sir, your line now is open.
Anthony Lebiedzinski
Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. So, Mendo or Bruce whoever, but I think Mendo you commented about the increased customer retention. What would you attribute that to? Any specific reasons that you can cite?
Mendo Akdag
Probably better service. We have a new infrastructure or I believe our speed of service delivery has improved since we moved to the new facility, so that’s helping. So I will say our service levels are better this year than last year.
Anthony Lebiedzinski
Okay. So just a follow up on that. So what is the average time now that the customer gets delivery of their shipment versus a year ago?
Mendo Akdag
It’s really before the shipment, how long it’s taking has been reduced. The average time of all the shipment is about the same. A slight improvement, probably half a day improvement I would say compared to last year.
Anthony Lebiedzinski
Okay. That’s helpful. And as far as new customer acquisition costs you said was flat versus a year ago. Broadly speaking, do you expect that to be stable or to go up or to go down? Anything you can comment on that, that’d be helpful.
Mendo Akdag
It really will depend on what the competition does and what the availability of advertising is, so it’s difficult to answer that. It depends only if the cost goes up.

Anthony Lebiedzinski
Okay. I think that’s all I have for now. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. At the moment, sir, we don’t have any further questions on queue. You may proceed.
Mendo Akdag
Thank you. In fiscal 2018, we are focusing on continuing to increase sales and improve our service levels. This wraps us today’s conference call. Thank you for joining us. Operator, this ends the conference call.
Operator
Thank you. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share on the Company's common stock.  The dividend will be payable on August 18, 2017, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 7, 2017.  The Company intends to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends; however, the declaration and payment of future dividends is discretionary and will be subject to a determination by the Board of Directors each quarter following its review of the Company's financial performance.

PetMed Express, Inc. also known as 1-800-PetMeds,[1] is an online pharmacy, based in the United States, that sells drugs for pets.
Business[edit]
PetMed Express is an online pharmacy that sells drugs for pets.[2]
Its business directly competes with veterinarians, who derive some of their income from selling pet drugs, which has created problems for the company because it can only fill prescriptions written by a veterinarian.[2][3] This competition, the company's refusal to disclose to veterinarians where it obtains its drugs and how it handles them, and the company's business practices has created distrust in the veterinary community from early on in the company's history.[4]
PetMed Express is licensed or authorized to conduct business in all 50 states in the United States[5] and has received Vet-VIPPS accreditation by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP).[6]
History[edit]
Petmed Express was founded in Florida in 1996.[7] Its stock was traded on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol PETS from September 1997 until March 2000; in March 2000 the company began the process of becoming listed on the National Quotation Bureau Electronic Quotation Service and became responsible for reporting to the SEC.[7][8] Marc Puleo, an anesthesiologist, was the founding CEO.[7]
Until 2002 PetMed Express and a company called Savemax Inc. operated in the same premises, shared staff, and operated under the same pharmacy licenses; according to the lawyer for both companies, Savemax was formed because of "a concern over PetMed's liability, and whether it [would] continue."[9]
From 1999 to 2002, PetMed Express and SaveMax were charged with violating the pharmaceutical law in several states. In one instance it was fined by the Environmental Protection Agency for selling drugs in metric doses, and has also received a warning letter from the FDA for selling misbranded drugs.[7][10]
In 1999, PetMed Express settled charges with the Florida Pharmacy Board for selling drugs that did not have prescriptions, false advertising, poor record keeping, and not labelling drugs correctly; PetMed Express paid a fine of around $30,000, agreed to send its pharmacist for further education, agreed to random inspections, and agreed to provide regular reports to the board.[9]
In 2001, Menderes Akdag became the CEO.[11]
In 2002, PetMed Express and Savemax were fined by the EPA for selling drugs marked with metric doses;[10] the drugs were made by Novartis for sale in Europe and Australia and the doses and labelling were not FDA-approved and Novartis sued the two companies for damages.[12]
In 2002, PetMed Express, this time with Savemax, was again charged by the Florida Pharmacy Board for contracting with veterinarians to write prescriptions for animals they had never examined, for selling animals drugs that had not been approved by the FDA, and for sharing its pharmacy license with SaveMax; PetMed Express agreed to dismantle the program, pay penalties, agree to random inspections, and provide free drugs to the community, and to have Savemax move to a different facility and obtain its own license.[9] The Florida board provided information to national boards and encouraged other state boards to take actions against veterinarians who had worked with PetMed Express to provide prescriptions for animals they had not examined.[9] In the same year, the company settled similar charges in Ohio[13]
In November 2002 the pharmacy board in Texas filed a lawsuit charging PetMed Express with dispensing veterinary drugs without prescriptions.[10] The case was settled in 2006 with a $50,000 fine and three years probation.[14]
The company's 2002 annual report said that its gross profits increased 261 percent in that year and were about $9.5 million and that its sales had increased by 220 percent over the last year.[9]
In 2004 securities class action lawsuits were filed against the company a month after it announced that its earnings were well below the guidance it had provided. The plaintiffs claimed that management had known that its business model competing with veterinarians was not sustainable and that as an unauthorized reseller of drugs, it could not control its supply. In 2005, the lawsuits were voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs.[15]
The company was picked 4th among Forbes magazine's 200 Best Small Business Companies in 2006 and number 6 in 2007.[16][17] BusinessWeek named PetMed Express number 27 of its top 100 "Hot Growth Companies" in 2006.[18]
In January 2007, PetMed Express began airing television commercials featuring actress and animal activist Betty White.[19]

PetMed Express, Inc. also known as 1-800-PetMeds,[1] is an online pharmacy, based in the United States, that sells drugs for pets.
Business[edit]
PetMed Express is an online pharmacy that sells drugs for pets.[2]
Its business directly competes with veterinarians, who derive some of their income from selling pet drugs, which has created problems for the company because it can only fill prescriptions written by a veterinarian.[2][3] This competition, the company's refusal to disclose to veterinarians where it obtains its drugs and how it handles them, and the company's business practices has created distrust in the veterinary community from early on in the company's history.[4]
PetMed Express is licensed or authorized to conduct business in all 50 states in the United States[5] and has received Vet-VIPPS accreditation by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP).[6]
History[edit]
Petmed Express was founded in Florida in 1996.[7] Its stock was traded on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol PETS from September 1997 until March 2000; in March 2000 the company began the process of becoming listed on the National Quotation Bureau Electronic Quotation Service and became responsible for reporting to the SEC.[7][8] Marc Puleo, an anesthesiologist, was the founding CEO.[7]
Until 2002 PetMed Express and a company called Savemax Inc. operated in the same premises, shared staff, and operated under the same pharmacy licenses; according to the lawyer for both companies, Savemax was formed because of "a concern over PetMed's liability, and whether it [would] continue."[9]
From 1999 to 2002, PetMed Express and SaveMax were charged with violating the pharmaceutical law in several states. In one instance it was fined by the Environmental Protection Agency for selling drugs in metric doses, and has also received a warning letter from the FDA for selling misbranded drugs.[7][10]
In 1999, PetMed Express settled charges with the Florida Pharmacy Board for selling drugs that did not have prescriptions, false advertising, poor record keeping, and not labelling drugs correctly; PetMed Express paid a fine of around $30,000, agreed to send its pharmacist for further education, agreed to random inspections, and agreed to provide regular reports to the board.[9]
In 2001, Menderes Akdag became the CEO.[11]
In 2002, PetMed Express and Savemax were fined by the EPA for selling drugs marked with metric doses;[10] the drugs were made by Novartis for sale in Europe and Australia and the doses and labelling were not FDA-approved and Novartis sued the two companies for damages.[12]
In 2002, PetMed Express, this time with Savemax, was again charged by the Florida Pharmacy Board for contracting with veterinarians to write prescriptions for animals they had never examined, for selling animals drugs that had not been approved by the FDA, and for sharing its pharmacy license with SaveMax; PetMed Express agreed to dismantle the program, pay penalties, agree to random inspections, and provide free drugs to the community, and to have Savemax move to a different facility and obtain its own license.[9] The Florida board provided information to national boards and encouraged other state boards to take actions against veterinarians who had worked with PetMed Express to provide prescriptions for animals they had not examined.[9] In the same year, the company settled similar charges in Ohio[13]
In November 2002 the pharmacy board in Texas filed a lawsuit charging PetMed Express with dispensing veterinary drugs without prescriptions.[10] The case was settled in 2006 with a $50,000 fine and three years probation.[14]
The company's 2002 annual report said that its gross profits increased 261 percent in that year and were about $9.5 million and that its sales had increased by 220 percent over the last year.[9]
In 2004 securities class action lawsuits were filed against the company a month after it announced that its earnings were well below the guidance it had provided. The plaintiffs claimed that management had known that its business model competing with veterinarians was not sustainable and that as an unauthorized reseller of drugs, it could not control its supply. In 2005, the lawsuits were voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs.[15]
The company was picked 4th among Forbes magazine's 200 Best Small Business Companies in 2006 and number 6 in 2007.[16][17] BusinessWeek named PetMed Express number 27 of its top 100 "Hot Growth Companies" in 2006.[18]
In January 2007, PetMed Express began airing television commercials featuring actress and animal activist Betty White.[19]

PetMed Express, Inc. also known as 1-800-PetMeds,[1] is an online pharmacy, based in the United States, that sells drugs for pets.
Business[edit]
PetMed Express is an online pharmacy that sells drugs for pets.[2]
Its business directly competes with veterinarians, who derive some of their income from selling pet drugs, which has created problems for the company because it can only fill prescriptions written by a veterinarian.[2][3] This competition, the company's refusal to disclose to veterinarians where it obtains its drugs and how it handles them, and the company's business practices has created distrust in the veterinary community from early on in the company's history.[4]
PetMed Express is licensed or authorized to conduct business in all 50 states in the United States[5] and has received Vet-VIPPS accreditation by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP).[6]

Buying from 1-800-PetMeds vs. your veterinarian




Are the medications from my veterinarian better than those from 1-800-PetMeds?
								No, we sell only U.S. FDA/EPA-approved medications (the same exact medications sold by your veterinarian). Also, we have a much larger selection of products than most veterinarians have. And, with our high volume of sales to millions of customers, we're able to deliver the freshest products direct to your door saving you time and money.

Does my veterinarian have a better product guarantee than 1-800-PetMeds?
								No, we have the best guarantee on products, because we honor all manufacturers' guarantees and we will refund your money for any reason. It is only for competitive reasons that some veterinarians say that the products purchased through their office have a better guarantee. They want you to keep buying  medications from their office and they don't want price competition. (This keeps your prices high!)

Is there any reason that I shouldn't buy from 1-800-PetMeds?
								No, there is no reason. As with all licensed pharmacies, our products and facilities are regularly inspected by state agencies and we're in full compliance. Our pharmacy takes the same special care with your pet's prescriptions as your local pharmacy takes with your own prescriptions. We have excellent customer service and aim to keep, you, our valued customer 100% satisfied.

Does my veterinarian need to sell me my pet's medications so that they can properly instruct usage of the product?
								No. Pharmacists are recognized in the health care industry as "the experts" on medication use. Our licensed pharmacists will gladly help answer any questions that you may have as well as give you helpful tips on giving your pet the medication.

Does 1-800-PetMeds dispense prescription medications without a veterinarian's authorization?
								No. All prescription medications must have an authorization before they are dispensed. All of our written and faxed prescriptions are stored electronically for quick retrieval. In addition, all of our phone authorizations are recorded.

Does 1-800-PetMeds sell foreign, damaged, or out-of-date product?
								No, we sell only U.S. FDA/EPA-approved medications (the same exact medications sold by your veterinarian). And, with our high volume of sales to millions of customers, we are able to deliver the freshest products direct to your door saving you time and money. We follow strict standards when it comes to product expiration dates. As with all licensed pharmacies, our products and facilities are regularly inspected by state agencies and we're in full compliance.

When I buy pet meds through 1-800-PetMeds do I still receive the manufacturers' guarantees?
								Yes, we meet or exceed all manufacturers' guarantees on our products without the fuss and hassle. You get the highest quality, U.S. FDA/EPA-approved products delivered fresh to your door. And if you are not 100% satisfied, we will refund your money. Compare your vet's guarantee to ours, click here.

What is the difference between Heartgard Plus and Trifexis?

Trifexis kills fleas, prevents heartworms and controls roundworms, hookworms and whipworms. It comes in a flavored pill form for dogs and cats.

Does my dog need a heartworm test every year?
								While in the past, the American Heartworm Society recommended periodic but not necessarily annual testing, because of some concerns with breaks regarding animals on preventives that still contracted heartworms, the 2005 guidelines now recommend annual testing and testing between preventative product changes.

								The 2005 guidelines of the American Heartworm Society recommend year-round prevention in order to manage heartworm disease.

What is the difference between Frontline Plus and  K9 Advantix II?
								K9 Advantix II has an added ingredient that repels and kills mosquitoes.

Do I need a prescription to purchase medications?
								Most flea and tick control products such as Frontline Plus and Advantage II do not require a prescription. If you are purchasing prescription required medications all we need is your veterinarian's name and phone number and we will obtain your pet's prescription for you free of charge. We will ask for the necessary information during your checkout. If you have a written prescription please mail it to us at 420 S Congress Ave, Suite 100, Delray Beach, FL. 33445 or have your veterinarian fax it to us at 1-800-600-8285.

Thousands of Internet based transactions are secured every day by this technology. For your protection and ours, we also employ a state-of-the-art fraud-detection system that minimizes the likelihood that your credit card will be fraudulently used.

If someone else finds my account information, can they use it to buy products?
								Your billing information is safe, our web site will never display your credit card number. If you logged in with a password you can conveniently use your last credit card, if you did not use a password to log in you will be required to enter your credit card number during checkout.

What is 1800PetMeds.com privacy policy?
								At 1800PetMeds.com we are committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. For full details on our Privacy Policy, click here






About Pricing




How can 1-800-PetMeds® sell pet medications at a lower price than my veterinarian and deliver them so fast?
								Because of our large sales volume and low overhead, we purchase these medications at wholesale prices. Delivery is fast because we ship from one central location to the entire nation.

What is 1-800-PetMeds® pricing policy?
								Unfortunately, there is no way to beat all the prices in the nation. For that reason, we meet all competitors' prices at time of order. If you find a lower price including shipping on the identical product from a Vet-VIPPS® accredited online pet pharmacy, we will honor that price at the time of order as long as the product is FDA/EPA approved for sale in the United States. The price being matched must be a product dispensed by an accredited licensed-pharmacy or veterinarian residing in the United States. 
								Simply click here to find out how.






About Payment Methods




Can I pay by Credit Card?
								We accept the following major credit cards. MasterCard, Visa, American Express, and Discover.

Can I pay by Check?
								Yes. Also, a pay by check option is available on our website and through customer care at 1-800-738-6337. You will need a copy of your check, date of birth and your driver's license.

Can I pay through PayPal?
								Yes. PayPal securely processes payments for 1-800-PetMeds, for orders placed both on our website and on our mobile site.






About your Account Log In




How  can I access my account?
								Ordered online before? 
								If you have previously ordered from us online, you can access your account through our Login page by clicking the "My Account" link and then click the "Sign in" link conveniently located on the top menu bar of practically every page of our website.  You then have two ways to log in.
								 
Haven't ordered online before, but want to access your account online?
 
								If you previously ordered by telephone or through the mail and did not supply an email address, you still have an account that can be accessed through the website, and you can certainly place an order online now. Just shop and when you're ready to checkout, enter the information requested of "New Customers."  Based on the information you enter, unless your name and address have changed, we can match it to your current account. Any new information will automatically be updated.  And, even if your name and address have changed, don't worry. It will just be as though you are opening a new account!
							
							What if I can't log in because I forgot my password and the credit card I used with my last order?
								You have a couple of options.
								 
								Just shop and when you're ready to checkout, enter the information requested of "New Customers."  Based on the information you enter, unless your name and address have changed, we can match it to your current account. Any new information will automatically be updated.  And, even if your name and address have changed, don't worry. It will just be as though you are opening a new account!
								 
								If you still have the same email address from when you last ordered:
								 
								1) Go to the Login page, by clicking the "My Account" link and then click the "Sign in" link conveniently located on the top menu bar of practically every page of our website.
								 
								2) Click on "Forgot Your Password and/or E-Mail Address?" and then use Option 2.  A new password will be sent to you via email.  You will then be able to access your account by following the login instruction in the "How can I access my account?" paragraph above.

What if I want to change my password?
								After you log in to your account, click on "Edit Password"  You will then be prompted to enter a new password and confirm your new password.  This option will only work if you have logged in to your account using a password.

What if I want to change my e-mail address?
								After you log in to your account, click on "Edit Email Address"  Your email address will automatically appear here.  Merely enter the new information and confirm the information.

What if I just can't log on?
								That's okay. You do not have to log on to place an order. Just shop as much as you want, and when you're ready to checkout, based on the information you enter, we can match it to your current account. Any new information will automatically be updated.

What if I am a new customer?
								As a new customer you do not yet have an account, and don't need one in order to browse and make your selections. We suggest that you visit the "New Customers" page to learn how easy it is to place an order with us online. Once you make your selections and "Checkout" you will be asked to enter the information needed to get your order on its way to you. An account will then be created automatically for you and the next time you order, you just follow the instructions above on accessing your account.

Do you use cookies on your website?
								We use cookies to make your shopping experience with us easy and convenient. If you would like to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies or disable cookies altogether, the Help button on your computer's toolbar should tell you how.

How secure is my Credit Card information?
								We store your credit card information in a secure database which is completely separate from the website. Even when you log in using your email address and password we do not display your full credit card number. If you happen to log in to our website using a cookie, for your security, your stored credit card number is not used.

Who can I contact if I have other problems or questions?
								If you have other problems related to logging in to our website that have not been answered here, you can contact us by calling 1-800-PetMeds® (1-800-738-6337) or sending us an email at customerservice@1800PetMeds.com.

PetMed Express, Inc. also known as 1-800-PetMeds,[1] is an online pharmacy, based in the United States, that sells drugs for pets.
Business[edit]
PetMed Express is an online pharmacy that sells drugs for pets.[2]
Its business directly competes with veterinarians, who derive some of their income from selling pet drugs, which has created problems for the company because it can only fill prescriptions written by a veterinarian.[2][3] This competition, the company's refusal to disclose to veterinarians where it obtains its drugs and how it handles them, and the company's business practices has created distrust in the veterinary community from early on in the company's history.[4]
PetMed Express is licensed or authorized to conduct business in all 50 states in the United States[5] and has received Vet-VIPPS accreditation by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP).[6]
History[edit]
Petmed Express was founded in Florida in 1996.[7] Its stock was traded on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol PETS from September 1997 until March 2000; in March 2000 the company began the process of becoming listed on the National Quotation Bureau Electronic Quotation Service and became responsible for reporting to the SEC.[7][8] Marc Puleo, an anesthesiologist, was the founding CEO.[7]
Until 2002 PetMed Express and a company called Savemax Inc. operated in the same premises, shared staff, and operated under the same pharmacy licenses; according to the lawyer for both companies, Savemax was formed because of "a concern over PetMed's liability, and whether it [would] continue."[9]
From 1999 to 2002, PetMed Express and SaveMax were charged with violating the pharmaceutical law in several states. In one instance it was fined by the Environmental Protection Agency for selling drugs in metric doses, and has also received a warning letter from the FDA for selling misbranded drugs.[7][10]
In 1999, PetMed Express settled charges with the Florida Pharmacy Board for selling drugs that did not have prescriptions, false advertising, poor record keeping, and not labelling drugs correctly; PetMed Express paid a fine of around $30,000, agreed to send its pharmacist for further education, agreed to random inspections, and agreed to provide regular reports to the board.[9]
In 2001, Menderes Akdag became the CEO.[11]
In 2002, PetMed Express and Savemax were fined by the EPA for selling drugs marked with metric doses;[10] the drugs were made by Novartis for sale in Europe and Australia and the doses and labelling were not FDA-approved and Novartis sued the two companies for damages.[12]
In 2002, PetMed Express, this time with Savemax, was again charged by the Florida Pharmacy Board for contracting with veterinarians to write prescriptions for animals they had never examined, for selling animals drugs that had not been approved by the FDA, and for sharing its pharmacy license with SaveMax; PetMed Express agreed to dismantle the program, pay penalties, agree to random inspections, and provide free drugs to the community, and to have Savemax move to a different facility and obtain its own license.[9] The Florida board provided information to national boards and encouraged other state boards to take actions against veterinarians who had worked with PetMed Express to provide prescriptions for animals they had not examined.[9] In the same year, the company settled similar charges in Ohio[13]
In November 2002 the pharmacy board in Texas filed a lawsuit charging PetMed Express with dispensing veterinary drugs without prescriptions.[10] The case was settled in 2006 with a $50,000 fine and three years probation.[14]
The company's 2002 annual report said that its gross profits increased 261 percent in that year and were about $9.5 million and that its sales had increased by 220 percent over the last year.[9]
In 2004 securities class action lawsuits were filed against the company a month after it announced that its earnings were well below the guidance it had provided. The plaintiffs claimed that management had known that its business model competing with veterinarians was not sustainable and that as an unauthorized reseller of drugs, it could not control its supply. In 2005, the lawsuits were voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs.[15]
The company was picked 4th among Forbes magazine's 200 Best Small Business Companies in 2006 and number 6 in 2007.[16][17] BusinessWeek named PetMed Express number 27 of its top 100 "Hot Growth Companies" in 2006.[18]
In January 2007, PetMed Express began airing television commercials featuring actress and animal activist Betty White.[19]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
