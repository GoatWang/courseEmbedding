He has extensive experience drafting and interpreting carrier discussion agreements, vessel sharing agreements, space charter agreements, various types of marine terminal operator agreements, and other forms of cooperative working agreements.

Experience







Acted as special U.S. maritime counsel to a bank in connection with a new Senior Secured Term and Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement for $1 billion, including preparing mortgages on the U.S. flag vessels owned by U.S. vessel trusts where the borrow was the beneficial owner; negotiating tripartite agreements among agent and trustee, U.S. vessel trust owners, and U.S.-bases bareboat charterers; and obtaining other U.S. security.





Secured dismissal of a complaint filed with the Federal Maritime Commission against our client, a leading ocean transportation and logistics company, by a trucking firm with which the client had terminated its business relationship. The complaint alleged violations of several provisions of the Shipping Act of 1984, and we moved to dismiss it for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. In its response, the complainant was forced to abandon a number of its Shipping Act claims as being devoid of merit, and the administrative law judge dismissed the remaining claims on both theories advanced in our motion.

FDA Proposes Regulations on Safe Food Transport [Transportation & Logistics Newsletter]


            			            May 02, 2014
					            

                                    In early February, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued its seventh and final major rule as part of the implementation of the Food Safety Modernization Act’s (FSMA). The proposed rule seeks to prevent the contamination of human and animal food during transport by establishing requirements for the design and maintenance of vehicles and transportation equipment, transportation operations, training of carrier personnel and record keeping. It would apply to shippers, receivers and carriers who transport food in the United States by motor or rail.

Profile

 


Joshua Stein retired from partnership on July 31, 2010. He was a partner in the Real Estate Practice Group in the New York office and a member of the American College of Real Estate Lawyers. He handled a wide range of commercial real estate loans, leases, development projects, purchases, sales, restructurings, and other transactions for purchasers, sellers, secured lenders, investors, and borrowers.  He closed loans secured by shopping centers, office buildings, hotels, apartment buildings, mixed-use projects, assisted living facilities, and other real property in portfolio and single-asset transactions in New York and nationally. These included acquisition, refinancing, and development loans.

Mr. Stein negotiated numerous leases, subleases, nondisturbance agreements, and related transactions, including many long-term "financeable" ground leases. He has represented buyers and sellers of almost every type of real property. Mr. Stein's hotel experience includes purchases, sales, development, and negotiation and restructuring of management agreements. He was engaged as an expert witness, and as a court-appointed receiver, in real estate disputes.

For the year ending in May 2006, Mr. Stein chaired the New York State Bar Association's Real Property Law Section, whose 5000 members include most of the real estate lawyers in New York. For five years before that, he chaired the Section's Commercial Leasing Committee.

He has published four books: Stein on New York Commercial Mortgage Transactions (LexisNexis 2006); A Practical Guide to Real Estate Practice (ALI-ABA 2001); Lender's Guide to Structuring and Closing Commercial Mortgage Loans (Mortgage Bankers Association 2004); and A Guide to Ground Leases (With Forms and Checklists) (ALI-ABA 2005). He edited and wrote much of the New York State Bar Association's two-volume treatise on Commercial Leasing (2004) and has published more than 150 articles, checklists and other materials on commercial real estate law and practice. Some of his articles have won awards, including a 2002 Burton Award recognizing clarity and simplicity in legal writing. He is one of the leading nonacademic writers on commercial real estate law and practice in the United States.
His name has appeared repeatedly in these international guides to leading real estate lawyers: America's Leading Lawyers for Business (Chambers); Guide to the World's Leading Real Estate Lawyers (Euromoney Legal Media Group); International Who's Who of Business Lawyers (Law Business Research); International Who's Who of Real Estate Lawyers (Law Business Research); The World's Leading Lawyers (Chambers); and others. Mr. Stein is also recognized as a leading real estate attorney in the 2008 Chambers US legal guide.

How Does A Child Injury Lawsuit in Georgia Work
















Joshua S. Stein

Atlanta's Child Injury LawyerJoshua S. Stein 


























Josh is originally from Marietta, Georgia and began practicing law in 2004 after receiving his undergraduate degree in Risk Management/Insurance and his Law Degree from the University of Georgia.  Following Law School, Josh worked for two years as In-House Litigation Counsel for a national insurance company.  This gave Josh an upfront view of an insurance company’s inner workings and how they handle and resolve lawsuits and injury claims.  Josh successfully tried numerous jury trials, provided advice on coverage issues and worked side-by-side with insurance adjusters on a daily basis evaluating and strategizing on how best to defend personal injury claims.  Josh then worked for ten years at a preeminent Southeast defense firm where he quickly worked his way up from Junior Associate to Equity Partner.  Under the training of some of the state’s finest lawyers, Josh represented Fortune 500 companies, national retailers, product manufacturers, and insurance companies for over a decade.  Josh successfully tried, mediated, or otherwise successfully defended thousands of lawsuits including catastrophic injury claims and wrongful death claims in such areas as premises liability, trucking/automobile liability, child injury claims, product liability, dram shop liability, professional negligence and nursing home malpractice.  Josh also represented many schools and various local/ small businesses in a General Counsel role.
After 12 years of working on the defense side, Josh was proud to join the Law Offices of Andrew E. Goldner, LLC as Of Counsel where the firm founder, Andy Goldner, proved to be one of his most worthy opponents, and friends, over the years.  Josh will join the firms fight for individuals who have been severely injured due to the negligence of others.  Josh’s past experiences gave him the motivation to help injured individuals who have been treated poorly by insurance companies as well as uniquely allowing him to provide his clients with an advantage since he knows the strategies used by the defense industry.  Josh has literally learned the playbook on how to try and defend personal injury claims and will now use this knowledge to succeed in maximizing recoveries for his clients.  This switch has also proven to better suit Josh’s personality of taking interest in each person who he is fortunate enough to represent and fight for as he gets the opportunity to know them and their family to help them through their difficult time.
Josh has earned numerous awards and honors over the years while participating in national industry organizations.  Josh has been named multiple times as a Georgia Super Lawyers “Rising Star” (awarded to top 5% of lawyers under 40), has been included multiple times in Georgia Trend’s “Legal Elite” and named by the National Trial Lawyers as a Top 100 Trial Lawyer.
Josh is admitted to practice in Georgia before the Georgia Court of Appeals, Georgia Supreme Court and the Northern and Middle Districts of the United States District Courts of Georgia.  He is currently a member of the State Bar of Georgia, Georgia Trial Lawyers Association and Atlanta Bar Association. Josh is in active participant with the Atlanta Volunteer Lawyers Foundation, serves as a Guardian Ad Litem in the pro bono program and worked closely with the YLD Mentor-Mentee Program.  Josh is a past member/presenter for such national organizations as DRI (Defense Research Institute), NRRDA (National Restaurant and Retail Defense Association), CLM (Council on Litigation Management) and RIMS (Risk Management Society).  His prior participation in these national defense organizations has proven very valuable in providing Josh with the knowledge and tactics necessary to successfully represent his clients.   
Josh is a proud husband and father of two, who enjoys spending time with his family and watching and playing sports.
