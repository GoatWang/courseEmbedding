Macarthur Minerals Stakes New Claims in Railroad Valley; Surface Samples Assay Up to 300 ppm Lithium - Junior Mining Network











































































			Macarthur Minerals Stakes New Claims in Railroad Valley; Surface Samples Assay Up to 300 ppm Lithium		



                        Lithium                    



                        Nevada                    




VANCOUVER, British Columbia, June 15, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Macarthur Minerals Limited (TSX-V:MMS) (the “Company” or “Macarthur Minerals”) is pleased to announce that it has expanded its lithium brine project portfolio, staking the Reynolds Springs Lithium Brine Project in Nevada on which it has located lithium at surface of up to 300 parts per million (“ppm”) lithium (“Li”).
The Company has staked 210 new unpatented placer mining claims at its new Reynolds Springs Lithium Brine Project (“Reynolds Springs Project”) in the Railroad Valley, Nevada. Three surface samples at the Reynolds Springs Project returned 260 to 300 ppm Li (Figure 1).
Figure 1: Location of the Reynolds Spring Project and results of soil samples
David Taplin, President, CEO and Director of Macarthur Minerals commented:
“Macarthur Minerals is excited about its staking of new claims in the Railroad Valley in Nevada. The new claims forming the Reynolds Spring Project are located on the Railroad Valley playa, which historically records the largest lithium soil anomaly in the State of Nevada. The Railroad Valley claims were chosen because the Valley has geological attributes that closely match the Clayton Valley, which hosts North America’s only producing lithium mine, Albemarle’s Silver Peak Lithium Mine. Macarthur Minerals believes based on a sampling program conducted in the Railroad Valley, it has staked some of the most prospective ground for lithium in that Valley.”
Reynolds Springs Project – Geological Setting
The new claims are located near the town of Currant, in Nye County, Nevada. The Reynolds Springs Project is located approximately 180 miles (300 km) North of Las Vegas, Nevada, and 330 miles (531 km) South East of Tesla’s new Gigafactory (Figure 2).
Figure 2: Regional location of Macarthur Mineral’s Reynolds Spring Project and Stonewall Lithium Project
Railroad Valley is a large topographically closed playa (dry Salt Lake bed) basin located in East-central Nevada. The basin is fault bounded with numerous active thermal springs (anomalous in lithium) emerging along the faults. The fault sets have strike lengths of 25 – 30 miles (42 – 50 km) and are parallel to each other, about 8-12 miles apart. The faults that bound the basin form an elongate rectangular shaped basin of about 300 square miles (830 square km) in size.
Numerous thermal springs emerge along the basin bounding fault systems which form the North-West and South-East flanks of the playa basin. Thermal waters which discharge from the springs carry moderately anomalous values of Lithium. Water samples collected from Reynolds Springs by Macarthur Minerals’ consulting geologists averaged 230 parts per billion (“ppb”) Li and 445 ppb boron. This about twice the concentration for these elements detected from water samples collected at other springs that were sampled in the valley.
The mountains that surround the basin contain outcropping rock units are also anomalous in lithium. This closely matches the geologic criteria for the United State Geological Survey (“USGS”) deposit model for Clayton Valley type lithium brine deposits. Macarthur Minerals believes that the combination of anomalous lithium in soils (+250 ppm) and anomalous lithium in thermal spring waters (230 ppb Li) indicates that the Reynolds Springs Project area is favorable for further exploration.
Historical Data
Prior to staking the claims, Macarthur Minerals completed an analysis of USGS historical soil, rock and groundwater data collected across California, Nevada and Utah. Sediment samples collected in the 1980s, during the United States Department of Energy’s National Uranium Resource Evaluation Program (“NURE”) were of particular interest. Spatial analysis of the historical data shows Railroad Valley to be the largest lithium soil anomaly in the State of Nevada. A total of 19,165 soils samples were collected by NURE across Nevada and analysed for Uranium, Lithium and other elements. Eighty-seven (87) samples returned lithium values in excess of 100 ppm. A cluster of 20 samples greater than 100 ppm were collected from Railroad Valley.
The other area identified from the NURE dataset that had similar elevated lithium levels was the Clayton Valley which hosts North America’s only producing lithium mine, Albemarle’s Silver Peak Lithium Mine. In comparison, approximately 108 samples were collected from the Clayton Valley and surrounding the Silver Peak mine. A total of nine samples reported assays greater than 100 ppm with samples ranging from 102 to 431 ppm Li.
Reconnaissance soil sampling in the Railroad Valley by Macarthur Minerals’ consulting geologists narrowed the area of interest to the Reynolds Springs area on the North-West flank of the playa basin.  A total of five widely spaced reconnaissance soil samples were collected from the Reynolds Springs area.  Analysis of these samples by ALS Chemex Labs using the ME – ICP41 and ICP61 methods returned a range of values for the five samples ranging from 80 – 350 ppm Li (average 256 ppm Li) and a range of 20 – 720 ppm B (average 342 ppm Boron).
The water and soil sample results mentioned above were compared to results from other reconnaissance samples collected elsewhere in the Railroad Valley.  This demonstrated that the Reynolds Springs area appeared to be enriched in lithium.  As a result of that analysis, a total of 210 new 20-acre unpatented placer mining claims were staked as indicated in Figure 1.
Next Steps for the Reynolds Springs Project
The Company has recently completed a 210 point geochemical soils sampling program across the Reynolds Springs Project (concurrent with the claim staking). Samples have been submitted to the laboratory for assay and will be reported when data is available. Following analysis of this wide spaced sampling program, the Company will consider an infill sampling program across areas considered highly prospective for lithium.
Macarthur Minerals is also currently undertaking a review of hyperspectral ASTER satellite imagery of Railroad Valley to identify additional prospective areas.
The Reynolds Spring Project is located only 110 miles (183kms) from the Company’s Stonewall Project in the Lida Valley, Nevada. The close location of the Reynolds Springs Project and Stonewall Project will allow sharing of resources and expertise for exploration of both projects. The Company is considering entering into joint ventures to assist in the exploration of both projects.

Macarthur Minerals Reports Surface Grades Up to 405 ppm Lithium at Railroad Valley - Junior Mining Network











































































			Macarthur Minerals Reports Surface Grades Up to 405 ppm Lithium at Railroad Valley		



                        Lithium                    



                        Nevada                    




VANCOUVER, British Columbia, July 25, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Macarthur Minerals Limited (TSX-V:MMS) (the “Company” or “Macarthur Minerals”) is pleased to announce the results of a geochemical soil sampling program at its new Reynolds Springs Lithium Brine Project (“Reynolds Springs”) in the Railroad Valley, Nevada of up to 405 parts per million (“ppm”) lithium (“Li”).
Figure 1: Soil sampling locations and results from the Reynolds Springs Lithium Project
Figure 2: Regional location of Macarthur Mineral’s Reynolds Springs Project and Stonewall Lithium Project
David Taplin, President, CEO and Director of Macarthur commented:
“Macarthur Minerals is excited about the results of the recent soil sampling program at its Reynolds Springs project in the Railroad Valley, Nevada of up to 405 ppm lithium. The results confirm data from historical USGS surveys that report anomalous lithium values in the Railroad Valley. Given the majority of samples contain lithium in higher concentrations than are typically found in playa sediments, we consider the Reynolds Springs project to be highly prospective for lithium brines.”
Soil Sampling Program
A total of 206 soil samples were collected across the full extent of the placer claims located on the Railroad Valley playa (dry Salt Lake bed). Soil samples were collected from a depth of approximately 1.5 feet (45.7 cm) every 660 feet (201 m) from 12 lines spaced 1,320 feet (402 m) (Figure 1).
Lithium values in the soil samples ranged from a low of 39.3 ppm to a high of 405 ppm Li. Samples were consistently high averaging 168.3 ppm Li with 85% of samples recording over 100 ppm Li and 19% greater than 200 ppm Li. These results are considered high in comparison to the majority of non-lithium producing playas and amongst the highest we have seen outside of the Clayton Valley.
The fact that 19% of the samples returned values above 200 ppm Li and that 66.5% of samples returned values between 100 and 200 ppm Li (Table 1), shows that the prospect is highly anomalous for lithium. Geologic evidence suggests that clays at the prospect were hydrothermally altered by geothermal spring waters to the Li rich clay Hectorite in the vicinity of Reynolds Springs.  Hot lithium-rich geothermal water, leaking into the clays located along the frontal fault of the Pancake Range, partially altered the clays to Hectorite and is the likely source of the anomaly.

Two large area, multi-point anomalies, reporting greater than 200 ppm Li were defined at the Reynolds Springs project (Figure 1). The anomaly near the southern boundary of the prospect extends over 1.75 miles East-West and 0.5 miles North-South (0.88 miles2 – 2.3 km2). This anomaly continues to the south into a wildlife management area where claim staking is prohibited.  At the northern boundary of the prospect, a similar sized anomaly reporting greater than 200 ppm Li has been defined.
Reynolds Springs Project 
The Reynolds Springs project consists of 210 new unpatented placer mining claims located in Railroad Valley, near the town of Currant, in Nye County, Nevada (Figure 2). The Reynolds Springs project is located approximately 180 miles (300 km) North of Las Vegas, Nevada, and 330 miles (531 km) South East of Tesla’s new Gigafactory (Figure 1).
Railroad Valley is a large topographically closed playa basin located in East-Central Nevada. The basin is fault bounded with numerous active thermal springs (anomalous in lithium) emerging along the faults. The fault sets have strike lengths of 25–30 miles (42–50 km) and are parallel to each other, about 8-12 miles apart (13-19 km). The faults that bound the basin form an elongate rectangular shaped basin of about 300 square miles (830 km2) in size.
Numerous thermal springs emerge along the basin bounding fault systems which form the North-West and South-East flanks of the playa basin. Thermal waters which discharge from the springs carry moderately anomalous values of Lithium. Water samples collected from Reynolds Springs by Macarthur Minerals’ consulting geologists averaged 230 parts per billion (“ppb”) Li and 445 ppb boron. This is about twice the concentration for these elements detected from water samples collected at other springs that were sampled in the Railroad Valley.
The mountains that surround the basin contain outcropping rock units also anomalous in lithium. This closely matches the geologic criteria for the United State Geological Survey (“USGS”) ore deposit model for Clayton Valley type lithium brine deposits. Macarthur Minerals believes that the combination of anomalous lithium in soils (+250 ppm) and anomalous lithium in thermal spring waters (230 ppb Li) indicates that the Reynolds Springs area is favourable for further exploration.

After collection in the field, the samples were submitted to the ALS Minerals laboratory in Reno, Nevada for analysis by four-acid digestion and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) multi-element analysis.  ALS Minerals laboratory of Reno, Nevada maintains ISO/IEC 17025:2005 accreditation and operates under a mature Quality Management System.  Internal laboratory quality control includes both control standards and replicate sample analysis.
Next Steps for the Reynolds Springs Project
The Reynolds Springs project is located only 110 miles (183kms) from the Company’s Stonewall project in the Lida Valley, Nevada. The close location of the Reynolds Springs and Stonewall projects will allow sharing of resources and expertise for exploration of both projects. The Company is considering entering into joint ventures to assist in the exploration of both projects.
ALPHA GIANT LIMITED PLACEMENT
The Company terminated the private placement to Alpha Giant Limited announced on June 7, 2017 for non-performance by Alpha Giant Limited. No shares were issued to Alpha Giant Limited.
