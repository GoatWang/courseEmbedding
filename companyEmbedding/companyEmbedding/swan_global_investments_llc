Performance of the Defined Risk Strategy
The Defined Risk Strat­e­gy has an envi­able per­for­mance track record. The Strat­e­gy is designed to provide sta­ble returns over a full mar­ket cycle while always seek­ing to lim­it the impact of large stock mar­ket decli­nes, and we’ve been doing just that since 1997.
 
“By active­ly seek­ing to NOT lose big, we believe that investors will be bet­ter off in the long run.”
    — Randy Swan, Founder, President and Portfolio Manager of Swan Global Investments
Our Legacy of Success
Help­ing Clients Grow and Pro­tect Wealth
We first put our Defined Risk Strat­e­gy to the test in July of 1997.  Since then, our inno­v­a­tive approach has pro­vid­ed the oppor­tu­ni­ty for growth, while reduc­ing our clients’ down­side expo­sure — help­ing our strat­e­gy con­sis­tent­ly out­per­form both the S&P 500 Index and the tra­di­tion­al 60/40 port­fo­lio over full mar­ket cycles since its incep­tion.*
 Minimizing Losses During Bear Markets
Win by Not Los­ing
“By active­ly seek­ing to NOT lose big…”
The Defined Risk Strat­e­gy has min­i­mized port­fo­lio loss­es dur­ing bear mar­kets. The S&P 500 has expe­ri­enced four years of neg­a­tive per­for­mance since 2000, for a cumu­la­tive loss of more than 80%. In those same down years the DRS pro­vid­ed a pos­i­tive total return of 18%.
 A Winning Combination
A Bet­ter Buy-and-Hold
“… We believe that investors will be bet­ter off in the long run.”
The key to the suc­cess of the strat­e­gy is its com­bi­na­tion of expo­sure to mar­ket gains while hedg­ing again­st down­side risk. The strat­e­gy is designed to cap­ture much of the market’s upside and lit­tle of its downside—letting investors par­tic­i­pate as mar­kets accel­er­ate, with a safe­ty net that aims to pre­vent sig­nif­i­cant loss­es.
We believe that is the type of per­for­mance investors desire to face the invest­ment chal­lenges of today and beyond.
 Better Risk-Adjusted Returns
The Defined Risk Strat­e­gy has his­tor­i­cal­ly pro­vid­ed bet­ter risk-adjust­ed returns when com­pared to the S&P 500 Index or the tra­di­tion­al 60/40 port­fo­lio*.
 Swan Defined Risk Strategy Performance
Rolling Returns
* — All data based on historic performance of the Swan DRS Select Composite, net of fees.
Disclosures: Performance results are presented in U.S. dollars and are net-of-actual-fees and trading expenses and reflect the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Actual fees may vary based on, among other factors, account size and custodial relationship. No current or prospective client should assume future performance of any specific investment strategy will be profitable or equal to past performance levels. All investment strategies have the potential for profit or loss. Changes in investment strategies, contributions or withdrawals may cause the performance results of your portfolio to differ materially from the reported composite performance. Different types of investments involve varying degrees of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific investment will either be suitable or profitable for a client’s investment portfolio. Historical performance results for market indices and/or categories generally do not reflect the deduction of transaction and/or custodial charges or the deduction of an investment management fee, the incurrence of which would have the effect of decreasing historical performance results. Economic factors, market conditions, and investment strategies will affect the performance of any portfolio and there are no assurances that it will match or outperform any particular benchmark.
*The benchmarks used for the DRS Select Composite are the S&P 500 Index, which consists of approximately 500 large cap stocks, and a 60/40 blended composite, weighted 60% in the aforementioned S&P 500 Index and 40% in the Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index. The 60/40 is rebalanced monthly. The Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index is a broad-based flagship benchmark that measures the investment grade, US dollar-denominated, fixed-rate taxable bond market. The index includes Treasuries, government-related and corporate securities, MBS (agency fixed-rate and hybrid ARM pass-throughs), ABS and CMBS (agency and non-agency). The S&P 500 Index is often used as a proxy for the overall U.S. equity market. Indexes and other benchmarks used herein are generally unmanaged and have no fees or expenses. An investment cannot be made directly in an index or some of these benchmarks. Swan’s investments may consist of securities which vary significantly from those in the benchmark indexes listed above and performance calculation methods may not be entirely comparable. Accordingly, comparing results shown to those of such indexes and benchmarks may be of limited use.
There are three DRS composites offered: 1) The DRS Composite which includes all accounts. 2) The DRS IRA Composite which includes all IRA assets under management. 3) The DRS Select Composite which includes all non-qualified accounts. Additional information regarding Swan’s policies and procedures for calculating and reporting performance returns is available upon request. Swan claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®) and has prepared and presented this report in compliance with GIPS. Swan’s compliance with GIPS has been independently verified for the periods July 1, 1997 through December 31, 2016. The Spaulding Group conducted Swan’s verification. A copy of the verification report is available upon request. To receive copies of the report please call 970–382-8901 or email operations@swanglobalinvestments.com. Verification assesses whether (1) the firm has complied with all the composite construction requirements of GIPS on a firm wide basis and (2) the firm’s policies and procedures are designed to calculate and present performance in compliance with GIPS. Verification does not ensure the accuracy of any specific composite presentation.

DEFINED RISK STRATEGY
 

















			Defined Risk Strategy		


David Lovell 


			2017-07-12T11:58:11+00:00		

 The Defined Risk Strategy
Helping investors grow and protect wealth since 1997.
We devel­oped the Defined Risk Strat­e­gy (DRS) in 1997 as a way to offer our clients a dis­tinc­tive, inno­v­a­tive tool for min­i­miz­ing mar­ket risk.
The DRS is a time-test­ed invest­ment approach that has been applied to var­i­ous asset class­es and avail­able in a range of invest­ments vehi­cles.
 ACHIEVE DESIRED OUTCOMES WITH A TIME-TESTED APPROACH
The DRS is designed to provide sta­ble returns over a full mar­ket cycle, while hedg­ing again­st large stock mar­ket decli­nes. We pur­sue this goal through a rules-based, active­ly man­aged hedged equi­ty invest­ment process.
 THE DEFINED RISK STRATEGY INVESTMENT PROCESS:

Always invest­ed to par­tic­i­pate in mar­ket appre­ci­a­tion over time
Hold­ing index-based ETFs
Always hedg­ing invest­ments with puts
Gen­er­ate mar­ket-neu­tral income through the use of options
Fol­low­ing a rules-based process to elim­i­nate the impact of emo­tions on invest­ment deci­sions.

Review the DRS Process MAXIMIZE WEALTH BY MINIMIZING LOSSES
The mar­ket is unpre­dictable, mak­ing it dif­fi­cult to time the mar­kets or con­sis­tent­ly pick out­per­form­ing stocks. That’s why we believe that the key to wealth cre­ation is to remain invest­ed while reduc­ing down­side risk.
By defin­ing the risk with a hedg­ing strat­e­gy, we seek to rede­fine the risk/return pro­file of the port­fo­lio.
See the DRS Tar­get­ed Returns A SOLUTION TO THE CHALLENGES INVESTORS FACE TODAY AND BEYOND
The Defined Risk Strat­e­gy solves many of the most press­ing chal­lenges that investors and advi­sors strug­gle to solve:


Seek­ing invest­ment return in a low yield world
Min­i­miz­ing volatil­i­ty
Tim­ing and sequence of returns chal­lenge
Retire­ment income chal­lenge
Bear mar­ket pro­tec­tion
Tax effi­cien­cy


 A TRACK RECORD OF SUCCESS
Our con­sis­tent approach offers investors a bet­ter way to grow and pro­tect wealth.
The Defined Risk Strat­e­gy is designed to out­per­form the under­ly­ing bench­mark over a full mar­ket cycle (bull and a bear mar­ket). Since incep­tion in 1997, the DRS has done just that.
The S&P 500 has had four down years since 2000, for a total cumu­la­tive com­bined loss of more than 80%. Dur­ing those years the Swan DRS pro­vid­ed a cumu­la­tive com­bined return of +18%*. This per­for­mance dur­ing down­turns is one rea­son the Swan DRS has con­sis­tent­ly out­per­formed the S&P 500 over full mar­ket cycles.
See More DRS Per­for­manceSwan Defined Risk Investing
The strategy’s suc­cess prompt­ed us to apply it across mul­ti­ple prod­ucts and assets, pro­vid­ing our clients with addi­tion­al oppor­tu­ni­ties to use this time-test­ed approach.

			Avoiding the Bear		


David Lovell 


			2016-11-03T09:40:00+00:00		

Avoiding the Bear
 Don’t Let the Bear get You Down
Check out this brief video for an intro­duc­tion to the Defined Risk Strat­e­gy and how it can help investors grow and pro­tect their nest egg for retire­ment.
Win by Not Losing
Remem­ber the bear mar­ket dur­ing the Finan­cial Crises of 2008? Or the Dot-Com Bust in 2000? Or the Crash of 1987?
Bear mar­kets (large loss­es in the mar­ket in excess of 20%) occur more often, cause more dam­age, and require longer recov­er time than investors may real­ize.
DID YOU KNOW?  — Since 1929, the S&P 500 data shows that bear mar­kets:

occur every 3.5 years,
last 10 months,
erase over 35% of mar­ket val­ue, and
take 3.3 years to recov­er.

At Swan, we believe that large port­fo­lio loss­es and mul­ti-year recov­er­ies are not the con­se­quences investors must accept in order to achieve long-term port­fo­lio growth. 
Swan’s Defined Risk Strat­e­gy is a unique invest­ment approach designed to help investors grow and pro­tect wealth.
Actively Seeking to NOT Lose Big
“By active­ly seek­ing to not lose big, we believe that investors will be bet­ter off in the long run.”
– Randy Swan, CEO and Port­fo­lio Man­ager of Swan Glob­al Invest­ments
The first rule of mak­ing mon­ey is to not lose it. Although this phrase in var­i­ous forms is attrib­ut­ed to many dif­fer­ent peo­ple, the con­cept remains true. While the risk of loss is assumed when invest­ing, avoid­ing bear mar­kets can be the dif­fer­ence between achiev­ing or miss­ing finan­cial goals.
Such major decli­nes often require mul­ti-year recov­er­ies. Invest­ments that provide some lev­el of bear mar­ket pro­tec­tion can dras­ti­cal­ly impact invest­ment returns over the long term.
Always Invested. Always Hedged.
Launched in 1997, the Swan Defined Risk Strat­e­gy is designed to seek con­sis­ten­cy of returns, down­side pro­tec­tion, and sus­tain­abil­i­ty of assets.
By lim­it­ing the dam­age caused by bear mar­kets, the Defined Risk Strat­e­gy has an envi­able track record of reduc­ing the port­fo­lio recov­ery time from years to months, there­by mak­ing it eas­ier to stay invest­ed and more like­ly on track towards achiev­ing invest­ment goals.

David Lovell 


			2017-06-15T13:29:00+00:00		

Defined Risk Investment Process
 Simple and Effective.
Repeatable Four Step Investment Process
Our unique hedged-equi­ty approach is dri­ven by a four-step, rules-based and repeat­able invest­ment process, which removes emo­tions from the invest­ment process.
The Defined Risk Strat­e­gy invest­ment process is unique­ly ‘Always Invest­ed, Always Hedged’.
Step 1: Establish Equities
Always Invest­ed — We begin by build­ing a core equi­ty posi­tion and we remain ful­ly invest­ed at all times.

Con­sumer Dis­cre­tionary (XLY)
Con­sumer Sta­ples (XLP)
Ener­gy (XLE)
Finan­cials (XLF)

Real Estate (XLRE)


Health Care (XLV)
Indus­tri­als (XLI)
Mate­ri­als (XLB)
Tech­nol­o­gy (XLK)
Util­i­ties (XLU)

 For exam­ple, our U.S. equi­ties pro­duct is always invest­ed in the S&P 500 via equal-weight­ed sec­tor ETFs
Sec­tor ETFs are very cost-effi­cient – 0.14% gross expense ratio
Step 2: Create the Hedge
Always Hedged — We then min­i­mize down­side risk and seek to pro­tect clients’ cap­i­tal by pur­chas­ing at- or near-the-mon­ey put options. We use only longer-term puts, which offer the great­est cost-effi­cien­cy and sta­bil­i­ty, and then main­tain that pro­tec­tion by rolling the hedge annu­al­ly.  As such, the DRS is not under duress to seek pro­tec­tion in mar­ket down­turns.
Step 3: Seek to Generate Market-Neutral Cash Flow
We use our options-trad­ing exper­tise to provide our clients with the poten­tial for return, regard­less of mar­ket con­di­tions. Fol­low­ing a rules-based trad­ing approach, we sell short-term pre­mi­um to take advan­tage of time decay and to off­set risks cre­at­ed by our long equi­ty posi­tions.
Mar­ket Neu­tral Strate­gies – Rules-Based Trades


Poten­tial to earn option pre­mi­um income in a vari­ety of mar­ket con­di­tions
Sell short-term pre­mi­um to take advan­tage of time decay
Pre­de­ter­mined adjust­ment and exit trig­gers
Off­sets risk in long posi­tions


Step 4: Monitor and Adjust
Pro­pri­etary soft­ware enables us to:


Obtain best-exe­cu­tion on all trades
Block trade all accounts for equal, effi­cient and simul­ta­ne­ous trad­ing
Allo­cate trades even­ly to all sep­a­rate­ly man­aged accounts
Over­see, re-hedge and rebal­ance each sep­a­rate­ly man­aged account
Mon­i­tor on a dai­ly basis: 
Put option expo­sure, to main­tain hedge rel­a­tive to equi­ty
Cash flows from new invest­ment and equi­ty div­i­dends, to remain ful­ly invest­ed
Option posi­tions for opti­miz­ing adjust­ments




For each account, we


Rebal­ance equi­ties as rules dic­tate
Re-hedge put options annu­al­ly, or intra-year, dur­ing large mar­ket decli­nes as rules dic­tate

Rolling the Hedge

Our unique, repeat­able Defined Risk invest­ment process how helped investors grow and pro­tect wealth since 1997.

Privacy Policy
Like most indus­tries today, the finan­cial ser­vices indus­try is rapid­ly being shaped by tech­nol­o­gy, which is lit­er­al­ly chang­ing the way we do busi­ness. To be suc­cess­ful in this envi­ron­ment, we must con­tin­ue to insure that our cus­tomers are con­fi­dent that we will man­age their finan­cial affairs expert­ly and con­fi­den­tial­ly.
At Swan Glob­al Invest­ments, LLC, we are required to acquire and retain cer­tain per­son­al and pri­vate client infor­ma­tion to provide the ser­vices we offer. It is essen­tial that we use dis­cre­tion and tech­nol­o­gy to man­age and main­tain cer­tain cus­tomer infor­ma­tion. We want to assure all of our cus­tomers that when­ev­er infor­ma­tion is used, it is done with dis­cre­tion. The safe­guard­ing of cus­tomer infor­ma­tion is an issue we take seri­ous­ly at Swan Glob­al Invest­ments, LLC. To affirm our con­tin­u­ing com­mit­ment to the prop­er use of cus­tomer infor­ma­tion, we have set forth the fol­low­ing Pri­va­cy Prin­ci­ples. It is the­se Pri­va­cy Prin­ci­ples that guide us in serv­ing the pri­va­cy needs of our cus­tomers.
Recog­ni­tion of a Customer’s Expec­ta­tion of Pri­va­cy: Swan Glob­al Invest­ments, LLC, we believe the con­fi­den­tial­i­ty and pro­tec­tion of cus­tomer infor­ma­tion is one of our fun­da­men­tal respon­si­bil­i­ties. And while infor­ma­tion is crit­i­cal to pro­vid­ing qual­i­ty ser­vice, we rec­og­nize that one of our most impor­tant assets is our cus­tomers’ trust. Thus, the safe­keep­ing of cus­tomer infor­ma­tion is a pri­or­i­ty for Swan Glob­al Invest­ments, LLC.
Use, Col­lec­tion, and Reten­tion of Cus­tomer Infor­ma­tion: Swan Glob­al Invest­ments, LLC lim­its the use, col­lec­tion, and reten­tion of cus­tomer infor­ma­tion to what we believe is nec­es­sary or use­ful to con­duct our busi­ness, provide qual­i­ty ser­vice, and offer prod­ucts, ser­vices, and oth­er oppor­tu­ni­ties that may be of inter­est to our cus­tomers. Infor­ma­tion col­lect­ed may include, but is not lim­it­ed to name, address, tele­phone num­ber, tax iden­ti­fi­ca­tion num­ber, date of birth, employ­ment sta­tus, annu­al income, and net worth.
Main­te­nance of Accu­rate Infor­ma­tion: Swan Glob­al Invest­ments, LLC rec­og­nizes that it must main­tain accu­rate cus­tomer records.

Employ­ees are edu­cat­ed on the impor­tance of main­tain­ing the con­fi­den­tial­i­ty of cus­tomer infor­ma­tion and on the­se Pri­va­cy Prin­ci­ples.

Pro­tec­tion of Infor­ma­tion via Estab­lished Secu­ri­ty Pro­ce­dures: Swan Glob­al Invest­ments, LLC rec­og­nizes that a fun­da­men­tal ele­ment of main­tain­ing effec­tive cus­tomer pri­va­cy pro­ce­dures is to provide rea­son­able pro­tec­tion again­st the unau­tho­rized access to cus­tomer infor­ma­tion.

Investment Solutions
An Outcome-Oriented Investment Solution
Investors do not care about where an investment product 'fits', they care about their statement balance when that money is needed. They care about achieving their desired outcomes.
Investors need solutions to the challenges they face today and beyond, not another product iteration.
In a world of products, we're offering a solution.
The Swan Defined Risk Strategy was designed for what's best for the investor, not what's easiest to "sell".  Randy Swan, Founder and Portfolio Manager created the strategy to solve investment challenges and address market risk directly, not to 'fit' into a trending category.
The Defined Risk Strategy is uniquely designed to provide what investors need to grow and protect wealth:

Consistent exposure to the market for capital appreciation
Utilizing a unique 'always hedged' approach to mitigate large losses
Remove timing and emotions from the process



An Investment Solution For Multiple Needs
At Swan Global Investments, we’ve applied the success of our Defined Risk Strategy across multiple investment solutions and asset classes. The Swan DRS can play varying roles inside any portfolio, including:


A core equity replacement or supplement
A fixed income replacement
An absolute return or alternative asset


Swan DRS offers investors a combination of upside opportunity with minimized downside risk. Contact us and we’ll be glad to tell you more about our strategy and the ways you can put it into play.
Funds
The Defined Risk Strategy applied to different asset classes.
The DRS is also available in mutual funds, designed to give investors a risk managed approach to asset allocation. The goal: to achieve positive returns while minimizing the downside risk of the equity markets. The Fund’s investment strategy is grounded in a proprietary process that has been developed and refined since 1997. Key elements of the Fund’s strategy include:

No reliance on market timing or stock selection
Aiming to protect client assets during market downturns
Diversifying with allocations designed to complement each other across a range of market conditions.

To learn more: Visit SwanDefinedRiskFunds.com
Separately Managed Accounts
Creating wealth by reducing losses.
We created the Defined Risk Strategy and began applying it to Separately Managed Accounts (SMA) in 1997 with the goal of providing an investment solution offering the possibility for income and downside protection. It has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over full market cycles since inception.
Our SMA includes:

Equally weighted ETFs representing the sectors of the S&P 500
Put options to hedge long equity positions
Income-generating options strategies

The Swan SMA is available for advisors to use with their clients at TD Ameritrade. TDA has invested in its technology to allow options managers such as Swan to offer SMA accounts to retail investors.
Swan’s unique SMA offering reflects our long-term commitment to provide sophisticated options-based strategies to the investing public through advisory relationships. A minimum commitment is required by each advisor to use the SMA structure.
Overlay
Stabilize returns and minimize taxes.
The Swan DRS Overlay applies our hedge and option income components over other managers’ portfolios, such as those with low cost basis or concentrated stock positions. Overlaying these types of portfolios with protection and income features can help clients smooth out returns and protect against extreme drawdowns, without incurring the taxes that would be triggered by liquidating securities. The Overlay program is ideal for executive stock programs that are restricted from liquidation or from full investment in Swan’s SMA program. The overlay has a few differences from our traditional DRS process, including:


Investors may use their own underlying equity portfolios
Customized hedging and income strategies are available


Collective Investment Trust – CIT
Grow and protect wealth in retirement plans.
The Swan Defined Risk Collective Investment Trust series is co-managed in association with Gordon Asset Management, LLC. Gordon is an independent registered investment advisor based in Raleigh-Durham, NC, which has a specialization in fiduciary services for corporate retirement plans. Alta Trust is a South Dakota chartered Trust company that acts as the Trustee of this Collective Investment Fund. There are five Swan Defined Risk CIT funds.

Defined Risk Income
Defined Risk Conservative
Defined Risk Moderate
Defined Risk Moderate Growth
Defined Risk Aggressive Growth

The CITs are currently available on numerous retirement platforms as well as made available through individual company employee benefit/retirement plans.
For general inquiries, please contact Alta Trust at: 866-516-4015;or visit their web page at www.trustalta.com/swan.
For CIT investment and participation related questions, please contact Gordon Asset Management at:(866) 216-1920, or visit their web page at www.wealthQB.com.
Swan Re
Reinsurance that offers leveraged returns.
Swan Re combines our DRS with a low-risk, low-cost reinsurance company structure. Swan’s expertise in the insurance industry and market leading risk/return characteristics of the DRS make a perfect fit for leveraged returns through a reinsurance product.
The launch of this product follows a proven format demonstrated by Greenlight Re, Third Point Re and Berkshire Hathaway, all of which direct reinsurance returns to investments rather than underwriting income. For the investor, Swan Re offers the possibility of earning a multiple of DRS’ historic returns through investment of premium float (premiums yet to be paid out as claims).
Swan Re will insure low-risk (low severity, high frequency) types of business that are contractually capped and often are very predictable in their payout patterns. Underwriter expenses should be much lower than for a traditional reinsurer.

Investing to help minimize downside risk
The market is unpredictable, making it difficult to time the markets or consistently pick outperforming stocks.
That’s why we believe reducing downside risk can significantly impact wealth creation.
With this in mind, we developed our Defined Risk Strategy in 1997 as a way to offer our clients a distinctive, innovative tool that seeks consistent returns while protecting portfolios from large market declines.

Important Disclosures- Please read:

ETFs are subject to investment advisory and other expenses, which will be indirectly paid by the Fund. As a result, the cost of investing in the Fund will be higher than the cost of investing directly in ETFs and may be higher than other mutual funds that invest directly in stocks. ETFs are subject to specific risks, depending on the nature of the Fund.
Investors cannot directly invest in an index and unmanaged index returns do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges. Swan may invest in index ETFs as an underlying asset within each mutual fund, such as:
SPY: The SPDR® S&P 500® ETF Trust seeks to provide investment results that, before expenses, correspond generally to the price and yield performance of the S&P 500® Index.
EEM: The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of large- and mid-capitalization emerging market equities.
IWM: The iShares Russell 2000 ETF seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of small-capitalization U.S. equities.
EAFE: The iShares MSCI EAFE ETF seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of large- and mid-capitalization developed market equities, excluding the U.S. and Canada.
The use of leverage, such as that embedded in options, could magnify the Fund’s gains or losses. Written option positions expose the Fund to potential losses many times the option premium received.
The adviser’s dependence on its Defined Risk Strategy process and judgments about the attractiveness, value and potential appreciation of particular ETFs and options in which the Fund invests or sells may prove to be incorrect and may not produce the desired results.
Purchased put options may expire worthless and may have imperfect correlation to the value of the Fund’s sector ETFs. Written call and put options may limit the Fund’s participation in equity market gains and may amplify losses in market declines. The Fund’s losses are potentially large in a written put or call transaction. If un-hedged, written calls expose the Fund to potentially unlimited losses.
Investments in underlying funds that own small and mid-capitalization companies may be more vulnerable than larger, more established organizations. Investments in foreign securities could subject the Fund to greater risks including, currency fluctuation, economic conditions, and different governmental and accounting standards. In addition to the risks generally associated with investing in securities of foreign companies, countries with emerging markets also may have relatively unstable governments, social and legal systems that do not protect shareholders, economies based on only a few industries, and securities markets that trade a small number of issues.
Investors should carefully consider the investment objective, risks, charges and expenses of the Swan Defined Risk Funds. Mutual funds involve risk, including possible loss of principal. There is no guarantee the Fund will meet its objective. This and other information is contained in the prospectus and should be read carefully before investing. For a prospectus please call Swan Defined Risk Funds at (877) 896-2590. The Funds are distributed by Northern Lights Distributors, LLC, member FINRA / SIPC. Northern Lights Distributors, LLC is not affiliated with Swan Capital Management, LLC, Swan Global Management, LLC, or Swan Global Investments, LLC. Swan Capital Management, LLC, Swan Global Management, LLC, and Swan Global Investments, LLC are affiliated entities. 6002-NLD-1/6/2016

Swan Extends the Defined Risk Strategy to Emerging Markets

Swan Global Investments Launches the Swan Defined Risk Emerging Markets Fund, Offering an Actively Managed Hedged Equity product for the Emerging Markets Asset Class




Jan 13, 2015, 9:12am EST














DURANGO, Colo., Jan.  13, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --

The Swan Defined Risk Emerging Markets Fund (Tickers: SDFAX, SDFCX, SDFIX) seeks to offer a defined risk hedged equity solution for the emerging markets asset class. 
The Fund objective is to seek income and growth. The Fund seeks to reach this object by minimizing risk, improving long-term returns and lowering volatility by applying Swan's proprietary Defined Risk Strategy (DRS) to a basket of international stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). 
Swan's DRS has a successful track record in its U.S. equities product since 1997, and the Fund's managers believe that this innovative method of combining hedging and option income can be applied to other asset classes such as emerging markets.
Swan Global Investments, LLC. (Previously, Swan Wealth Advisors, Inc.), announced the launch of the Swan Defined Risk Emerging Markets Fund (Tickers: SDFAX, SDFCX, SDFIX). The Fund seeks to implement the Swan Defined Risk Strategy (DRS) with a basket of international stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and will be available on numerous platforms. 
Logo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150112/168687LOGO 
Information regarding the Swan Defined Risk Emerging Markets Fund may be obtained by contacting the company directly at 970-382-8901 or www.swanglobalinvestments.com. 
"We believe that it is imperative for investors to find alternative forms of asset growth and diversification that have upside potential, especially in today's low interest rate and perceived risk environment," said Randy Swan, President and Portfolio Manager. "The expansion of our Defined Risk Strategy to emerging markets may provide investors with an investment product that is non-correlated to traditional asset classes, helping to guard against systematic risk to long-term returns with a carefully constructed hedging and income strategy."
Swan's investment philosophy is that market timing and stock selection are imperfect investment tools, making it extremely difficult to out-perform a respective benchmark over time. Furthermore, Swan believes that market risk, regardless of the underlying asset class, cannot be minimized or reduced solely by diversification across asset classes. This claimed risk reduction by asset allocation is strictly theoretical and typically based upon relationships that existed over a particular period. There is no guarantee that these same relationships will continue in the future. Options, and specifically hedging with options, can help to address market risk directly. 
It is through this approach that Swan has been able to lower the market risk associated with the S&P 500 in its U.S. equities product since July of 1997 by quantifying risk through its proprietary DRS, rather than by using approaches built on hypothetical speculation. The company's new Defined Risk Emerging Markets Fund fully implements the principles of the DRS, with actively managed equity exposure through emerging market index ETFs that are fully hedged at all times, with no aspiration to market prediction, and an options income strategy built on defined risk. 
"Our research confirms the effectiveness of the DRS engine with other asset classes and most extensively with international equities, both foreign developed and emerging markets," said Mr. Swan. "We are excited that the Defined Risk Emerging Markets Fund will bring Swan's proprietary and compelling investment method to an asset class that we believe is brimming with growth potential."
About Swan Global Investments
Swan Global Investments is a SEC registered investment advisor providing asset management services utilizing the Swan Defined Risk Strategy. Please note that registration of the Advisor does not imply a certain level of skill or training.  
Investors should carefully consider the investment objective, risks, charges and expenses of the Swan Defined Risk Emerging Markets Fund. This and other information is contained in the prospectus and should be read carefully before investing. For a prospectus please call Swan Defined Risk Fund at (877) 896-2590. The Fund is distributed by Northern Lights Distributors, LLC, member FINRA/SIPC. Northern Lights Distributors, LLC is not affiliated with Swan Capital Management, LLC and Swan Global Investments, LLC. Mutual funds involve risk, including possible loss of principle. ETFs are subject to investment advisory and other expenses, which will be indirectly paid by the Fund. As a result, the cost of investing in the Fund will be higher than the cost of investing directly in ETFs and may be higher than other mutual funds that invest directly in stocks. ETFs are subject to specific risks, depending on the nature of the fund. The use of leverage, such as that embedded in options, could magnify the Fund's gains or losses. Written option positions expose the Fund to potential losses many times the option premium received. The Fund is a new mutual fund and has a limited history of operation. The adviser's dependence on its DRS process and judgments about the attractiveness, value and potential appreciation of particular ETFs and options in which the Fund invests or writes may prove to be incorrect and may not produce the desired results. Purchased put options may expire worthless and may have imperfect correlation to the value of the Fund's sector ETFs. Written call and put options may limit the Fund's participation in equity market gains and may amplify losses in market declines. The Fund's losses are potentially large in a written put or call transaction. If un-hedged, written calls expose the Fund to potentially unlimited losses. There is no guarantee the fund will meet its objectives.                                                 6020-NLD-1/12/2015
