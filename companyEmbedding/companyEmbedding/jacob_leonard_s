 OKLAHOMA CITY, OK                                            





                        Jacob lost his life in an accident. He is survived by 3 children. Jacob's wife  previously lost her life last January. Jacob was an exceptional person who was a good father, son, family man, co-worker, and a great friend to all. Jacob always had a smile on his face and cared more about others than himself. I am very proud and lucky to have known him.  Please use this account to donate to the surviving family members to help them through this difficult time.

 OKLAHOMA CITY, OK                                            





                        Jacob lost his life in an accident. He is survived by 3 children. Jacob's wife  previously lost her life last January. Jacob was an exceptional person who was a good father, son, family man, co-worker, and a great friend to all. Jacob always had a smile on his face and cared more about others than himself. I am very proud and lucky to have known him.  Please use this account to donate to the surviving family members to help them through this difficult time.

As Breakside Brewery prepares to open its production new facility in Milwaukie, Head Brewer Ben Edmunds announced a big new hire to assist with the transition: “I’m very excited to let you all know that Jacob Leonard will be joining  the brewing staff at Breakside as the Production Manager and  Co-Brewmaster of our new facility.”

Jacob Leonard made a name for himself at Walking Man Brewing, helping to put that brewery on the map back in the day before making his way to Widmer Brothers, where he has been for over a year now. Known for creating some of the best hoppy, big beers and constantly trying something new, he is known to still homebrew on his off time every weekend. Jacob is an exciting new addition to the Breakside Brewery team. Joining the team in September, there will be a welcoming party at Breakside for Jacob Leonard as he debuts his first beers for the company.

Back Stories:
12/13/2010: Interview with Jacob Leonard when he left Walking Man for Widmer.

5 Stars Out Of 5






July 21, 2010



Debbie from ChristFocus Book Club






  
            "Leonard's Biblical Chronological Chart" is a useful Bible reference chart that covers a lot of information. It's easy unfold and then correctly fold back together. It's also a nice size that's easy to handle. Some of the text was a little small, though, so you have to be standing right next to it to read it all. Overall, I thought it a useful quick-reference chart for either personal use or for use in classrooms at church.The information it contained: Jewish weights, measures, and divisions of time; it gave the Biblical term and the modern equivalent (like a Sabbath Day's journey equals 3/4ths of an English mile). The origins and main beliefs of the Sadducees, Pharisees, Scribes/Lawyers, Essenes, and Samaritans. A time-line border ring with the date, the event, the Scripture reference to the event. About the books of the Bible--who they're written by, how much history they cover, and/or when they were written. In the center, there was: A family tree of the Kings of Judah and when they reigned. A map showing the voyages of St. Paul with Scripture references. A map of Canaan at about 200 B.C. with the location of the 12 tribes of Israel marked on it. A family tree of Jacob's family showing his descendants at the time they arrived in Egypt. A family tree of the Kings of Israel and when they reigned. A chart showing the periods of Scriptural history (Creation to Deluge, Deluge to the calling of Abraham, etc.) and the number of years they covered. A list of Scripture references for the miracles of Jesus. A map of the Exodus: the Israelite's journey from Egypt to Canaan, with Scripture references.

            Quality all the way from the binding, the selected paper and the content.  If you appreciate the sanctity of the efforts of the original author/publisher in their attempts to stay true to their time period and resources, then this is a publication you will treasure as a keepsake.

Kimberly Ippolito and Jacob Leonard's Wedding Website







MenuAccommodationsSkyScannerSkyScanner is a website I refer everyone to for any travel searching. This website is similar to other websites like Expedia and Kayak, but I have personally found it to be much more thorough. Whether you are staying in Houston or Galveston, this website will help you find accommodations in your price range. (It will also help you search for car rentals and flights if you are interested.)Visit WebsiteTravel and TransportationAirportsIf you plan on flying to Houston or Galveston, you will notice that there are several major airport options. You may consider different airports depending on where you are staying or how you plan to travel once you're on the ground.1. George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) is located on the north side of Houston, and is our main airport. If you plan on staying in Houston and simply driving to Galveston for the day of our wedding, you may want to consider making IAH your airport of choice. Many airlines provide non-stop flights from Denver (DEN) to George Bush Intercontinental.2. If you plan on staying in Galveston, but don't want to pay extra to fly there directly, Hobby Airport (HOU) is another airport you should consider. Located slightly to the south of downtown Houston, the drive from Hobby Airport to Galveston is significantly shorter than from IAH (if you are not renting a car, this may save you quite a chunk of money in taxi fares).3. If you are staying in Galveston and don't mind paying a bit extra to fly there directly, you might consider Galveston's Schole's International Airport (GLS). However, if you're on a budget, you may want to compare prices of plane tickets and taxi fares between Houston and Galveston.Driving in HoustonDriving a personal vehicle is the most efficient way, and perhaps one of the only ways, to get around Houston. The city of Houston is not really built for pedestrians or cyclists(unless you are in the heart of downtown). The METRO bus system is very rudimentary, and the downtown light-rail system only spans a few blocks. Therefore, if you plan to be doing anything during your visit, you should either call a reputable taxi service or rent a car.However, be advised: Houston drivers are arguably some of the most aggressive drivers in the United States, and their driving patterns are a bit different than other places. I would highly recommend you read this article listing a few basic tips on how traffic flows in Houston and how to get through your trip with yourself, your family, and your rental car in one piece.TaxisAs a general rule, taxi services in Houston are very expensive. I highly encourage you to compare prices of a lot of different taxi services if you are on a tight budget, or even compare their prices with car rentals. Of course, there are many more taxi services than the ones listed here, but these are some of the more popular taxi services around town.Houston VIP Taxi: (281) 616-5838, websiteOn-Cabs Houston: (832) 648-4111, websiteYellow Cab Houston: (713) 236-1111, websiteTaxi Club of Greater Houston: (866) 829-4258, websiteAll City TransportationClick on the link below for the City of Houston's full list of transportation options (this includes personal and public transportation).Visit WebsiteThings to DoHouston CityPASSHouston CityPASS is a bulk ticket pass to multiple attractions in Houston and the greater Houston area. If you are planning to make a small vacation out of your trip, this would be a good idea! This will save you money (vs buying all individual tickets) if you are already planning to go to all of the places included in the CityPASS.Note that a few of these sites are closer to, or even in, Galveston.Attractions included in Houston's CityPASS are:Space Center HoustonDowntown AquariumHouston Museum of Natural ScienceHouston Zoo OR Houston Museum of Fine ArtsThe Children's Museum of Houston OR Kemah Boardwalk(Click on each attraction name to go to its individual website)Visit WebsiteMuseum District, Houston, TX, United States713-715-1939The Houston Museum District is home to more than 19 museums and attractions, including the following (click on the name of the museum to go to its own website):The Children's Museum - FREE on Thursdays 5-8pmThe Houston Museum of Natural Science - Permanent Exhibit Halls FREE on Thursdays 3-6pmThe Houston Zoo The Houston Museum of Fine Arts - FREE on Thursdays 10am–9pmThe Health Museum - FREE on Thursdays 2-7pmTo see more free admission times, click this link.To see more museums and attractions, go to the Houston Museum District website.Visit WebsiteEmailWater ParksIf you can't stand the Gulf Coast heat, water parks are a great place to spend a day. Click on the name of a water park below to go to its website.Wet 'n' Wild Splash Town - North Houston, SpringTyphoon Texas - West Houston, KatyPirate's Bay Waterpark - East Houston, BaytownSchlitterbahn Galvetson Island Waterpark - GalvestonTopgolfIf you like to golf, but still hate the Gulf Coast heat, or want to try a new spin on indoor golfing, try Topgolf. It is a semi-indoor, multi-story building, where each group gets to play their own competitive game of golf on a 200+ yard net-enclosed field. You do not have to know how to golf to play at Topgolf.Topgolf has locations in Spring (North Houston), central Houston, and Webster/League City (South Houston).Old Town Spring403 Main St, Spring, TX 77373, United States281-353-9310Old Town Spring is the historic section of the Spring area, where merchants and restaurants have been established (many in the original buildings). You can find anything from traditional German and Chinese shops to arts-and-crafts to Texas BBQ to modern bistros. You can find almost anything there, including museums and tours.To see more about the history of Old Town Spring, click this link.To see a list of vendors and restaurants in Old Town Spring, click this link.Visit WebsiteEmailMeyer ParkWhether you're looking for a playground, a place to run or take a nice walk, or feed the ducks (and nutria!), you can find it all at Meyer Park. If you've brought dogs with you, they are also welcome. The park covers 180 acres, and includes a duck pond, fishing pond, walking trails, playgrounds, soccer fields, softball fields, basketball courts, barbeque and picnic areas, and restrooms.For parks closer to downtown Houston, click this link (I highly recommend Discovery Green).For other Houston dog-friendly restaurants and attractions, click this link.For parks in Galveston, click this link. Keep in mind Galveston also has many beach parks.The Woodlands MallThe Woodlands Mall is arguably the best mall in North Houston for all your shopping needs. They are also surrounded by a beautiful urban center, walking area, and other restaurants and shops.Another mall closer to Spring is the Willowbrook Mall. There are also a few Tanger Outlet Mall locations in the Houston/Galveston area. And if you want the full up-scale mall experience, try the Galleria in Southwest Houston.George R. Brown Convention Center1001 Avenida De Las Americas, Houston, TX 77010, United StatesThe George R. Brown Convention Center offers conventions and events year round, so check out their events calendar and see if there is anything that interests you! They are located across the street from Discovery Green park and is within view of Minute Maid Park (the Houston Astros stadium).Visit WebsiteGalveston, TX, United StatesGalveston may not be the prettiest of beaches, but only being a short drive away from Houston, it's still a great place to spend the day! If you are not staying in Galveston, consider staying for the afternoon after our wedding. Stewart Beach is usually the most popular site, but there is a lot more to do in Galveston! Do some fishing, take the ferry, or go on a dolphin tour! Galveston has lots of historical sites, museums, and beautiful architecture to explore, and also has lots of fun family attractions, like Moody Gardens and the Kemah Boardwalk. Check out their website for a complete list of things Galveston has to offer!Visit WebsiteEthnic and Cultural Markets, Sites, and RestaurantsSince Houston is the most ethnically-diverse city in the United States, it only makes sense that there are many different ethnic and cultural markets, sites, and restaurants throughout the city. You can find things from every continent in all corners of Houston. Here is a simple map and list of some international/ethnic markets and a list of Houston's best restaurants* to start with, but there are so many more not listed here. Keep an eye out when you're out and about, and feel free to explore!*This restaurant list is kind of limited, and many of the places mentioned may be very expensive, so it may be helpful to do a more local search depending on what area of town you will be staying in.WeatherTypical June Weather on the Texas Gulf Coast... is pretty hot, but not as hot as it could be! June temperatures usually reach into the 90s, and average humidity is around 75%. Please also take into account that Houston & Galveston are at sea-level, so those of you travelling from higher altitudes may temporarily feel like your lungs have been replaced with a sack of bricks (but on the bright side, you can do a lot more physical activity without getting winded!). June also marks the beginning of hurricane season, so we will be watching that situation very closely and will update you if anything happens; although, hurricanes in June are pretty rare.You shouldn't have to pack that heavy. The only thing you would ever need a jacket or long pants for is the plane ride or for indoor activities where AC is not treated as the pricey commodity it is. Do pack any anti-humidity products you need. We also recommend bringing a reusable water bottle.Please, please stay hydrated, and if you feel any symptoms of heat stroke, do not hesitate to take a break, go inside, or drink more water. For more information on heat stroke, its symptoms, and how to treat it, click this link.-To see up-to-date weather and a 7 day forecast for Houston, click this linkTo see up-todate weather and a multiple day forecast for Galveston, click this link.For live Galveston beach cams, click this link.Thanks, we've received your .Schedule Your Reminder.Sign up below and we'll remind you a month before the wedding to check back for all the details you need to know.Please enter a valid email address.Remind MeWebsite created on The Knot.

One of my old aquariums




Painting neon tetras in the studio




Another one of my old aquariums









From the Water to the Wall


At one time in my life I was an avid aquarist, so it is not surprising that such a long held passion springs forth the tropical fish paintings seen in THE AQUARIUM SHOP. From the above photos you see a couple of aquariums that I created some years ago. I would love to keep aquariums today, but with their need for regular maintenance and my lack of time it's just not feasible. So now, using a combination of watercolor, acrylic, colored pencil, and a final enhancement in Photoshop I am painting small portraits of the tropical fish I so adore and hanging them on the walls of my home. Here in THE AQUARIUM SHOP I offer prints of these paintings... ENJOY!

                My focus is on small freshwater tropical fish, but from time to time I'll paint trees and landscapes—inspirations from my hiking and kayaking adventures.
