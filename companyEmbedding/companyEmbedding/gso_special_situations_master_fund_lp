History[edit]
GSO was founded in 2005 by Bennett Goodman, Tripp Smith and Doug Ostrover. The GSO team had previously managed the leveraged finance businesses at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette and later Credit Suisse First Boston, after the acquisition of DLJ.[1]
In May 2007, GSO sold a minority stake in its business to Merrill Lynch.[1]
The following year, in March 2008, The Blackstone Group acquired GSO for approximately $1 billion.[2] Blackstone paid GSO $620 million in cash and stock and the GSO team also received an earnout worth up to $310 million through payable over the subsequent five years, based on certain earnings targets. Blackstone had existing relationships with the GSO team as an original investor in GSO's funds. The combination of Blackstone and GSO created one of the largest credit platforms in the alternative asset management business, with over $21 billion of total assets under management.[3] Following the completion of the acquisition, Blackstone merged GSO's operations with its existing debt investment operations.[4][5]
In July 2010, GSO announced the final closing of the Blackstone / GSO Capital Solutions Fund (the Fund) with total commitments of over $3.25 billion.[6]
In March 2011, GSO acquired European collateralized loan obligation manager AIB Capital Markets which included four CLO vehicles worth more than €1.5 billion. GSO had previously acquired $3.1 billion of CLOs from Callidus Capital Management in 2010.[7]
In November 2011, it was reported that GSO had raised over $2 billion for its newest mezzanine debt investment fund, making it one of the largest players in that market.[8]
In March 2012, GSO raised $4 billion for its second mezzanine investment fund focused on middle-market companies.[9]
