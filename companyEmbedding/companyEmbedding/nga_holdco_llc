Notes to
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)

1.
Organization

NGA
HoldCo, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (the
“Company”), was formed on January 8, 2007 at the
direction of Newport Global Opportunities Fund LP
(“Newport”), a Delaware limited partnership, for the
purpose of holding equity, either directly or indirectly through
affiliates, in one or more entities related to the gaming industry.
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements represent
the financial position and results of operations of the Company and
its two wholly owned subsidiaries; NGA Blocker, LLC
(“Blocker”) and NGA Acquisition Co. LLC
(“Acquisition Co”).

On
December 14, 2007, the date of the closing of its acquisition
of a 17.0359% interest in Eldorado Resorts, LLC, a Nevada limited
liability company (“Resorts”), the Company transferred
in part to Resorts and in part to Donald L. Carano
(“Carano”), respectively, free and clear of any liens,
ownership of a total of $38,045,363 original principal amount of
First Mortgage Bonds due 2012, co-issued by Eldorado Casino
Shreveport Joint Venture (the “Louisiana Partnership”)
and Shreveport Capital Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Louisiana Partnership (the “New Shreveport Notes”),
together with 11,000 preferred shares issued by Shreveport Gaming
Holdings, Inc. (“SGH”), then a partner of the Louisiana
Partnership that is not affiliated with Resorts or the Company, in
exchange for a 17.0359% interest in Resorts. In May 2007, Newport
contributed 100% of the New Shreveport Notes held by Newport since
August 2006 and 11% of the preferred shares held since August 2006
(collectively, the “Eldorado Shreveport Investments”)
to the Company. The Eldorado Shreveport Investments were
transferred to the Company at the fair value as of the transfer
date.

Effective
April 1, 2009, Resorts became a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Eldorado HoldCo LLC, a Nevada limited liability company
(“Eldorado”), when all of the members of Resorts,
including Acquisition Co., the subsidiary of the Company through
which the Company held its interest in Resorts, exchanged their
interests in Resorts for identical interests in Eldorado. Eldorado,
which was formed to be a holding company for Resorts, conducts no
operations of its own and, other than its ownership of Resorts, has
no assets or liabilities.

The
Company has had no revenue generating business since inception. Its
current business plan consists primarily of its holding of a
17.0359% equity interest in Eldorado. For information concerning
the possible acquisition of an interest in another gaming company,
see Note 6 below. Eldorado, through Resorts, owns and operates the
Eldorado Hotel and Casino (the “Eldorado-Reno”) located
in Reno, Nevada. Through two wholly owned subsidiaries, Resorts
owns all of the partnership interests of the Louisiana Partnership,
and operates, pursuant to a management agreement, the Eldorado
Shreveport Hotel and Casino in Shreveport, Louisiana (the
“Eldorado-Shreveport”), which is owned by the Louisiana
Partnership. Eldorado Limited Liability Company
(“ELLC”), a Nevada limited liability company 96.1858%
owned by Resorts, is a 50% joint venture partner in a general
partnership that owns and operates the Silver Legacy Resort Casino
(“Silver Legacy”), a hotel and casino property adjacent
to Eldorado-Reno. Resorts also own a 21.25% interest in Tamarack
Junction, a small casino in South Reno.

The
Company’s one issued and outstanding Class A Unit,
representing all of its voting equity, is held by NGA VoteCo, LLC,
a Nevada limited liability company (“VoteCo”). All of
the Company’s issued and outstanding Class B Units,
representing all of its non-voting equity, are held by NGA No
VoteCo, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company
(“InvestCo”). VoteCo is owned by Thomas R. Reeg,
Timothy T. Janszen and Ryan L. Langdon, each of whom owns a 30%
interest, and Roger A. May, who owns a 10% interest. Messrs. Reeg,
Janszen, Langdon and May collectively are referred to as the
“VoteCo Equityholders”. InvestCo is owned by Newport,
formed primarily for the purpose of seeking long-term capital
appreciation and current income by acquiring, holding and disposing
of investments made in distressed debt securities and equities.
Newport holds all of InvestCo’s issued and outstanding voting
securities. At present, the Company has no plans to issue any
additional Class A Units or Class B Units.

The VoteCo
Equityholders, through VoteCo, control all matters of the Company
that are subject to the vote of members, including the appointment
and removal of managers. Messrs. Reeg, Janszen, Langdon and May are
the Company’s managers and Mr. Reeg is also the
Company’s operating manager. The Class B Units issued to
InvestCo allow it and its investors to invest in the Company
without having any voting power or power to control the operations
or affairs of the Company, except as otherwise required by law. If
InvestCo and its investors had any of the power to control the
operations or affairs of the Company afforded to the holders of the
Class A Units, they and their respective constituent
equityholders would generally be required, in connection with the
Company’s investment in Eldorado, to be licensed or found
suitable under the gaming laws and regulations of the States of
Nevada and Louisiana as well as various local regulations in those
states.

VoteCo,
InvestCo, the Company and each of the Company’s wholly owned
subsidiaries are managed by Thomas R. Reeg, the operating manager
of each entity. NGA Blocker, LLC, a Nevada limited liability
company (“Blocker”), is a holding company that has
elected to be taxed as a corporation. Because Blocker is a
separately taxed, non-flow through entity, Blocker is taxed on its
share of the income relating to the Company’s investment in
Eldorado rather than the Company’s investors.

The
Company’s acquisition in December 2007 of a 17.0359% interest
in Resorts was pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Purchase
Agreement, dated July 20, 2007 (the “Purchase
Agreement”). The parties to the Purchase Agreement were
Resorts, AcquisitionCo, which is the subsidiary through which the
Company acquired its interest in Resorts, and Carano, now the
presiding member of Eldorado’s Board of Managers and the
Chief Executive Officer of Eldorado who then held the same
positions with Resorts, from whom a portion of the 17.0359%
interest was acquired. The closing of this transaction occurred on
December 14, 2007 (“Closing”) after necessary
gaming licenses and approvals were obtained from Nevada and
Louisiana, respectively. The Company owns indirectly through its
subsidiaries 17.0359% of Eldorado, and Carano or members of his
family own directly or indirectly approximately 51% of Eldorado.
Carano continues in the roles in the management of Eldorado and
Resorts in which he served Resorts prior to Closing.

The
17.0359% equity interest in Resorts acquired by the Company
included a new 14.47% membership interest acquired directly from
Resorts (the “14.47% Interest”) and a previously
outstanding 3% membership interest (that, as a result of the
issuance of the 14.47% Interest, was reduced to a 2.5659% interest)
acquired from Carano (the “2.5659% Interest”). In
consideration for its equity interest, AcquisitionCo:

transferred
to Resorts, free and clear of any liens, ownership of $31,133,250
original principal amount of the New Shreveport Notes together with
the right to all interest paid with respect thereto after the
closing date, and

transferred
to Carano, free and clear of any liens, $6,912,113 original
principal amount of New Shreveport Notes together with the right to
all interest paid with respect thereto after the closing date and a
preferred stock equity interest representing a capital contribution
amount of $286,889 issued by SGH.




At
closing, Resorts and Carano paid Newport in cash the respective
amounts owed to AcquisitionCo for interest on the respective
amounts of New Shreveport Notes received at closing that was
accrued and unpaid through the date of closing.

Under the
terms of the Purchase Agreement, Resorts was entitled, prior to or
immediately following the Company’s acquisition of its
interest in Resorts, to make a distribution to the members of
Resorts other than AcquisitionCo of up to $10 million. On
July 25, 2007 Resorts made the $10 million distribution, which
was funded through borrowings under Resorts’ credit facility
as permitted by the Purchase Agreement, to its members.

2. Basis
of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies

Basis of
Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

The
Company prepares its financial statements on the accrual basis of
accounting in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).

The
unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Blocker and
AcquisitionCo. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation.

In the
opinion of Management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated
financial statements contain all adjustments, all of which are
normal and recurring, necessary to present fairly the financial
position of the Company as of September 30, 2010 and
December 31, 2009, and the results of its operations for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, and its
cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009.
The results of operations for such periods are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for a full
year.

Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America have been
condensed or omitted. These consolidated financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on April 14,
2010.

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

Cash and
cash equivalents include all highly liquid instruments purchased
with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of
purchase. Cash equivalents are stated at cost plus accrued
interest, which approximates fair value.

Investment
in Eldorado

        The
Company accounts for its 17.0359% investment in Eldorado using the
equity method of accounting. The Company considers on a quarterly
basis whether the fair value of its equity method investment has
declined below its carrying value whenever adverse events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded value may not
be recoverable. If the Company considers any such decline to be
other than temporary, then a write-down would be recorded to
estimated fair value. Evidence of a loss in value that may be other
than temporary might include, but would not necessarily be limited
to, absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the
Company’s investment or the inability of Eldorado to sustain
an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the
investment. In evaluating whether the loss in value is other than
temporary, the Company considers: 1) the length of time and the
extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; 2) the
financial condition and near-term prospects of Eldorado, including
any specific events which may influence the operations of Eldorado;
3) the Company’s intent and ability to retain its investment
in Eldorado for a period of time sufficient to allow for any
anticipated recovery in fair value; 4) the condition and trend of
the economic cycle; 5) Eldorado’s financial performance and
projections; 6) trends in the general market; and 7)
Eldorado’s capital strength and liquidity.

In
determining whether the fair value of the investment in Eldorado is
less than its carrying value, the Company uses a discounted cash
flow model as its principal technique. The Company’s model
incorporates an estimated weighted-average cost of capital that a
market participant would use in evaluating the investment in a
purchase transaction. The estimated weighted-average cost of
capital is based on the risk free interest rate and other factors
such as current risk premiums. The Company uses the discounted cash
flow model as it provides greater detail and opportunity to reflect
specific facts, circumstances and economic conditions for its
investment. Comparable business transactions are often limited in
number, the information can be dated, and often require significant
adjustments due to differences in the size of the business, markets
served and other factors. The Company therefore believes that in
its

circumstance,
this makes comparisons to business transactions less reliable than
the discounted cash flows model. However, the Company does consider
comparable business transactions as a reasonableness test of our
principal technique.

In
performing this impairment test, the Company takes steps to ensure
that appropriate and reasonable cash flow projections and
assumptions are used. The Company also performs sensitivity
analyses on the key assumptions used, including the
weighted-average cost of capital.

Fair Value
of Financial Instruments

The fair
value of cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable and accrued
liabilities approximates their carrying value due to the immediate
or short term maturity of these financial instruments.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In
January 2010, the FASB issued “Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosure (Topic 820)” which clarified the disclosure
requirements of existing U.S. GAAP related to fair value
measurements. This standard requires additional disclosures about
recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements as follows:
(1) for transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value
measurements, as those terms are currently defined in existing
authoritative literature, a reporting entity is required to
disclose the amount of the movement between levels and an
explanation for the movement; (2) for activity at Level 3,
primarily fair value measurements based on unobservable inputs, a
reporting entity is required to present separately information
about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements, as opposed to
presenting such transactions on a net basis; (3) in the event
of a disaggregation, a reporting entity is required to provide fair
value measurement disclosure for each class of assets and
liabilities; and (4) a reporting entity is required to provide
disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to
measure fair value for both recurring and non-recurring fair value
measurements for items that fall in either Level 2 or Level 3.
These disclosure requirements are effective for interim and annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except
for disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements
in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements
for which disclosure becomes effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those
fiscal years. This standard did not impact our financial position,
results of operations and cash flows as of and for the quarter
ended September 30, 2010.

In
addition, certain amendments to Accounting Standards Codification
(“ASC”) Topic 810 “Consolidation” became
effective for us beginning January 1, 2010. Such amendments
include changes to the quantitative approach to determine the
primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity
(“VIE”). An enterprise must determine if its variable
interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a
VIE by evaluating whether 1) the enterprise has the power to
direct activities of the VIE that have a significant effect on
economic performance, and 2) the enterprise has an obligation
to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity
that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The amendments to
ASC 810 also require ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise
is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The adoption of these
amendments did not have a material effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements as of September 30,
2010.

Membership Units and Related Rights

The
Company’s Operating Agreement has created two classes of
membership units, the Class A Units and the Class B Units.
VoteCo holds one Class A Unit of the Company, representing the
Company’s only outstanding voting equity. InvestCo holds
9,999

 

7


 


 


Table of
Contents

NGA
HoldCo, LLC

Notes to
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)—(Continued)

 

Class B
Units of the Company representing all of the Company’s
outstanding non-voting equity. With the exception of voting rights,
the rights of a Class A Unit and a Class B Unit are
identical.

Each of
the Company’s membership units, both Class A and Class
B, represent a percentage interest in the Company equal to the
quotient determined by dividing one by the aggregate number of
units, both Class A and Class B, held by all members as of the
date of the determination. The economic rights, risks and rewards
are all shared by the members ratably according to their respective
percentage interests.

Distributions

Subject to
all applicable gaming approvals, distributions by the Company will
be to its members at such times and in such amounts as approved by
the Operating Manager in good faith in accordance with the
provisions of the Company’s operating agreement and, if and
when made, will be distributed by the Company to its members in
proportion to their respective percentage interests in the Company.
There is no formal agreement between Newport and the Company
regarding the settlement of the due to/from related parties;
however, such amounts are expected to be settled upon sale of the
Company’s investment in Eldorado.

Restrictions
on Transfer

Unless
approved in advance by the Operating Manager and by applicable
gaming authorities, no member of the Company may transfer all or
any portion of its membership units. In addition, transfers or
issuances of any membership units to any person who is required to
be, and has not been, found suitable to be licensed or to hold such
membership units by applicable gaming authorities, are prohibited
and will be null and void and of no force or effect as of the
inception of the attempted transfer or issuance.

Furthermore,
as of the date the Company receives notice from any applicable
gaming authority that a member of the Company or a transferee of
any membership interest in the Company (1) is required to be
licensed but is unsuitable to be licensed or (2) is unsuitable
to hold a membership interest in the Company, then the unsuitable
member or transferee may not, for so long as the unsuitability
determination remains in force and effect,

Company Manager Compensation

No member
or manager of the Company is entitled to receive any compensation
from the Company for any services rendered to or on behalf of the
Company, or otherwise, in his, her or its capacity as a member or
manager of the Company. A manager of the Company is entitled to
reimbursement from the first available funds of the Company for
direct out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the manager on
behalf of the Company that directly related to the business and
affairs of the Company.

Investment in Eldorado

The
Company’s 17.0359% investment in Eldorado (which was acquired
on April 1, 2009 in exchange for a 17.0359% interest
originally acquired in Resorts, as described in Note 1) is
accounted for under the equity method. The investment, which is
reported as Equity income (loss) on Eldorado on the consolidated
statement of operations, was originally recorded at fair value and
is adjusted by the Company’s share of
