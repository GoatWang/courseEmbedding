You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

NEW!  This sight glass or level indicating accessory takes the guess work out of determining how much liquid is in any of your hot side brewing vessels. It is most commonly installed in hot liquor tanks to measure strike and sparge water volumes, but is also very useful in boil kettles to measure pre and post boil volumes.While weldless systems have gotten a bad rep amongst homebrewers, this design is different. When installed per instructions, the unit is 100% guaranteed not to leak the first time and any time you reinstall it (no leak reports in at least 5000 units sold).Our new Flex Sight kit will work for converted kegs or pots.

Includes:One pair of stainless steel machined elbow barbs with matching weldless bushings for installation at the bottom and top of the pot, keg, or tank.One 24" length of high temperature silicone tubingPair of hose clampsChoice of orings or stick on decals for calibration. Note that stick on decals can be applied directly to your keg or kettle, but if you are heating on an open flame, the lower numbers will melt off. This option is best used for electric vessels. For the orings option, you'll get three larger orings to mark 5,10,15 gallons and then eleven smaller rings to mark each gallon in between. IMPORTANT NOTE: The numbers you see in the picture are a little different than the ones we include in this kit. We include the same numbers as the other sight glass kits with the smaller arrows that run under the number.Install intructions:Drill two 1/2" holes in the pot or keg, one at the bottom and one at the top. Avoid putting the hole too close to any curves, welds or other obstructions. Hint: Use a framing square to ensure that the holes are directly plumb or "inline" with each other.

                  Breeze to install, inherently heat resistant, no leaks, love the sharpie + o rings for water level indicators and my clumsy self can't break the tube! This is all benefit, no downside for me personally.
