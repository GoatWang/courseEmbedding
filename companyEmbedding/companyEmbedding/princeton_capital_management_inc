A service offered to retirement plan sponsors








Princeton Capital Management, Inc. is an independent asset management firm specializing in equity portfolios for both private and institutional clients.
We offer four investment strategies that span the spectrum of reward/risk outcomes for marketable equity securities:



Core Equity� a conservative strategy designed to deliver both outperformance and downside protection through an investment approach that favors the stocks of mid-to-large capitalization companies






Growth Equity � an unconstrained strategy seeking investment opportunities across the entire stock market 






Sector Select � an unconstrained strategy, limited to 10-20 stocks, seeking investment opportunities in different economic environments across the entire stock market 






Young Enterprise Shares� (YES) � an aggressive strategy seeking maximum returns through investments in primarily small- and micro-capitalization companies that are positioned to capitalize on tomorrow�s trends. 


 Each strategy has a distinct reward/risk goal, yet all four share a common investment approach centered around a unique analytical framework focused on assessments of trends, business models and valuation.
 We manage portfolios for both private and institutional clients, who engage us directly or through their wealth advisor’s external manager program. In either case, transparency and the free flow of communication are the hallmarks of every relationship. 
 Through PrinCap Retirement Services, we work with retirement plan sponsors to improve asset management, increase employee participation and contributions and facilitate goal-based financial planning.  For more information, please click the PrinCap link at left.  
We welcome your interest in Princeton Capital Management and encourage you to learn more about us.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

25

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

Our History  – details...





 
Princeton Capital Management was formed in 1988 to offer to a select client base of high net worth individuals and institutions the successful analytical and investing methods practiced by its founders during their long and well-regarded careers at a number of prestigious institutions.
Drawing upon their expertise in the fundamental analysis of a broad range of securities - from the largest of companies around the world to the youngest and smallest U.S. based companies – the founding partners developed a method of portfolio management that looked beyond the restrictive parameters of investment strategy style labels or benchmark considerations. They believed their clients would derive greater benefits from an approach that combined an expansive analytical consideration of companies large, small, young and mature, with disciplined portfolio construction focused on optimizing the balance between risk and return.
Over the past twenty-eight years, Princeton Capital Management has demonstrated the soundness of this approach by delivering competitive long-term returns across each of our investment strategies.


 











Our Organization  – details...





 
Managing investment portfolios is Princeton Capital Management’s only business. Our resources are focused on fundamental security analysis, portfolio construction, investment operations and client service – nothing else.
Moreover, most members of the investment team serve as both analysts and portfolio managers, eliminating the layers, and thus the distractions, common to firms with separate research and portfolio management staffs.
We pride ourselves on being an organization of equals. This is beneficial to clients as it allows each member of the team the confidence to present an opinion on investment ideas versus deferring to either a group or an individual perceived to have greater authority than others. It is our experience that hierarchical organizations and the committees associated with such structures rarely facilitate successful stock investing. A group in which respected peers, unafraid of the repercussions of honest appraisals, surround a designated person with final authority has been a demonstrably winning method of making successful investment decisions.
                        Princeton Capital Management has remained an independent, owner-managed firm since its inception, and owner assets are invested alongside those of our clients. We believe our clients have benefited from the Firm’s organizational stability and shared goals.
