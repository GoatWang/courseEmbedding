Apartments for rent in Virginia
If you're thinking of moving to Virginia, you'll have plenty of apartment choices in Virginia cities like Arlington, Richmond, Virginia Beach and Norfolk.

If you decide to rent an Arlington apartment, you'll share a home town with the Pentagon and Northern Virginia's technology corridor. The single largest employer in the county is the federal government, and the top 10 private employers in the area include Lockheed Martin, U.S. Airways, BAE Systems and Booz Allen Hamilton.

There's more to Arlington, VA than just politics and business, though. With nearly 1,300 acres of open space that includes close to 200 public parks and playgrounds, there's plenty of opportunity for outdoor recreation. And after you move into your Arlington apartment, you can take visiting friends and relatives on a trip to the Arlington Cemetery, one of the many national parks and monuments near apartments in Arlington, Virginia.

Maybe you'd rather live in the "River City" of Richmond, VA, which is appropriately named so for the James River that runs through it. For recreational fun, head to Central Richmond and take a waterfront stroll along the Canal Walk or go on a boat tour of the river and Kanawha Canal.

More than half of the work force in Richmond is comprised of law, government and service professions, but information technology, semiconductor manufacturing and biotechnology companies are on the rise. Much like Arlington, there are cultural and political landmarks around every corner, including the Virginia State Capitol.

If you're a beach person, look for apartments in Virginia Beach, the largest city in Virginia near Chesapeake Bay. Here, you can enjoy an average of 213 sunny days a year, sandy beaches, top-notch restaurants and a variety of shopping. You'll find calm waves just off Shore Drive at Chesapeake Bay Beach, as well as immaculate sand and breath-taking scenery in the Sandbridge area. Shopping is best found in the 17-block stretch of the Town Center of Virginia Beach with its large stores, local boutiques and specialty shops.

Norfolk is another city in Virginia with great apartments near a wealth of entertainment and recreation. Waterfront activities are readily available as Norfolk is bordered by the Chesapeake Bay and the Elizabeth River. Seven Venues is the entertainment hub of the city and features Scope Arena, Prism Theatre in Scope Arena, Chrysler Hall, Attucks Theatre, Wells Theatre, Harrison Opera House and Harbor Park. There are also many picturesque parks and museums in Norfolk.
The number of residents in Norfolk, including apartment dwellers, is approximately 200,000. This historic colonial city is home to the world's largest naval base, so many of these residents are in the military or have friends and family in the military.

These are just four of the many terrific cities in Virginia. You might also choose to look for apartments for rent in Hampton, Lynchburg, Fredericksburg or any of the other fantastic areas in Richmond.
