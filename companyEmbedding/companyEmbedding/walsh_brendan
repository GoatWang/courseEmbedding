                              This paper examines the behaviour of the Irish labour market during the 1990s. Over the course of the decade the Irish unemployment
                                 rate fell from the highest to the lowest in the EU. Over the same period a record number of jobs was created and all the indicators
                                 suggest that full employment was achieved. The primary reason for this "employment miracle" was the output boom, which in
                                 turn may be attributed to Ireland's "super competitiveness" in the late 1990s. Several factors contributed to this - a low
                                 exchange rate, the inflow of FDI to high productivity sectors, and wage moderation following the return to centralised wage
                                 agreements in 1987. Labour market reforms, including a tightening of the social welfare regime and a switch of spending from
                                 income support to active labour market policies, played a positive role. The fact that unemployment has risen only slowly
                                 during the current downturn points to the lasting effect of these changes

"Beautifully honest throughout and was a pleasure to read" - By 
Anonymous  (usa)


"Go" unapologetically took me on a far flung journey across the globe and back, stopping in Laos, Korea and a heartbreakingly familiar small town.  Beautifully honest throughout and was a pleasure to read.

"Always a pleasure." - By 
Joe 


Didn't think I'd be able to read something from Walsh again. Always loved listening to and reading his pieces. With what he writes he makes me think, but in an (for me very unusual) calm way. He's using words that I can relate to, to write about things I can relate to and transports the very feeling of a situation. Can't wait till my copy of this one arrives in Germany.

"Colorful Learning Experience!" - By 
Dolores Ayotte  (Winnipeg, Manitoba)


"The Minibeast Mansion" is a great, colorful, little children's book. The illustrations are very good and the educational purpose of this book is twofold. It teaches young children to count to ten and recognize colors with the help of playful creatures. What wonderful fun for preschool children!

"Loved this book" - By 
Jeffrey 


I loved this book.. It was an enjoyable , light read. I got involved in the characters lives and decisions.. Great family values, also showed a softer more loving side of the justice system. I hope their is a part 2 to this story.. To close I will never look at a Crow or a murder of crows the same again CAW CAW :)

Pulling the Strings: My Autobiography

by Peter Stringer






Available for download now.






Price:

$9.99








"Great Read" - By 
Nav Logan 


Peter Stringer – Pulling the StringsI don’t read many autobiographies, but this one sounded promising. After slogging half way through the recent Brian O’Driscoll book and giving it up as a lost cause, I was hoping that this would be something different, and thankfully, it was.I’m a huge fan of rugby, and I’ve always liked and respected Peter Stringer as a player. Someone once described him as the perfect scrum-half, “He’s exactly what it says on the tin.” I thought this comment very apt.Many other scrum halves try to be an extra centre, and coaches are looking at bigger, scrum half’s to impose more physicality of the game. Me, I prefer a clever, sniping scrum half; a bundle of energy with good hands, quick feet and a sharp mind. Peter Stringer fits that bill. Watching his play for Bath last season, I’m glad to say that ... full review

by John Leonard






Available for download now.

"A Frenetic Blinding Bending Look into Gaelic Football, Subbing and Sobriety" - By 
N. Liddle 


Don't read this book at 3 am!  It will buzz you up to the ceiling and keep you up there - you will NOT get back to sleep!  John's story is frenetic, well-written and above all, honest.  He is self-deprecating but also knows how good he was as the sub Goal Keeper.  I can't imagine what it must have felt like to have been a sub all that time and never to have gotten a game on!  (and this for a man who admits to loving the limelight!)His personality shines through so that this book is not only an inside-the-locker room expose of the Dub's rituals and warm-ups and practices - it's also a mad careening journey into the mind of a man crazied by a pedophile priest in his boyhood and who's been chasing demons since then.  The man's heart shines through ... full review

Tales from the War

Usually ships within 2 to 4 weeks.






Price:

$30.95








"A great book - worth reading!" - By 
J Murata  (Schertz, TX USA)


Tales from the War is a book of short stories with similarities to the Lord of the Rings.  I have already read the book three times. The stories take place in Verdania and take you on adventures through battles between good and evil for the crown of the kingdom. I thought it was very descriptive and had great battle scenes. I really liked the different characters that fought on the good side with queen Emerald.One of my favorite characters was the Red Rose who struggles through evil desires of the flesh and what is good. He is the son of an Immortal and possesses great powers but tries to use them for good. His companion Airryer is a half-breed of Elf and Bythnay. He carries a crossbow with arrows and some mystical bolts made by fairies. The Red Rose and Airryer fight against ghost men, bounty hunters, and ... full review

Insurance sounds boring and dreary to most people. Not for us at Walsh, Brendan, however. While it is a serious business, we do not see insurance as boring - it is after all the business of keeping people in their homes, from going out of business and getting back on the road – essentially helping people lead normal lives and recover from disaster. This is interesting stuff! We are partnered with the right insurance carrier/s, people we have been doing business with for years. This enables us to comparison shop and gets you (our client) the best deal available. And the best deal is not always about price – but, hey – price is a big factor and we will never stop fighting to get you the best price. We help our clients with all kinds of insurance, but here are the main insurance types our agency focuses on -

Auto insurance – do you know what coverage you have? Most of our clients gloss over when we start talking liability, collision, comprehensive insurance coverages. And why do the limits have to be different based on your specific needs? Rest assured, we understand what is needed to operate a vehicle in and around New York, NY and will handle all the details for you.
Business Insurance – own or operate a business? Do you need insurance before you can execute on a job/contract? Not sure what type of insurance you need? Do you just need the minimum or are you thinking about future exposure to lawsuits and injury claims? Our commercial insurance agents are standing by to help you get the right policy to help your business succeed.
Homeowners insurance – who knows where the value lies in an insurance policy when it comes to something as local-specific as insurance for a structure, building, home in a specific location – your local insurance agent – that’s who! Let us showcase our knowledge of the area in and around New York, NY. You will be confident that you found the best local partner for your insurance needs.
