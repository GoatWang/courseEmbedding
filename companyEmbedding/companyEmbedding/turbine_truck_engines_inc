	Item 1.01.

	 

	Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

	 


	 

	 


	On April 25, 2017 (the “Effective Date”), Turbine Truck Engines, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (this “Agreement”) by and between (i) the Company; (ii) Novo Healthnet Limited (“NHL”), (iii) ALMC-ASAP Holdings Inc. (“ALMC”); (iv) Michael Gaynor Family Trust (the “MGFT”); (v) 1218814 Ontario Inc. (“1218814”) and (vi) Michael Gaynor Physiotherapy Professional Corp. (“MGPP, and together with ALMC, MGFT and 1218814, the “NHL Shareholders”). Each of NHL and the NHL Shareholders may be referred to collectively herein as the “NHL Parties” and separately as an “NHL Party.” Each of the Company and each NHL Party may be referred to herein collectively as the “Parties” and separately as a “Party.” Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Company agreed to acquire from the NHL Shareholders all of the shares of both common and preferred stock of NHL held by the NHL Shareholders in exchange for the issuance by the Company to the NHL Shareholders of shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Company Common Stock”), such that following the closing of the share exchange (the “Exchange”), the NHL Shareholders will own 167,797,406 restricted shares of Company Common Stock, representing 85% of the issued and outstanding Company Common Stock, calculated including all granted and issued options or warrants to acquire the Company Common Stock as of the Effective Date, but to exclude shares of Company Common Stock that are subject to a current Regulation S offering being undertaking by the Company. As a result of the Exchange, NHL will become a wholly owned foreign subsidiary of the Company.


	 


	As of the closing of the Exchange, the Company’s Board will expand the size of the Board of Directors to be six persons, and to name the nominees of the NHL Shareholders to fill the newly created vacancies. Immediately thereafter, each of (i) Vincenzo Cirillo shall resign as a director and as the Interim Chief Executive Officer of the Company; (ii) Judy Norstrud shall resign as the Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer of the Company, and (iii) Chris David shall resign as the Secretary and Treasurer of the Company, but shall remain both as the President of the Company and as a director. In connection with the resignations of the Mr. Cirillo and Ms. Norstrud, the Company will enter into a settlement and general release agreement with each of such persons, each in form and substance as reasonably agreed to by the Parties.


	 


	The Agreement may be terminated, as set forth in the Agreement, (a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and each of the NHL Parties, (b) by the Company (i) if the applicable closing conditions have not been satisfied or waived by the Company, by May 15, 2017; or (ii) or there has been a material violation, breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of any NHL Party contained in the Agreement, which violation, breach or inaccuracy would cause any certain conditions set forth in the Agreement not to be satisfied, and such violation, breach or inaccuracy has not been waived by the Company or cured by the NHL Parties, applicable, within five (5) business days after receipt by NHL of written notice thereof from the Company or is not reasonably capable of being cured prior to May 15, 2017; (c) by all of the NHL Parties acting together (i) if the applicable closing conditions have not been satisfied or waived by the NHL Parties, by May 15, 2017, provided, however, that the NHL Parties may not terminate the Agreement if the reason for the failure of any such condition to occur was the breach of the terms of the Agreement by any of the NHL Parties; or (ii) or there has been a material violation, breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company contained in the Agreement, which violation, breach or inaccuracy would cause any of the applicable closing conditions not to be satisfied, and such violation, breach or inaccuracy has not been waived by NHL Parties or cured by the Company, applicable, within five (5) business days after receipt by the Company of written notice thereof from NHL or is not reasonably capable of being cured prior to May 15, 2017; or (d) by any Party, if a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority shall have issued an order or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated under the Agreement and such order or action shall have become final and nonappealable.


	 


	The closing is subject to various customary closing conditions.


	 


	The foregoing description of the Agreement is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such document, filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

	Section 8.02

	Indemnification of NHL

	. The Company (“Company Indemnifying Party”) hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law the NHL Shareholders, NHL and each of its officers, directors, employees, stockholders, attorneys and agents and permitted assignees (each a “NHL Indemnified Party”), against and in respect of any and all Losses incurred or sustained by any NHL Indemnified Party as a result of or in connection with any breach, inaccuracy or nonfulfillment or the alleged breach, inaccuracy or nonfulfillment of any of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company contained herein or in any of the additional agreements or any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto.


	 


	Section 8.03

	Procedure

	. The following shall apply with respect to all claims by any NHL Indemnified Party or Company Indemnified Party for indemnification:


	 







	 



	(a)


	An indemnified Party shall give the indemnifying Party prompt notice (an “Indemnification Notice”) of any third-party Action with respect to which such indemnified Party seeks indemnification pursuant to Section 8.01 or Section 8.02 (a “Third-Party Claim”), which shall describe in reasonable detail the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the indemnified Party. The failure to give the Indemnification Notice shall not impair any of the rights or benefits of such indemnified Party under Section 8.01 or Section 8.02, except to the extent such failure materially and adversely affects the ability of the indemnifying Party to defend such claim or increases the amount of such liability.




	 






	 




	21







	 




	 




	 







	 



	(b)


	In the case of any Third-Party Claims as to which indemnification is sought by any indemnified Party, such indemnified Party shall be entitled, at the sole expense and liability of the indemnifying Party, to exercise full control of the defense, compromise or settlement of any Third-Party Claim unless the indemnifying Party, within a reasonable time after the giving of an Indemnification Notice by the indemnified Party (but in any event within ten (10) days thereafter), shall (i) deliver a written confirmation to such indemnified Party that the indemnification provisions of Section 8.01 or Section 8.02 are applicable to such Action and the indemnifying Party will indemnify such indemnified Party in respect of such Action pursuant to the terms of this Article VIII and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, shall do so without asserting any challenge, defense, limitation on the indemnifying Party’s liability for Losses, counterclaim or offset, (ii) notify such indemnified Party in writing of the intention of the indemnifying Party to assume the defense thereof, and (iii) retain legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified Party to conduct the defense of such Third-Party Claim.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	(c)


	If the indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such Third-Party Claim pursuant to Section 8.03(b), then the indemnified Party shall cooperate with the indemnifying Party in any manner reasonably requested in connection with the defense, and the indemnified Party shall have the right to be kept fully informed by the indemnifying Party and their legal counsel with respect to the status of any legal proceedings, to the extent not inconsistent with the preservation of attorney-client or work product privilege. If the indemnifying Party so assumes the defense of any such Third-Party Claim, the indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense, compromise, or settlement thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel employed by the indemnified Party shall be at the expense of such indemnified Party unless (i) the indemnifying Party has agreed to pay such fees and expenses, or (ii) the named parties to any such Third-Party Claim (including any impleaded parties) include an indemnified Party and the indemnifying Party and the indemnified Party shall have been advised by its counsel that there may be a conflict of interest between such indemnified Party and the indemnifying Party in the conduct of the defense thereof, and in any such case the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the indemnifying Party.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	(d)


	If the indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim pursuant to Section 8.03(b), the indemnified Party shall not pay, or permit to be paid, any part of any claim or demand arising from such asserted liability unless the indemnifying Party withdraws from or fails to vigorously prosecute the defense of such asserted liability, or unless a judgment is entered against the indemnified Party for such liability. If the indemnifying Party does not elect to defend, or if, after commencing or undertaking any such defense, the indemnifying Party fails to adequately prosecute or withdraw such defense, the indemnified Party shall have the right to undertake the defense or settlement thereof, at the indemnifying Party’s expense. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control, but may participate in, and the indemnified Party (at the expense of the indemnifying Parties) shall be entitled to have sole control over, the defense or settlement of (x) that part of any Third Party Claim (i) that seeks a temporary restraining order, a preliminary or permanent injunction or specific performance against the indemnified Party, or (ii) to the extent such Third Party Claim involves criminal allegations against the indemnified Party or (y) the entire Third Party Claim if such Third Party Claim would impose liability on the part of the indemnified Party. In the event the indemnified Party retains control of the Third-Party Claim, the indemnified Party will not settle the subject claim without the prior written consent of the indemnifying Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.




	 






	 




	22







	 




	 




	 









	 



	(e)


	If the indemnified Party undertakes the defense of any such Third-Party Claim pursuant to Section 8.03(b) and proposes to settle the same prior to a final judgment thereon or to forgo appeal with respect thereto, then the indemnified Party shall give the indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof and the indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in the settlement, assume or reassume the defense thereof or prosecute such appeal, in each case at the indemnifying Party’s expense. The indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of such indemnified Party settle or compromise or consent to entry of any judgment with respect to any such Third-Party Claim (i) in which any relief other than the payment of money damages is or may be sought against such indemnified Party, (ii) in which such Third Party Claim could be reasonably expected to impose or create a monetary liability on the part of the indemnified Party (such as an increase in the indemnified Party’s income Tax) other than the monetary claim of the third party in such Third-Party Claim being paid pursuant to such settlement or judgment, or (iii) which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant, person conducting such investigation or initiating such hearing, plaintiff or petitioner to such indemnified Party of a release from all liability with respect to such Third-Party Claim and all other Actions (known or unknown) arising or which might arise out of the same facts.



	 

	Section 8.04

	Periodic Payments

	. Any indemnification required by this Article VIII for costs, disbursements or expenses of any indemnified Party in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending any Action shall be made by periodic payments by the indemnifying Party to each indemnified Party during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or costs, disbursements or expenses are incurred.


	 


	Section 8.05

	Insurance

	. Any indemnification payments hereunder shall take into account any insurance proceeds or other third-party reimbursement actually received.


	 


	Section 8.06

	Time Limit

	. The obligations of the NHL Indemnifying Party and the Company Indemnifying Party under Section 8.01 and Section 8.02 shall expire two (2) years from the Closing Date, except with respect to (i) an indemnification claim asserted in accordance with the provisions of this Article VIII which remains unresolved, for which the obligation to indemnify shall continue until such claim is resolved; and (ii) resolved claims for which payment has not yet been paid to the indemnified Party.

Binding arbitration shall be the sole means of resolving any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including with respect to the meaning, effect, validity, termination, interpretation, performance or enforcement of this Agreement) or any alleged breach thereof (including any claim in tort, contract, equity, or otherwise).

	(f)


	The Arbitrator may, at his discretion and at the expense of the Party who will bear the cost of the arbitration, employ experts to assist him in his determinations.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	(g)


	The costs of the arbitration proceeding and any proceeding in court to confirm any arbitration award or to obtain relief, as applicable (including actual attorneys’ fees and costs), shall be borne by the unsuccessful Party and shall be awarded as part of the Arbitrator’s decision, unless the Arbitrator shall otherwise allocate such costs in such decision. The determination of the Arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the Parties and not subject to appeal.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	(h)


	Any judgment upon any award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered in and enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. The Parties expressly consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts (Federal and state) in Palm Beach County, Florida to enforce any award of the Arbitrator or to render any provisional, temporary, or injunctive relief in connection with or in aid of the Arbitration. The Parties expressly consent to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to arbitrate any and all matters to be submitted to arbitration hereunder. None of the Parties hereto shall challenge any arbitration hereunder on the grounds that any party necessary to such arbitration (including the Parties) shall have been absent from such arbitration for any reason, including that such Party shall have been the subject of any bankruptcy, reorganization, or insolvency proceeding.

Each Party agrees to waive any requirement for the security or posting of any bond in connection with any such equitable remedy, and agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that (a) the other Party has an adequate remedy at law, or (b) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.


	 


	Section 10.20

	Counterparts

	. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which taken together shall be but a single instrument.

	On December 25, 2015, TTE received a written ruling from the Taiwan District Prosecutor’s Office that it had declined to prosecute Alan Chen and Mr. Huang for criminal fraud.


	 


	On January 4, 2016, Formosan Brothers, on behalf of the Company, filed an appeal to the Taiwan High Prosecution Office requesting the High Court review the facts and evidence of the case and send the matter back to the Taiwan District Prosecutor's Office for a new investigation of the facts and evidence.

The Company intends to continue to pursue this matter until a final resolution is obtained.


	 


	As of the Effective Date, the Company and its Taiwan-based legal counsel, Formosan Brothers Law Firm, continue to submit briefings, attend hearings and respond to any request from the Taiwan District Court Prosecutor as the Prosecutor's office undertakes its new investigation.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THIS FILING CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THE WORDS "ANTICIPATED,"  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and plan of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere herein. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements including information about possible or assumed results of our financial conditions, operations, plans, objectives and performance that involve risk, uncertainties and assumptions. The actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements. For example, when we indicate that we expect to increase our product sales and potentially establish additional license relationships, these are forward-looking statements. The words expect, anticipate, estimate or similar expressions are also used to indicate forward-looking statements.  OVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY  Turbine Truck Engines, Inc. is a clean-air technology company dedicated to identifying, developing and commercializing important scientific innovations designed to dramatically enhance both environmental conservation and cost savings in how the world consumes energy.  Turbine Truck Engines, Inc. ("TTE" or "the Company") was incorporated in Delaware on November 27, 2000. On February 20, 2008, the Company was re-domiciled to the State of Nevada. To date, the Company's activities have been limited to raising capital, organizational matters, engaging in research and development, testing its technology, and the structuring of its business plan. The corporate headquarters are located in Bellevue, Washington. The Company has not yet generated any revenues since inception.  To date, the Company's principal research and development operations have been directed at the potential commercialization, of its (a) Detonation Cycle Gas Turbine Engine technology ("DCGT"); its (b) Gas to Liquid Conversion Process technology ("GTL"); and the (c) Hydrogen Production Burner System ("HPBS").  In addition, the Company continues to conduct diligence to either purchase or merge an intellectual property asset and/or an existing operational company asset. To date, TTE has not entered into a contractual commitment to complete an asset purchase or merger.  On May 5, 2015 TTE completed a one-for-twenty (1:20) reverse split of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share. All common shares and options to purchase common shares have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this reverse split, unless otherwise noted. The new CUSIP number is 89989X 204.  Table of Contents  PRODUCT STATUS AND DESCRIPTION  I. THE DCGT ENGINE TECHNOLOGY  COMPANY HISTORY OF THE DETONATION CYCLE GAS TURBINE ENGINE  Since the formation of Turbine Truck Engines, Inc., on November 27, 2000, the development of the Detonation Cycle Gas Turbine Engine technology ("DCGT"), for the application of heavy-duty highway trucks, has been at the core of the Company's business operations. Up until August 13, 2014, the Company had funded the building and testing of Prototype #5, a 540HP 12-cylinder engine and Prototype #6, a 70HP 4-cylinder engine for the purpose of sufficiently advancing the research and development of the DCGT engine technology to a point of entering into a joint venture agreement with a heavy-duty truck engine manufacturer for advanced research and development. To date, however, the DCGT engine technology is not ready for commercialization, for any application, and remains in the research and development phase.  The DCGT was successfully patented in December 1999 by the inventor, Robert Scragg ("Mr. Scragg"), whom had earlier issued a master license for all rights and potential applications for the DCGT to Alpha Engines, Inc., ("Alpha"), a company owned by he and his wife, Barbara Scragg. On December 15, 2000, TTE acquired the option rights for an exclusive License from Alpha for manufacturing and marketing heavy-duty highway truck engines utilizing Alpha's DCGT engine technology embodied in U.S. Patent No. 6,000,214 and other proprietary technology and rights owned by Alpha, at that time, including Marketing Survey Data in the highway trucking industry. TTE exercised its option and acquired the licensing rights on July 22, 2002.  In August, 2014, the Company changed a majority of its Board of Directors, management and corporate officer personnel, and undertook a revised look at the Company's business operations. While TTE's new management and Board of Directors, in coordination with Mr. Scragg, continued to believe the patented DCGT technology can be developed for commercialization, they determined that the Company should shift its research and development focus to designing a DCGT engine for applications directly related to power generation. Based on this new focus, TTE no longer intends to expend resources on the development of the DCGT engine technology for the heavy-duty truck engine applications and instead is pursuing a path forward to the development of the DCGT engine technology for other commercial applications specifically related to power generation.  On November 14, 2014, TTE executed an Asset Purchase Agreement and a Technology Sale, Transfer, Assignment Agreement for all Intellectual Property, dated October 14, 2014 (the "Asset Purchase Agreements") between the Company, Robert and Barbara Scragg and Alpha Engines Corporation, settling and ending all licensing agreements between TTE and Alpha Engines Corporation and completing the purchase by the Company of all patents, Intellectual Property, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, rights, title, and interest for both (1) the DCGT engine technology; and (2) the electromagnetic process and apparatus for converting methane gas to liquid methanol, on a low-volume scale, also referred to as the Gas-to-Liquid process technology. Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreements, all royalty payments due by TTE to Alpha Engines were settled with no future royalty payments due. TTE owns the DCGT engine technology free and clear.  Since taking ownership of the DCGT technology, TTE has periodically engaged in discussions with several North American based engineering firms to re-initiate research and development of the DCGT engine technology for applications directly related to turning a shaft for power generation; however, the Company is not currently engaged in a research and development contract.  ABOUT THE DCGT ENGINE TECHNOLOGY  This patent in its simplicity makes it very unique. A detonation cycle gas turbine engine includes a turbine rotor contained in a housing. The exhaust ports of respective valve-less combustion chambers are located on opposite sides of the rotor directing combustion gases toward the turbine. The chambers are connected by a valve-less manifold fed with fuel and oxidizer. When combustible gases are detonated by an igniter in one of the combustion chambers, the back pressure from the detonation shuts off the fuel and oxidizer flow to that chamber and redirects the fuel and oxidizer to the opposite chamber, where detonation occurs. The process repeats cyclically. Power is taken off the rotor shaft mechanically or electrically.  Table of Contents  The invention utilizes a water wheel as the turbine wheel which has blades that are positively displaced, through a blade race, by the rapid expansion of gases exiting from combustion chambers via nozzles, rather than pistons or gas turbines.  Our engine has a blower, rather than a compressor, to supply less air per horsepower hour than required by existing gas turbines or piston engines, thereby producing less exhaust gases per horsepower hour.  The blower supplies low pressure air via a single manifold to two combustion chambers simultaneously thereby requiring less work to complete a detonation cycle, resulting in higher thermos-mechanical efficiencies than gas turbines or piston engines.  The engine manifolds, combustion chambers, and ignition system has the capability of cyclically detonating fuel-air mixtures without using valves. The engine uses a fuel pump and vaporizers to gasify wet fuels prior to mixing with combustion air in the manifolds to produce complete combustion of all fuel-air mixtures in the detonation process. The engine uses a plasma arc ignition, a visibly constant illuminating plasma flame between two electrodes to detonate fuel-air mixtures and does not require critical ignition timing.  Low pressure air and fuel mixtures are detonated instantaneously-in less than one millisecond-producing high velocity shock waves that kinetically compress inert gases resulting in higher working pressures than the pressures produced in constant pressure heating utilized in gas turbine engines, and Otto and Diesel cycle piston engines.  The detonation cycle engine uses less working fluid and produces less exhaust gas per horsepower hour than Brayton cycle turbines and Otto or Diesel cycle piston engines.  Six working prototypes have been developed and constructed over the course of the last 20 years, culminating in the development of the 6th generation prototype engine which consists of two 7-inch, 8-pound turbine wheels mounted on a single shaft, driven by 4 horizontally opposed combustion chambers producing an estimated 70 horsepower at 20,000 rpm.  The DCGT engine technology includes an Electromagnetic Isothermal Combustion ("EIC") process that powers the engine. The EIC process produces complete combustion of fuel-oxidizer mixtures in cyclic detonations that negate unwanted nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide emissions. The high pressure gases produced by the detonations drive a unique turbine, producing shaft horsepower.  The EIC process enables the DCGT to operate with blower air at low static pressure, negating the necessity of compressing and preheating fuel-oxidizer mixtures prior to combustion. By eliminating the compression of fuel-oxidizer mixtures, the DCGT engine achieves higher thermal efficiencies in a simplified mechanical structure. The DCGT engine offers the following proprietary and competitive advantages over current diesel, gasoline and gas turbine engines:  ? Air cooled - less than 2 pounds per horsepower  ? Fewer moving parts - less maintenance  ? Flex-fuel and mixed fuels capability  ? Operates on all hydrocarbon fuels, hydrogen and synthetic fuels  ? Cold start capability with any fuels  ? Burns 30% less fuel "Greenhouse exhaust gases"  ? Less nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide exhaust emissions  ? Less hydrocarbon exhaust emissions  ? No lube oil, filters or pumps  Table of Contents  COMPETITION FOR THE DCGT ENGINE TECHNOLOGY FOR POWER GENRATION  Given that certain aspects of the Company's DCGT engine technology is still under U.S. patent protection, the Company is not aware of any entity that has successfully commercialized pulse detonation cycle technology for power generation applications. Additionally, until TTE is able to successfully produce data from a prototype of an operational DCGT engine turning a shaft for power generation, it is difficult to provide qualitative comparisons of the DCGT engine technology to the myriad of other technologies available to both residential and business consumers today. Once TTE is able to successfully complete a working bench prototype and collect a myriad of acceptable data on items such as horsepower, torque, efficiency, temperatures, pressures and more, TTE will then be better positioned to identify the target market for commercialization of the DCGT engine technology for power production. At that time, TTE can then provide clarity and direction on competition considerations for our product and its target market.  PATENTS FOR THE DCGT ENGINE TECHNOLOGY  The DCGT engine technology currently has a single U. S. Patent No. 6,000,214, a novel patent with a 20-year life from the filing date of December 16, 1997. The patent was based on research and development beginning in 1984, which included the design, construction, and testing of working prototypes #1, #2, #3 and #4. The patent attorneys were Schoemaker & Mattare Ltd. TTE intends to file additional patents to protect any new developments in the engine technology.  II. GAS-TO-LIQUID PROCESS TECHNOLOGY  COMPANY HISTORY OF THE GAS TO LIQUID PROCESS TECHNOLOGY  In addition to the DCGT engine technology, Robert Scragg is also the inventor of an expired patent for a process in which methane gas, the primary component of natural gas, is converted into liquid methanol at low-volume production rates. Low volume is defined as 50 gallons per minute or less. This process is referred to as Gas-to-Liquid ("GTL" or "the Scragg Process").  In 1983, Robert Scragg received patent protection for his "Electromagnetic Process and Apparatus for Making Methanol". While this patent has expired, certain intellectual property and trade secrets remain intact and protected and are now owned by TTE. Mr. Scragg's 1983 patent proved that gentle oxidation of methane gas, a hydrocarbon, using precise electromagnetic activation produces methanol gas which is then condensed in the reactor chamber to form liquid methanol. The Scragg process for gas to liquid conversion provides for production of methanol on a low-volume scale using an easily transportable apparatus and system. When the inventor received his patent for the GTL process technology, he created a working GTL prototype for presentation to the U.S. Patent office. Today, that prototype no longer exists and a new prototype has to be built using the inventor's notes, drawings and data collection, along with newly gathered research information, to prove the viability of the GTL technology.  As noted in Section I above, titled Company History of the DCGT Engine Technology, on November 14, 2014, the Company closed an Asset Purchase Agreement, with Robert and Barbara Scragg and Alpha Engines Corporation, completing the purchase, by Turbine Truck Engines, Inc. of all patents, intellectual property, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, rights, title, and interest for an electromagnetic process and apparatus for converting methane gas to methanol, the Scragg Process. While the Scragg Process patent has expired, certain intellectual property and trade secrets remain intact and protected and are now owned by TTE.  Prior to TTE completing its acquisition of Robert Scragg's GTL process technology, TTE always had an open invitation to pursue a licensing contract, with Alpha, for the development of the Scragg Process. While TTE never completed a licensing agreement for the Scragg Process, TTE's prior management did periodically pursue potential development partners.  On June 3, 2015, TTE signed and executed a Consulting Services Agreement with Justin Dean, an individual, to retain Mr. Dean as the Project and Program Manager for Phase 1 of TTE's product development of its GTL process technology. This agreement further defined Mr. Dean's responsibilities to include conceptual design analysis, product development analysis, product commercialization analysis, business plan analysis, product application analysis, and industry use & application analysis.  Table of Contents  On June 3, 2015, TTE signed and executed a Services Agreement with Sahoma Controlware, LLC (the "Sahoma Agreement") to provide the Company with services for the design, modeling and simulation of TTE's Gas-to-Liquid Process technology, to include the Electromagnetic Generator, Chemical Reactor and Process Gas Feed Systems products. The Sahoma Agreement's scope of work included developing individual product simulation models & analysis for flow, thermal, vibration, structural/stress and electrical while also developing simulation models for the entire GTL Reactor Process to determine maximum operational effectiveness and efficiency.  Collectively, both the Sahoma Agreement and the Dean Consulting Services Agreement were executed to provide the Company with engineering, technical and analytical expertise to validate the Company expending additional resources on the development of its Gas-to-Liquid process technology for converting methane and oxygen gas into methanol liquid at low-volume production rates.  On February 19, 2016, the Company executed Settlement Agreements with both Sahoma Controlware, LLC and Justin Dean mutually concluding both the Engineering Services Agreement, dated June 3, 2015, with Sahoma and the Consulting Services Agreement, dated June 3, 2015, with Dean. Under both Services Agreements, the Company has received certain 3D modeling, design and data sets that, while not conclusive, do provide a working baseline for continuing additional research and development to validate the GTL process technologies' operational capacity and efficiency.  Under the terms of the Settlement Agreements, the Company has no further obligation to pay Sahoma the final milestone payment of $10,824 and Dean will retain the 250,000 shares of the Company's common stock issued to him under the Consulting Services Agreement.  Since executing the Settlement Agreements, the Company has had periodic discussions with a U.S. based engineering entity as it considers the best path forward to continue research and development of its GTL low-volume production process technology. The next phase of research to validate the operational and commercial viability of the GTL process technology will require conducting additional modeling and the build of a bench prototype to collect data sets on a multitude of items including, but not limited to, yield rates, species analysis and energy balance calculations. To date, the Company is not engaged in a research and development contract.  WHY LOW VOLUME PRODUCTION OF GAS TO LIQUID  Throughout the United States and the world, at sites where drilling operations are producing natural gas as a by-product, a large portion of the natural gas is being flare burned, instead of being sold, as the site is either too far from a pipeline or the accessible pipeline has no additional capacity. When taking into account cost analysis, environmental considerations and commodity pricing in today's marketplace, TTE believes the demand for an easily transportable, self-sustaining apparatus capable of converting gas to liquid, on a low-volume scale, has elevated.  As a result of the market's willingness to consider other options, besides flare burning the on-site natural gas, several companies are working to develop a low-volume, easily transportable GTL apparatus for commercialization. To date, TTE is not aware of any company that has commercialized a low-volume, unmanned, remote GTL system which has proved viable as a self-supporting, profitable business.  TTE believes today's marketplace dynamics allow for a lower volume, easily transportable GTL apparatus to address an enormous, unmet need of redirecting flare burn natural gas for conversion to methanol for commercial resale or reuse onsite even at low-volume production rates.  COMPETITION FOR THE SCRAGG PROCESS GAS TO LIQUID  To date, companies invested in converting natural gas to methanol are primarily engaged in high-volume scale production operations. The current state-of-the-art method of producing liquid methanol involves a low pressure process of preparing synthesis gas by steam reforming or partial oxidation of a gaseous hydrocarbon feedstock or by direct combination of carbon dioxide with purified hydrogen rich gases. Typically, naphtha or a natural gas feedstock is desulfurized, preheated and mixed with a superheated steam, and then reacted over a conventional catalyst in a multi-tubular reformer. After cooling, the synthesis gas is compressed to the required pressure and passed into a hot-wall converter over a low pressure methanol synthesis catalyst at a temperature ranging from 250 to 270 degrees centigrade. The crude methanol that is formed is condensed and separated from the uncondensed gases which are recycled with makeup synthesis gas and fed back into the converter.  Table of Contents  Methanex Corp. is the world's largest producer of Methanol. To date, facilities converting gas to liquid are only focused on large scale production. The dollar cost to build and operate a high-volume scale GTL production facility is significant.  PATENTS FOR THE GAS TO LIQUID SCRAGG PROCESS  To date there are no patents or patents pending for the Gas to Liquid Scragg Process. On Feb 15, 1983, the Scragg Process for converting methane to methanol was granted patent protection under US Patent # 4,374,288. The patent has expired; however, the Company claims protection under Trade Secrets laws.  III. THE HYDROGEN PRODUCTION BURNER SYSTEMS  In 2010, TTE was working with various Chinese based partners to develop its licensed DCGT engine technology for use in various applications in Asia. At that time, TTE's CEO, Michael Rouse, was introduced to Falcon Power Co. Ltd. ("Falcon"), a Taiwan based business, that was developing a technology focused on converting methanol to hydrogen, on-demand, using a proprietary technology now known as the Hydrogen Production Burner System ("HPBS"). One of the potential fuel sources for the DCGT engine technology is hydrogen, thus TTE and Falcon began a diligence phase to consider a collaborative effort to blend the 2 technologies having the HPBS produce hydrogen that could then provide a hydrogen fuel source for the DCGT engine.  Commencing in the spring of 2010 and through February 2014, the Company conducted diligence, negotiated, executed, and ultimately terminated certain contractual obligations with certain Taiwanese and/or Chinese based individuals and corporations. The Company's intentions throughout this defined period was to directly participate in commercializing the Hydrogen Production Burner System worldwide through either licensing rights or a Technology Purchase Agreement of the HPBS technology.  In September 2013, the Company was engaged in certain contracts with Energy Technology Services Co. Ltd ("ETS"), a Taiwan based corporation, for business development of the HPBS technology in Asia. Under the terms of these contracts, the Company provided ETS a total of $300,000 (CAN) to fulfill TTE's June 2013 Purchase Order with ETS, for the manufacture of a new 200m3 HPBS unit.  Throughout the fall of 2013 and into January 2014, ETS provided TTE with positive written and video status reports on the progress of the building, completion and delivery of its 200m3 HPBS unit as defined and paid for under the June 2013 Purchase Order. To date, ETS has not fulfilled its contractual obligation to deliver a new 200m3 HPBS.  In February 2014, TTE hired a Taiwan based law firm, Formosan Brothers, to represent the Company, in its pursuit of criminal fraud charges against ETS' principal partners, Chen, Chong-Ping ("Alan Chen") and Huang, Ren-Ju ("Mr. Huang"), both Taiwan citizens, for failure to deliver the newly built 200m3 HPBS unit as provided for under contract. ETS was represented to the Company as the business partners for the inventor Dr. Ching-Chang Chang ("Dr. Chang").  In Spring 2014, given that no direct evidence existed indicating Dr. Chang had knowledge of the fraud against TTE, the Company engaged in negotiations directly with the HPBS inventor for the purchase of the HPBS technology. To date, Dr. Chang claims to have title ownership of the HPBS technology. In October 2014, Dr. Chang presented TTE with both pictures and video of a new 60m3 HPBS unit he completed building, at his own expense. While TTE and Dr. Chang have negotiated proposed terms and conditions for TTE to acquire the HPBS technology, TTE is continuing to undergo extensive due diligence to validate and verify title ownership of the HPBS technology. Until the Company is satisfied with both (a) title ownership of the HPBS; and (b) exactly which Taiwan individuals were engaged in fraud against the Company, any final agreement to purchase the HPBS technology is pending.  Table of Contents  On December 25, 2015, TTE received a written ruling from the Taiwan District Prosecutor's Office declining to prosecute Alan Chen and Mr. Huang for criminal fraud.  On January 4, 2016, Formosan Brothers, on behalf of TTE, filed an appeal to the Taiwan High Prosecution Office requesting the High Court review the facts and evidence of the case and grant TTE an appeal of the lower court's decision and send the matter back to the Taiwan District Prosecutor's Office for a new investigation of the facts and evidence.  On February 1, 2016, TTE received notice that the Companies' appeal was granted and that the initial decision, dated December 25, 2015, by the Taiwan District Court prosecutor not to prosecute Alan Chen and Mr. Huang was overturned and rescinded. The case was returned to the Taiwan District Court Prosecutor with instructions to conduct a new investigation of the facts and evidence. TTE and its counsel intend to continue to pursue these charges until a satisfactory resolution is obtained.  As of September 30, 2016, TTE and its Taiwan based legal counsel, Formosan Brothers Law Firm, continue to submit briefings, attend hearings and respond to any request from the Taiwan District Court Prosecutor as the Prosecutor's office undertakes its new investigation.  ABOUT THE HYDROGEN PRODUCTION AND BURNER SYSTEM  Hydrogen (H2) is an ideal fuel for combustion - it burns easily and efficiently at very high temperatures and emits pure water vapor (H2O) as its only by-product. But the gas is a difficult fuel to work with. Existing methods for transporting and storing hydrogen (namely high-pressure compression and liquefaction) are complex, inefficient, and expensive. It's also the smallest molecule in existence and tends naturally to leak; only exacerbating these problems.  The Hydrogen Production Burner System is an efficient methanol-to-hydrogen production and burner integrated technology which utilizes a steam reformation process, employs a proprietary chemical catalyst and a unique low temperature pyrolytic reaction to convert common methanol into clean-burning hydrogen gas, on-demand, for use as a fuel source to a proprietary burner assembly. The inventor of the HPBS is located in Taiwan and has been developing the technology for over 9 years.  Having a technology available that can produce hydrogen on-demand and on-site eliminates the costly and difficult issues that surround the transportation and storage of hydrogen. Additionally, methanol (CH4O, also known as methyl alcohol or wood alcohol) is inexpensive, widely accessible, and easier to store, handle and transport. The HPBS technology provides a unique and marketable solution for those entities wanting to burn hydrogen as a thermal heat source.  The HPBS system offers the potential to integrate with a wide array of industrial boilers and steam generators as well as other various residential and commercial applications. The efficiency of the HPBS technology could save the . . .  Oct 31, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

	ITEM 1. BUSINESS




	 


	Turbine Truck Engines, Inc. ("TTE" or "the Company") was incorporated in Delaware on November 27, 2000. On February 20, 2008, the Company was re-domiciled to the State of Nevada. To date, the Company's activities have been limited to raising capital, organizational matters, engaging in research and development, testing its technology, and the structuring of its business plan. The corporate headquarters are located in Bellevue, Washington. The Company has not yet generated any revenues since inception.


	 


	To date, the Company's principal research and development operations have been directed at the potential commercialization, of its (a) Detonation Cycle Gas Turbine Engine technology ("DCGT"); its (b) Gas-to-Liquid Conversion Process technology ("GTL"); and the (c) Hydrogen Production Burner System ("HPBS"). In addition, the Company continues to conduct diligence to either purchase or merge an intellectual property asset and/or an existing operational company asset.


	 


	On January 2, 2017, TTE entered into a non-binding Letter-of-Intent (the “LOI”) with Novo Healthnet Limited (“NHL”), a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Ontario, Canada, pursuant to which TTE and NHL agreed to pursue, in good-faith, negotiations for the entry into a definitive agreement for the acquisition, by TTE, of all of the issued and outstanding shares of NHL, such that NHL would become a wholly owned foreign subsidiary of the Company.


	 


	On May 5, 2015, TTE completed a one-for-twenty (1:20) reverse split of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share.


	 


	On May 10, 2015, Michael Rouse, TTE's founder, resigned as the Company's President and member of the Board of Directors, and Christopher David, was appointed to serve as the Company's President, while remaining the Company's Secretary, Treasurer and member of the Board of Directors. To date, Mr. Rouse's seat on the Company's Board of Directors has not be filled.


	 


	On September 8, 2015, the Company adopted the 2015 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2015 Plan") which authorizes up to 5,000,000 shares of common stock to be available for issuance to certain employees and consultants as defined in the 2015 Plan. The 2015 Plan supersedes the 2011 Compensation Plan.


	 


	The Company will need to raise capital over the coming 12 months to support its activities. The Company's activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including failing to secure additional funding to commercialize the Company's current technology before another company develops similar technology.

	PRODUCT STATUS AND DESCRIPTION



	 



	I.

	THE DCGT ENGINE TECHNOLOGY




	 



	COMPANY HISTORY OF THE DETONATION CYCLE GAS TURBINE ENGINE



	 


	Since TTE’s formation in 2000, the development of the Detonation Cycle Gas Turbine Engine technology ("DCGT"), for the application of heavy-duty highway trucks, has been at the core of the Company's business operations.


	 


	The DCGT was patented in December 1999 by the inventor, Robert Scragg ("Mr. Scragg"), whom had earlier issued a master license for all rights and potential applications for the DCGT to Alpha Engines, Inc., ("Alpha"), a company owned by he and his wife, Barbara Scragg. On December 15, 2000, TTE acquired the option rights for an exclusive License from Alpha for manufacturing and marketing heavy-duty highway truck engines utilizing Alpha's DCGT engine technology embodied in U.S. Patent No. 6,000,214 and other proprietary technology and rights owned by Alpha, at that time, including Marketing Survey Data in the highway trucking industry. TTE exercised its option and acquired the licensing rights on July 22, 2002.


	 


	The Company has funded the building and testing of Prototype #5, a 540HP 12-cylinder engine and Prototype #6, a 70HP 4-cylinder engine for the purpose of sufficiently advancing the research and development of the DCGT engine technology to a point of entering into a joint venture agreement with a heavy-duty truck engine manufacturer for advanced research and development.


	 


	In August, 2014, the Company changed a majority of its Board of Directors, management and corporate officer personnel, and undertook a revised look at the Company's business operations. While TTE's new management and Board of Directors, in coordination with Mr. Scragg, continue to believe the patented DCGT technology can be developed for commercialization, the new TTE Board of Directors determined that the Company should shift its research and development focus to designing a DCGT engine for applications directly related to power generation. Based on this new focus, TTE no longer intends to expend resources on the development of the DCGT engine technology for the heavy-duty truck engine applications and instead is pursuing a path forward to the development of the DCGT engine technology for other commercial applications specifically related to power generation. To date, however, the DCGT engine technology is not ready for commercialization, for any application, and remains in the research and development phase.


	 


	On November 14, 2014, TTE executed an Asset Purchase Agreement and a Technology Sale, Transfer, Assignment Agreement for all Intellectual Property, dated October 14, 2014 (the "Asset Purchase Agreements") between the Company, Robert and Barbara Scragg and Alpha Engines Corporation, settling and ending all licensing agreements between TTE and Alpha Engines Corporation and completing the purchase by the Company of all patents, Intellectual Property, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, rights, title, and interest for both (1) the DCGT engine technology; and (2) the electromagnetic process and apparatus for converting methane gas to liquid methanol, on a low-volume scale, also referred to as the Gas-to-Liquid process technology. Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreements, all royalty payments due by TTE to Alpha Engines were settled with no future royalty payments due. TTE owns the DCGT engine technology free and clear.


	 


	Since taking ownership of the DCGT technology, TTE has had discussions with several North American based engineering firms to re-initiate research and development of the DCGT engine technology for applications directly related to turning a shaft for power generation; however, the Company is not currently engaged in a research and development contract.

	ABOUT THE DCGT ENGINE TECHNOLOGY



	 


	This patent in its simplicity makes it very unique. A detonation cycle gas turbine engine includes a turbine rotor contained in a housing. The exhaust ports of respective valve-less combustion chambers are located on opposite sides of the rotor directing combustion gases toward the turbine. The chambers are connected by a valve-less manifold fed with fuel and oxidizer. When combustible gases are detonated by an igniter in one of the combustion chambers, the back pressure from the detonation shuts off the fuel and oxidizer flow to that chamber and redirects the fuel and oxidizer to the opposite chamber, where detonation occurs. The process repeats cyclically. Power is taken off the rotor shaft mechanically or electrically.


	 


	The invention utilizes a water wheel as the turbine wheel which has blades that are positively displaced, through a blade race, by the rapid expansion of gases exiting from combustion chambers via nozzles, rather than pistons or gas turbines.


	 


	The DCGT engine design has a blower, rather than a compressor, to supply less air per horsepower hour than required by existing gas turbines or piston engines, thereby producing less exhaust gases per horsepower hour.


	 


	The blower supplies low pressure air via a single manifold to two combustion chambers simultaneously thereby requiring less work to complete a detonation cycle, resulting in higher thermos-mechanical efficiencies than gas turbines or piston engines.


	 


	The engine manifolds, combustion chambers, and ignition system has the capability of cyclically detonating fuel-air mixtures without using valves. The engine uses a fuel pump and vaporizers to gasify wet fuels prior to mixing with combustion air in the manifolds to produce complete combustion of all fuel-air mixtures in the detonation process. The engine uses a plasma arc ignition, a visibly constant illuminating plasma flame between two electrodes to detonate fuel-air mixtures and does not require critical ignition timing.


	 


	Low pressure air and fuel mixtures are detonated instantaneously–in less than one millisecond–producing high velocity shock waves that kinetically compress inert gases resulting in higher working pressures than the pressures produced in constant pressure heating utilized in gas turbine engines, and Otto and Diesel cycle piston engines.


	 


	The detonation cycle engine uses less working fluid and produces less exhaust gas per horsepower hour than Brayton cycle turbines and Otto or Diesel cycle piston engines.


	 


	Six working prototypes have been developed and constructed over the course of the last 20 years, culminating in the development of the 6th generation prototype engine which consists of two 7-inch, 8-pound turbine wheels mounted on a single shaft, driven by 4 horizontally opposed combustion chambers producing an estimated 70 horsepower at 20,000 rpm.


	 


	The DCGT engine technology includes an Electromagnetic Isothermal Combustion ("EIC") process that powers the engine. The EIC process produces complete combustion of fuel-oxidizer mixtures in cyclic detonations that negate unwanted nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide emissions. The high pressure gases produced by the detonations drive a unique turbine, producing shaft horsepower.


	 


	The EIC process enables the DCGT to operate with blower air at low static pressure, negating the necessity of compressing and preheating fuel-oxidizer mixtures prior to combustion. By eliminating the compression of fuel-oxidizer mixtures, the DCGT engine achieves higher thermal efficiencies in a simplified mechanical structure. The DCGT engine offers the following proprietary and competitive advantages over current diesel, gasoline and gas turbine engines:


	 










	·





	Air cooled - less than 2 pounds per horsepower

	COMPETITION FOR THE DCGT ENGINE TECHNOLOGY FOR POWER GENERATION



	 


	Given that certain aspects of the Company's DCGT engine technology is still under U.S. patent protection, the Company is not aware of any entity that has successfully commercialized pulse detonation cycle technology for power generation applications. Additionally, until TTE is able to successfully produce data from a prototype of an operational DCGT engine turning a shaft for power generation, it is difficult to provide qualitative comparisons of the DCGT engine technology to the myriad of other technologies available to both residential and business consumers today. Once TTE is able to successfully complete a working bench prototype and collect a myriad of acceptable data on items such as horsepower, torque, efficiency, temperatures, pressures and more, TTE will then be better positioned to identify the target market for commercialization of the DCGT engine technology for power production. At that time, TTE can then provide clarity and direction on competition considerations for our product and its target market.


	 



	PATENTS FOR THE DCGT ENGINE TECHNOLOGY



	 


	The DCGT engine technology currently has a single U. S. Patent No. 6,000,214, a novel patent with a 20-year life from the filing date of December 16, 1997. The patent was based on research and development beginning in 1984, which included the design, construction, and testing of working prototypes #1, #2, #3 and #4. The patent attorneys were Schoemaker & Mattare Ltd. TTE intends to file additional patents to protect any new developments in the engine technology.


	 



	II.

	GAS-TO-LIQUID PROCESS TECHNOLOGY




	 



	COMPANY HISTORY OF THE GAS TO LIQUID PROCESS TECHNOLOGY



	 


	In addition to the DCGT engine technology, Robert Scragg is also the inventor of an expired patent for a process in which methane gas, the primary component of natural gas, is converted into liquid methanol at low-volume production rates. Low volume is defined as 50 gallons per minute or less. This process is referred to as Gas-to-Liquid ("GTL" or "the Scragg Process").


	 


	In 1983, Robert Scragg received patent protection for his "Electromagnetic Process and Apparatus for Making Methanol". While this patent has expired, certain intellectual property and trade secrets remain intact and protected and are now owned by TTE. Mr. Scragg's 1983 patent proved that gentle oxidation of methane gas, a hydrocarbon, using precise electromagnetic activation produces methanol gas which is then condensed in the reactor chamber to form liquid methanol. The Scragg process for gas to liquid conversion provides for production of methanol on a low-volume scale using an easily transportable apparatus and system. When the inventor received his patent for the GTL process technology, he created a working GTL prototype for presentation to the U.S. Patent office. Today, that prototype no longer exists and a new prototype has to be built using the inventor's notes, drawings and data collection, along with newly gathered research information, to prove the viability of the GTL technology.

	As noted in Section I above, titled Company History of the DCGT Engine Technology, on November 14, 2014, the Company closed an Asset Purchase Agreement, with Robert and Barbara Scragg and Alpha Engines Corporation, completing the purchase, by Turbine Truck Engines, Inc. of all patents, intellectual property, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, rights, title, and interest for an electromagnetic process and apparatus for converting methane gas to methanol, the Scragg Process. While the Scragg Process patent has expired, certain intellectual property and trade secrets remain intact and protected and are now owned by TTE.


	 


	Prior to TTE completing its acquisition of Robert Scragg's GTL process technology, TTE always had an open invitation to pursue a licensing contract, with Alpha, for the development of the Scragg Process. While TTE never completed a licensing agreement for the Scragg Process, TTE's prior management did periodically pursue potential development partners.


	 


	On January 23, 2013, the Company entered into a Binding Letter of Intent ("BluGen LOI") with BluGen, Inc., a California corporation ("BluGen"), for the purpose of the joint development of a GTL bench prototype, using the trade secrets of the Scragg Process. Under the terms of the BluGen LOI, BluGen was to work with TTE, and the inventor, Robert Scragg, to recreate and expand upon the original designs created by Mr. Scragg. The BluGen LOI allowed for certain of the Scragg processes' trade secrets and data to be made available to BluGen in a phased manner as certain development milestones were achieved by BluGen. TTE never received notice, from BluGen, that the first milestone had been achieved with no real indication BluGen even undertook a coordinated effort to advance the Scragg Process technology. On October 24, 2014, TTE sent notice to BluGen terminating the January 23, 2013 Binding LOI based on non-performance by BluGen.


	 


	On June 3, 2015, TTE signed and executed a Consulting Services Agreement with Justin Dean, an individual, to retain Mr. Dean as the Project and Program Manager for Phase 1 of TTE's product development of its GTL process technology. This agreement further defined Mr. Dean's responsibilities to include conceptual design analysis, product development analysis, product commercialization analysis, business plan analysis, product application analysis, and industry use & application analysis.


	 


	On June 3, 2015, TTE signed and executed a Services Agreement with Sahoma Controlware, LLC (the "Sahoma Agreement") to provide the Company with services for the design, modeling and simulation of TTE's Gas-to-Liquid Process technology, to include the Electromagnetic Generator, Chemical Reactor and Process Gas Feed Systems products. The Sahoma Agreement's scope of work included developing individual product simulation models & analysis for flow, thermal, vibration, structural/stress and electrical while also developing simulation models for the entire GTL Reactor Process to determine maximum operational effectiveness and efficiency.


	 


	Collectively, both the Sahoma Agreement and the Dean Consulting Services Agreement were executed to provide the Company with engineering, technical and analytical expertise to validate the Company expending additional resources on the development of its Gas-to-Liquid process technology for converting methane and oxygen gas into methanol liquid at low-volume production rates.


	 


	On February 19, 2016, the Company executed Settlement Agreements with both Sahoma Controlware, LLC and Justin Dean mutually concluding both the Engineering Services Agreement, dated June 3, 2015, with Sahoma and the Consulting Services Agreement, dated June 3, 2015, with Dean. Under both Services Agreements, the Company has received certain 3D modeling, design and data sets that, while not conclusive, do provide a working baseline for continuing additional research and development to validate the GTL process technologies' operational capacity and efficiency.


	 


	Under the terms of the Settlement Agreements, the Company has no further obligation to pay Sahoma the final milestone payment of $10,824 and Dean will retain his 250,000 Rule 144 common shares issued to him under the Consulting Services Agreement.


	 


	Since executing the Settlement Agreements, the Company is in ongoing discussions with a U.S. based engineering entity as it considers the best path forward to continue research and development of its GTL low-volume production process technology. The next phase of research to validate the operational and commercial viability of the GTL process technology will require conducting additional modeling and the build of a bench prototype to collect data sets on a multitude of items including, but not limited to, yield rates, species analysis and energy balance calculations.

	Throughout the United States and the world, at sites where drilling operations are producing natural gas as a by-product, a large portion of the natural gas is being flare burned, instead of being sold, as the site is either too far from a pipeline or the accessible pipeline has no additional capacity. When taking into account cost analysis, environmental considerations and commodity pricing in today's marketplace, TTE believes the demand for an easily transportable, self-sustaining apparatus capable of converting gas to liquid, on a low-volume scale, has elevated.


	 


	As a result of the market's willingness to consider other options, besides flare burning the on-site natural gas, several companies are working to develop a low-volume, easily transportable GTL apparatus for commercialization. To date, TTE is not aware of any company that has commercialized a low-volume, unmanned, remote GTL system which has proved viable as a self-supporting, profitable business.


	 


	TTE believes today's marketplace dynamics allow for a lower volume, easily transportable GTL apparatus to address an enormous, unmet need of redirecting flare burn natural gas for conversion to methanol for commercial resale or reuse onsite even at low-volume production rates.


	 



	COMPETITION FOR THE SCRAGG PROCESS GAS TO LIQUID



	 


	To date, companies invested in converting natural gas to methanol are primarily engaged in high-volume scale production operations. The current state-of-the-art method of producing liquid methanol involves a low pressure process of preparing synthesis gas by steam reforming or partial oxidation of a gaseous hydrocarbon feedstock or by direct combination of carbon dioxide with purified hydrogen rich gases. Typically, naphtha or a natural gas feedstock is desulfurized, preheated and mixed with a superheated steam, and then reacted over a conventional catalyst in a multi-tubular reformer. After cooling, the synthesis gas is compressed to the required pressure and passed into a hot-wall converter over a low pressure methanol synthesis catalyst at a temperature ranging from 250 to 270 degrees centigrade. The crude methanol that is formed is condensed and separated from the uncondensed gases which are recycled with makeup synthesis gas and fed back into the converter.


	 


	Methanex Corp. is the world's largest producer of Methanol. To date, facilities converting gas to liquid are only focused on large scale production. The dollar cost to build and operate a high-volume scale GTL production facility is significant.


	 



	PATENTS FOR THE GAS TO LIQUID SCRAGG PROCESS



	 


	To date there are no patents or patents pending for the Gas to Liquid Scragg Process. On Feb 15, 1983, the Scragg Process for converting methane to methanol was granted patent protection under US Patent # 4,374,288. The patent has expired, however the process remains protected under Trade Secrets law.

	THE HYDROGEN PRODUCTION BURNER SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY




	 



	COMPANY HISTORY OF THE HYDROGEN PRODUCTION BURNER SYSTEM



	 


	In 2010, TTE was working with various Chinese based partners to develop its licensed DCGT engine technology for use in various applications in Asia. At that time, TTE's CEO was introduced to Falcon Power Co. Ltd. ("Falcon"), a Taiwan based business, that was developing a technology focused on converting methanol to hydrogen, on-demand, using a proprietary technology now known as the Hydrogen Production Burner System ("HPBS"). One of the potential fuel sources for the DCGT engine technology is hydrogen, thus TTE and Falcon began a diligence phase to consider a collaborative effort to blend the 2 technologies having the HPBS produce hydrogen that could then provide a hydrogen fuel source for the DCGT engine.

	Commencing in the spring of 2010 and through February 2014, the Company conducted diligence, negotiated, executed, and ultimately terminated certain contractual obligations with certain Taiwanese and/or Chinese based individuals and corporations. The Company's intentions throughout this defined period was to directly participate in commercializing the Hydrogen Production Burner System worldwide through either licensing rights or a Technology Purchase Agreement of the HPBS technology.


	 


	In September 2013, the Company was engaged in certain contracts with Energy Technology Services Co. Ltd ("ETS"), a Taiwan based corporation, for business development of the HPBS technology in Asia. Under the terms of these contracts, the Company provided ETS a total of $300,000 (CAN) to fulfill TTE's June 2013 Purchase Order with ETS, for the manufacture of a new 200m3 HPBS unit.


	 


	Throughout the fall of 2013 and into January 2014, ETS provided TTE with positive written and video status reports on the progress of the building, completion and delivery of its 200m3 HPBS unit as defined and paid for under the June 2013 Purchase Order. To date, ETS has not fulfilled its contractual obligation to deliver a new 200m3 HPBS.


	 


	In February 2014, TTE hired a Taiwan based law firm, Formosan Brothers, to represent the Company, in its pursuit of criminal fraud charges against ETS' principal partners, Chen, Chong-Ping ("Alan Chen") and Huang, Ren-Ju ("Mr. Huang"), both Taiwan citizens, for failure to deliver the newly built 200m3 HPBS unit as provided for under contract. ETS was represented to the Company as the business partners for the inventor Dr. Ching-Chang Chang ("Dr. Chang").


	 


	In Spring 2014, given that no direct evidence existed indicating Dr. Chang had knowledge of the fraud against TTE, the Company engaged in negotiations directly with the HPBS inventor for the purchase of the HPBS technology. To date, Dr. Chang claims to have title ownership of the HPBS technology. Until the Company is satisfied with both (a) title ownership of the HPBS; and (b) exactly which Taiwan individuals were engaged in fraud against the Company, any final agreement to purchase the HPBS technology is pending.


	 


	On December 25, 2015, TTE received a written ruling from the Taiwan District Prosecutor's Office declining to prosecute Alan Chen and Mr. Huang for criminal fraud.


	 


	On January 4, 2016, Formosan Brothers, on behalf of TTE, filed an appeal to the Taiwan High Prosecution Office requesting the High Court review the facts and evidence of the case and grant TTE an appeal of the lower court's decision and send the matter back to the Taiwan District Prosecutor's Office for a new investigation of the facts and evidence.


	 


	On February 1, 2016, TTE received notice that the Companies' appeal was granted and that the initial decision, dated December 25, 2015, by the Taiwan District Court prosecutor not to prosecute Alan Chen and Mr. Huang was overturned and rescinded. The case was returned to the Taiwan District Court Prosecutor with instructions to conduct a new investigation of the facts and evidence. TTE and its counsel intend to continue to pursue these charges until a final resolution is obtained.


	 


	As of December 31, 2016, TTE and its Taiwan based legal counsel, Formosan Brothers Law Firm, continue to submit briefings, attend hearings and respond to any request from the Taiwan District Court Prosecutor as the Prosecutor's office undertakes its new investigation.


	 



	ABOUT THE HYDROGEN PRODUCTION BURNER SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY



	 


	Hydrogen (H2) is an ideal fuel for combustion — it burns easily and efficiently at very high temperatures and emits pure water vapor (H2O) as its only by-product. But the gas is a difficult fuel to work with. Existing methods for transporting and storing hydrogen (namely high-pressure compression and liquefaction) are complex, inefficient, and expensive. It's also the smallest molecule in existence and tends naturally to leak; only exacerbating these problems.


	 


	The Hydrogen Production Burner System is an efficient methanol-to-hydrogen production and burner integrated technology which utilizes a steam reformation process, employs a proprietary chemical catalyst and a unique low temperature pyrolytic reaction to convert common methanol into clean-burning hydrogen gas, on-demand, for use as a fuel source to a proprietary burner assembly. The inventor of the HPBS is located in Taiwan and has been developing the technology for over 10 years.

	Having a technology available that can produce hydrogen on-demand and on-site eliminates the costly and difficult issues that surround the transportation and storage of hydrogen. Additionally, methanol (CH4O, also known as methyl alcohol or wood alcohol) is inexpensive, widely accessible, and easier to store, handle and transport. The HPBS technology provides a unique and marketable solution for those entities wanting to burn hydrogen as a thermal heat source.



	 


	The HPBS system is applicable to a wide array of industrial boilers and steam generators as well as other various residential and commercial applications. The efficiency of the HPBS technology could save the end user 30-60% on energy costs as compared to current sources of energy such as electricity, heavy oils, coal, and natural gas.


	 



	COMPETITION FOR THE HPBS TECHNOLOGY



	 


	The Company has identified a handful of competitors, including Air-Gas, that manufacture hydrogen producing generators. There are three main types of hydrogen generators, those that (a) convert methane to hydrogen through a catalyst; (b) convert water through electrolysis; and (c) convert methanol through catalysis. There are commercialized units for each method, however, to our knowledge; there are no commercialized units, like the HPBS technology that produce hydrogen from methanol, on demand, for on-site use. In that regard, the Company considers itself uniquely positioned to provide the market with a hydrogen production and burner system that is uniquely different than its competitors.


	 



	PATENTS FOR THE HPBS TECHNOLOGY



	 


	To date, the Company has no patents (nor does TTE know of any patents pending) for the HPBS technology. The catalytic process used to covert methanol to hydrogen is proprietary and to the best of the companies' knowledge stands alone in marketplace. If TTE is able to secure ownership of the HPBS technology, TTE intends to continue to develop the technology with an eye toward submitting patents for those items that are able to be patented.

CONSEQUENTLY, ALL OF THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE IN THIS FILING ARE QUALIFIED BY THESE CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE OF THE ACTUAL RESULTS OR DEVELOPMENTS.


	 


	The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and plan of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere herein. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements including information about possible or assumed results of our financial conditions, operations, plans, objectives and performance that involve risk, uncertainties and assumptions. The actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements. For example, when we indicate that we expect to increase our product sales and potentially establish additional license relationships, these are forward-looking statements. The words expect, anticipate, estimate or similar expressions are also used to indicate forward-looking statements.


	 



	For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015:



	 


	Operating Costs – During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, operating costs totaled $164,887 and $401,573, respectively. The decrease of $236,686 was mainly attributable to the decreases in research and development expenses, consulting fees and stock based compensation.


	 


	Other Income – During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, other income totaled $0 and $34,000, respectively. The decrease of $34,000 was primarily due to forgiveness of certain accounts payable in 2015.

	Interest (Income) Expense - Net - During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 net interest expense totaled $0 and $2,403,141, respectively. The decrease of $2,403,141 was primarily due to the Company converting notes payable during 2015 and fully amortizing the deferred non cash debt issuance costs.


	 


	The net loss for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was ($164,887) and ($2,770,714), respectively. The decrease of $2,605,827 was mainly attributable to decrease in interest expense, stock based compensation, net of the decrease in other income.


	 



	Liquidity and capital resources



	 


	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $164,887. In light of the continued net losses, the Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company's ability to begin operations and to achieve a level of profitability. The Company intends on financing its future development activities and its working capital needs largely from the sale of public equity securities with some additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including term notes and proceeds from sub-licensing agreements until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. The financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.


	 


	As previously mentioned, since inception, we have financed our operations largely from the sale of common stock and the issuance of notes payable. During the year ended December 31, 2016 we raised cash of $150,000 through private placements of common stock financings.


	 


	We have incurred significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $22,388,213.


	 


	We anticipate that cash used in product development and operations, especially in the marketing, production and sale of our products, may increase significantly in the future.


	 


	We will be dependent upon our existing cash, together with anticipated net proceeds from any public offering and future debt issuances and private placements of common stock and potential license fees, to finance our planned operations through the next 12 months.


	 


	Additional capital may not be available when required or on favorable terms. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to significantly reduce or refocus our operations or to obtain funds through arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain or potential markets, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities would result in ownership dilution to our existing stockholders.


	 


	On November 14, 2014, TTE executed an Asset Purchase Agreement and a Technology Sale, Transfer, Assignment Agreement for all Intellectual Property, dated October 14, 2014 (the "Asset Purchase Agreements") with Robert & Barbara Scragg and Alpha Engines, Inc., to obtain all rights, title, interest, patents, trademarks, and inventor notes for both the Detonation Cycle Gas Turbine Engine (DCGT) and Gas-to-Liquid (GTL) technologies. The purchase price of the Asset Purchase Agreement for both the DCGT & GTL technologies was 37,500 restricted common shares (reverse split adjusted). Additionally, the Company paid a Royalty payment of $1,000 towards all outstanding Royalty payments. As part of the Asset Purchase Agreement, any and all licensing agreements between the Company and the Sellers were terminated to include that any and all accrued and outstanding royalty payments or other compensation which may have been due by the Company to the Sellers thereunder was forgiven by Sellers.


	 


	Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreements, Robert & Barbara Scragg consulted with TTE for the purpose of the turnover of all applicable intellectual property, proprietary information, data, notes, hardware, pertinent material, improvements and advancements directly or indirectly related to both technologies. On November 16, 2015, upon completion of this turnover, the Scraggs were issued 12,500 shares of free trading common stock as compensation for the services provided as an independent consultant.

	In addition to the above noted consulting compensation the Asset Purchase Agreement allows for the Scraggs to receive an additional 50,000 shares of restricted common stock upon either (a) Purchaser's certification of viability, which shall be made by Purchaser using reasonable commercial standards, of either of the Detonation Cycle Gas Turbine Engine or the Gas-to-Liquid technology, which shall include at a minimum, the independent collection of data proving commercial viability or (b) commercial sales by the Purchaser, or its successors or licensees, of products embodying either of the DCGT or the GTL technology. As of December 31, 2016, no additional shares have been issued for these certain terms and conditions.


	 



	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.


	 



	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates



	 


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 


	We believe that the following critical policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our financial statements.


	 


	The Company entered into various loan agreements with a Canadian company owned by one of the Company's Directors. In accordance with the loan agreements, the Company issued shares of common stock to the Canadian company as additional costs in obtaining the financing. These shares were accounted for as contra-equity deferred non-cash debt issuance costs and were amortized as interest expense over the life of the notes which are five years. Foreign currency translation gains and losses, when material, have been recorded as other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in stockholders' deficit.


	 


	The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant utilizing certain assumptions that require judgments and estimates. These assumptions include estimates for volatility, expected term, and risk-free interest rates in determining the fair value of the stock-based awards.


	 


	The Company issues common stock, stock options and warrants to consultants for various services. Costs for these transactions are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more readily measurable. The determination requires judgment in terms of the consideration being measured.


	 


	Research and development costs are charged to operations when incurred and are included in operating expenses.

	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


	Board of Directors and Stockholders


	Turbine Truck Engines, Inc.


	Bellevue, WA


	 


	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Turbine Truck Engines, Inc. ("the Company") as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the related statements of net (loss), changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the management of Turbine Truck Engines, Inc. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


	 


	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we expressed no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	 


	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Turbine Truck Engines, Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


	 


	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2, the Company incurred a net loss of $164,887 and $2,770,714 during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	Notes to Financial Statements





	For the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015



	 



	1. Background Information



	 


	Turbine Truck Engines, Inc. ("TTE" or "the Company") was incorporated in Delaware on November 27, 2000. On February 20, 2008, the Company was re-domiciled to the State of Nevada. To date, the Company's activities have been limited to raising capital, organizational matters, engaging in research and development, testing its technology, and the structuring of its business plan. The corporate headquarters are located in Bellevue, Washington. The Company has not yet generated any revenues since inception.


	 


	To date, the Company's principal research and development operations have been directed at the potential commercialization, of its (a) Detonation Cycle Gas Turbine Engine technology ("DCGT"); its (b) Gas-to-Liquid Conversion Process technology ("GTL"); and the (c) Hydrogen Production Burner System ("HPBS"). In addition, the Company continues to conduct diligence to either purchase or merge an intellectual property asset and/or an existing operational company asset.


	 


	On January 2, 2017, TTE entered into a non-binding Letter-of-Intent (the “LOI”) with Novo Healthnet Limited (“NHL”), a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Ontario, Canada, pursuant to which TTE and NHL agreed to pursue, in good-faith, negotiations for the entry into a definitive agreement for the acquisition, by TTE, of all of the issued and outstanding shares of NHL, such that NHL would become a wholly owned foreign subsidiary of the Company.


	 


	On May 5, 2015 TTE completed a one-for-twenty (1:20) reverse split of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share. All common shares and options to purchase common shares have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this reverse split.


	 



	2. Going Concern



	 


	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $164,887 with no revenues generated to date. In view of these matters, the Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company's ability to begin operations and to achieve a level of profitability. The Company intends on financing its future development activities and its working capital needs largely from the sale of public equity securities with some additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including term notes and proceeds from sub-licensing agreements until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. The financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.


	 



	3. Significant Accounting Policies



	 


	The significant accounting policies followed are:


	 


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 


	Cash is maintained at financial institutions and, at times, balances may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has never experienced any losses related to these balances. All of the Company's non-interest bearing cash balances were fully insured at December 31, 2016 and 2015. Insurance coverage was $250,000 per depositor at each financial institution. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no amounts held in excess of federally insured limits.







	 




	F-6







	 






	Table of Contents






	 


	The Company's financial instruments include cash and accounts payable. The carrying amounts of cash and accounts payable approximate their fair value, due to the short-term nature of these items.


	 


	The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets or asset groups whenever adverse events or changes in business climate indicate that the expected undiscounted future cash flows from the related assets may be less than previously anticipated. If the net book value of the related assets exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows of the assets, the carrying amount would be reduced to the present value of their expected future cash flows and an impairment loss would be recognized. There have been no impairment losses in any of the periods presented.


	 


	Research and development costs are charged to operations when incurred and are included in operating expenses. The Company incurred $0 and $25,256 of research and development costs for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.


	 


	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences associated with differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as measured by the enacted tax rates, which are expected to be in effect when these differences reverse. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as current or non-current, depending on the classification of the assets or liabilities to which they relate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities not related to an asset or liability are classified as current or non-current depending on the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The principal types of temporary differences between assets and liabilities for financial statements and tax return purposes are set forth in Note 6.


	 


	The Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 740-10 "

	Uncertainty in Income Taxes

	" (ASC 740-10), January 1, 2007. The Company has not recognized a liability as a result of the implementation of ASC 740-10. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits has not been provided since there are no unrecognized benefits at December 31, 2016 or 2015. The Company has not recognized interest expense or penalties as a result of the implementation of ASC 740-10. If there were an unrecognized tax benefit, the Company would recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses.


	   


	The Company entered into various loan agreements with a Canadian company. In accordance with the loan agreements, the Company issued shares of common stock to the Canadian company as additional costs in obtaining the financing. These shares have been accounted for as contra-equity deferred non-cash offering issuance costs and they have been amortized as interest expense over the life of the notes which is five years. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses, when material, have been recorded as other income or loss. For the year ended December 31, 2015 the Company recorded a foreign currency transaction gain of $88,791. As of December 31, 2015, the Canadian company converted all outstanding notes payable and related accrued interest into common stock, therefore, the remaining balance of the deferred non-cash offering issuance costs has been recorded as interest expense for approximately $2,403,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015.


	 


	Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted losses per common share are computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding and dilutive options outstanding during the year. Common stock equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were anti-dilutive due to the net losses sustained by the Company during these periods. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 potentially dilutive common stock options and warrants of 5,610,000 and 4,600,000 have been excluded from dilutive losses per share due to the Company's losses in all periods presented.


	 


	The Company recognizes all share-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of employee stock options, as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values. That expense will be recognized over the period during which an employee or director is required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). Options issued for past services are vested immediately and are expensed at the time of issuance.


	 


	The Company issues common stock and common stock options and warrants to consultants for various services. For these transactions, the Company follows the guidance in FASB ASC Topic 505. Costs for these transactions are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measureable. The value of the common stock is measured at the earlier of (i) the date at which a firm commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instrument is reached or (ii) the date at which the counterparty's performance is complete.

	Recent accounting pronouncements




	 


	Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its EITF), the AICPA, and the SEC did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.


	 



	4. Options and warrants



	 


	On September 8, 2015, the Company adopted the 2015 Incentive Compensation Plan ("the 2015 Plan") which authorizes up to 5,000,000 shares of common stock issuance to certain employees and consultants as defined in the 2015 Plan and approved by the Company's Board of Directors.


	 


	The 2015 Plan authorizes up to 5,000,000 shares of common stock issuance to persons employed by the Company either as an employee, officer, director or independent consultant or other person employed by the Company, provided that no person can be granted shares under the 2015 Plan for services related to raising capital or promotional activities. There are no restrictions on resale upon the purchases of the stock from the employees or the consultants, unless contained in the written award approved by the Board of Directors, or otherwise as provided by law. During 2016 and 2015, the Company did not grant any common stock options or warrants to consultants, directors and employees under the 2015 Plan. As of December 31, 2016, 4,987,500 shares are available under the 2015 Plan for future grants, awards, options or share issuance.


	 


	The fair value of each option granted was estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes model that uses assumptions noted in the following table. Expected volatility is based on the Company's historical market price at consistent points in periods equal to the expected life of the options. The expected term of options granted is based on the Company's historical experience. The risk-free interest rate for the periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The Company estimates forfeitures; both at the date of grant as well as throughout the requisite service period, based on the Company's historical experience and future expectations.


	 


	The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2016, based on the Company's closing stock price of $0.24 was $440,000 and $400,000, respectively. Intrinsic value is the amount by which the fair value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the options.


	 


	On September 16, 2016, 50,000 options were granted to the Company’s Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer for past services. These options were issued outside of the 2015 Plan, have an exercise price of $0.50, fully vested on the grant date, expire 5 years from the date of grant and have a grant date fair value of $0.42.


	 


	During the year ended December 31, 2016, 1,000,000 options were granted to the Company’s President, Secretary, Treasurer and Board Director for future services to be provided to the Company, through December 31, 2017, as defined in the Future Services Agreement dated February 19, 2016. These options were issued outside of the 2015 Plan and have an exercise price of $0.16 per share. The grant date fair value of these options was $0.03 per share. 500,000 of these options vested immediately and expire five years from date of grant. Additionally, 500,000 options vest on the first anniversary of the grant date and expire five years from that date.


	  


	The weighted average assumptions made in calculating the fair value of options granted during the year ended December 31, 2016 are as follows:

Stock based compensation was $50,306 and $327,604 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2016 there was $2,236 of unrecognized stock based compensation, which will be recognized during 2017.


	 



	5. Commitments and Contingencies



	 


	Effective July 1, 2015, the Company moved its headquarters to 11120 NE 2

	nd

	Street, Suite 200, Bellevue, WA 98004 on a month-to-month basis. Through June 30, 2015, the Company leased its previous corporate headquarters on a month-to-month basis with a monthly rental cost of $436. For the year ended December 31, 2015 total rent expense was approximately $2,173.


	 


	During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company hired a Taiwan based law firm, Formosan Brothers, to represent the Company, in its pursuit of criminal fraud charges against ETS' principal partners, Chen, Chong-Ping ("Alan Chen") and Huang, Ren-Ju ("Mr. Huang"), both Taiwan citizens, for failure to deliver the newly built 200m3 HPBS unit as provided for under contract. ETS was represented to the Company as the business partners for the inventor Dr. Ching-Chang Chang ("Dr. Chang").


	 


	On June 3, 2015, TTE signed and executed a Services Agreement with Sahoma Controlware, LLC ("Sahoma") to provide the Company with services for the design, modeling and simulation of Turbine Truck Engine's Gas-to-Liquid ("GTL") Process technology for converting Methane and Oxygen Gas into Methanol Liquid. The contract cash price to complete the design, modeling and simulation as defined under this Phase 1 agreement is $36,080 with payment determined by three separate milestones as follows: (1) $10,824 paid to Sahoma Controlware, on June 3, 2015, upon executing the services agreement (Milestone #1); (2) $14,432 paid to Sahoma on September 11, 2015 upon Sahoma having submitted initial design & modeling documents (Milestone #2); and (3) $10,824, to be paid upon submission, by Sahoma to the Company of all final design, modeling and simulation documents, drawings and electronic files (Milestone #3). As of December 31, 2015, Milestone #3 had not yet occurred. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized $25,256 in research and development expense related to the agreement. Subsequent to year end, the Company terminated this agreement. On February 19, 2016, the Company executed Settlement Agreements with both Sahoma and Justin Dean, under which the Company has no further obligation to pay Sahoma the Milestone payment of $10,824.


	 


	During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with a contractor to provide consulting services for a six-month period in exchange for 250,000 shares of common stock valued at $15,000, which represented the fair value of the common stock at the commitment date. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company has recognized $0 and $15,000, respectively, of consulting expenses.


	 


	The Company has entered into various other agreements that have been disclosed in previous 10-K and 10-Q filings. These agreements have been either terminated or put on hold and may be reinitiated based on both adequate funding and a viable product development and commercialization plan being approved by the Companies' new Board of Directors.

	On November 14, 2014, TTE executed an Asset Purchase Agreement and a Technology Sale, Transfer, Assignment Agreement for all Intellectual Property, dated October 14, 2014 (the "Asset Purchase Agreements") with Robert & Barbara Scragg and Alpha Engines, Inc., to obtain all rights, title, interest, patents, trademarks, and inventor notes for both the Detonation Cycle Gas Turbine Engine (DCGT) and Gas-to-Liquid (GTL) technologies. The purchase price of the Asset Purchase Agreement for both the DCGT & GTL technologies was 37,500 restricted common shares. Additionally, the Company paid a Royalty payment of $1,000 towards all outstanding Royalty payments. As part of the Asset Purchase Agreement, any and all licensing agreements between the Company and the Sellers were terminated to include that any and all accrued and outstanding royalty payments or other compensation which may have been due by the Company to the Sellers thereunder was forgiven by Sellers.


	 


	Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreements, Robert & Barbara Scragg consulted with TTE for the purpose of the turnover of all applicable intellectual property, proprietary information, data, notes, hardware, pertinent material, improvements and advancements directly or indirectly related to both technologies. On November 16, 2015, upon completion of this turnover, the Scraggs were issued 12,500 shares of free trading common stock valued at $625 and recorded as consulting expense in the accounting financial statements.


	 


	In addition to the above noted consulting compensation the Asset Purchase Agreement allows for the Scraggs to receive an additional 50,000 shares of restricted common stock upon either (a) Purchaser's certification of viability, which shall be made by Purchaser using reasonable commercial standards, of either of the Detonation Cycle Gas Turbine Engine or the Gas-to-Liquid technology, which shall include at a minimum, the independent collection of data proving commercial viability or (b) commercial sales by the Purchaser, or its successors or licensees, of products embodying either of the DCGT or the GTL technology. As of December 31, 2016, no additional shares have been issued for these certain terms and conditions.


	 



	6. Income Taxes



	 


	Deferred taxes are recorded for all existing temporary differences in the Company's assets and liabilities for income tax and financial reporting purposes. Due to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, as noted below, there was no net deferred tax benefit or expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.


	 


	There is no current or deferred income tax expense or benefit allocated to continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 or 2015.


	 


	The provision for income taxes is different from that which would be obtained by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before income taxes. The items causing this difference are as follows:

	Since Company management anticipates it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not provide future benefit, the Company has established a 100 percent valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.


	 


	As of December 31, 2015, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards totaling approximately $616,000 which begin expiring in 2023.


	 


	We are subject to income tax audits by the Internal Revenue Service and the State of Florida for the years 2013 – 2016.


	 



	7. Related Party Transactions



	 


	On July 30, 2013, the Company signed an Agreement with 2367416 Ontario, Inc., a Canadian company ("236"), whereby 236 agrees to provide financing to the Company in the initial sum of CAN $450,000 and a maximum of CAN $10,000,000 in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. The financing provided was to be funded in tranches with terms between three (3) and five (5) years, with each tranche being separately negotiated. As a part of the loan costs, 236 was issued Rule 144 restricted common stock equal to the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company at the time of the initial advance. These shares were considered an additional cost in obtaining the financing and the value of these shares at the commitment date was recorded as a contra equity and amortized to interest expense over five years.


	 


	On August 13, 2014, the Company appointed Enzo Cirillo, a majority shareholder in the Company, as its Chairman of the Board and Interim Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Cirillo is the sole principle partner for 2367416 Ontario, Inc. As disclosed above, 236 previously funded the Company through certain convertible notes, all of which converted during 2015, as disclosed below.


	 


	On March 16, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors accepted an offer from 236 to irrevocably convert eight separate Loan Agreements dated from June 19, 2013 through October 1, 2014, payable by the Company to 236 with a cumulative principal balance of $499,585 and a cumulative accrued interest balance of $69,075 for a total amount of debt owed of $568,660 into 2,369,675 shares of the Company's common stock. The conversion price in this transaction was $0.24 per share. At the commitment date, the conversion was not beneficial to 236, accordingly no beneficial conversion feature was recorded for these notes. This conversion of debt into shares of common stock was full and final payment for the debt as evidenced by all eight Loan Agreements. The shares were issued on March 18, 2015. As part of the conversion of debt to common stock, at the March 16, 2015 conversion date, the Company also expensed the unamortized deferred non-cash offering costs of $2,379,075 to interest expense.


	 


	During the year ended December 31, 2016, 2367416 Ontario, Inc. purchased 343,750 shares of common stock at $0.16 per share for cash proceeds of $55,000, purchased 60,000 shares of common stock at $0.25 per share for cash proceeds of $15,000, purchased 27,777 shares of common stock at $0.54 for cash proceeds of $15,000, purchased 35,714 shares of common stock at $0.42 for cash proceeds of $15,000 and purchased 192,308 shares of common stock at $0.26 for cash proceeds of $50,000, providing the Company gross cash proceeds of $150,000.


	 


	The above terms and amounts are not necessarily indicative of the terms and amounts that would have been incurred had comparable transactions been entered into with independent parties.

	8. Convertible Preferred Stock



	 


	On March 16, 2012, the Company created the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock ("Series A"). The Series A has the following features:


	 








	·





	Par value is $.001.










	 









	·





	25,000 shares authorized.

















	·





	Voting rights on each matter submitted to common shareholders; 306 votes per each share of preferred stock held.

















	·





	Convertible after 6 months from the above date on a ratio of one-to-one into common shares at the option of the preferred share holder.





	 


	Effective December 19, 2014, the Company filed a Certificate of Change with the Nevada Secretary of State to amend the Company's Articles of Incorporation to (a) terminate the designation of 25,000 shares of its Series "A" Convertible Preferred Stock and (b) clarify that the Company's authorized stock remains 499,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 and 1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.001. Additionally, the Company terminated the designation of 17,500 shares of its Series "B" Preferred stock, previously approved by the Company's Board of Directors on June 18, 2014.


	 


	With the Company terminating both the Series "A" Convertible Preferred and the Series "B" Preferred designations, the Company maintains its current authorized class of 1,000,000 Preferred shares with no Series designation being authorized, issued or outstanding at December 31, 2016 and 2015.


	 



	9. Other Income



	 


	Other income for the year ended December 31, 2015 consists of a gain on the forgiveness of legal and professional fees of $34,000.


	 



	10. Subsequent Events



	 


	On January 2, 2017, TTE entered into a non-binding Letter-of-Intent (the “LOI”) with Novo Healthnet Limited (“NHL”), a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Ontario, Canada, pursuant to which TTE and NHL agreed to pursue, in good-faith, negotiations for the entry into a definitive agreement for the acquisition, by TTE, of all of the issued and outstanding shares of NHL, such that NHL would become a wholly owned foreign subsidiary of the Company. Prior to closing a definitive agreement for the TTE and NHL acquisition transaction, provisions allow for TTE to raise US$3,000,000, with the option for TTE to extend the raise up to US$6,000,000, via private placement. These funds will be held in escrow and and will only be made available to TTE and NHL upon the closing of a definitive agreement transaction between TTE and NHL. If a definitve agreement transaction is not closed then all funds will be returned to the offering investors with no interest accrued and at no expense to the investors.

	Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	 


	The Company's Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2016. Based upon such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2016, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as required under Rules 13a – 15(e) and 15d – 15(e) under the Exchange Act. This conclusion by the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer does not relate to reporting periods after December 31, 2016.


	 




	Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting




	 


	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rue 13a-15(f) and 15d – 15(f) of the Exchange Act) of the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


	 


	The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.


	 


	Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.


	 


	Management, under the supervision of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

	2013 Internal control – Integrated Framework

	issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2016 under the criteria set forth in the

	2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework

	.


	 


	A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has determined that material weaknesses exist due to a lack of formalized controls and procedures as well as a lack of segregation of duties, as well as the absence of an independent audit committee chair, resulting from the Company's limited resources.


	 




	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting




	 


	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	On September 8, 2015, the Company adopted the 2015 Incentive Compensation Plan ("the 2015 Plan") which authorizes up to 5,000,000 shares of common stock issuance to certain employees and consultants as defined in the 2015 Plan and approved by the Company's Board of Directors. The 2015 Plan authorizes issuance to persons employed by the Company either as an employee, officer, director or independent consultant or other person employed by the Company, provided that no person can be granted shares under the 2015 Plan for services related to raising capital or promotional activities. Upon issuance of common stock under the 2015 Plan, there are no restrictions on resale of the stock unless contained in the written award approved by the Board of Directors. During 2016 and 2015, the Company did not grant any common stock warrants or options from the 2015 Plan. As of December 31, 2016, 4,987,500 shares are available under the 2015 Plan for future grants, awards, options or share issuance.

	4.


	The registrant’s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a – 15(f) and 15d – 15(f)) for the registrant and have:





	 




	 










	 



	a)


	Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;





	 




	 




	 






	 



	b)


	Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;





	 




	 




	 






	 



	c)


	Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and





	 




	 




	 






	 



	d)


	Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant’s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant’s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of the annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting; and





	 




	 




	 









	5.


	The registrant’s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant’s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant’s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):





	 




	 










	 



	a)


	All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and





	 




	 




	 






	 



	b)


	Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting.

BELLEVUE, Wash., Jan. 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Turbine Truck Engines, Inc., a Nevada corporation (OTCQB:TTEG) ('the Company" or "TTE"), announces it has entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent, dated January 2, 2017, to acquire one hundred percent of the shares of Novo Healthnet Limited ("Novo"), a limited company incorporated under the laws of Ontario, Canada, in exchange for eighty-five percent of the equity in TTE. Novo, through its existing network of clinics and affiliates, is one of Canada's largest Ancillary Health Service providers of physiotherapy, occupational therapy, chiropractic medicine and massage therapy. Novo is represented nationally by a network of over 140 clinics staffed and administered by licensed health care professionals, as well as over 130 Long Term Care and Retirement Homes for which Novo provides rehabilitation services.








A closing of the contemplated transaction is preconditioned on the negotiation and execution of definitive binding agreements which will include customary closing conditions including the completion of due diligence by the parties.  
Novo's long-term growth business model is centered on efficient whole health medicine through Integrative Healthcare. Novo has recently secured (1) a business partnership with a licensed producer and distributor of medical cannabis products; and (2) exclusive distribution rights to an on-line virtual physician access system. With over 300,000 patients in Canada, Novo Healthnet Limited is ideally positioned for patient on-site activation into progressive treatment solutions. The Integrative Healthcare model will allow patients seeking diagnosis, treatment and maintenance to experience the one center solution without compromising the traditional primary care physician platform.
Enzo Cirillo, TTE's Interim CEO and Board Chairman, states, "Novo's Integrative Healthcare platform model presents patients with an advanced physician access system that provides appropriate diagnostic outcomes leading to the controlled access to traditional as well as cannabinoid medication. The TTE Board of Directors recognizes the Novo solution as not only a Canadian solution but as a global answer to primary and ancillary Integrative Healthcare providing TTE with immediate revenue."
Amanda Dalcourt, Novo's CEO, states, "This acquisition marks a new and exciting chapter into the continued development of what Novo believes to be the ideal patient based solution to an ever changing primary and ancillary care model. The emphasis on innovative medicine with practical and efficient delivery is the only way that we as healthcare professionals can ensure that an aging and growing population can receive the healthcare that will maximize the opportunity for optimal quality of life." Amanda Dalcourt is a registered Physiotherapist, a member of the Ontario College of Physiotherapists, a former winner of the Northern Ontario Entrepreneur of the Year and a co-author of several books.

BELLEVUE, Wash., May 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Turbine Truck Engines, Inc., a Nevada corporation (OTCQB: TTEG) (the "Company" or "TTE"), is pleased to announce the signing of a definitive Share Exchange Agreement, dated April 25, 2017, (the "SEA") with the shareholders of Novo Healthnet Limited, an Ontario province, Canada corporation ("NHL" or "Novo").








The SEA provides for delivery, by NHL shareholders to TTE, of 100% of the outstanding common and preferred shares of NHL in exchange for the delivery, by TTE to the NHL shareholders, of 85% of TTE's common stock, on a fully-diluted basis representing all TTE outstanding common and preferred shares, options and warrants at the time of closing the SEA. The TTE Board of Directors has approved the Share Exchange Agreement. Upon closing of the SEA, Novo will be a 100% owned foreign subsidiary of TTE. Completion of the share exchange, pursuant to the SEA, is contingent to satisfaction of certain conditions. 
Novo Healthnet Limited ("Novo") owns a 100% interest in Novo Assessments, Inc., Novo Healthnet Rehab Limited, Novo Peak Health, Inc. and an 80% interest in Novo Healthnet Kemptville Centre, Inc. (collectively the "Novo Family") all of which are Ontario province, Canada corporations.
Novo's business model for growth is centered on efficient whole health medicine through integration of healthcare, medical sciences and technology. The Novo integrated healthcare model will allow patients seeking medical diagnosis, treatment, products and maintenance to experience the one center solution without compromising the traditional primary care physician platform.
Centralization, through the implementation of the latest hardware and software technology, is a core pillar of Novo Healthcare Limited's integrated business strategy to advance and expand the Novo Family's presence and business model both in Canada and worldwide. Novo's emphasis on providing access to primary care medical solutions through virtual technology allows for centralization of services to occur on a micro footprint level while providing healthcare solutions to remote and small population areas as well as underserved populations in dense urban areas.
Upon closing the SEA, Turbine Truck Engines will commence shifting its business operations and mission statement away from developing innovations for the energy sector and environmental conservation and will instead focus its resources and business operations on implementation of Novo's model of integrated healthcare, technology and medical science.

(TTEG.OB) is indexed on Standard & Poor's (S&P)       	   	 FACT: Each year, 700,000 new and replacement truck engines are sold in America, typically within the $13,500 to $25,000 price range.  It's a market valued at more than 12 Billion Dollars Annually.  	In America alone, there are currently over 5,000,000 heavy-duty highway trucks in use. This means that every day, over 5,000,000 big engines emit harmful gasses that pollute our air, contribute to smog and global warming, and pose serious health risks to humans. State and federal governments have recently begun taking action by passing tough new legislation that strictly limits harmful engine exhaust gas emissions and requires refiners to produce virtually sulfer-free diesel fuel. The problem: current truck engine technologies cannot meet these new requirements, though they will apply to all new and replacement engines built in as early as 2006. New engine technology is a necessity.  TTEG's Patented Technology... is set to REVOLUTIONIZE the truck engine market.  Clean Air Technology   Turbine Truck Engines, Inc. is a technology company dedicated to the development of its New Environmental Age Truck Engine for mass market in the U.S. and abroad. Our revolutionary new engine design can utilize any fuel (gasoline, diesel, propane, natural gas, hydrogen, methanol, or ethanol) or fuel mixture, yet needs no coolant, lube oil, filters, or pumps. This unique, light weight turbine design has few moving parts, thus requiring less maintenance. Our innovative cyclic detonation process produces complete combustion of fuel-oxidation mixtures, resulting in greater fuel economy and fewer harmful exhaust emmissions than any other practical engine design in the world today. In development since 1984, our technology has been demonstrated in four experimental prototype engines and was recently awarded a United States Engine Patent.  	       					The DCGT is the only modern heavy-duty truck engine design in development that can effectively meet the unique environmental and economical challenges of the new century.   ZERO nitrogen oxide (NO, NO2, N2O2) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions (using hydrogen)  						uses 30% less fuel than current engine technologies  						has no pistons or valves, and uses no lube oil, filters or pumps  						operates on all fuels: hydrocarbon, hydrogen and synthetic  						has flex-fuel and mixed fuels capability  						has few moving parts, requiring less maintenance  						has a high power-to-weight ratio  						is lightweight (less than 2 lbs. per hp)  						is air cooled  						has cold start capability        						It's the solution to rising fuel costs  						It's the solution to needed improvement in fuel efficiency  						It's the solution to government restrictions on fuel emissions  						It's the solution to the advancement of alternate fuels  						It's the solution to the concern over global warming and environmental quality       	   	About Frost and Sullivan: http://www.frost.com/prod/servlet/frost-home.pag 	About The Award: http://www.marketwire.com/mw/release.do?id=784415  Recent Press Releases    Hydrogen Powered Turbine Test Proves Successful Wednesday September 17, 9:06 am ET  	   DELAND, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Turbine Truck Engines, Inc.

The DCGT engine is powered by an innovative new electromagnetic isothermal combustion process that produces complete combustion of fuel-oxidizer mixtures in cyclic detonations.
The high-pressure gasses produced by these detonations drive a unique turbine producing shaft horsepower. The engine’s unique combustion process allows the DCGT to operate with blower air at low static pressure, negating the necessity of compressing and preheating fuel-oxidizer mixtures prior to combustion. Once the compression of fuel-oxidizer mixtures has been eliminated, the engine both achieves higher thermal efficiency in a simplified mechanical structure, and provides significant advantages over current diesel, gasoline, and gas turbine engines.
