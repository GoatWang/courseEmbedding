Request A CatalogIf you are looking for versatile seating, a sofa and loveseat set are the perfect combination of style and function. The sofa can seat anywhere from 3 to 5 and the loveseat can fit two comfortably. So you can easily seat 5 to 8 with a sofa loveseat pair.
You don’t need to compromise on style either. Get a leather sofa and love seat and mix it with other fabrics and items in your room to make a statement. Or have your leather loveseat sofa set be the focal point and design your room around them. With Bassett’s large selection of sofas and love seats, getting the exact look you are going for is simple!
For a traditional parlor look, our sofa and loveseat is a good choice. With a camel-back frame and optional turned legs or skirt, it is both functional and fashionable. Or for something more regal, the leather loveseat and sofa set is a good choice. With plush, hand rubbed leather, this sofa and loveseat set has a classic old world flair to upgrade any room.
Check out Bassett Furniture’s selection of sofas and love seats! Or, shop by sofa and loveseat style and fabric.Related ProductsSofa Recliner SofasFeatures & Design TipsSofa and Loveseat Layout IdeasLiving Room Design Help from HGTV

Bedroom FurnitureView Our CatalogEveryone needs a place where you can get away after a long, hard days’ work.  With Basset’s wide selection of bedroom furniture and bedroom furniture sets, you can create the perfect place to unwind and rest.  Basset offers the finest in luxury bedroom furniture and our highly skilled staff can help you find the perfect bedroom set to suit your taste and price point. We offer everything from contemporary to traditional bedroom furniture, along with everything in between.
Consider a theme or period before you begin your bedroom furniture shopping. Do you prefer a contemporary or traditional look? Rustic, modern or cottage? When looking for individual bedroom furniture pieces, this is an imperative. It will affect the colors and finishes you choose. Make sure you measure the room before you floor plan and remember that you’ll be living with your new bedroom furniture every day so don’t forget about functionality. For example, you may wish to choose furniture that provides additional storage space.
Choose from complete, matching bedroom furniture sets to individual bedroom furniture pieces, depending on your preference and budget. While mixing and matching bedroom furniture can be an enjoyable experience for some, others may prefer the convenience of purchasing and entire matching bedroom set. Either way, a Bassett associate is ready and able to assist you.
We spend more time in the bedroom than any other room in the home. And while our beds are the most important element to this room, don’t overlook the importance of bedroom furniture such as nightstands, wall mirrors, armoires, dressers and other accessories in making your living space comfortable. Shop from our wide selection of bedroom accessories and accent pieces to make your bedroom space complete.
Let’s not forget mattresses. Whether you prefer a very firm mattress or a mattress that contours to your body shape and type, you’ll find the one that best suits you at Bassett. We offer a wide variety of top manufacturers such as Sealy, Serta and Sterns & Foster, just to name a few. You’ll find plush mattresses, pillow tops – you name it, priced to move and within your budget. Additionally, we carry designer bedding including mattress covers, quilts, blankets, and throw pillows in colors and patterns that are sure to match your bedroom decor.
Finally, Bassett offers a great selection of decorative wall art for your bedroom, living room or anywhere within your home. Color alone can reflect and attitude or make a bold statement, so consider the type of environment you wish to create before selecting wall art. Remember that pastels create a peaceful environment while hot colors create and entirely different kind of feng shui or vibe.
Our bedroom furniture features classic looks that never go out of style. If you are into more modern style, we have the perfect combination of casual, elegant, and natural looking bedroom-furniture.  Whatever you are looking for Basset furniture can help create the look you envision. Come in and visit us in our stores to look at the extensive bedroom furniture collections we carry.Related ProductsAccent FurnitureNightstandsFeatures & Design TipsBedroom TipsContemporary Bedroom IdeasModern Bedroom Ideas

CPSC, Bassett Furniture Reach Consent Agreement Over Crib Hazards
































FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 


February 14, 1980
 


Release # 80-006


 



WASHINGTON, D.C. (February 14) -- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission provisionally has accepted a consent agreement with Bassett Furniture Industries, Inc., involving two crib styles that could pose a life-threatening strangulation hazard to infants.
The terms of the agreement require Bassett to undertake an extensive remedial action program and to pay a $175,000 civil penalty. The firm estimates that the cost of the program, including the civil penalty, could be as high as $1 million.
The Commission provisionally approved the consent agreement on February 7 by a 3-2 vote, with Commissioners Zagoria and Statler dissenting. Both dissenting Commissioners believe that the amount of the civil penalty levied should be greater. (A copy of the dissent is attached.)
Bassett Furniture Industries, Inc., of Bassett, Virginia, is the manufacturer of the "Candlelite" and "Mandalay" style cribs which reported have caused six infant deaths since 1977.
CPSC staff believes that the crib design is such that infants can trap their heads between a corner post and the headboard (or footboard) and strangle as they stand on the crib mattress.
The agreement pertains to the "Mandalay" crib models 5126-505, 5621-505 and 5225-505, and to "Candlelite" models 5028-505, 5028-510, 5127-505 and 5127-510. The model numbers can be found on an adhesive label affixed to the inside of the headboard below the mattress level.
The "Mandalay" cribs were manufactured from February, 1974, through October, 1976, and sold nationwide for approximately $100 to $125 in retail stores. The "Candlelite" cribs sold for approximately $100 nationwide, and were produced from December, 1975, to mid-October, 1977.
Consumers who own one of these cribs which has not yet been modified immediately should contact Bassett to obtain a free repair kit or instructions for eliminating the hazard. Consumers can contact Bassett at its toll-free number l-800-336-5223. (In Virginia, consumers should place a collect telephone call to Bassett at (703) 629-7511, extension 340).
In its proposed complaint against Bassett, CPSC staff alleged that the two crib styles pose a substantial risk of strangulation injuries or death to infants. CPSC staff alleged that the firm knew as early as September, 1977 that its "Candlelite" cribs could cause strangulation deaths of infants, but that Bassett did not notify CPSC staff of the potential hazard as required by law. The complaint also alleged that Bassett knew (or should have known) in March, 1978 that the "Mandalay" cribs could present a strangulation hazard but failed to report to CPSC staff. In entering into the consent agreement, Bassett does not admit that it had an obligation to report, that reportable information exists, or that the product presented a substantial hazard.
Bassett had been undertaking corrective action since February, 1978 to locate and modify the potentially hazardous cribs. Despite its efforts, approximately 4,700 "Mandalay" style cribs (out of an estimated 5,800 produced) and about 400 "Candlelite" cribs (of 1,654 produced) still may not have been modified to eliminate the hazard.
The central part of the consent agreement requires Bassett to take the unprecedented step of sending hazard notifications by direct mail to all parents who have had children within the previous 21 months. This mailing is expected to include more than four million parents of infants and young children.
In addition, Bassett will purchase advertising space in "TV Guide" and "Family Circle" magazines, in which they will run l/2-page advertisements warning consumers of the potential crib hazard. These magazines have a combined total readership of more than 27 million people.
As an added incentive to consumers, Bassett will pay a $5 cash award to anyone who identifies the location of an unmodified crib, once its repair has been verified.
Bassett further has agreed to mail posters which describe the crib hazard and the needed safety modification to all obstetricians and gynecologists practicing in the U.S., as well as to all pediatric and maternity clinics, for display in their offices. As part of its earlier voluntary corrective action with CPSC, Bassett already has distributed posters to approximately 25,000 pediatricians and to some medical clinics.
In addition, Bassett agreed to pay a civil penalty of $175,000 settlement of CPSC staff's allegation that the firm failed promptly to report the alleged defect in the cribs. The Commission will vote whether to give final approval to the agreement following a seven-day public comment period which opens on February 14, when the agreement is published in the Federal Register. Interested persons should submit their written comments by no later than February 21 to CPSC's Office of the Secretary, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, D.C., 20207.
The Commission will consider all comments in deciding whether to give final approval to the agreement.

Dissenting Opinion Of
			Commissioner Sam Zagoria
			(Joined In By Commissioner Stuart Statler)
			 



The Corrective Action Plan negotiated by our staff with Bassett Furniture Industries is a good one.
I regret that a majority of the Commission has decided to choose the option of approving the plan and accepting a civil penalty of only $175,000 for failure to report in a timely manner, as required by law, the existence of two substantial product hazards. The other option of approving the very same Corrective Action Plan and issuing a complaint consisting of two counts because of the styles of cribs involved with a potential fine of up to $1,000,000 is a more appropriate one. This is a case allegedly involving the non-reporting of an infant death and other serious incidents by a firm which describes itself as the "world's largest Furniture Manufacturer" with reported annual sales of $281,000,000. I recognize that litigation is fraught with uncertainties. But here, where an infant strangled to death, protection of consumers would be better served by seeking a higher penalty.
As a point of reference, Corning Glass Works paid a $325,000 civil penalty in a 1976 case where there were no deaths. On balance, I would have chosen to issue a complaint against Bassett and sought a fine larger than $175,000.




 
 




 




The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death associated with the use of
          thousands of types of consumer products under the agency’s jurisdiction. Deaths, injuries, and property damage from consumer product incidents cost the
          nation more than $1 trillion annually. CPSC is committed to protecting consumers and families from products that pose a fire, electrical, chemical or
          mechanical hazard. CPSC's work to help ensure the safety of consumer products - such as toys, cribs, power tools, cigarette lighters and household
          chemicals -– contributed to a decline in the rate of deaths and injuries associated with consumer products over the past 40 years.
Federal law bars any person from selling products subject to a publicly-announced voluntary recall by a manufacturer or a mandatory recall ordered by the
          Commission.
To report a dangerous product or a product-related injury go online to www.SaferProducts.gov or call CPSC's Hotline at 800-638-2772 or teletypewriter at
          301-595-7054 for the hearing impaired. Consumers can obtain news release and recall information at www.cpsc.gov, on Twitter @USCPSC or by subscribing
          to CPSC's free e-mail newsletters.

Bassett Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2008 Results
BASSETT, Va., Feb 11, 2009 (GlobeNewswire via COMTEX News Network) -- Bassett Furniture Industries Inc. (Nasdaq:BSET) announced today its results of operations for its fiscal year and quarter ended November 29, 2008. Sales for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $61.7 million, down 18.9% from the $76.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. This shortfall is primarily due to continued soft furniture retail conditions fueled by the significant economic turmoil during the fourth quarter of 2008 that affected the financial markets, consumer confidence and spending on big-ticket items such as furniture (see also discussion in Wholesale and Retail Segments below). Gross margins in the fourth quarter of 2008 were 40.0% as compared to 38.8% for 2007. This increase is due to improved margins in both the wholesale and retail segments. Selling, general and administrative expenses 
decreased $0.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to the 
fourth quarter of 2007 primarily due to decreased spending in our wholesale and retail segments offset by a $4.1 million increase in bad debt expense. Bad debt expense increased due to store closings (both planned and completed) and the prolonged weak retail environment that is affecting certain licensees within the Company's retail network. The Company also recorded a significant non-cash charge of $23.4 million to write-off substantially all of the deferred tax assets previously recorded. The Company reported a net loss of $(37.8) million, or $(3.24) per share for the quarter ended November 29, 2008, as compared to a net loss of $(4.0) million, or $(0.34) per share, for the quarter ended November 24, 2007. See the attached Reconciliation of Net Loss as Reported to Net Loss as Adjusted to compare quarter over quarter results without these unusual charges. "Business deteriorated 
significantly as the 2008 fourth quarter progressed, negatively affecting our results on several fronts," said Robert H. Spilman, Jr., president and chief executive officer. "In addition to the extremely weak economy and its effect on the furniture industry, the mid-September worldwide financial meltdown impacted the value of our investment portfolio as well. The Company incurred non cash charges totaling $30.3 million comprised of write-offs of deferred income tax assets, a goodwill write-off, and the impairment of its marketable securities portfolio. Furthermore, the Company recorded $6.6 million of bad debt reserves during the quarter. These charges were partially offset by $2.1 million of proceeds from the CDSOA. "We are in an extremely volatile and difficult environment and are focusing our efforts squarely on the generation and preservation of cash. At year end, we had 
reduced inventories by 13%, a $6.7 million reduction. Company wide headcount had dropped 7% despite the acquisition of four licensed stores during the course of the year. We are continuing to assess our overall cost structure and inventory levels and are presently implementing plans to reduce both. Accordingly, the Company has recently suspended its employee 401k match and its quarterly dividend to shareholders. "We continue to work with our Bassett Home Furnishings licensed store network to help our dealers weather this unprecedented storm. We are focused on helping our dealers streamline their cash flow and to implement more aggressive product promotions in an attempt to stimulate consumer interest. Six underperforming licensee stores were closed and two were acquired during the quarter. In addition to these efforts, we are planning to close another 8-10 licensed stores in 2009 
and could acquire additional licensee stores. At year end, the network was comprised of 84 licensed and 31 corporate stores. "The corporate store network results improved slightly during the quarter despite an overall sales decline of 4%. One store in Atlanta and one in Houston were converted to the new prototype. Both stores have produced significant comparable sales increases since their September 1st openings. Also of significance was the devastation caused by Hurricane Ike and its effect on Houston, one of our most productive markets. Our best store in the market was flooded, requiring a complete remodel. Three other stores in the market were also temporarily closed for one to two weeks. "We are in the process of re-shaping our product assortment in anticipation of a prolonged economic slump. This includes a tighter assortment in general and an expansion of our faster 
turning custom upholstery products which have seen a smaller drop off in sales. We are also working with our suppliers to offer even better values in this category. These efforts should enable our dealers to have consistent access to our best selling SKUs and to concentrate on driving sales to the strongest part of our assortment." Sales for the years ended November 29, 2008 and November 24, 2007 were $288.3 million and $295.4 million, respectively, representing a decrease of 2.4%. Sales for the full year of 2008 and 2007 have been positively impacted by $16.4 million and $5.2 million, respectively, due to a change in the Company's business practices with respect to freight for the delivery of wholesale furniture to our retail stores. In July of 2007, the Company began invoicing these customers on a fully landed basis such that the invoice price includes freight. Excluding the 
effects of the business change, sales decreased 6.3%. This shortfall is primarily due to continued soft furniture retail conditions fueled by the significant economic turmoil during the fourth quarter of 2008 that affected the financial markets, consumer confidence and spending on big-ticket items such as furniture. Due to our fiscal calendar, net sales for 2008 also reflect a 53 week period as compared to a 52 week period for 2007. Gross margins were 39.9% for fiscal 2008 as compared to 34.0% for 2007. Excluding the effects of the above mentioned business change, gross margins would have been 36.2% for 2008 as compared to 32.8% for 2007. This significant increase is due to improved margins in both the wholesale and retail segments. Selling, general and administrative expenses, which excludes the effects of the business change noted above, increased $4.8 million due primarily to a 
$7.9 million increase in bad debt expense partially offset by decreased spending in the wholesale segment. Bad debt expense increased due to store closings (both planned and completed) and the prolonged weak retail environment that is affecting our licensed retail network. The Company also recorded a significant non-cash tax charge of $23.4 million to write-off substantially all of the deferred tax assets previously recorded. The Company reported a net loss of $(40.4) million, or $(3.46) per share for the year ended November 29, 2008, as compared to a net loss of $(9.9) million, or $(0.84) per share, for the year ended November 24, 2007. See the attached Reconciliation of Net Loss as Reported to Net Loss as Adjusted to compare year over year results without these unusual charges. The operating loss reported by the Company in 2008, exclusive of the impairment charges discussed 
below, is primarily due to losses incurred by the Company's retail segment and to the reserves recorded for bad debts related to sales to certain licensee stores within its wholesale segment. These losses reflect both the deteriorating home furnishings retail environment and the shortfall between the amount of sales required to break even on an average per store basis and the amount of sales that were actually written and delivered. The Company continues to take actions to improve per store sales performance including adding new more value oriented product offerings, strengthening its design and sales talent, and incorporating elements of the new store prototype into more of its stores. In addition, we are closing underperforming stores that we do not believe will be able to meet their required breakeven sales levels. Further, we are reducing the cost and expense structure of our 
wholesale segment to reflect this lower level of sales and the reduced number of stores. Restructurings, Other Non-Recurring Items and Income Taxes Our 2008 and 2007 results were negatively impacted by certain restructuring and non-recurring items totaling $3.0 million and $7.9 million, respectively. Unusual items for the quarter and year ended November 29, 2008 included a $3.5 million charge to write-off the goodwill remaining on the wholesale reporting unit and a $0.2 million charge related to the impairment of other intangibles, which were both recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008. The Company also recorded $0.6 million for the impairment of leasehold improvements and $0.6 million for lease exit costs related to the closure of a corporate retail store, $1.4 million of legal and other expenses for the proxy contest with Costa Brava Partnership III L.P. and a $1.3 
million gain associated with the sale of the Company's former airplane. In accordance with SFAS No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS No. 109), the Company evaluates its deferred income tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required or should be adjusted. SFAS No. 109 requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a "more likely than not" standard. Due to the losses in the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company is in a cumulative loss position for the past three years which is considered significant negative evidence that is difficult to overcome on a "more likely than not" standard through objectively verifiable data. While the Company's long-term financial outlook remains positive and the Company has 
certain tax planning strategies that could produce taxable income and may help it to realize its deferred tax assets, the Company concluded that its ability to rely on its long-term outlook and forecasts as to future taxable income was limited due to uncertainty created by the weight of the negative evidence, including the cumulative losses and a market capitalization well below its book value. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recorded a $23.4 million charge to establish a valuation allowance against substantially all of its deferred tax assets. Wholesale Segment Net sales for the wholesale segment were $51.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, 19.2% below the level attained in the fourth quarter of 2007. Net sales for the year ended November 29, 2008 were $242.1 million as compared to $247.7 million for the year ended November 24, 2007, a decrease of 
2.3%. The full year fiscal 2008 and 2007 reported sales were increased by reported revenue of $16.4 million and $5.2 million, respectively due to a change in the business practices as described above. Excluding this change, recorded revenue decreased 19.7% for the fourth quarter and 6.9% year over year. Due to our fiscal calendar, net sales for 2008 also reflect a 53 week period as compared to a 52 week period for 2007. Approximately 55% of wholesale shipments during 2008 were imported products compared to 49% for 2007. Gross margins for the wholesale segment were 27.9% for the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to 27.2% for 2007. Gross margins for the year ended November 29, 2008 were 29.3% as compared to 24.4% for the year ended November 24, 2007. Excluding the effects of the business change noted above, gross margins would have been 24.2% for fiscal 2008 and 22.8% for fiscal 2007. The 
year over year increase is primarily due to an improved product mix associated with increased imported products which carry a higher margin and the absence of the significant wind down costs incurred in 2007 related to the closing of the Bassett plant. Retail Segment Net sales for the retail segment were $22.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to $23.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, a decrease of $1.3 million as comparable store sales decreased 4.2%. Net sales for the year were $97.2 million in 2008 as compared to $87.5 million in 2007, an increase of $9.6 million. The year over year sales increase primarily resulted from additional Company-owned stores and a 2% increase in comparable store sales. The comparable store sales increases were primarily driven by progress in the Dallas market, the benefits of store consolidation in upstate New York, and 
increased sales in the Pineville, NC store due to its conversion to the new store prototype. Gross margins for 2008 increased 2.5 percentage points due to improved pricing and promotional strategies. Our retail segment reduced its total operating losses by $1.0 million, a 9.2% decrease. For the 24 comparable corporate stores, we reduced our operating losses by approximately 10% over 2007. We believe that the combination of new product introductions, store prototype retrofits, better hiring and training of design consultants and continued improved marketing efforts will lead to the further improvement in retail operating results. Other Income (loss), net Other income (loss), net for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $(6.5) million as compared to $1.5 million for 2007. Other income (loss), net for the year ended November 29, 2008 was $(7.0) million as compared to $5.9 million 
for the year ended November 24, 2007. There were two primary factors that contributed to the loss in other income for the 2008 fiscal fourth quarter and the year. Due to the significant decline in the financial markets during the fiscal fourth quarter, many of the Company's holdings sustained significant losses. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities", the Company recorded a $3.3 million charge for the other than temporary decline in the value of the marketable securities portfolio, $3.1 million of which was recorded in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the Company recognized $5.4 million ($4.0 million in the fourth quarter) in net losses from the Alternative Asset Fund, which had historically produced returns in excess of the relevant market indices. Balance Sheet and Cash Flow The Company used 
$19.0 million of cash in operating activities during the year ended November 29, 2008 primarily to fund retail operating losses, slower collections on accounts receivable and a decrease in accounts payable. This use of cash was due to both the continued difficult environment at retail as well as payments to fund the inventory build at the end of 2007 and the beginning of 2008 for the January 2008 new product rollout. Although the Company plans additional product introductions in 2009, they will not be as extensive as the rollout in early 2008. The Company expects overall inventory levels to decrease during 2009, generating additional positive cash flow. The Company also funded $18.7 million in dividends, including an $8.7 million special dividend in August, and repurchased $4.3 million of common stock under a previously announced share repurchase plan. These cash requirements were 
primarily funded through $29.6 million of net investment sales, $6.1 million in dividends from an affiliate and $9.0 million in additional borrowings on the revolving credit facility. Subsequent Events and Status of Investment Redemptions Subsequent to year end, the Company announced that the Board of Directors did not declare a regular quarterly dividend to be paid in the second quarter of 2009, conserving approximately $1.1 million of cash. This follows the announcement in October of 2008 where the Board decided to suspend making any decision with respect to the $0.50 per share second special dividend that it previously said it intended to make during 2008. Also subsequent to year end, the Company received $10.6 million or 80% of its net asset value of the investment in Styx Partners, L.P. The Company expects to receive the remaining portion by the end of 2009. 
Revolving Credit Facility At the end of 2008, the Company had $19.0 million outstanding on the revolving credit facility, with $10.6 million of availability. Due to the charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company's net worth decreased below the levels specified in the revolving credit facility. Subsequent to year end, the Company received a waiver of the violation from its bank and a reduction of the net worth covenant requirements for fiscal 2009 and 2010. The other relevant terms in the facility including the interest rate were not significantly amended. About Bassett Furniture Industries, Inc. Bassett Furniture Industries, Inc.

Company InfoAbout BassettStore ReviewsInvestorsCareersMAKE(over) A DIFFERENCEEnvironmental InitiativesSupplier Responsibility at BassettView Our Catalog About Bassett Furniture
Bassett’s blend of style, comfort and value has been trusted for more than a century and made it one of the most recognizable brands in America. Today, Bassett has taken its craftsmanship and built a new reputation of quality custom furniture that can be made and delivered in 30 days or less.
  
Bassett currently operates more than 100 retail locations in the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada and is rapidly expanding sales on bassettfurniture.com. We are passionate about developing fashionable and innovative home furnishings at a great value, as well as offering a number of exceptional services to meet your needs.  Our custom solutions make it easy to express your unique sense of style with a variety of options, including upholstery, beds, dining, home storage and home entertainment.
  
 One visit to a store and you realize that Bassett is much more than a furniture store. Our skilled Design Consultants are dedicated to taking the guess work out of decorating. They’ll help create custom furnishings, define your decorating lifestyle, establish a budget, make a house call, or simply offer an opinion…all free of charge.
If you want to know how it all began, we have to take you back to late 1800s in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains to an area northwest of Martinsville, Virginia. The Bassett family was running a sawmill that supplied rail ties for the new Norfolk & Western line that was being built through the family property. In 1892, the rail line was completed and the family began looking for markets for its lumber.
John David “J.D.” Bassett was making a good living traveling the countryside selling goods for general stores when he began carrying lumber samples from the mill. He quickly made his first sale of lumber to a coffin company in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and returned home with the knowledge of the growing furniture industry and the subsequent demand for raw lumber.
He soon had orders for oak from several furniture companies in North Carolina. He quickly learned that the best markets for Appalachian oak was up north and he made inroads into those markets.
“Here I was shipping raw lumber from Henry County (Virginia) to Jamestown, New York, and Grand Rapids, Michigan, where factories converted that lumber into finished furniture to be shipped everywhere, including the South,” J.D. recalled. “It seemed to me that furniture certainly could be made in Henry County at a tremendous advantage.
Bassett and his brothers laid out a plan and in 1902 the Bassett Furniture Company was born. At first, the company had about 50 men, from farms and the surrounding hills, and focused on styles made of oak and features simple profiles with carved overlays.
Early dressers sold for $4.75, washstands for $2.75 and beds for $1.50
By 1917, Company sales reached $1 million. But family members had opened new divisions that ultimately competed with each other for sales. In 1930, a “house divided” meeting was called and the different companies were incorporated into Bassett Furniture Industries, Inc., in 1931.
The post-war years brought rapid growth as large neighborhoods sprang up quickly around the country. In the early 1960s, the Company bought Prestige Furniture Corp. and added upholstery to its line up and acquired three other companies to expand its bedroom and dining room production.
Furniture markets began to shift in the 1990s and many “mom-and-pop” stores were closed as large store chains with “no-name” furniture were gaining a foothold. Seeing this trend, Bassett opened its first store in 1997. The design was a departure from the compartmentalized rooms of typical furniture stores with little display merchandising.
Today, Bassett remains committed to the early principles of the company … that great quality, stylish furniture does not need to be expensive and should be available to everyone. A visit to one of our stores and you’ll see just how committed we are to that idea.

Bassett Announces New Division to Expand Club Level Product Line

BASSETT, Va., July  19, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bassett Furniture Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:BSET), a leading manufacturer and marketer of home furnishings, today announced the formation of a new division to expand its motion product line.  The Club Level Motion Division will be led by Bruce Cohenour, senior vice president of sales and merchandising, and will focus on expanding the motion product line nationally with its independent retailers.
“Bassett continues to seek new avenues to pursue sales growth as we look to the future.  We believe that heightening our commitment to the motion category through our new Club Level Motion Division will enhance our open market sales efforts and offers a strategic complement to our HGTV HOME Design Studios and our Bassett Home Furnishings store program,” said Robert H. Spilman Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. The new Club Level program offers fashion-forward styling, 17 leather options, and quick availability to retailers.  Other features of Club Level include the use of 100% top grain leathers, a 400-pound weight capacity, and limited lifetime warranty.  In addition, the line features powered headrests, extended footrests, and lay flat motion.  To support the sales effort for this new division, Bassett will add sales representatives, expand its showroom space in High Point, N.C., this fall, and showcase the new line at the upcoming World Market Center in Las Vegas.  “The new Club Level Division enables us to leverage our well-known Bassett brand name to boost visibility of these motion products,” said Mr. Cohenour.  “For 115 years, Bassett has grown and evolved in the home furnishings industry.  This new motion line of furniture will allow us to grow this category with independent furniture retailers and contribute meaningfully to our business success." With 91 corporate-owned and licensed stores, Bassett Furniture Industries, Inc., has leveraged its strong brand name in furniture into a network of corporate and licensed stores that focus on providing consumers with a friendly environment for buying furniture and accessories. The most significant growth opportunity for Bassett continues to be the Company’s dedicated retail store program. Bassett’s retail strategy includes affordable custom-built furniture that can be delivered quickly. The stores also feature the latest on-trend furniture styles, free in-home design visits, and coordinated decorating accessories. Bassett also has a selective and growing wholesale business, with more than 700 accounts on the open market, across the United States and internationally.

The new Club Level program offers fashion-forward styling, 17 leather options, and quick availability to retailers.  Other features of Club Level include the use of 100% top grain leathers, a 400-pound weight capacity, and limited lifetime warranty.  In addition, the line features powered headrests, extended footrests, and lay flat motion.  To support the sales effort for this new division, Bassett will add sales representatives, expand its showroom space in High Point, N.C., this fall, and showcase the new line at the upcoming World Market Center in Las Vegas.  “The new Club Level Division enables us to leverage our well-known Bassett brand name to boost visibility of these motion products,” said Mr. Cohenour.  “For 115 years, Bassett has grown and evolved in the home furnishings industry.  This new motion line of furniture will allow us to grow this category with independent furniture retailers and contribute meaningfully to our business success." With 91 corporate-owned and licensed stores, Bassett Furniture Industries, Inc., has leveraged its strong brand name in furniture into a network of corporate and licensed stores that focus on providing consumers with a friendly environment for buying furniture and accessories. The most significant growth opportunity for Bassett continues to be the Company’s dedicated retail store program. Bassett’s retail strategy includes affordable custom-built furniture that can be delivered quickly. The stores also feature the latest on-trend furniture styles, free in-home design visits, and coordinated decorating accessories. Bassett also has a selective and growing wholesale business, with more than 700 accounts on the open market, across the United States and internationally.
