Frederick J. Lynch Appointed Chief Executive Officer of Masonite International | Business Wire
























































Frederick J. Lynch Appointed Chief Executive Officer of Masonite 
      International






May 30, 2007 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



MISSISSAUGA, Ontario--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Masonite International Inc. announced today that Frederick J. Lynch, 43, 
      the company’s President since July 2006, will 
      assume the additional title of Chief Executive Officer, effective 
      immediately. Kenneth W. Freeman will continue as Chairman of Masonite, a 
      leading global manufacturer of residential and commercial doors.
    


“This is an orderly, well-planned transition, 
      and the time is right,” Mr. Freeman said in 
      announcing the appointment. “Since joining 
      Masonite as President, Fred Lynch has demonstrated the skills, vision 
      and values that will enable him to be a great CEO for Masonite.” 
      He said that Mr. Lynch has accelerated progress in the areas of talent 
      acquisition, customer satisfaction, manufacturing excellence, product 
      innovation and employee engagement.
    

      Mr. Lynch noted, “All of us at Masonite are 
      indebted to Ken Freeman for setting the company on a course toward 
      profitable growth and undisputed industry leadership. Our job now is to 
      further accelerate our progress on that path to success. Having come to 
      know the people of Masonite, I have absolute confidence that we will 
      achieve this.”


      Mr. Lynch said the company has taken a number of steps to control costs, 
      improve quality, expand the customer base and broaden the product line 
      in positioning itself for a new period of growth when the North American 
      home construction and repair, remodeling and renovation markets recover 
      from the current downturn. At the same time, he said, “Masonite 
      is moving aggressively to take advantage of significant growth 
      opportunities in Europe and Asia.”


      Mr. Lynch began his career twenty one years ago as a chemical engineer 
      at Allied Signal, worked his way up through manufacturing at Allied 
      Signal and Honeywell, and eventually became vice president and general 
      manager of the specialty chemicals division, with operations in North 
      America and Europe. In 2003, he joined Alpharma Inc., a generic drug 
      company, as senior vice president, and became President of Human 
      Generics, a $900 million business with 3,000 employees in the United 
      States, Europe, China and Indonesia.
    

      Mr. Freeman, 56, is a Managing Director of Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & 
      Company, and Executive Chairman of Accellent, Inc. From 1996 to 2004 he 
      was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Quest Diagnostics 
      Incorporated.
    

      Masonite is a leading global manufacturer of residential and commercial 
      doors. Masonite’s employees are a dedicated 
      team committed to providing the highest value door products to our 
      customers in more than 70 countries around the world.
