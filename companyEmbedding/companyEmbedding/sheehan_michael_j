                              revealing his own interpretation of security, he makes the case for a postpositivist conception that links human emancipation,

                           The year 2007 will see the 50th anniversary of the Space Age, which began with the launching of Sputnik by the Soviet Union
                              in October 1957. Since that time, the development of space technology has revolutionised many aspects of life on Earth, from
                              satellite television to mobile phones, the internet and micro-electronics. It has also helped to bring about a revolution
                              in the use of military force by the most powerful states. Space is crucial to the politics of the postmodern world. It has
                              seen competition and cooperation in the past fifty years, and is in danger of becoming a battlefield in the next fifty. The
                              International Politics of Space is the first book to bring these crucial themes together and provide a clear and vital picture
                              of how politically important space has become, and what its exploitation might mean for all our futures. Michael Sheehan analyses
                              the space programmes of the United States, Russia, China, India and the European Space Agency, and explains how central space
                              has become to issues of war and peace, international law, justice and international development, and cooperation between the
                              worlds leading states. It highlights the significance of China and India's commitment to space, and explains how the theories
                              and concepts we use to describe and explain space are fundamental to the possibility of avoiding conflict in space in the
                              future. This ground-breaking book will be of great interest to students of international relations, space politics and security
