Investors who are interested in maximizing the after-tax returns of their mutual fund holdings may consider investing in a tax-efficient fund. Tax-efficient funds seek to achieve long-term capital appreciation while limiting taxable distributions of capital gains and dividends. This approach attempts to reduce the effects of federal taxation on an investor's long-term return potential and increase after-tax return compared with similar funds for which tax efficiency is not a primary goal.
The Tax-Efficient Equity Fund, which T. Rowe Price introduced in 2000, seeks to maximize long-term capital growth on an after-tax basis. The fund typically invests in stocks of large-cap and mid-cap companies and also may invest a significant portion of its assets in technology companies.
The fund's goal is to generate competitive pre-tax performance and outperform on an after-tax basis over a full market cycle. In an effort to achieve strong after-tax returns, the fund seeks to avoid realizing capital gain distributions by limiting sales of existing holdings and not rotating from one sector to another in an attempt to capture short-term outperformance. However, taxable gains may be realized in order to satisfy redemption requests or when we believe the benefits of continuing to hold a security outweighs tax considerations. As appropriate, we may attempt to use losses from sales of securities that have declined to offset future gains that would otherwise be taxable.
Fund holdings are subject to market risk, and share prices may be more volatile than those of a fund focusing on slower-growing or cyclical companies.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







The performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of a 1.00% redemption fee on shares held for 365 days or less; if it did, the performance would be lower.

The returns presented in this table reflect the return before taxes; the return after taxes on dividends and capital gain distributions; and the return after taxes on dividends, capital gain distributions, and gains (or losses) from the redemption of shares held for 1‐, 5‐, and 10‐year or since‐inception periods, as applicable. After‐tax returns reflect the highest federal income tax rate but exclude state and local taxes. The after‐ tax returns reflect the rates applicable to ordinary and qualified dividends and capital gains effective in 2003.
During periods when the fund incurs a loss, the post‐liquidation after‐tax return may exceed the fund's other returns because the loss generates a tax benefit that is factored into the result. An investor's actual after‐tax return will likely differ from those shown and will depend on his or her tax situation. Past before‐ and after‐tax returns do not necessarily indicate future performance.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







The performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of a 1.00% redemption fee on shares held for 365 days or less; if it did, the performance would be lower.

The returns presented in this table reflect the return before taxes; the return after taxes on dividends and capital gain distributions; and the return after taxes on dividends, capital gain distributions, and gains (or losses) from the redemption of shares held for 1‐, 5‐, and 10‐year or since‐inception periods, as applicable. After‐tax returns reflect the highest federal income tax rate but exclude state and local taxes. The after‐ tax returns reflect the rates applicable to ordinary and qualified dividends and capital gains effective in 2003.
During periods when the fund incurs a loss, the post‐liquidation after‐tax return may exceed the fund's other returns because the loss generates a tax benefit that is factored into the result. An investor's actual after‐tax return will likely differ from those shown and will depend on his or her tax situation. Past before‐ and after‐tax returns do not necessarily indicate future performance.

Morningstar Ratings1


as of 05/31/2017



Overall





3 Year





5 Year





10 Year







				Morningstar rated the Tax-Efficient Equity Fund among 
1284,
1284,
1145
and 
805
Large Growth
funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable) 
ending 05/31/2017, respectively.


The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance 
figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The 
weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year 
rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating 
for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most 
weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is 
included in all three rating periods.
			

Performance Comparison
as of 
					
						06/30/2017
					
				







							This chart shows the value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund over the past 10 years or since its inception (for funds lacking 10-year records). The result is compared with benchmarks, which may include a broad-based market index and a peer group average or index. Market indexes do not include expenses, which are deducted from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes.
						
Benchmark Definitions



1 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, 
and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of 
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating 
formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest 
impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

*157 of our 332 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 134 of these 157 (85%) funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 215 of 317 (68%), 183 of 225 (81%), 149 of 180 (83%), of T. Rowe Price funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
36 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes). 34 of these 36 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 38 of 39, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details. 
Past performance cannot guarantee future results. All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal. Diversification cannot assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market.
Based on cumulative total return, 174 of 232 (75%), 142 of 160 (89%), 115 of 127 (91%), and 105 of 114 (92%) T. Rowe Price stock funds (including all share classes and excluding funds used in insurance products) outperformed their Lipper averages for the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)

1Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
*The principal value of the Retirement Funds and Target Funds (collectively, the "target date funds") is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The target date funds' allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The Retirement Funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term retirement withdrawal horizon. The Target Funds emphasize asset accumulation prior to retirement, balance the need for reduced market risk and income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a moderate postretirement withdrawal horizon. The target date funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The key difference between the Retirement Funds and the Target Funds is the overall allocation to equity; although they each maintain significant allocations to equities both prior to and after the target date, the Retirement Funds maintain a higher equity allocation, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

   Source   for performance: T. Rowe Price. Fund performance is calculated using the   official NAV with dividends reinvested, if any. The value of an investment   and any income from it can go down as well as up. Investors may get back less   than the amount invested. It will be affected by changes in the exchange rate   between the base currency of the fund and the subscription currency, if   different. Sales charges (up to a maximum of 5% for the A Class), taxes and   other locally applied costs have not been deducted and if applicable, they   will reduce the performance figures. Past   performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance.

No expenses or any   other fees are charged to the Z class. Fee arrangements for the Z, S and J   classes are made directly with the investment manager. Please see the   prospectus for further information.

	    David J. Eiswert,
	    Portfolio Manager,
	    



We expect the U.S. economy will continue to grow at a slow but steady pace. If President Trump is able to move ahead with tax reform and is successful in getting some of his proposed infrastructure stimulus through Congress, we think inflationary factors could drive markets higher. However, if the agenda stalls, secular stagnation could persist. Ultimately, we want our investments to work regardless of the broader external environment and will continue to buy quality companies where we have specific insights that should lead to improving economic returns in the future.

Diverse economic and corporate fundamentals across regions, countries, and sectors have led to increased complexity and volatility in equity markets. While this presents challenges for most investors looking for clear winners, we feel we have a significant advantage through our fundamental analysis, sound analytical framework, and focus on durable and high-quality growth companies.

We believe the market is approaching a new long-term average for the price of oil in the $40 to $50 per barrel range, despite the higher price levels that many market participants expect. We are heartened that opportunities for new investments remain, in part driven by the volatility in the space.

Emerging Markets Equity

In emerging markets, identifying winners can be profitable; but avoiding losers is critical. Investing in the region since 1985, we believe there is no substitute for proprietary, fundamentally-driven research. That’s why today we have one of the industry’s deepest emerging and frontier markets equity research platforms.

The high yield market has enjoyed a significant rally in recent months. However, ongoing macro factors and negative headlines will likely cause volatility in risk assets, including high yield bonds. Our estimates for fallen angels - issuers downgraded from investment-grade to high yield - have been nearly met and absorbed into the market, but energy and metals issuers will continue to drive the market default rate higher through 2016 into 2017.

We believe the start of the European Central Bank's (ECB) corporate bond buying programme in June is likely to be a near-term focus for the asset class. More broadly, upcoming risk events, such as the UK's referendum on European Union membership could cause volatility to rise across financial markets, which could feed through into investment-grade corporate bonds. That said, we believe that from a medium-term perspective, fundamentals in the asset class are reasonable as Europe is in a credit-friendly part of the economic cycle with inflation low and growth moderate.

While we are reasonably sanguine about the outlook for the market, we retain a defensive bias. We suspect that, at current spreads, the market is already pricing in much of the European Central Bank's (ECB) bond buying programme. Although further gains are unlikely to be as strong as April’s, we believe there will be some limitation of downside risk as long as the ECB continues to fuel demand for yield.

We believe that long-term fundamental drivers in emerging markets debt remain sound, with solid sovereign balance sheets and higher growth profiles relative to developed markets. Furthermore, from a relative value perspective, yields are more attractive in emerging market local debt than developed markets where a growing number of securities are trading with negative yields.

	    David J. Eiswert,
	    Portfolio Manager,
	    



We expect the U.S. economy will continue to grow at a slow but steady pace. If President Trump is able to move ahead with tax reform and is successful in getting some of his proposed infrastructure stimulus through Congress, we think inflationary factors could drive markets higher. However, if the agenda stalls, secular stagnation could persist. Ultimately, we want our investments to work regardless of the broader external environment and will continue to buy quality companies where we have specific insights that should lead to improving economic returns in the future.

Diverse economic and corporate fundamentals across regions, countries, and sectors have led to increased complexity and volatility in equity markets. While this presents challenges for most investors looking for clear winners, we feel we have a significant advantage through our fundamental analysis, sound analytical framework, and focus on durable and high-quality growth companies.

We believe the market is approaching a new long-term average for the price of oil in the $40 to $50 per barrel range, despite the higher price levels that many market participants expect. We are heartened that opportunities for new investments remain, in part driven by the volatility in the space.

Our portfolio was well positioned to benefit from the more favourable market environment in May. We believe that volatility is likely to rise ahead of the UK referendum on EU membership in the weeks ahead, which could present opportunities to invest in high-quality UK businesses whose valuations might be affected before the vote.

Emerging Markets Equity

In emerging markets, identifying winners can be profitable; but avoiding losers is critical. Investing in the region since 1985, we believe there is no substitute for proprietary, fundamentally-driven research. That’s why today we have one of the industry’s deepest emerging and frontier markets equity research platforms.

The high yield market has enjoyed a significant rally in recent months. However, ongoing macro factors and negative headlines will likely cause volatility in risk assets, including high yield bonds. Our estimates for fallen angels - issuers downgraded from investment-grade to high yield - have been nearly met and absorbed into the market, but energy and metals issuers will continue to drive the market default rate higher through 2016 into 2017.

We believe the start of the European Central Bank's (ECB) corporate bond buying programme in June is likely to be a near-term focus for the asset class. More broadly, upcoming risk events, such as the UK's referendum on European Union membership could cause volatility to rise across financial markets, which could feed through into investment-grade corporate bonds. That said, we believe that from a medium-term perspective, fundamentals in the asset class are reasonable as Europe is in a credit-friendly part of the economic cycle with inflation low and growth moderate.

While we are reasonably sanguine about the outlook for the market, we retain a defensive bias. We suspect that, at current spreads, the market is already pricing in much of the European Central Bank's (ECB) bond buying programme. Although further gains are unlikely to be as strong as April’s, we believe there will be some limitation of downside risk as long as the ECB continues to fuel demand for yield.

We believe that long-term fundamental drivers in emerging markets debt remain sound, with solid sovereign balance sheets and higher growth profiles relative to developed markets. Furthermore, from a relative value perspective, yields are more attractive in emerging market local debt than developed markets where a growing number of securities are trading with negative yields.

Morningstar Ratings1


as of 05/31/2017



Overall





3 Year





5 Year





10 Year







				Morningstar rated the Tax-Efficient Equity Fund among 
1284,
1284,
1145
and 
805
Large Growth
funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable) 
ending 05/31/2017, respectively.


The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance 
figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The 
weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year 
rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating 
for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most 
weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is 
included in all three rating periods.
			

Performance Comparison
as of 
					
						06/30/2017
					
				







							This chart shows the value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund over the past 10 years or since its inception (for funds lacking 10-year records). The result is compared with benchmarks, which may include a broad-based market index and a peer group average or index. Market indexes do not include expenses, which are deducted from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes.
						
Benchmark Definitions



1 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, 
and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of 
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating 
formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest 
impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details.

The mutual funds referred to in this website are offered and sold only to persons residing in the United States and are offered by prospectus only. The prospectuses include investment objectives, risks, fees, expenses, and other information that you should read and consider carefully before investing.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

*157 of our 332 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 134 of these 157 (85%) funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 215 of 317 (68%), 183 of 225 (81%), 149 of 180 (83%), of T. Rowe Price funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
36 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes). 34 of these 36 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 38 of 39, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

*The principal value of the Retirement Funds and Target Funds (collectively, the "target date funds") is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The target date funds' allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The Retirement Funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term retirement withdrawal horizon. The Target Funds emphasize asset accumulation prior to retirement, balance the need for reduced market risk and income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a moderate postretirement withdrawal horizon. The target date funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The key difference between the Retirement Funds and the Target Funds is the overall allocation to equity; although they each maintain significant allocations to equities both prior to and after the target date, the Retirement Funds maintain a higher equity allocation, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

   Source   for performance: T. Rowe Price. Fund performance is calculated using the   official NAV with dividends reinvested, if any. The value of an investment   and any income from it can go down as well as up. Investors may get back less   than the amount invested. It will be affected by changes in the exchange rate   between the base currency of the fund and the subscription currency, if   different. Sales charges (up to a maximum of 5% for the A Class), taxes and   other locally applied costs have not been deducted and if applicable, they   will reduce the performance figures. Past   performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance.

Hedged share classes (denoted by 'h') utilise investment techniques to mitigate currency risk between the underlying investment currency(ies) of the fund and the currency of the hedged share class. The costs of doing so will be borne by the share class and there is no guarantee that such hedging will be effective.






   Please   note that no management fees are charged to the Z, S and J share classes. No   administration agent fees are charged to the J class. No expenses or any   other fees are charged to the Z class. Fee arrangements for the Z, S and J   classes are made directly with the investment manager. Please see the   prospectus for further information.



   Where   the base currency of the fund differs from the share class currency, exchange   rate movements may affect returns.

U.S. stocks rose in May, continuing the advance that started in mid-February. The portfolio outperformed the benchmark index over the month. Stock selection in the consumer discretionary sector and an underweight to consumer staples names boosted relative results. Conversely, stock selection in the industrials and business services and information technology sectors hurt relative performance.

	    Portfolio Manager,
	    



Following the election, we saw a sharp bifurcation between the performance of growth and value stocks. Value-oriented sectors, including financials, energy, and industrials and business services, got a boost from the reflation trade as investors rotated into cyclical industries deemed to benefit the most from the policies proposed by the incoming U.S. presidential administration. On the other hand, growth-oriented sectors, such as information technology, health care, and consumer discretionary, lagged. Regardless of the market's initial reaction, it's too soon to definitively declare winners and losers. As such, we remain steadfast in our bottom-up approach to stock selection based on rigorous fundamental research. Sentiment can certainly be a powerful force in the near term; however, over the long run, returns in the stock market are driven by growth in earnings and cash flows. Despite recent lackluster returns, fundamentals in information technology, consumer discretionary, and several health care names are actually quite vibrant.Information TechnologyIn the information technology sector we continue to emphasize disruptive business models and technologies that that we believe can sustain high growth for several years. Secular demand for public cloud computing services remains a key growth driver; select companies benefiting from the shift of advertising spending to digital and social media channels also present compelling investment opportunities. We also favor companies driven by the convergence of communications and computing, including Internet software companies and those that will benefit from broad global tailwinds in digital payments.We increased our position in Microsoft as we believe the company's continued evolution to cloud computing remains on track. The company's recent acquisition of LinkedIn should also be additive to Microsoft's core Office franchise. We believe the software giant is also improving its market positioning, execution, long-term prospects, and capital allocation management.Juniper Networks made progress in diversifying its customer base, ramping new products across its portfolio, and improving its cost structure. Shares advanced after the company reported strong quarterly earnings and guidance, driven by sales growth in new products, particularly in the switching segment. We opportunistically sold shares on recent strength in the stock.Consumer DiscretionaryOur sizable exposure to the consumer discretionary sector is composed primarily of companies that we believe are well positioned to take advantage of powerful secular trends in retail spending. Consumption continues to grow and consumer confidence is strong, with unemployment at multiyear lows and wages starting to grow after years of stagnating. Within the sector, we continue to emphasize companies with innovative business models that are benefiting from secular growth in ecommerce retail and shifting dynamics in travel and leisure services.Yum! Brands, the parent company of Taco Bell, KFC, and Pizza Hut, spun off its China business during the period. Following the spinoff, we bought shares of the legacy enterprise. We are positive on the company's refranchising initiatives, which we believe can lead to higher margins, a more stable cash flow stream, and more capital being returned to shareholders.We sold shares of Hanesbrands during the quarter on concerns that the vertically integrated and owned supply chain model is becoming increasingly less efficient with more acquisitions. We also believe the company is exposed to negative tax reform optionality. Thus, we redeployed the proceeds of the sale to fund investments with stronger upside potential.Health CareWe are taking a more cautious approach given the real risk of regulatory reform for the health care sector, particularly on drug pricing. While we've reduced our exposure to the sector, we still believe there are opportunities in select therapeutics companies developing promising drugs that address large, unmet clinical needs. In our view, some of the most attractive investment themes in the sector include managed care industry consolidation, innovations in medical equipment, and robotic technology.We bought shares of biotechnology firm Biogen as we believe the company has significant medium- and long-term growth potential in several of its pipeline programs. We expect Spinraza, a recently approved treatment for all types of spinal muscular atrophy, to be accretive to earnings starting in 2017. The firm also has a steady base business of multiple sclerosis treatments, including Tecfidera, which should be a reliable revenue generator for the next several years.We trimmed our position in Allergan during the period; however, we still maintain a constructive view of the company as we believe it is well positioned to deliver organic growth from several of its business segments. More streamlined operations following the sale of its generic drug business in the third quarter of 2016, along with a number of upcoming product launches, could also bode well for the firm's long-term earnings growth.

Biotech and pharmaceutical companies continue to make dramatic progress in various clinical areas. We remain focused on companies with strong fundamentals and the potential to bring additional new drugs to market in areas where there is significant, unmet clinical need. We are also finding opportunities to take advantage of trends such as managed care industry consolidation and innovative robotic medical technology.

Shares of Morgan Stanley traded higher along with the broader financials sector during the fourth quarter. In addition to tailwinds from higher interest rates, fixed income, currencies, and commodities (FICC) activity continued to improve and act as a key profit driver for its brokerage business.TD Ameritrade shares also benefited from postelection optimism during the quarter. Increased trading volumes and net new asset flows over the long term should further benefit the company. We also believe the company's acquisition of competitor Scottrade will be accretive to earnings.Shares of American Airlines extended their rally into the fourth quarter on expectations that more disciplined capacity growth across the industry should drive improved results going forward. The stock also got a boost mid-quarter on news that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway had accumulated shares of the company. Better-than-expected traffic numbers propelled the stock higher, and management followed with better-than-expected fiscal guidance.Restrained capacity growth and improved traffic also benefited shares of Alaska Air Group. We continue to believe that Alaska Air Group is a high-quality company that will be able to produce consistent earnings growth.Facebook reported another strong quarter, with results ahead of consensus expectations across all financial metrics. However, the stock traded lower on comments from management that 2017 would be a year of aggressive investment for the company. Management's lack of clarity as to the magnitude of its planned investments was not well received by the market. Also, similar to its peers, the stock lagged due to the U.S. presidential election as investors rotated into other segments of the market deemed to benefit from Trump's policy proposals.Workday is a durable software company that is in the early stages of penetrating its addressable market. The company saw its shares struggle following the release of its third-quarter earnings report, which featured disappointing guidance. Though it faces competitive pressures, Workday's platform is highly unique, and we believe its positioning will improve and ultimately surmount what we consider temporary headwinds.Shares of Amazon.com fell after the company reported that gross profits were lower than expected and management provided guidance that was well below consensus estimates. Expenses for the quarter reflected higher year-over-year costs associated with the buildout of its third-party distribution business. While investors reacted to the near-term impact, the investments should pay off down the road as growth in this segment is accelerating and margins are much higher relative to its base retail business. Amazon Web Services, the company's dominant cloud computing unit, is also a key profit driver that continues to grow at an impressive rate.Priceline reported another quarter of solid results, with strong growth across all geographies and channels. Key metrics, including bookings growth, gross profits, and earnings all came in ahead of consensus expectations and previous guidance. Despite the company's healthy fundamentals, the stock was roughly flat during the period after it sold off along with other Internet-related names in the aftermath of the U.S. presidential election.

	    Robert W. Sharps,
	    Portfolio Manager,
	    



Following the election, we saw a sharp bifurcation between the performance of growth and value stocks. Value-oriented sectors, including financials, energy, and industrials and business services, got a boost from the reflation trade as investors rotated into cyclical industries deemed to benefit the most from the policies proposed by the incoming U.S. presidential administration. On the other hand, growth-oriented sectors, such as information technology, health care, and consumer discretionary, lagged. Regardless of the market's initial reaction, it's too soon to definitively declare winners and losers. As such, we remain steadfast in our bottom-up approach to stock selection based on rigorous fundamental research. Sentiment can certainly be a powerful force in the near term; however, over the long run, returns in the stock market are driven by growth in earnings and cash flows. Despite recent lackluster returns, fundamentals in information technology, consumer discretionary, and several health care names are actually quite vibrant.Information TechnologyIn the information technology sector we continue to emphasize disruptive business models and technologies that that we believe can sustain high growth for several years. Secular demand for public cloud computing services remains a key growth driver; select companies benefiting from the shift of advertising spending to digital and social media channels also present compelling investment opportunities. We also favor companies driven by the convergence of communications and computing, including Internet software companies and those that will benefit from broad global tailwinds in digital payments.We increased our position in Microsoft as we believe the company's continued evolution to cloud computing remains on track. The company's recent acquisition of LinkedIn should also be additive to Microsoft's core Office franchise. We believe the software giant is also improving its market positioning, execution, long-term prospects, and capital allocation management.Juniper Networks made progress in diversifying its customer base, ramping new products across its portfolio, and improving its cost structure. Shares advanced after the company reported strong quarterly earnings and guidance, driven by sales growth in new products, particularly in the switching segment. We opportunistically sold shares on recent strength in the stock.Consumer DiscretionaryOur sizable exposure to the consumer discretionary sector is composed primarily of companies that we believe are well positioned to take advantage of powerful secular trends in retail spending. Consumption continues to grow and consumer confidence is strong, with unemployment at multiyear lows and wages starting to grow after years of stagnating. Within the sector, we continue to emphasize companies with innovative business models that are benefiting from secular growth in ecommerce retail and shifting dynamics in travel and leisure services.Yum! Brands, the parent company of Taco Bell, KFC, and Pizza Hut, spun off its China business during the period. Following the spinoff, we bought shares of the legacy enterprise. We are positive on the company's refranchising initiatives, which we believe can lead to higher margins, a more stable cash flow stream, and more capital being returned to shareholders.We sold shares of Hanesbrands during the quarter on concerns that the vertically integrated and owned supply chain model is becoming increasingly less efficient with more acquisitions. We also believe the company is exposed to negative tax reform optionality. Thus, we redeployed the proceeds of the sale to fund investments with stronger upside potential.Health CareWe are taking a more cautious approach given the real risk of regulatory reform for the health care sector, particularly on drug pricing. While we've reduced our exposure to the sector, we still believe there are opportunities in select therapeutics companies developing promising drugs that address large, unmet clinical needs. In our view, some of the most attractive investment themes in the sector include managed care industry consolidation, innovations in medical equipment, and robotic technology.We bought shares of biotechnology firm Biogen as we believe the company has significant medium- and long-term growth potential in several of its pipeline programs. We expect Spinraza, a recently approved treatment for all types of spinal muscular atrophy, to be accretive to earnings starting in 2017. The firm also has a steady base business of multiple sclerosis treatments, including Tecfidera, which should be a reliable revenue generator for the next several years.We trimmed our position in Allergan during the period; however, we still maintain a constructive view of the company as we believe it is well positioned to deliver organic growth from several of its business segments. More streamlined operations following the sale of its generic drug business in the third quarter of 2016, along with a number of upcoming product launches, could also bode well for the firm's long-term earnings growth.

	    David J. Eiswert,
	    Portfolio Manager,
	    



We expect the U.S. economy will continue to grow at a slow but steady pace. If President Trump is able to move ahead with tax reform and is successful in getting some of his proposed infrastructure stimulus through Congress, we think inflationary factors could drive markets higher. However, if the agenda stalls, secular stagnation could persist. Ultimately, we want our investments to work regardless of the broader external environment and will continue to buy quality companies where we have specific insights that should lead to improving economic returns in the future.

Diverse economic and corporate fundamentals across regions, countries, and sectors have led to increased complexity and volatility in equity markets. While this presents challenges for most investors looking for clear winners, we feel we have a significant advantage through our fundamental analysis, sound analytical framework, and focus on durable and high-quality growth companies.

We believe the market is approaching a new long-term average for the price of oil in the $40 to $50 per barrel range, despite the higher price levels that many market participants expect. We are heartened that opportunities for new investments remain, in part driven by the volatility in the space.

Our portfolio was well positioned to benefit from the more favourable market environment in May. We believe that volatility is likely to rise ahead of the UK referendum on EU membership in the weeks ahead, which could present opportunities to invest in high-quality UK businesses whose valuations might be affected before the vote.

European shares rose in May, helped by higher oil prices and the view that the global economy can withstand an increase in U.S. interest rates. Concerns also eased about the possibility of a UK exit from the EU and the state of the Greek economy following a debt-reduction deal with creditors.

Emerging Markets Equity

In emerging markets, identifying winners can be profitable; but avoiding losers is critical. Investing in the region since 1985, we believe there is no substitute for proprietary, fundamentally-driven research. That’s why today we have one of the industry’s deepest emerging and frontier markets equity research platforms.

	    Portfolio Manager,
	    



The high yield market has enjoyed a significant rally in recent months. However, ongoing macro factors and negative headlines will likely cause volatility in risk assets, including high yield bonds. Our estimates for fallen angels - issuers downgraded from investment-grade to high yield - have been nearly met and absorbed into the market, but energy and metals issuers will continue to drive the market default rate higher through 2016 into 2017.

	    Portfolio Manager,
	    



We believe the start of the European Central Bank's (ECB) corporate bond buying programme in June is likely to be a near-term focus for the asset class. More broadly, upcoming risk events, such as the UK's referendum on European Union membership could cause volatility to rise across financial markets, which could feed through into investment-grade corporate bonds. That said, we believe that from a medium-term perspective, fundamentals in the asset class are reasonable as Europe is in a credit-friendly part of the economic cycle with inflation low and growth moderate.

While we are reasonably sanguine about the outlook for the market, we retain a defensive bias. We suspect that, at current spreads, the market is already pricing in much of the European Central Bank's (ECB) bond buying programme. Although further gains are unlikely to be as strong as April’s, we believe there will be some limitation of downside risk as long as the ECB continues to fuel demand for yield.

We believe that long-term fundamental drivers in emerging markets debt remain sound, with solid sovereign balance sheets and higher growth profiles relative to developed markets. Furthermore, from a relative value perspective, yields are more attractive in emerging market local debt than developed markets where a growing number of securities are trading with negative yields.

Higher risk appetite and technical factors have meaningfully influenced most spread sectors—both positively and negatively. The rally in spread sectors slowed in May, and the upside for holding additional risk seems to be more limited in light of near-term uncertainty and Brexit concerns.
