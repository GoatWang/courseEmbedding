	INFORMATION STATEMENT UNDER REGULATION 14C






	Dear Common Stock Stockholders (Stockholder(s), you, or your):







	Why am I receiving these materials?


	Sino Payments, Inc., a Nevada corporation (Company, we, our, or us) is sending you this Information Statement to inform you of corporate actions approved by the Companys Board of Directors and approved by the written consent of Stockholders owning shares of Company Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share, (Common Stock) representing more than 50% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Common Stock. You do not need to take any actions in respect of these corporate actions, which consist of the corporate actions set forth on page 1 of this Information Statement.







	What vote is required to approve each proposed corporate action?




	Each of the proposed corporate actions requires the approval of Shareholders with shares of Common Stock representing more than 50% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the record date of August 2, 2016 (record date).  Written consents representing 15,421,941 shares or 52% approved the five corporate actions as of August 15, 2016.  The number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the record date was 29,656,130 shares.







	What are the purposes of the proposals?







	Election of Directors: Under state law and our by-laws, the Company has to annually elect directors.





	Say on Pay Votes:  The vote on Say-on-Pay and on the frequency of a Say-on-Pay vote are both advisory votes that are not binding on the Company, but the vote or consent is required under Section 14A(a)(2) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (Exchange Act).  The Company believes that the approval by written consent of Stockholders is sufficient.





	Name Change and Trading Symbol: With respect to amending the Articles of Incorporation, the Company wants to change its corporate name to more accurately describe its primary business lines and to conform the name of the Company to a name that is similar to its operating subsidiaries names. The Board of Directors believes that the corporate name change will support a rebranding of the Company and create a corresponding uniform corporate name for any related marketing or public relations campaigns. The proposed new corporate name is similar to the corporate name of the Companys operating subsidiaries, which operating subsidiaries have direct contact with Company customers. Accordingly, the Board believes that the new corporate name will better portray and convey the Companys marketplace identity.





	Pursuit of TSI Stock Acquisition. The Company also wanted the Stockholders to ratify the Company continuing to seek consummation of the proposed acquisition of 1,250 shares of capital stock of TAPServices, Inc., a Philippines technology company, (TSI) for the reasons set forth in Corporate Action: Proposed TSI Stock Acquisition below.







	Why is there no Annual Meeting of Shareholders?


	The Companys Board of Directors and the Stockholders who filed written consents have sufficient voting power to approve or reject any of or all of the proposed corporate actions.  Nevada law allows the Stockholders to approve these proposals by written consent.  As such, holding an annual meeting of shareholders, while such a meeting has certain ancillary benefits, is not necessary to approve or reject the proposed corporate actions.  A written consent avoids the cost of holding an annual meeting, which cost is significant for a small reporting company like the Company.







	Who is paying for the preparation and mailing of the Information Statement


	? The cost of preparing and mailing the Information Statement will be borne by the Company. Banks, brokerage houses and other nominees or fiduciaries will be requested to forward the material to their principals and the Company will, upon request, reimburse them for their expenses in so doing.  The Company estimates the cost of preparing and mailing the Information Statement to be $5,500.







	When do the proposed corporate actions become effective?


	For federal law purposes, the corporate actions are effective twenty (20) days after the mailing of this Information Statement to the Stockholders which mailing should occur on or about September 20, 2016. The name change will take effect for state law purposes upon filing of the amendment to the Articles of Incorporation. The name change and related trading symbol change will also require the approval of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or FINRA for purposes of the public market for the Common Stock.  The Company intends to file for FINRA approval on or about September 6, 2016. FINRA approval, if given, should take two to four weeks.






	1












	Whom should I contact if I have additional questions?


	Stockholders with any questions about this Information Statement or the corporate actions may contact Matthew Mecke, Director of the Company, at the Company address and telephone number on page 1 of this Information Statement or at email: matthew@


	mecke.ch.




	 




	The Companys Board of Directors believes that the corporate actions are either required by law or are in the best interests of the Company and the Stockholders.






	CORPORATE ACTIONS: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS






	At an August 2, 2016 board meeting, the Companys Board of Directors nominated the five incumbent directors, as listed on page 1 of the Information Statement, to stand for shareholder election to the Companys Board of Directors and to serve from date of election to and assumption of offices until their successors are elected and assume office in fiscal year 2017. On August 15, 2016, the Company received sufficient Stockholders written consents to elect those five nominees to the Companys Board of Directors. The profiles of the directors nominated by the Companys Board of Directors and elected by shareholder written consent are:

	CORPORATE ACTION:  ADVISORY, NON-BINDING VOTE TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION






	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 allows our Stockholders to vote to approve, on an advisory and non-binding basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Information Statement and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC or Commission and in accordance with the SECs rules. Specifically, Section 14A(a)(2) of the Exchange Act requires the Company to seek (i) a non-binding advisory shareholder vote (commonly referred to as say-on-pay vote) on its executive compensation program as it is described below in the Executive Compensation section of this Information Statement and (ii) a non-binding advisory shareholder vote on whether the say-on-pay vote should occur every one, two or three years.  The Board of Directors recommended a three-year frequency to its Stockholders.





	Our executive compensation is designed to attract, motivate, and retain our named executive officers, who are critical to our success. Our named executive officers are rewarded by salary for the achievement of specific annual, long-term and strategic goals, business unit goals, corporate goals, and the realization of increased Stockholder value.  





	While cash compensation in the form of base salary is the primary component of our compensation program as of the date of this Information Statement, the Company will evaluate the adoption of a comprehensive stock option and incentive plan from time to time and will consider adoption of such a plan when the Company has reached a level of business and financial performance where appreciation in the public market price of the Common Stock based on the performance of the Company and its management is deemed to be possible. The Company does not anticipate considering additional forms of compensation, including incentive compensation, until 2017.





	Our Board of Directors reviews the compensation for our named executive officers to ensure such compensation achieves the desired goals of aligning our executive compensation structure with our Stockholders interests and current market practices. Stockholder approval is for our named executive officer compensation as described in the compensation section and related compensation tables below. This vote, commonly known as a say-on-pay proposal, gives our equity holders the opportunity to express their views on our named executive officers compensation. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this Information Statement.





	The Company has not created a compensation committee of the Board of Directors as of the date of this Information Statement. The Board of Directors intends to address creation of such a committee prior to the end of 2016.





	The say-on-pay vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on the Company or our Board of Directors. Our Board or Directors values the opinions of Stockholders and to the extent there is any significant vote against the approval the named executive officer compensation as disclosed in this Information Statement, they will consider our Stockholders concerns and the Board of Directors will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns.






	CORPORATE ACTION: ADVISORY, NON-BINDING VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY OF AN ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION






	As part of our Board of Directors commitment to improved corporate governance, and as required by Section 14A(a)(2) of the Exchange Act, the Board of Directors provided Stockholders with an opportunity to provide an advisory vote to determine whether the shareholder vote on named executive officer compensation, or the Say-on-Pay vote, should occur every one, two or three years.





	After careful consideration, the Board of Directors determined that a Say-on-Pay vote that occurs every third year is the most appropriate alternative for our company (as a small reporting company with a limited compensation program).  Therefore, our Board of Directors recommended a frequency of every three years on holding future Say-on-Pay votes. In reaching its recommendation, and since the compensation of the management has not significantly changed over the past few years, the Board of Directors believes that every three years Say-on-Pay vote will allow Stockholders to provide Stockholders with sufficiently meaningful input on our executive compensation philosophy, policies and programs, especially in light of the limited number of Stockholders and the limited turnover in our Stockholder base.





	The options presented for Stockholders approval were one year, two years or three years for frequency of vote on Say-on-Pay. The three-year frequency was approved by sufficient written consents of Stockholders received as of August 15, 2016.

	CORPORATE ACTION: AMEND ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION TO CHANGE CORPORATE NAME







	STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD NOT DESTROY ANY STOCK CERTIFICATES AND SHOULD NOT SUBMIT ANY STOCK CERTIFICATES UNTIL REQUESTED TO DO SO







	Approval

	.  Our Board of Directors approved a resolution at the August 2, 2016 board meeting to change our corporate name from Sino Payments, Inc. to Value Exchange International, Inc. Our Board of Directors believes that the new corporate name will more accurately reflect our current business activities in the area of information technology and computer software and systems development and will conform the Company name to a name that is similar to its operating subsidiaries corporate names (being Value Exchange International). The Board of Directors believes that a common corporate name will allow more efficient and consistent promotion and marketing of the Companys services and products and will enhance marketplace recognition of our Company and its various services and products offered by the operating subsidiaries.






	Effectiveness of the Name Change and Trading Symbol.  

	For state law purposes, the change in our corporate name will become effective upon the filing of an Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Nevada (Amendment). We intend to file the Amendment as soon as practicable after the filing of this Information Statement with the Commission. The name change also requires that we will also will file a submission to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA) for the change of name and in order to receive a new stock trading symbol for our Common Stock.  The request for a new trading symbol is voluntary and sought by the Company to have a trading symbol that is similar to its new corporate name.  While FINRA is not obligated to grant a request by our Company for a specific trading symbol, the Company will seek approval of VEII as the new trading symbol for our Common Stock. FINRA approval, which is not a certainty, will take an estimated two to four weeks.  FINRA may select the new trading symbol and is not obligated to approve our requested trading symbol. The anticipated date of the filing of the FINRA application is September 6, 2016. The Company anticipates that the change in corporate name and trading symbol will be effective on or before October 1, 2016.






	Stockholder Rights

	. Changing the name of our company or trading symbol for our Common Stock will not effect the rights of existing Stockholders.  The proposed name change and proposed trading symbol change will not affect the validity or transferability of currently outstanding stock certificates of the Common Stock, and Stockholders will not be requested to surrender for exchange any stock certificates they hold. Stock certificates issued after the name change is effective will show the new corporate name. Companys stock transfer agent will charge its usual and customary fees for any Stockholder transaction requiring or requesting issuance of new stock certificates showing the new corporate name.






	Exchange Act Registration

	. We will continue to be subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.  Our Common Stock is, currently, registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and, as a result, we are subject to periodic reporting and other requirements.  The corporate name change and change in trading symbol will not affect the registration of our Common Stock or reporting requirements pursuant to the Exchange Act.






	Accounting Consequences

	. There will be no accounting consequences to our Common Stock upon the effect of our corporate name change and trading symbol change.






	No Going Private Transaction

	. The Board of Directors does not intend for the corporate name change or trading symbol change to be the first step in a series of plans or proposals of a going private transaction within the meaning of Rule 13e-3 as promulgated under the Exchange Act.






	CORPORATE ACTION: PURSUIT OF PROPOSED TSI STOCK ACQUISITION






	On January 8, 2015, the Company initiated efforts to reach an agreement to acquire 1,250 shares of the TSI capital stock for cash, which TSI shares represent 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of TSI capital stock, in order to acquire TSI as a wholly-owned subsidiary and to expand Company business into the Philippines. The Companys operating subsidiaries provide, as a service provider, management and consulting services to TSI.  The Company believes that the provision of such services to TSI is made on an at arms length, fair market basis. As previously reported in filings with the Commission, the Company deposited US$200,000 with TSI in January 2015 as a future subscription, conditional deposit on the proposed purchase of the TSI stock and under an agreement in principle. The deposit is refundable in full to the Company if the proposed TSI Stock acquisition is not consummated.






	4










	As of the date of this Information Statement, TSI and the Company have not reached final, mutually acceptable terms and conditions for or a signed, definitive agreement for the proposed TSI Stock acquisition and a condition to preceding with further efforts to consummate the proposed TSI Stock acquisition, being the approval of the PSEC of the transaction, has not been obtained and the Company is not certain of when PSEC will render a decision on this matter.  The previously reported agreement in principle is not legally binding on TSI and the Company. As such, there is no legally binding obligation to consummate the proposed TSI Stock acquisition and, although the Company intends to continue efforts to close this transaction, the proposed TSI Stock acquisition may not occur.  Besides PSEC approval and reaching final terms for and signing a definitive, mutually acceptable agreement, the proposed TSI Stock acquisition will also require the approval of Companys Board of Directors and TSIs Board of Directors of any agreement for the proposed TSI Stock acquisition as well as application of the US$200,000 deposit towards the purchase price of the TSI stock.  Company Stockholder approval of the transaction is not required under Nevada law.





	The Board of Directors approved the continued effort to consummate the proposed TSI Stock acquisition at the August 2, 2016 board meeting and sought Stockholder ratification of the pursuit of the proposed TSI Stock acquisition because of: (1) the delay in seeking closure of the transaction and (2) to ascertain the Stockholders support for (a) Companys intention to expand its business and Companys geographical market reach by acquisitions like the proposed TSI Stock acquisition and (b) Stockholders support for the continued effort to close the proposed TSI Stock acquisition. The delay in seeking closure of this transaction is the result of a combination of circumstances, including: changes in Company management, Company managements attention being diverted to filing stabilizing and enhancing the business and financial condition of the Company and its compliance with filing requirements under the Exchange Act and the pending PSEC review of the proposed TSI Stock acquisition. There can be no assurance that the Company and TSI will reach agreement on and consummate the proposed TSI Stock acquisition. Stockholders approved the continued pursuit of the proposed TSI Stock acquisition by written consents received by August 15, 2016 and representing 15,421,941 shares of Common Stock, or 52% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock eligible to vote on this corporate action (based on 29,656,130 shares of Common Stock being issued and outstanding as of the record date.





	TSIs business line in the Philippines is substantially the same as the Companys business line (as performed by the Companys operating subsidiaries), which business line is: the provision of computer hardware, software, devices, sales terminals and other equipment (collectively, the Products) made by third parties and mostly used in the retail or e-commerce business; and to own, lease, sell, design, install, integrate, maintain, repair, manage, or otherwise commercially exploit the Products, or otherwise provide related information technology or computer consulting services. The Companys operating subsidiaries provide operations management and technology consulting services to TSI as a service provider.






	INTEREST OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN MATTERS TO BE ACTED UPON






	Except as set forth herein, no director, executive officer, as a Director of the Company, and no associate of any of the foregoing persons, has any substantial interest, direct or indirect, by security holding or otherwise, in any matter approved by shareholder written consent, other than elections to directors office.







	POLICY FOR APPROVAL OF RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS








	The disinterested directors of the Companys Board of Directors are responsible for reviewing and approving all related person transactions in accordance with our written policy. Such transactions are generally reviewed before entry into the related person transaction.  If any of our specified officers or directors becomes aware of a related party transaction that has not been previously approved or ratified, such related person transaction will be promptly submitted thereafter to the disinterested directors for their review. In reviewing a transaction, the disinterested directors consider the relevant facts and circumstances, including the benefits to us, any impact on director independence and whether the terms are consistent with a transaction available on an arms-length basis. Only those related person transactions that are determined to be in (or not inconsistent with) our best interests are permitted to be approved. No member of the Board of Directors may participate in any review of a transaction in which the director or any of his or her family members is the related person. The Board of Directors do not believe that any of the corporate actions require related person transaction review and approval.







	CODE OF ETHICS






	We have adopted a written code of ethics that applies to all of our officers, directors and employees, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 14 to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as filed with the SEC on July 20, 2009.

	NO DISSENTERS RIGHTS






	Nevada law and the Companys Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws do not provide for dissenters rights in connection with any of the corporate actions described in this Information Statement.






	COMMON STOCK AND VOTING RIGHTS






	Each share of the Companys Common Stock entitles its holder to one vote on each matter submitted to the Stockholders.  However, because Stockholders with more than 50% of the voting power have consented to the corporate actions by written consents in lieu of a special meeting in accordance with Section 78.320 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, no other Stockholder vote or consent will be solicited in connection with corporate actions.  The Company has no other class of capital stock issued.

	DIRECTOR EXPERIENCE



	 


	Our Board of Directors believes that directors should possess the highest personal and professional ethics, integrity and values, and be committed to representing the long-term interests of the Companys shareholders. When evaluating candidates for election to the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors has sought candidates with certain qualities that it believes are important, including integrity, an objective perspective, good judgment, and leadership skills.

We anticipate that the Board of Directors will authorize the creation of such committees, in compliance with established corporate governance requirements in 2016 or early 2017.

	REPORT OF AUDIT COMMITTEE






	The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with management, and discussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by the statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, as amended. The Audit Committee received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent accountant required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountants communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent accountant the independent accountants independence. Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.





	Signed by Matthew Mecke, Johan Pehrson and Edmund Yeung






	BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEETINGS






	The Board of Directors held four meetings to date in 2016 and at least 75% of all directors attended these four meetings. The Audit Committee met in April 2016 to discuss required matters for the Form 10-K Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 15, 2016.






	COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE BOARD






	While the Board of Directors does not have a formal process for shareholders to send communications to the Board of Directors, each member of the Board of Directors is receptive to receiving communications from our shareholders. Shareholders may send communications to the attention of any Director at our office address on page 1 of this Information Statement.






	LEGAL PROCEEDINGS



	 


	To our knowledge, during the last ten years, none of the directors elected by written consent: (1) had a bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; (2) been convicted in a criminal proceeding or been subject to a pending criminal proceeding, excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses; (3) been subject to any order, judgment or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities; (4) been found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the SEC, or the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended or vacated; or (5) been the subject to, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reverse, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization, any registered entity, or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member.

	Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance






	Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and certain of our officers to file reports of holdings and transactions in Company Common Stock with the SEC. Based on our records and other information, we believe that in 2016 and as of the date of this Information Statement, our directors and our officers who were subject to Section 16(a) met all applicable filing requirements. Section 16(a) compliance for fiscal year 2015 was reported in Part III of the Form 10-K Annual Report of the Company.






	LIMITATION OF DIRECTOR LIABILITY






	Section 78.138 of the Nevada Revised Statutes or NRS provides that a director or officer will not be individually liable unless it is proven that (i) the directors or officers acts or omissions constituted a breach of his or her fiduciary duties, and (ii) such breach involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of the law.





	Section 78.7502 of NRS permits a company to indemnify its directors and officers against expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with a threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding if the officer or director (i) is not liable pursuant to NRS 78.138 or (ii) acted in good faith and in a manner the officer or director reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and, if a criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct of the officer or director was unlawful.






	10










	Section 78.751 of NRS permits a Nevada company to indemnify its officers and directors against expenses incurred by them in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding as they are incurred and in advance of final disposition thereof, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the officer or director to repay the amount if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such officer or director is not entitled to be indemnified by the company. Section 78.751 of NRS further permits the company to grant its directors and officers additional rights of indemnification under its articles of incorporation or bylaws or otherwise.





	Section 78.752 of NRS provides that a Nevada company may purchase and maintain insurance or make other financial arrangements on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, for any liability asserted against him and liability and expenses incurred by him in his capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the company has the authority to indemnify him against such liability and expenses.





	Our Articles of Incorporation provide that no director or officer of the Company will be personally liable to the Company or any of its stockholders for damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer; provided, however, that the foregoing provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director or officer (i) for acts or omissions which involve intentional misconduct, fraud or knowing violation of law, or (ii) the payment of dividends in violation of Section 78.300 of NRS.





	Company Bylaws implement the indemnification and insurance provisions permitted by Chapter 78 of the NRS by providing that the Company shall indemnify its directors to the fullest extent permitted by the NRS and may, if and to the extent authorized by the board of directors, so indemnify its officers and any other person whom it has the power to indemnify against liability, reasonable expense or other matter whatsoever.





	Insofar as indemnification by us for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (Securities Act) may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling the company pursuant to provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification by such director, officer or controlling person of us in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being offered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by us is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.





	Other than as disclosed herein, there is no pending litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors or executive officers to which indemnification is required or permitted, and we are not aware of any threatened litigation or proceeding that may result in a claim for indemnification.

Value Exchange International, Inc. Acquires TapServices, Inc. In Philippines As Part Of Strategic Growth Plan






GlobeNewswire



May 10, 2017 9:15 AM EDT













 
















































 HONG KONG, May 10, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Value Exchange International, Inc., a Nevada U.S.A. corporation based in Hong Kong, (OTCQB:VEII) ("VEII") announced today completion of all conditions to the acquisition of TapServices, Inc., a private information technology ("IT") solutions provider in Philippines, ("TSI").   The acquisition of TSI is part of VEII's strategic plan to expand VEII IT solutions business beyond its traditional base in Hong Kong and adjacent parts of China.   Business of TSI:  Like VEII, TSI is engaged in the business of providing information, data, and communications technology services, to supply and deal in all related products, including computer hardware, software and application products, and to own, design, install, maintain, operate, integrate, sell, lease or otherwise deal in such systems, facilities, gateways, equipment, devices and terminals.  TSI's core market is the Manila region.  TSI has the same retail Point of Sale system end user focus as VEII.  Advantages of Acquisition: VEII believes the acquisition of TSI brings the following strengths to VEII:  - TSI's highly complementary IT solutions business expands the geographic market of VEII; and  - TSI provides a local platform for efforts to increase VEII's customer base outside of Hong Kong-China; and   - Enhances VEII top line growth rates and provides a new revenue source for VEII.

MA Technicals at a Glance For Value Exchange International Inc (VEII) Shares – JCTY News

MA Technicals at a Glance For Value Exchange International Inc (VEII) Shares


July 25, 2017 JCTY Staff Writer     
	










Value Exchange International Inc (VEII) are being closely watched by investors as the firm’s Mesa Adaptive Moving Average (MAMA) has moved above the Fractional Adaptive Moving Average (FAMA), indicating that a potential upward move might be forthcoming.  The MESA Adaptive Moving Average, which was developed by John Ehlers, is a technical trend-following indicator which adapts to price movement “based on the rate change of phase as measured by the Hilbert Transform Discriminator”. This method of adaptation features a fast and a slow moving average so that the composite moving average swiftly responds to price changes and holds the average value until the next bar’s close. The author states that because the average’s fallback is slow, trading systems can be created with almost whipsaw-free trades.
Interested traders may also be keeping an eye on the Williams Percent Range or Williams %R. Williams %R is a popular technical indicator created by Larry Williams to help identify overbought and oversold situations. Investors will commonly use Williams %R in conjunction with other trend indicators to help spot possible stock turning points. Value Exchange International Inc (VEII)’s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R currently sits at -95.75. In general, if the indicator goes above -20, the stock may be considered overbought. Alternately, if the indicator goes below -80, this may point to the stock being oversold.
Another technical indicator that might serve as a powerful resource for measuring trend strength is the Average Directional Index or ADX. The ADX was introduced by J. Welles Wilder in the late 1970’s and it has stood the test of time. The ADX is typically used in conjunction with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) to help spot trend direction as well as trend strength. At the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for Value Exchange International Inc (VEII) is noted at 28.35. Many technical analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal.
Investors may use various technical indicators to help spot trends and buy/sell signals. Presently, Value Exchange International Inc (VEII) has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of -50.95. The CCI was developed by Donald Lambert. The assumption behind the indicator is that investment instruments move in cycles with highs and lows coming at certain periodic intervals. The original guidelines focused on creating buy/sell signals when the reading moved above +100 or below -100. Traders may also use the reading to identify overbought/oversold conditions.
Taking a look at other technical levels, the 3-day RSI stands at 37.64, the 7-day sits at 46.35 and the 14-day (most common) is at 48.54. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is an often employed momentum oscillator that is used to measure the speed and change of stock price movements. When charted, the RSI can serve as a visual means to monitor historical and current strength or weakness in a certain market. This measurement is based on closing prices over a specific period of time. As a momentum oscillator, the RSI operates in a set range. This range falls on a scale between 0 and 100. If the RSI is closer to 100, this may indicate a period of stronger momentum. On the flip side, an RSI near 0 may signal weaker momentum. The RSI was originally created by J. Welles Wilder which was introduced in his 1978 book “New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems”.
Keeping an eye on Moving Averages, the 50-day is 0.07, the 200-day is at 0.03, and the 7-day is 0.07 for Value Exchange International Inc (VEII). Moving averages have the ability to be used as a powerful indicator for technical stock analysis. Following multiple time frames using moving averages can help investors figure out where the stock has been and help determine where it may be possibly going. The simple moving average is a mathematical calculation that takes the average price (mean) for a given amount of time.
