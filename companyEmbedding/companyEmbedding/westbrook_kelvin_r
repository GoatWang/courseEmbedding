Kelvin Westbrook Named BJC HealthCare Board Chair
BJC HealthCare appoints Kelvin R. Westbrook, president and CEO of KRW Advisors, chairman of the board of directors. 

Westbrook has served BJC institutions over the past 15 years, first at Christian Hospital, then St. Louis Children’s Hospital and the BJC board, where he has also served as chair of the compensation committee. 

“Kelvin knows BJC, and he knows the St Louis community,” says Steve Lipstein, BJC president and CEO. “He has always encouraged BJC’s board and leaders to make health care more available, more affordable, endlessly in pursuit of even better patient outcomes. He wants St. Louis to be a healthier community.” 

Prior to founding KRW Advisors, which provides strategic and general business and consulting services in the telecommunications, media and other industries, Westbrook established Millennium Digital Media Systems (now Broadstripe), a broadband telecommunications service provider. He previously served as president and chairman of LEB Communications, Inc., an affiliate of Charter Communications, and as executive vice president of Charter Communications. Earlier in his career, Westbrook was a partner in the national law firm of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker in New York City, where he specialized in mergers and acquisitions and corporate finance. 

An active community member, Westbrook serves on the boards of several public companies including Archer Daniels Midland Company, Camden Property Trust, Stifel Financial Corp. and Commerce Bank (St. Louis), N.A. He is a member of the Washington University School of Medicine National Council and the Business Program Advisory Council of Harris-Stowe State University, and devotes energy to other community projects and charity work in St. Louis. Westbrook has been featured by Black Enterprise as the CEO of one of the nation’s 100 largest businesses owned by African Americans. 

Westbrook becomes the fifth chairman of BJC since its formation in 1993, succeeding Donald Ross, who served as chair since 2009 and remains a member of the board. Previous chairs in addition to Ross were Paul McKee Jr., John Dubinsky and Charles Knight.
