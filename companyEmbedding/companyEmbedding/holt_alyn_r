Alyn Richard Holt of Cherry Hill, NJ passed away suddenly in Marlton, New Jersey on Saturday, May 13, 2017. A Celebration of Life in remembrance of him will be held at a later date, in June.
Alyn Richard Holt was born on September 11, 1937 in Clear Lake, South Dakota. His parents were Claude L. and Eva Irene Rupp Holt. He grew to manhood on the family farm that was opened to agriculture by his grandparents soon after South Dakota established statehood. His heritage of hardy Pennsylvanians and Norwegians who arrived here on tall sailing ships, includes early immigrants, pioneers and a great-grandfather who was a Civil War soldier in attendance at the surrender at Appomattox.
To his family, Alyn Richard Holt was known as Richard or "Dick." To the rest of the world, Alyn was recognized by his given name and those who knew him well often called him"Al." From his beginnings in a one-room country school on the South Dakota Prairie, to Middle School and High Schools in South Dakota and winters in North Hollywood, California, he developed the foundation of his "Never met a Stranger" personality that propelled him to his world-wide recognition.
Alyn graduated from the College of Engineering, South Dakota State University in 1959 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Electrical Engineering. During that time he was a member of the Air Force ROTC. He obtained his Masters Degree in Business at California State University, Fullerton.
In 1981, Alyn R. Holt co-founded inTEST Corporation, Cherry Hill, NJ. He began the company in his garage and demonstrated his product to the semiconductor industry from his Dodge van. From that diffident start, his business evolved into a world-wide enterprise and his travel, which included many frequent round-the-world trips put him in the million mile travel group many times over. He was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of inTEST from its inception. He was pleased when the inTEST team rang the opening bell when the company became a part of the New York Stock Exchange.
Alyn had 40 plus years of experience in the automated test equipment (ATE) Industry. His vocation included general management, marketing management and engineering. From 1973 to 1980, Alyn Holt was Manager of the Measurement Systems Division of Siemens Corporation, a subsidiary of Siemens A.G. Munich, Germany. From 1966 to 1973, he served as Vice President of Marketing for Computest Corporation, a manufacturer of ATE for the computer industry. Mr. Holt was a co-inventor on several of the Company's patents. Alyn began his career at Hughes Aircraft in El Segundo, California, in 1959. He later was transferred to the Fullerton office. It was there in Orange County where he met his future life-mate Connie Smith. In 1961, Alyn Richard Holt and Connie Smith were married at Fullerton California. Their marriage was blessed with two cherished daughters, Stacey Lee and Kristen Doris Holt. Alyn enjoyed his life, and loved his family and friends; he especially liked family gatherings and lunch with his friends. He held his employees in high esteem. He was fond of golf, whether watching it or playing it. He appreciated music and all the fine accoutrements on which it was played.
Alyn is survived by his daughter Kristen Holt Thompson and son-in-law Brian Thompson, three grandchildren: Bradley, Stacey and Trey Thompson, one brother Dale Holt and wife Adina of Clear Lake, SD, six nephews and nieces: Robert and Gary (Ingrid) Lane, North Dakota, David (Mona) Lane and Randy (Sue) Holt, Minnesota, Carey (Kim) Holt and Karna (Marty) Stroschein, South Dakota and numerous cousins and friends.
He was preceded in death by his wife Connie Holt and daughter Stacey Lee Holt, his parents, sister Genie Holt Lane, brothers: Paul K. and C. Lyle.Holt, one sister-in-law and one brother-in-law.
The final resting place for Alyn Richard Holt is with Connie and Stacey in the Memorial Gardens at The Prince of Peace Lutheran Church in Marlton, New Jersey.
Affiliations:
Member of the SDSU Foundation Council of Trustees. He began serving in 1999.
Served on the Lohr College of Engineering Advisory Council

I have always been impressed with Dick's contribution to industry. I am impressed and admire it. He will be sorely missed by you and everyone that knew him.Dick proclaimed in our high school days that he wanted to be a millionaire. Little did we realize that he would accomplish it many times over. As far as I know the only one in our class to accomplish that.I also admire that he kept his faith, generosity and always remembered his friends and associates. We will all remember him as being generous and down-to-earth. I will especially miss his e-mails and shared documents.Only Richard would have a Tesla on order when he passed. He was looking forward to driving it. He planned right up to the end. Working on a goal.Audrey and I will keep you guys in our prayers.

His mother spoke of the clever way he attempted to make shopping easier for her, when he was not yet four years old. They were in a department store and she was looking at dresses and at their price tags which dandling down on cotton strings. He stood-by watching her for a while, then he suddenly disappeared.  Just as quickly he reappeared from between the rows of dresses, Here Mom he said to her, holding up the fistful of price tags that he had removed from some of the dresses, so she could look at them all at once. Chagrinned and underwhelmed, she lay them down on the counter, grabbed little Richard by the arm and made a hasty exit.

One of my fondest memories and what Uncle Richard said was my claim to fame was several years ago I spent a week in Hawaii with him and my first day there we were golfing and we arrived on the first green and He said to me . Randy remember that when you are putting here it always goes toward the water. I quickly reminded him that didn't make any sense as we were on an Island and over the years he has brought that up and we always would have a good laugh over that especially on our weekly calls as he sat in the portable limousine and made his calls. I miss those calls but luckily have some messages saved that he left when I wasn't available to talk. Miss you!!!!!!

I called your father shortly after your mother died.  I feel close to all of your aunts and uncles.  I treasure the memories of your family.  Know that you have my deepest sympathy.  Even though I don't know you personally, I know a lot about you.  I have heard stories from other family members.  Your dad was one great man.  So benevolent to the university from which we both graduated.  So benevolent in all that he did.  It is an honor to be related to such a man.  May God bless your memories.                                              Kay

Mr. Alyn Richard Holt

Born:  September 11, 1937
Died: May 13, 2017
Location: Cherry Hill, New Jersey









Tribute & Message From The Family







Alyn Richard Holt of Cherry Hill, NJ passed away suddenly in Marlton, New Jersey on Saturday, May 13, 2017. A Celebration of Life in remembrance of him will be held at a later date, in June.
Alyn Richard Holt was born on September 11, 1937 in Clear Lake, South Dakota. His parents were Claude L. and Eva Irene Rupp Holt. He grew to manhood on the family farm that was opened to agriculture by his grandparents soon after South Dakota established statehood. His heritage of hardy Pennsylvanians and Norwegians who arrived here on tall sailing ships, includes early immigrants, pioneers and a great-grandfather who was a Civil War soldier in attendance at the surrender at Appomattox.
To his family, Alyn Richard Holt was known as Richard or "Dick." To the rest of the world, Alyn was recognized by his given name and those who knew him well often called him"Al." From his beginnings in a one-room country school on the South Dakota Prairie, to Middle School and High Schools in South Dakota and winters in North Hollywood, California, he developed the foundation of his "Never met a Stranger" personality that propelled him to his world-wide recognition.
Alyn graduated from the College of Engineering, South Dakota State University in 1959 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Electrical Engineering. During that time he was a member of the Air Force ROTC. He obtained his Masters Degree in Business at California State University, Fullerton.
In 1981, Alyn R. Holt co-founded inTEST Corporation, Cherry Hill, NJ. He began the company in his garage and demonstrated his product to the semiconductor industry from his Dodge van. From that diffident start, his business evolved into a world-wide enterprise and his travel, which included many frequent round-the-world trips put him in the million mile travel group many times over. He was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of inTEST from its inception. He was pleased when the inTEST team rang the opening bell when the company became a part of the New York Stock Exchange.
Alyn had 40 plus years of experience in the automated test equipment (ATE) Industry. His vocation included general management, marketing management and engineering. From 1973 to 1980, Alyn Holt was Manager of the Measurement Systems Division of Siemens Corporation, a subsidiary of Siemens A.G. Munich, Germany. From 1966 to 1973, he served as Vice President of Marketing for Computest Corporation, a manufacturer of ATE for the computer industry. Mr. Holt was a co-inventor on several of the Company's patents. Alyn began his career at Hughes Aircraft in El Segundo, California, in 1959. He later was transferred to the Fullerton office. It was there in Orange County where he met his future life-mate Connie Smith. In 1961, Alyn Richard Holt and Connie Smith were married at Fullerton California. Their marriage was blessed with two cherished daughters, Stacey Lee and Kristen Doris Holt. Alyn enjoyed his life, and loved his family and friends; he especially liked family gatherings and lunch with his friends. He held his employees in high esteem. He was fond of golf, whether watching it or playing it. He appreciated music and all the fine accoutrements on which it was played.
Alyn is survived by his daughter Kristen Holt Thompson and son-in-law Brian Thompson, three grandchildren: Bradley, Stacey and Trey Thompson, one brother Dale Holt and wife Adina of Clear Lake, SD, six nephews and nieces: Robert and Gary (Ingrid) Lane, North Dakota, David (Mona) Lane and Randy (Sue) Holt, Minnesota, Carey (Kim) Holt and Karna (Marty) Stroschein, South Dakota and numerous cousins and friends.
He was preceded in death by his wife Connie Holt and daughter Stacey Lee Holt, his parents, sister Genie Holt Lane, brothers: Paul K. and C. Lyle.Holt, one sister-in-law and one brother-in-law.
The final resting place for Alyn Richard Holt is with Connie and Stacey in the Memorial Gardens at The Prince of Peace Lutheran Church in Marlton, New Jersey.

Kristen and family;I am a high school classmate of Dick. We graduated in 1955 from CLHS. I think half of our classmates have been called home at this time. I have always been impressed with Dick's contribution to industry. I am impressed and admire it. He will be sorely missed by you and everyone that knew him.Dick proclaimed in our high school days that he wanted to be a millionaire. Little did we realize that he would accomplish it many times over. As far as I know the only one in our class to accomplish that.I also admire that he kept his faith, generosity and always remembered his friends and associates. We will all remember him as being generous and down-to-earth. I will especially miss his e-mails and shared documents.Only Richard would have a Tesla on order when he passed. He was looking forward to driving it. He planned right up to the end. Working on a goal.Audrey and I will keep you guys in our prayers.

We are going to miss our little brother Richard. He always showed signs of his initiative.  His mother spoke of the clever way he attempted to make shopping easier for her, when he was not yet four years old. They were in a department store and she was looking at dresses and at their price tags which dandling down on cotton strings. He stood-by watching her for a while, then he suddenly disappeared.  Just as quickly he reappeared from between the rows of dresses, Here Mom he said to her, holding up the fistful of price tags that he had removed from some of the dresses, so she could look at them all at once. Chagrinned and underwhelmed, she lay them down on the counter, grabbed little Richard by the arm and made a hasty exit.

One of my fondest memories and what Uncle Richard said was my claim to fame was several years ago I spent a week in Hawaii with him and my first day there we were golfing and we arrived on the first green and He said to me . Randy remember that when you are putting here it always goes toward the water. I quickly reminded him that didn't make any sense as we were on an Island and over the years he has brought that up and we always would have a good laugh over that especially on our weekly calls as he sat in the portable limousine and made his calls. I miss those calls but luckily have some messages saved that he left when I wasn't available to talk. Miss you!!!!!!

To Kristen and family,     My mother was Eloise Holt Jones Anderson.  She was your father's first cousin.  My mother and I were very close to Gene's family and your grandmother.  In 1971 I took your grandmother, Eva Irene, to New England.  She had never been there.  We went to stay with your parents and Stacy.  Their home was our base for travel.  I called your father shortly after your mother died.  I feel close to all of your aunts and uncles.  I treasure the memories of your family.  Know that you have my deepest sympathy.  Even though I don't know you personally, I know a lot about you.  I have heard stories from other family members.  Your dad was one great man.  So benevolent to the university from which we both graduated.  So benevolent in all that he did.  It is an honor to be related to such a man.  May God bless your memories.                                              Kay
