There are two moments when checking on the value of your investments may be almost irresistible: when your balance is soaring—and when it is tanking. But that’s just when emotions have a nasty way of clouding the minds of even the most seasoned investors.





It is better to give your portfolio a regular checkup. At the very least, you should check your asset allocation, once a year, or any time your financial circumstances change significantly—for instance, if you lose your job or get a big bonus. Your checkup is a good time to determine if you need to rebalance your asset mix or reconsider some of your specific investments.
We believe that setting and maintaining your strategic asset allocation are among the most important ingredients in your long-term investment success. No matter what your age or goals, we believe this means being diversified both among and within different types of stocks, bonds, and other investments.

            Why diversify
        
The goal of diversification is not necessarily to boost performance—it won’t ensure gains or guarantee against losses. But once you choose to target a level of risk based on your goals, time horizon, and tolerance for volatility, diversification may provide the potential to improve returns for that level of risk.
To build a diversified portfolio, you should look for assets—stocks, bonds, cash, or others—whose returns haven’t historically moved in the same direction, and to the same degree, and, ideally, assets whose returns typically move in opposite directions. This way, even if a portion of your portfolio is declining, the rest of your portfolio, hopefully, is growing. Thus, you can potentially offset some of the impact of a poorly performing asset class on your overall portfolio.
Another important aspect of building a well-diversified portfolio is that you try to stay diversified within each type of investment.
Within your individual stock holdings, beware of overconcentration in a single stock. For example, you may not want one stock to make up more than 5% of your stock portfolio. Fidelity also believes it’s smart to diversify across stocks by market capitalization (small, mid, and large caps), sectors, and geography. Again, not all caps, sectors, and regions have prospered at the same time, or to the same degree, so you may be able to reduce portfolio risk by spreading your assets across different parts of the stock market. You may want to consider a mix of styles, too, such as growth and value.
Similarly, when it comes to your bond investments, consider varying maturities, credit qualities and durations, which measure sensitivity to interest-rate changes.

            Diversification has proven its long-term value
        
During the 2008–2009 bear market, many different types of investments lost value to some degree at the same time. While it may have felt as though diversification failed during the downturn, it didn’t. The major asset classes were more highly correlated, but diversification still helped contain portfolio losses.
Consider the performance of three hypothetical portfolios: a diversified portfolio of 70% stocks, 25% bonds, and 5% short-term investments; a 100% stock portfolio; and an all-cash portfolio.


Diversification helped limit losses and capture gains during the 2008 financial crisis






 Source: Strategic Advisers, Inc. Hypothetical value of assets held in untaxed accounts of $100,000 in an all cash portfolio; a diversified growth portfolio of 49% U.S. stocks, 21% international stocks, 25% bonds, and 5% short-term investments; and all stock-portfolio of 70% U.S. stocks and 30% international stocks. This chart’s hypothetical illustration uses historical monthly performance from January 2008 through February 2014 from Morningstar/Ibbotson Associates; stocks are represented by the S&P 500 and MSCI EAFE Indexes, bonds are represented by the Barclays U.S. Intermediate Government Treasury Bond Index, and short-term investments are represented by U.S. 30-day T-bills. Chart is for illustrative purposes only and is not indicative of any investment. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.




By the end of February 2009, both the all-stock and the diversified portfolios would have declined. The all-stock portfolio would have lost nearly half of its initial value (–49.7%); however, the diversified portfolio would have lost a bit more than a third (35%). Yes, the diversified portfolio would have declined, but diversification would have helped reduce losses compared with the all-stock portfolio. The all-cash portfolio (1.6%) would have outperformed the all-stock and diversified portfolios over this 14-month period.


Investors have averaged lower returns than some market indexes
January, 1996 – December, 2015






 Source: Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behavior (QAIB) 2015, DALBAR Inc. www.dalbar.com. Average equity fund investor and average bond fund investor performances were  from the DALBAR study, QAIB 2015. See the footnote "DALBAR study" below for important information.





Watching the value of a stock or diversified portfolio fall that much is just the kind of situation that can stir an investor’s emotions—and sometimes lead to short-term decision making, including dumping your stock holdings. Indeed, keeping your money in cash might have seemed like a good idea in February 2009. But look at what happened as market started to come back.
Five years after the bottom, our hypothetical all-stock portfolio would have risen by 162.3%, the diversified portfolio by 99.7%, and the all-cash portfolio by 0.3%. The all-stock portfolio got the biggest lift during the market’s upswing. This is a good example of how such portfolios can behave when the market is in an upward trend—the diversified portfolio may gain less than the all-stock portfolio and more than the all-cash portfolio.
Now let’s look at what happened over a longer cycle. From January 2008 through February 2014, the diversified portfolio was up 29.9 %, while the all-stock portfolio was up 31.8%. This is what diversification is about. It will not maximize gains in rising markets, but it captured most of the gains while delivering less volatility than just investing in stocks.

            The high price of bad timing
        
Why is it so important to have a risk level you can live with? As the example above illustrates, the value of a diversified portfolio usually plays out over time. Unfortunately, many investors struggle to realize the benefits of their investment strategy because in buoyant markets, people tend to chase performance and purchase higher-risk investments. In a market downturn, investors tend to flock to lower-risk investment options, which can lead to missed opportunities during ensuing market recoveries. The degree of underperformance by individual investors has often been the worst during bear markets. Studies have consistently shown that the returns achieved by the average stock or bond fund investor have lagged, often by a large margin, the reported returns of the average stock or bond index.
The data from DALBAR (see chart right) shows that fund investors trail the market significantly. This means the decisions investors make about diversification within and across asset classes and trying to time when to get into or out of the market, as well as about fees or underperforming funds, cause them to generate far lower returns than the overall market.
“Being disciplined as an investor isn’t always easy, but over time it has demonstrated the ability to generate wealth, while market timing has proven to be a costly exercise for many investors,” observes an executive vice president at Fidelity Investments. “Having a plan that includes appropriate asset allocation and regular rebalancing can help investors overcome this challenge.”

            Building a diversified portfolio
        
To start, you need to make sure your asset mix (e.g., stocks, bonds, and short-term investments) is aligned to your investment time frame, financial needs, and comfort with volatility. The sample asset mixes below combine various amounts of stock, bond, and short-term investments to illustrate different levels of risk and return potential.


Choose the amount of stocks you are comfortable with






 Data source: Morningstar Inc., 2016 (1926–2015). Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Returns include the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings. This chart is for illustrative purposes only and does not represent actual or implied performance of any investment option. See footnote two below for detailed information.


The purpose of the target asset mixes is to show how target asset mixes may be created with different risk and return characteristics to help meet a participant's goals. You should choose your own investments based on your particular objectives and situation. Remember, you may change how your account is invested. Be sure to review your decisions periodically to make sure they are still consistent with your goals. 
                                       
                                    




            Diversification is not a one-time task.
        
Once you have a target mix, you need to keep it on track with periodic checkups and rebalancing. If you don’t rebalance, a good run in stocks could leave your portfolio with a risk level that is inconsistent with your goal and strategy.


How an investment mix can change over time






 This chart's hypothetical illustration uses historical monthly performance from January 1996 through December 2015 from Morningstar/Ibbotson Associates; stocks are represented by the S&P 500 and MSCI EAFE Indexes, bonds are represented by Barclays U.S. Intermediate Government Treasury Bond Index, and short-term investments are represented by U.S. 30-day T-bills. Chart is for illustrative purposes only and is not indicative of any investment. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.




What if you don’t rebalance? Let’s look at a hypothetical portfolio over a historical 20-year period to illustrate how changing markets, such as last year’s large rise in the S&P 500, can have an impact on an investment mix—and, in turn, on the amount of risk in a portfolio.
Consider a hypothetical growth portfolio with 70% in stocks (49% U.S. and 21% foreign), 25% bonds, and 5% short-term investments, in January 1996. Two decades later at the end of December 2015, the investment mix has changed dramatically—to 80% in stocks (65% U.S. and 15% foreign), 18% in bonds, and 2% short term (see the chart right).
The resulting increased weight in Stocks (both domestic and foreign) meant the portfolio now had more potential risk. Why? Because while past performance does not guarantee future results, stocks have historically had larger price swings than bonds or cash. This means that when a portfolio skews toward stocks, the portfolio has the potential for bigger ups and downs.1 In fact, as the chart below shows, the portfolio’s risk level as of December 2015 was nearly 13% greater than that of the target mix due to changes in the asset allocation associated with the relative returns to stocks, bonds, and cash. The standard deviation (e.g., risk) was 13.7% for the rebalanced portfolio and 15.5% for the buy and hold portfolio. (Portfolio risk is measured by the annualized standard deviation of monthly returns, which shows the variability of a portfolio’s returns.)2
Let’s take a closer look at the risk levels of the hypothetical portfolio over time. The chart below shows the hypothetical portfolio’s risk for two scenarios: if the investment mix were rebalanced back to the target every year, and if no rebalancing ever took place—in other words, a buy and hold strategy. As you can see, the risk of the buy-and-hold portfolio varied more widely than that of the rebalanced portfolio. On average, during this time period, the buy-and-hold portfolio experienced higher risk (annualized portfolio volatility).
Rebalancing is not just a risk-reducing exercise. The goal is to reset your asset mix to bring it back to the expected and appropriate risk level for you. Sometimes that means reducing risk by increasing the portion of a portfolio in more conservative options, but sometimes it means adding more risk to get back to your target mix. That could mean increasing investments in riskier asset classes such as stocks. Investing is an ongoing process. You need to create a plan, choose appropriate investments, and then conduct regular checkups to keep your portfolio on track. Here are the three steps to do just that:

            1. Know your target investment mix
        
If you haven’t already done so, choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and short-term investments that you consider appropriate for your investing goals. Take into account your financial situation, tolerance for volatility, and when you will need the money you are investing.


Not rebalancing led to more risk over time
(January 1996-December 2015)






 Chart is for illustrative purposes only. The chart depicts observed historical risk based on the performance of broad diversified indexes named in the chart “How an investment mix can change over time.” A portfolio that is not diversified within asset classes may experience different levels of risk. 
                                       
                                    



Stocks have historically had higher potential for growth, and longer time periods can help to smooth out volatility.
On the other hand, if you’ll need the money in just a few years—or if the thought of potentially losing money makes you too nervous—consider a higher allocation to generally less volatile investments such as bonds and short-term investments. By doing this, of course, you’d be trading the potential of higher returns for the potential of lower volatility.

            2. Review your portfolio regularly
        
We suggest you—on your own or in partnership with an investment professional—monitor your asset mix at least annually, or whenever your financial circumstances change, and rebalance your portfolio to correct for significant drift away from the mix you choose. As a guideline, you may want to consider rebalancing if your stock allocation moves away from your target by more than 10 percentage points.

            3. Rebalancing when needed
        
There are a variety of ways to rebalance your portfolio. One is to sell those asset classes you currently have too much of and reinvest the proceeds in those that fall short of your target. But selling securities in taxable accounts generally has tax consequences in the year of a sale, so be sure to consider taxes when making any decisions to sell. A way to rebalance without immediate tax consequences is to invest any new money you have (savings contributions, bonus, etc.), either gradually or all at once, in investments in asset classes that currently fall below your target.
Regardless of which approach you take, one important aspect of rebalancing is that you do it in a way that also keeps your portfolio diversified within each type of investment.
Achieving your long-term goals requires balancing risk and reward. Choosing the right mix of investments and then periodically rebalancing and monitoring your choices can make a big difference in your outcome.

Domestic stocks are represented by the S&P 500® Index, bonds are represented by U.S. intermediate-term government bonds, and short-term assets are based on the 30-day U.S. Treasury bill. Foreign equities are represented by the Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe, Australasia, Far East Index for the period from 1970 to the last calendar year. Foreign equities prior to 1970 are represented by the S&P 500® Index.
              


               2. Source: Strategic Advisers. Portfolio risk is measured using standard deviation, which is a statistical measure of how much a return varies over an extended period of time. The more variable the returns, the larger the standard deviation. Investors may examine historical standard deviation in conjunction with historical returns to decide whether an investment’s volatility would have been acceptable given the returns it would have produced. A higher standard deviation indicates a wider dispersion of past returns and thus greater historical volatility. Standard deviation does not indicate how an investment actually performed, but it does indicate the volatility of its returns over time. Standard deviation is annualized. The returns used for this calculation are not load adjusted.
              


               3. Fidelity Portfolio Advisory Service® is a service of Strategic Advisers, Inc., a registered investment adviser and a Fidelity Investments company. This service provides discretionary money management for a fee.
              


               4. Fidelity Freedom Funds are designed for investors expecting to retire around the year indicated in each fund’s name. Except for the Freedom Income Fund, each fund’s asset allocation strategy becomes increasingly conservative as the fund approaches the target rate and beyond. Ultimately, the funds are expected to merge with the Freedom Income Fund. The investment risk of each Fidelity Freedom Fund changes over time as the fund’s asset allocation changes. The funds are subject to the volatility of the financial markets, including that of equity and fixed income investments in the U.S. and abroad, and may be subject to risks associated with investing in high-yield, small-cap, commodity-linked, and foreign securities. Principal invested is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the funds’ target dates.
              


5. Guarantees subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.


               DALBAR study: DALBAR is an independent, Boston-based financial research firm. Using monthly fund data supplied by the Investment Company Institute, QAIB calculates investor returns as the change in assets after excluding sales, redemptions and exchanges. This method of calculation captures realized and unrealized capital gains, dividends, interest, trading costs, sales charges, fees, expenses and any other costs. After calculating investor returns in dollar terms, two percentages are calculated for the period examined: Total investor return rate and annualized investor return rate. Total return rate is determined by calculating the investor return dollars as a percentage of the net of the sales, redemptions, and exchanges for the period.


Equity performance is represented by the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Index, an unmanaged index of 500 common stocks generally representative of the U.S. stock market. S&P 500® and S&P are registered service marks of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., and are licensed for use by Fidelity Distributors Corporation and its affiliates. Fixed income performance is represented by the Barclays Capital Aggregate Index. The Barclays Capital Aggregate Index is an unmanaged market value–weighted index representing securities that are SEC registered, taxable, and dollar denominated. This index covers the U.S. investment-grade fixed-rate bond market, with index components for a combination of the Barclays Capital government and corporate securities, mortgage-backed pass-through securities, and asset-backed securities. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Performance of an index is not illustrative of any particular investment. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

 Meet the Diversified Portfolios Team
Defined by our independence and dedication to acting in your best interest, Diversified Portfolios, Inc. is a wealth management firm based in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. A passion for building long-term relationships and a reliance on a fact-based investing process led us to found our partnership.
As financial services industry veterans, we’ve seen how a focus on investment performance and conflicts of interest over fees can distort the financial planning process and make it harder – rather than easier – for you to realize your goals. That’s why 100 percent of our compensation comes from advisory fees. We do not receive compensation from any other sources. Unlike brokers and bank-based advisors, we are fiduciaries and must put our clients’ needs before our own.
Combined, we have more than 80 years of experience in financial and investment planning. Whatever your situation – from a complex estate planning puzzle to a retirement income distribution issue and everything in between – we’ve either encountered it before or can bring to bear the weight of our collective knowledge to solve it.
