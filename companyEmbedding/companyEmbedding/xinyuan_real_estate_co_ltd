BEIJING, May 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Xinyuan Real Estate Co., Ltd. ("Xinyuan" or the "Company") (NYSE:   XIN), an NYSE-listed real estate developer and property manager primarily in China and recently in other countries, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.








First Quarter 2017 Highlights

Total first quarter revenue increased 19.2% to US$280.7 million from US$235.4 million in the first quarter of 2016. 
Contract sales increased 9.2% to US$305.4 million from US$279.6 million in the first quarter of 2016. 
Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") expenses as a percent of total revenue decreased to 12.6% from 13.4% in the first quarter of 2016. 
Net income was US$7.4 million, compared to US$6.9 million in the first quarter of 2016. 
Diluted net earnings per American Depositary Share ("ADS") attributable to shareholders were US$0.11, compared to US$0.09 in the first quarter of 2016. 
The Company repurchased 1,367,400 ADSs at a total cost of approximately US$7.2 million in the first quarter of 2017.

Mr. Yong Zhang, Xinyuan's Chairman, stated, "Our first quarter results were generally in line with our expectations under the current government's restrictive policies impacting China's overall housing market. We achieved approximately 20% revenue growth which was partially driven by improved average selling prices ("ASP") as well as healthy sales from our Brooklyn, New York-based Oosten project, which contributed over 20% to our total sales this quarter. The majority of our development projects in China performed in line with our budget in the first quarter and we maintained a cautious approach to unit sales volume and operating expenses given the current environment. Among Xinyuan's U.S. projects, our Oosten project has sold 38 units as of the end of the first quarter. Our second New York project, located in Manhattan, began excavation and foundation work, and our third New York project, located in Queens, continues to move through its planning stage for development.  
On the financing front, we closed our offering of US$300 million 7.75% senior notes due 2021 at the end of February to further optimize our financial structure. This transaction in the first quarter is reflective of our focus on improving our debt structure and managing interest payments over the longer term. In addition, our property management service entity, Xinyuan Technology Service Co., Ltd., successfully listed on National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ) in China in this quarter, which we expect to provide better financing opportunities in the future.
As we look ahead, we continue to develop our planning stage projects more cautiously given the current environment. For the remaining quarters of this year, our goal is to generate positive cash flows from our operations, optimize pricing of our China and U.S.-based unit sales, commence pre-sales for four to five of our new planning stage projects, complete select land acquisitions and move forward with the next stages of development for our New York City-based projects. We are pleased to pay our 21st consecutive quarterly dividend and our recent $40 million share repurchase announcement demonstrates our commitment to delivering value for our shareholders," concluded Mr. Zhang.
First Quarter 2017 Financial Results
Contract Sales
Contract sales in China totaled US$240.8 million in the first quarter compared to US$279.6 million in the first quarter of 2016. The Company's GFA sales in China were 140,300 square meters in the first quarter of 2017 compared to 206,600 square meters in the first quarter of 2016. The ASP per square meter sold in China was RMB11,820 (US$1,717) in the first quarter of 2017 compared to RMB8,839 (US$1,354) in the first quarter of 2016. The ASP increase was due to the product mix of units sold and the Company's strategic adjustment efforts to maintain pricing stability. Contract sales in the United States totaled US$64.6 million in the first quarter of 2017.

Real Estate Project Update in the United States
In the first quarter of 2017, our Brooklyn, New York-based Oosten project delivered 38 units with revenue of approximately $65 million. As of the end of March 2017, total units sold and revenue of this project had reached 144 units and $217 million, respectively, and the construction loan had been completely paid off. Most closed buyers had moved in. Also during the first quarter, local market demand and price trends remained healthy in both Manhattan and Brooklyn. Both saw modest year-on-year unit price increases with Brooklyn enjoying slightly higher increases. We also observed a meaningful drop in new condominium inventory year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter in both Manhattan and Brooklyn. In particular, Brooklyn new development condo unit inventory saw a 22% quarter-on-quarter decrease during the first quarter. 
Xinyuan's second New York project, located in midtown Manhattan, had completed demolition, and excavation and foundation work had begun. In the first quarter, the Company successfully closed a $108 million construction loan from a major commercial bank. 
For our project located in Queens, New York, the company has selected a general contractor and is in the planning stage of the ground-up development. We are also in discussions with several financial institutions regarding construction financing in order to commence construction.

Advanced Social Media Training Online Lead Generation Top Trainers in the Country

Should Agents be using social media, you ask? Facebook, YouTube and Twitter? Yes! There has been a fundamental shift in how businesses reach customers, and more importantly how Real Estate Agents reach buyers and sellers. Think outside your traditional marketing box.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
