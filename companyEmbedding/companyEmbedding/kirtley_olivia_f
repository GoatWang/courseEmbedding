A Director’s Perspective on Subsidiary Governance: Olivia F. Kirtley







 







Olivia Kirtley






 
Olivia Kirtley, a non-executive director of U.S. Bancorp, Papa John’s International, and ResCare, Inc., and president of the International Federation of Accountants (IFA), examines the multidimensional environment of subsidiary governance and highlights leading practices organizations can take to better align the governance of parents and their subsidiaries.
In her role at the IFA she leads an organization which includes over 175 member bodies in 130 countries representing almost three million accountants. She also is a past chairman of the board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the National Association of Corporate Directors has named Ms. Kirtley as one of the top 100 corporate directors and governance professionals in the U.S.
Following is an excerpt of an interview with Ms. Kirtley which originally appeared in Deloitte’s On the Board’s Agenda publication.
Q: In organizations that consist of a parent and subsidiaries, governance of the full enterprise is often shared between the boards of the parent and the subsidiaries. What are the key issues for parent boards?
Olivia F. Kirtley: Transparency and accountability—it’s as simple as that. A lot of what goes on at the subsidiary level may be outside the control of the parent. For example, a subsidiary board may need to deal with issues unique to the subsidiary’s own circumstances, including issues that are dictated by local regulatory or other national requirements. Therefore, it is important that the parent board knows the issues being discussed by the subsidiary board, and is assured that all of the appropriate issues are being addressed. When something important comes up, mechanisms and protocols need to be in place as to elevate these matters to a higher level for awareness, follow up, remediation or any other reason.
Having said that, it’s always a challenge for the parent board to know how to interact with its subsidiaries, how frequently to interact, what type of information subsidiaries should be asked to provide and at what point the parent board needs to be involved with certain matters. There isn’t a one‑size‑fits‑all answer for how to go about doing that, other than to say the basic goal should be transparency and accountability.
Q: Subsidiary boards need to act in the best interests of the subsidiary, but also have a responsibility to the parent organization. How should the subsidiary board balance these responsibilities?
Olivia F. Kirtley: Ideally, the interests of the parent and subsidiary will be aligned, but when that isn’t the case, it is the subsidiary board’s responsibility to make sure the parent understands why a particular solution or course of action is not a good one for the subsidiary. In some situations, it may be that the proposed solution is not the optimal one for the subsidiary, or could be just a matter of preference.
On the other hand, the issue may be about something substantial, for example because of a difference in business models, a difference in the format for accumulating data or because the solution may be overly expensive or difficult for the subsidiary to implement. In these situations, it is important for the subsidiary board to make its case to the parent so the parent is aware of the issues and the related consequences. This will allow the parent to weigh all of the pros and cons when making choices for the entire organization.
Q: Would having common directors on both the parent and subsidiary boards help facilitate transparency?
Olivia F. Kirtley: That is certainly a good practice. There often are cross-over directors on the parent and subsidiary boards, but those individuals are not always parent company independent directors; sometimes, senior members of management of the parent company will serve on the subsidiary board. They are normally expected to report up to the parent on any issues arising from the subsidiary’s board or committee meetings that would be viewed as significant and of interest to the parent’s full board or its committees.
Q: Historically, organizations weren’t always fully aware of the risks facing their subsidiaries. Are they better understanding these risks today?
Olivia F. Kirtley: There’s no one answer to this because different organizations are at different levels of maturity in their risk model, and some are much more mature than others. However, after the global financial crisis, the whole subject of risk began building momentum. It was no longer a case of just going through the exercise and having a risk assessment, but one of actively monitoring, mitigating and following existing and emerging risks.
When it comes to risk, I think there are two big dangers. One is not having a true understanding at the parent level of the culture, climate and environment that the subsidiaries operate in. The other is to assess risk based solely on materiality, because some risks are extremely disproportionate to their financial materiality. For instance, most anti-money laundering or anti-bribery regulations have very low tolerance levels—it’s not a materiality issue, it’s an event issue—and that can really have very disproportionate consequences to the financial issue at hand.
I think there is a lot of room for improvement, though many companies’ risk processes may be very good. But depending on how they’re structured, how centralized or decentralized their compliance and their risk processes are, the diversity of their human capital, and the parent board’s awareness of cultural norms, and what happens within and across national borders, I think that most boards should pay close attention to the way risks are being identified, monitored, and mitigated.
Q: Would rotating management between the parent and subsidiaries help the overall organization better understand its risks?
Olivia F. Kirtley: Some companies certainly do that and have done it for a long time. I think it not only increases the knowledge management has of the subsidiaries, but sometimes, particularly with an acquisition, it is the best way to ensure that the organization’s culture gets embedded into the new organization. Things can be written on a piece of paper, such as a code of conduct, but only by seeing it in real time can you tell how that code is being interpreted and adopted. When an organization feels it needs to quickly get its values embedded into a new subsidiary, particularly one in a developing country that may have less experience with large, formal corporate structures, putting parent company management into the subsidiary’s operations may be the best approach.
Q: Is technology making the task of subsidiary oversight easier?
Olivia F. Kirtley: Technology is certainly very helpful, particularly when the parent and subsidiaries are on common platforms, because it allows for the retrieval of data in real time, the gathering of data in various formats, or the manipulation of huge amounts of data to show trends or patterns. With technology, the collection and analysis of data is not dependent on it going through someone else’s human hands. Instead, you can retrieve the data yourself, in whatever format you want, and do it in real time.
Many organizations, however, may not be on common platforms and that makes data collection and analysis across the parent and subsidiaries a challenge. To maximize the effectiveness of their technologies, I think we will see organizations increasingly moving to centralized data systems and common platforms.

Managing Risk in an Age of Social Media

                          Social media channels provide many opportunities for brands, but they also pose significant threats. By enlisting support from chief marketing officers (CMOs), knowing which questions to ask, developing plans and leveraging available tools, board members may be better prepared to help their organizations manage risk in the digital environment. Learn what steps CMOs can take to help boards in these efforts and the questions boards can pose to CMOs and other senior executives to help clarify brand positioning and mitigate potential damage on social media.
                        



PCAOB Adopts Changes to the Auditor’s Report

                          The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) adopted a new auditing standard aimed at increasing the informational value, usefulness and relevance of the auditor’s report. The standard retains the PCAOB’s current pass/fail opinion of the existing auditor’s report, and includes several significant modifications, including enhanced descriptions of the auditor’s roles and responsibilities, communication of critical audit matters and disclosure of auditor tenure. Learn what other key changes are part of the new standard and on what areas of the standard management and boards might want to focus.
                        



Strategic Shifts Can Bring CFO Recruiting and Succession Challenges

                          Rising expectations from CEOs and boards for CFOs to play a greater part as business leaders, even leading company-wide transformations, is producing significant ripple effects on finance talent development, succession planning and recruitment, according to Bryan Proctor, head of the Financial Officer Center of Expertise at Korn Ferry. Mr. Proctor describes how some organizations are adapting, such as by seeking out “superstar No. 2s”—executives with both a breadth of experience in leading change and the necessary depth in finance to support transformations—and developing rigorous succession planning discipline.

Creating Value Through Compliance Modernization

                          The foundational role of compliance is to prevent, detect, respond to and remediate risk. A modernized compliance function, however, can shift beyond its traditional role of value protection toward value creation. Modernizing the function entails taking a broad view of the way compliance is governed, how oversight processes are designed and executed, and how technology and analytics can be utilized to provide insight and value. It also takes into account the number and nature of connection points to other parts of the risk management organization or to the business.
                        



How Chief Compliance Officers Can Make an Immediate Impact

                          Although chief compliance officers (CCOs) are commonplace in large, heavily regulated industries, getting a seat at the highest levels of an organization isn’t always a given. CCOs, however, can be important contributors to their organizations’ strategic agendas, according to Keith Darcy, independent senior advisor to Deloitte & Touche LLP and former executive director of the Ethics & Compliance Officer Association; and Maureen Mohlenkamp, a Deloitte Risk and Financial Advisory principal at Deloitte & Touche LLP, who both conduct transition labs for incoming CCOs. They discuss why a CCO’s first 180 days is a critical window for setting an agenda, and the importance of strategic alignment at the enterprise level.
                        



Strengthening Government Contract Compliance

                          Government contract work is highly regulated, and government audits of a contractor’s finances, processes and controls can help tighten procedures, but also reveal issues that may expose organizations to compliance and business risks. Understand what contractors can expect from a government audit and some common compliance challenges. Further, learn practical steps executives can take to address contract risk and compliance issues, including creating a culture of compliance and open communication and acquiring the tools that allow organizations to identify anomalies and trends.

Gaining Control of Earnings Calls

                          In the eleventh hour before an earnings call many C-suite executives can be found combing through metrics, spreadsheet data and the output from analytical models, searching for insights that could help them communicate to investors and analysts a narrative about performance. Learn how streamlining the information production process on the front end may help executives in gaining insights to manage the business and in crafting a more effective message to the investment community. Also, understand how focusing on what drives the business when creating a narrative can create a feedback loop that operationalizes the organization’s strategy.
                        



Risk Managers Less Confident About Newer Risks, Cybersecurity: Global Survey

                          Risk management executives are less confident about their organization’s ability to combat newer risks, such as model risk and third-party risks, while cybersecurity remains an area of significant concern, according to the 10th edition of Deloitte’s Global Risk Management survey. The survey findings, which comprise responses from 77 financial services institutions around the world, indicate that areas of increasing maturity in risk management programs include more active board oversight and increased adoption of the CRO position. Nevertheless, risk management programs may need to increase their ability to anticipate and respond flexibly to new regulatory and business developments.
                        



Auto Sector Compliance: Weighing the Benefits of ISO Anti-Bribery Guidance

                          The anti-bribery management standards issued by the Geneva-based International Organization for Standardization (ISO) provide automotive companies, as well as global organizations in other sectors, with new guidance and tools that could potentially help mitigate the risks and costs of noncompliance with anti-bribery laws. Learn about the global nature of the new ISO guidance, as well as other considerations for any organization considering incorporating it into their ethics and compliance program.

A Director’s Perspective on Subsidiary Governance: Olivia F. Kirtley







 







Olivia Kirtley






 
Olivia Kirtley, a non-executive director of U.S. Bancorp, Papa John’s International, and ResCare, Inc., and president of the International Federation of Accountants (IFA), examines the multidimensional environment of subsidiary governance and highlights leading practices organizations can take to better align the governance of parents and their subsidiaries.
In her role at the IFA she leads an organization which includes over 175 member bodies in 130 countries representing almost three million accountants. She also is a past chairman of the board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the National Association of Corporate Directors has named Ms. Kirtley as one of the top 100 corporate directors and governance professionals in the U.S.
Following is an excerpt of an interview with Ms. Kirtley which originally appeared in Deloitte’s On the Board’s Agenda publication.
Q: In organizations that consist of a parent and subsidiaries, governance of the full enterprise is often shared between the boards of the parent and the subsidiaries. What are the key issues for parent boards?
Olivia F. Kirtley: Transparency and accountability—it’s as simple as that. A lot of what goes on at the subsidiary level may be outside the control of the parent. For example, a subsidiary board may need to deal with issues unique to the subsidiary’s own circumstances, including issues that are dictated by local regulatory or other national requirements. Therefore, it is important that the parent board knows the issues being discussed by the subsidiary board, and is assured that all of the appropriate issues are being addressed. When something important comes up, mechanisms and protocols need to be in place as to elevate these matters to a higher level for awareness, follow up, remediation or any other reason.
Having said that, it’s always a challenge for the parent board to know how to interact with its subsidiaries, how frequently to interact, what type of information subsidiaries should be asked to provide and at what point the parent board needs to be involved with certain matters. There isn’t a one‑size‑fits‑all answer for how to go about doing that, other than to say the basic goal should be transparency and accountability.
Q: Subsidiary boards need to act in the best interests of the subsidiary, but also have a responsibility to the parent organization. How should the subsidiary board balance these responsibilities?
Olivia F. Kirtley: Ideally, the interests of the parent and subsidiary will be aligned, but when that isn’t the case, it is the subsidiary board’s responsibility to make sure the parent understands why a particular solution or course of action is not a good one for the subsidiary. In some situations, it may be that the proposed solution is not the optimal one for the subsidiary, or could be just a matter of preference.
On the other hand, the issue may be about something substantial, for example because of a difference in business models, a difference in the format for accumulating data or because the solution may be overly expensive or difficult for the subsidiary to implement. In these situations, it is important for the subsidiary board to make its case to the parent so the parent is aware of the issues and the related consequences. This will allow the parent to weigh all of the pros and cons when making choices for the entire organization.
Q: Would having common directors on both the parent and subsidiary boards help facilitate transparency?
Olivia F. Kirtley: That is certainly a good practice. There often are cross-over directors on the parent and subsidiary boards, but those individuals are not always parent company independent directors; sometimes, senior members of management of the parent company will serve on the subsidiary board. They are normally expected to report up to the parent on any issues arising from the subsidiary’s board or committee meetings that would be viewed as significant and of interest to the parent’s full board or its committees.
Q: Historically, organizations weren’t always fully aware of the risks facing their subsidiaries. Are they better understanding these risks today?
Olivia F. Kirtley: There’s no one answer to this because different organizations are at different levels of maturity in their risk model, and some are much more mature than others. However, after the global financial crisis, the whole subject of risk began building momentum. It was no longer a case of just going through the exercise and having a risk assessment, but one of actively monitoring, mitigating and following existing and emerging risks.
When it comes to risk, I think there are two big dangers. One is not having a true understanding at the parent level of the culture, climate and environment that the subsidiaries operate in. The other is to assess risk based solely on materiality, because some risks are extremely disproportionate to their financial materiality. For instance, most anti-money laundering or anti-bribery regulations have very low tolerance levels—it’s not a materiality issue, it’s an event issue—and that can really have very disproportionate consequences to the financial issue at hand.
I think there is a lot of room for improvement, though many companies’ risk processes may be very good. But depending on how they’re structured, how centralized or decentralized their compliance and their risk processes are, the diversity of their human capital, and the parent board’s awareness of cultural norms, and what happens within and across national borders, I think that most boards should pay close attention to the way risks are being identified, monitored, and mitigated.
Q: Would rotating management between the parent and subsidiaries help the overall organization better understand its risks?
Olivia F. Kirtley: Some companies certainly do that and have done it for a long time. I think it not only increases the knowledge management has of the subsidiaries, but sometimes, particularly with an acquisition, it is the best way to ensure that the organization’s culture gets embedded into the new organization. Things can be written on a piece of paper, such as a code of conduct, but only by seeing it in real time can you tell how that code is being interpreted and adopted. When an organization feels it needs to quickly get its values embedded into a new subsidiary, particularly one in a developing country that may have less experience with large, formal corporate structures, putting parent company management into the subsidiary’s operations may be the best approach.
Q: Is technology making the task of subsidiary oversight easier?
Olivia F. Kirtley: Technology is certainly very helpful, particularly when the parent and subsidiaries are on common platforms, because it allows for the retrieval of data in real time, the gathering of data in various formats, or the manipulation of huge amounts of data to show trends or patterns. With technology, the collection and analysis of data is not dependent on it going through someone else’s human hands. Instead, you can retrieve the data yourself, in whatever format you want, and do it in real time.
Many organizations, however, may not be on common platforms and that makes data collection and analysis across the parent and subsidiaries a challenge. To maximize the effectiveness of their technologies, I think we will see organizations increasingly moving to centralized data systems and common platforms.

Mr. Proctor describes how some organizations are adapting, such as by seeking out “superstar No. 2s”—executives with both a breadth of experience in leading change and the necessary depth in finance to support transformations—and developing rigorous succession planning discipline.

Creating Value Through Compliance Modernization

                          The foundational role of compliance is to prevent, detect, respond to and remediate risk. A modernized compliance function, however, can shift beyond its traditional role of value protection toward value creation. Modernizing the function entails taking a broad view of the way compliance is governed, how oversight processes are designed and executed, and how technology and analytics can be utilized to provide insight and value. It also takes into account the number and nature of connection points to other parts of the risk management organization or to the business.
                        



How Chief Compliance Officers Can Make an Immediate Impact

                          Although chief compliance officers (CCOs) are commonplace in large, heavily regulated industries, getting a seat at the highest levels of an organization isn’t always a given. CCOs, however, can be important contributors to their organizations’ strategic agendas, according to Keith Darcy, independent senior advisor to Deloitte & Touche LLP and former executive director of the Ethics & Compliance Officer Association; and Maureen Mohlenkamp, a Deloitte Risk and Financial Advisory principal at Deloitte & Touche LLP, who both conduct transition labs for incoming CCOs. They discuss why a CCO’s first 180 days is a critical window for setting an agenda, and the importance of strategic alignment at the enterprise level.
                        



Strengthening Government Contract Compliance

                          Government contract work is highly regulated, and government audits of a contractor’s finances, processes and controls can help tighten procedures, but also reveal issues that may expose organizations to compliance and business risks. Understand what contractors can expect from a government audit and some common compliance challenges. Further, learn practical steps executives can take to address contract risk and compliance issues, including creating a culture of compliance and open communication and acquiring the tools that allow organizations to identify anomalies and trends.

                          Risk management executives are less confident about their organization’s ability to combat newer risks, such as model risk and third-party risks, while cybersecurity remains an area of significant concern, according to the 10th edition of Deloitte’s Global Risk Management survey. The survey findings, which comprise responses from 77 financial services institutions around the world, indicate that areas of increasing maturity in risk management programs include more active board oversight and increased adoption of the CRO position. Nevertheless, risk management programs may need to increase their ability to anticipate and respond flexibly to new regulatory and business developments.

Women in Business Q&A: Olivia F. Kirtley, President, International Federation of Accountants (IFAC)






By Laura Dunn

































Olivia Kirtley, CPA, CGMA, became president of the IFAC Board in November 2014. She previously served as deputy president from 2012 to 2014 and was first elected to the Board in November 2007. Ms. Kirtley also served on the independent IFAC Task Force on Rebuilding Public Confidence in Financial Reporting in 2002 and 2003.
Ms. Kirtley is a business consultant on strategic, risk, and governance issues. She is also a non-executive director of three public companies - U.S. Bancorp, Papa John's International, Inc., and ResCare, Inc. She was previously vice president of finance and chief financial officer of a global manufacturing company and a joint venture of Emerson Electric Co. and Robert Bosch GmbH.  Ms. Kirtley spent the first decade of her career with Ernst & Ernst/Ernst & Whinney (now EY) in both audit and tax.
In 1998, Ms. Kirtley was elected chairman of the Board of Directors of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). From 2000 to 2003, Ms. Kirtley was chairman of the AICPA Board of Examiners, where she led computerization of the Uniform CPA Examination with substantial changes to the content and structure. Ms. Kirtley is the recipient of the AICPA's highest honor, the Gold Medal, in recognition of her exemplary leadership and service to the accountancy profession.  In 2010, she was also named to NACD Directorship 100 by the National Association of Corporate Directors as one of the leading 100 corporate directors and governance professionals in the U.S.
Ms. Kirtley has a master's degree in taxation from Georgia State University and a bachelor's degree in accounting from Florida Southern College.
How has your life experience made you the leader you are today? 
As a child growing up in a small rural town in Kentucky, I was fortunate to have parents who told me I could be anything I wanted to be if I worked hard.  From an early age, I had jobs during summers and school holidays. By the age of 16, I was managing a swimming pool and supervising a crew on a farm. It wasn't until I left my small community for college in Florida that I realized how unusual this was for a woman at that time, much less a young girl. I very much enjoyed making decisions and being in charge, so I was determined that my gender would not define my choices.   In college, I had numerous student leadership roles and was the only woman in my class who graduated from my business school in accounting.
I've been incredibly fortunate to have many opportunities to lead throughout my career, both in employment and volunteer roles.  I've also traveled extensively and worked in different cultures, experienced the ups and downs of economic cycles, and seen first-hand how leadership - both good and bad - can impact the success of organizations and individuals. 
I think all of these experiences have made me a person who considers leadership to be an honor.  I've learned that the primary role of a leader is to serve - to help others succeed in whatever they do and to facilitate the achievement of agreed-upon strategies and goals. 
How has your previous employment experience aided your position at IFAC? 
My background is a bit different to previous IFAC Presidents. I'm the first to come into this role as a professional accountant in business, in addition to having public accounting experience.  
I spent the first decade of my career with one of the large international firms--but my last three decades have been spent in the corporate world, as a CFO; as a non-executive director of publicly listed companies; as an audit committee chair; and as a consultant on governance structures and risk management.  
The one role I haven't had in the financial reporting system is that of a regulator... but I can assure you, I've spent plenty of time with them, particularly as an audit committee chair. 
I believe my experience in so many different roles gives me a unique perspective on the issues impacting our profession. I am a member of the profession. I am client of the profession. I rely on the profession. And I want professional accountants around the world to be the best they can be - for our profession and in the public interest.  
What have been the highlights and challenges been during your tenure at IFAC?
I first joined the IFAC Board in 2007 - just before the global financial crisis. The last seven years has encompassed extraordinary financial and sovereign debt issues. They are still ongoing in many countries.  IFAC has dealt with some exceptional challenges as a result, including working with member bodies, policy makers, and global regulators to identify ways that the risks of corporate failures and financial crises can be mitigated going forward.  We have not always agreed with regulators on the best way forward, particularly when calls for action inspire changes with potential unintended consequences, but we continue to engage in dialogue and speak out in the public interest. 
One of the most exciting challenges has been IFAC's focus on professional accountancy organization development around the world.  Last year IFAC was granted several million dollars from the UK government to support the growth of the profession in countries that desperately need accountants to help support strong, verifiable, financial reporting that will help attract inward investment.  We recently announced the first three countries that will benefit from this grant - Rwanda, Ghana and Uganda.
And on a personal note, I was elected President officially at the World Congress of Accountants in Rome in November 2014 - a humbling and exciting experience- and my first official role was to make a speech at the Vatican, to which Pope Francis had invited World Congress attendees for a private audience.  The challenge came when I learned just a few days before that my speech had to be made in Italian!  Pope Francis was very gracious and encouraging as I worked through my remarks, and his speech to our group was most inspiring, regarding the importance of accountants in fighting corruption and poverty by encouraging accountable and transparent financial systems.
What advice can you offer women who are seeking a career in financial services?
First of all, there's no substitute for competence, so devote yourself to learning and expanding your knowledge, not only of financial services sector, but also of business generally. But competence must be accompanied by confidence, which can only be gained through experience.  So my primary message would be to raise your hand, take the risk of accepting new challenges and opportunities. There are several studies that say men accept assignments or seek promotions when they are only partially prepared, whereas most women do so only with a much greater level of preparedness. Don't wait until you think you are 100% prepared - few of us really are.  Go for it.  The experience you'll obtain will be invaluable and lead to bigger opportunities in the future.  
How do you maintain a work/life balance?
That's an ongoing challenge, and I'm not always successful.  But I try to use the 80/20 rule - striving to have the proper balance at least 80% of the time.  That has been more difficult at certain stages of my career and family.  However, having an infrastructure at home allowed me to spend quality time with my children and husband which has always been a top priority.  The other challenge is being disciplined about disconnecting from all the connectivity we have - email, smart phones, and tablets.  That is something I could do better at, and I'm trying to be more disciplined.  
What do you think is the biggest issue for women in the workplace? 
There are at least two big issues, other than the confidence issue I mentioned earlier.  They are legacy workplace issues - i.e. not changing to accommodate greater use of remote technology and allowing more flexible office time - and unconscious biases of both men and women.   We must tackle both of these issues to increase our success in retaining women and hiring them into senior management roles.  
How has mentorship made a difference in your professional and personal life? 
I've been lucky to have been inspired by terrific people - both men and women - throughout my personal and professional lives.  From parents who gave me every encouragement, to a husband who was my biggest encourager while he excelled in his own career as a physician, to professionals in all walks of life. My involvement outside my workplace, in the accounting profession and non-profit organizations, was particularly significant in providing some wonderful mentors.
Which other female leaders do you admire and why?
They are numerous.  There are several women world leaders, past and present, who have demonstrated outstanding leadership on very complex situations.  Among the several current women executives that I admire is Sheryl Sandberg.  She has not only been a  leader and visionary early adopter of new technology that's transforming the way we live, work and interact with each other, but she's also given back by writing  a terrific book to encourage other women along their leadership journey.
And leadership isn't always about age or experience.  We have much to learn from young women too.  Who could fail to be impressed by the poise, bravery and boldness of Malala Yousafzai?  She was shot for being a girl who wanted an education - and continues to campaigns for girls' rights to an education.  She is an utterly amazing young woman and gives a whole new meaning to leading by example.  
What do you want IFAC to accomplish in the next year?
IFAC is the global voice of the accounting profession.  As regulators ponder changes to financial reporting and audit processes, I'm looking forward to engaging with as many as possible.  
I'm looking forward to further progress in our program to support the growth of professional accountancy organizations in developing countries; supporting diversity and inclusion programs in the profession to help build talent; and looking at ways in which we can further encourage technology solutions for sharing best practice and information with our peers all over all the world.
