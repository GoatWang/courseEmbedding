Conatus Pharmaceuticals - Unique Positioning In The NASH Field - Conatus Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:CNAT) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Conatus Pharmaceuticals - Unique Positioning In The NASH FieldDec. 1.16 | About: Conatus Pharmaceuticals (CNAT) Matthew Michniewicz Long only, Deep Value, special situations, GrowthSummaryFocus on NASH cirrhosis treatment with less industry competition than NASH fibrosis treatments provides CNAT with an alternate path to market.Although further behind NASH competition in pipeline maturity, lead product Emricasan has great potential for combination treatments.Market activity picking up, as competition tightens and larger firms look to pick up smaller players to enter the field.Conatus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:CNAT) is an early-stage developmental biotechnology company in the liver disease field. Its lead compound, emricasan, is an oral pan-caspase protease inhibitor designed to slow or halt the damaging effects of inflammation and apoptosis in the liver. It works by inhibiting human caspases in the liver, which are enzymes that lead to processes of inflammation and cell death. Excessive caspase enzymatic activity, as seen in severe liver disease, leads to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and eventually the need for a transplant for survival. Conatus' market outlook for emricasan is quite large, as it is one of the multiple companies with products in development to deal with NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) and its consequences. Briefly, NASH is a liver disease that resembles alcoholic liver disease, but is found in individuals with little or no alcohol consumption. Its traits typically include a buildup of fat in the liver, along with excessive inflammation and cell death. NASH is labeled as a silent disease since most patients with NASH are asymptomatic, and do not develop symptoms until late-stage manifestations arise. There are currently no approved treatments for NASH, and the potential market for the drugs that make it through their developmental and marketing stages successfully has been touted to be as high as $35 billion. For a great overview of the main players in the NASH field, which includes some of CNAT's competition, see Logribel Biostocks' article "NASH Drugs: A Comprehensive Review Of Current Clinical Trials". This is especially recommended as the rest of the article will assume the reader's familiarity with the NASH field and focus on Conatus' outlook in the market going forward.
 Emricasan's mechanism of action makes it a unique broad-based treatment option Liver disease typically progresses in the following fashion: inflammation, fibrosis, asymptomatic cirrhosis, symptomatic cirrhosis, liver failure and need for transplant. This progression of fibrosis and cirrhosis occurs as inflammation and cell death increases, mediated by caspase activity, leading to significant scarring and loss of liver function. Emricasan, being a caspase inhibitor, blocks the enzymatic pathways that lead to inflammation and cell death. Due to this very general mechanism, emricasan has the potential to deal with the consequences of moderate to severe liver disease, regardless of the specific disease causing the progression. This positions emricasan uniquely in the field of NASH, as other competitors are developing drugs that focus on earlier stage intervention in the progression of NASH rather than consequences of NASH and liver disease in general. In addition to this, because emricasan works on the later stages of liver disease, it is an interesting candidate to be used in combination therapies with other drugs that successfully make it to market for the treatment of NASH at earlier stages of disease. 

 (Source: CNAT) Market potential for emricasan may be better than it appears Currently, the focus of most drug developers in the NASH field is on dealing with NASH fibrosis and early-stage interventions in the disease cycle. Conatus has taken a different approach with emricasan, focusing primarily on later-stage cirrhosis treatment with emricasan - and for good reason. As illustrated below from management's presentation at the 2016 Stifel Healthcare Conference on November 16, 2016, cirrhosis affects approximately 630,000 US adults, with costs of up to $9.8 billion to the healthcare system. 36,000 patients die each year from late-stage liver disease, where the only current cure is a liver transplant with a huge waiting list (approx 15,000 waiting, with 7,000 livers available each year).
 

 (Source: CNAT) Taking a look at the market size, advanced NASH fibrosis (F2-F3 stages, approx 15 million US and EU patients) does have a larger patient population base relative to NASH cirrhosis (F4, approx 0.9 million US and EU patients). However, when we take diagnosis rates into account, the treatable diagnosed population sizes for patients with earlier NASH fibrosis and NASH cirrhosis equal out. This is because NASH is a silent disease as mentioned previously, and patients do not seek treatment until they become symptomatic. This results in a skewed diagnosis rate in favor of NASH cirrhosis relative to NASH fibrosis. Until better screening and diagnostic tools are developed to raise the level of diagnosed NASH fibrosis patients, the large estimated population size with NASH fibrosis will not carry over into the group of patients who will be seeking treatment. 

 (Source: CNAT) The next market factor that favors emricasan going forward is that there are far fewer drugs in development for NASH cirrhosis compared to NASH fibrosis. Currently, approximately 20 different drugs are being explored as treatments for NASH fibrosis while only two are being explored for NASH cirrhosis - emricasan being one of them. This lack of intense competition in the cirrhosis treatment field, along with similar diagnosed market potential as NASH fibrosis, and potential combination treatments down the road with early-stage fibrosis treatments, makes emricasan a unique player in the NASH and general liver disease field.
 

 (Source: CNAT) Clinical Trial Overview and Timeline Conatus currently has several clinical trials at various stages in process. Below is a general overview of these trials and their expected timelines; please see the conference presentation slides for detailed breakdown: 

 

 (Source: CNAT 2016 Stifel Healthcare Conference) On top of the studies shown above that are in progress, management is planning an ENCORE-LF study, with expectations to start in H1 2017, that seeks to get approval for a clinical endpoint rather than a surrogate endpoint and be classified as a phase 3 trial for liver cirrhosis. If approved, this will accelerate its time to market for such a treatment, but it is not in any sense guaranteed. Management is having ongoing discussions to see whether a phase 3 trial will be appropriate, although the higher likelihood is that it will need to do a phase 2b first. This will be an announcement to watch for going into 2017. Depending on the results of the above trials, management could have the data on hand to expand the scope of treatment for emricasan to earlier stages of liver diseases, especially with histology endpoints used in its NF and POLT-HCV-SVR trials.
 Management has also stated it plans to release the three-month follow-up open-label results and analysis of its liver cirrhosis phase 2 trial in late 2016/early 2017. Besides this, all other trials in progress have at least 2018 top-line result timelines, making emricasan a long way away from getting through its developmental stages. Plan for Conatus Going Forward Management's plan for emricasan is to register it initially for treatments in patients with cirrhosis due to NASH. If emricasan is approved for this patient population in the US and/or Europe, management seeks to build its own commercial organization to market emricasan, along with its own sales team to target MDs dealing with NASH. If emricasan continues to show strong clinical results, management would look to expand emricasan's use to larger patient populations through combination treatments and partnerships with other biopharmaceutical companies. As of November 1, 2016, CNAT had approximately 26 million shares outstanding. As of September 30, 2016, CNAT had $31.1 million cash on hand, which, at the current burn rate, should be enough to last for another year or so in operational/clinical expenses. CNAT has a $50 million ATM in place with MLV & Co. LLC since August 2014, of which it sold 6,155,721 shares for approximately $13.5 million net of expenses, as of its November 8, 2016, 10-Q. With the current share price <$2.00/share, management may find itself diluting existing shareholders substantially to raise funds through its ATM. Unless significant positive news emerges, or a partnership is announced to help offset the costs of development, this poses a risk to existing shareholders and the share price. This is a concern going forward since there will be multiple trials in progress in 2018 at what will be a much greater cash burn rate. Due to distant timelines for completion of current and planned trials, management will need to find ways to raise the necessary capital, preferably via partnership and then further stock dilution as needed.
 Market outlook for NASH companies On September 20th, 2016, Tobira Therapeutics, also an early-stage NASH player, got bought out for a massive premium by Allergan (NYSE:AGN), rocketing the microcap company from a market cap of $78 million to over $730 million. This came after Tobira announced disappointing phase 2b results where it did not meet its primary endpoints. With the huge potential market in this field, it isn't surprising to see bidding wars emerge for small-cap companies that may have a better drug candidate in development than the big pharma players do. As a result of this buyout, you can be sure that other players, such as Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD) and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), are paying attention and taking a look at what's available to pad their own pipelines. With Allergan's CEO being quoted saying that the Tobira deal was a "very competitive situation", that leads one to think that there is at least one other large pharma looking to buy out a smaller target, if not a couple. With potentially billions in repatriated capital coming back to the US via corporate tax cuts under Trump, this could be a very interesting area for acquisitions going forward. Summary Emricasan is a unique play in the NASH field, due to its broad function in treating NASH cirrhosis, and potentially NASH fibrosis and earlier-stage liver disease with label expansion. There is limited competition in the cirrhosis field, with an almost equal diagnosed market size of patients needing treatment between NASH cirrhosis and fibrosis. Although the timeline for reaching the market for emricasan is arguably quite distant relative to other NASH players, its broad mechanism of action could help it gain rapid market share through combination therapies down the road. Acting as a surprise factor is the sector CNAT finds itself in, with hungry large biopharms looking for potential buyouts or partnerships with the most promising drugs in development. However, it is always crucial to remember that the success of these microcap companies hinges on their main drug. If future trials do not show positive results, and management is unable to partner or sell sufficient shares to raise needed capital, the company can always go under. Investment in this field is risky and often a gamble. Going forward, CNAT presents itself as an interesting player in the field, with great potential IF all goes as planned with its trials and financing needs.

Cirrhosis








What Is Cirrhosis?
Cirrhosis is an advanced stage of fibrosis in which collagen deposits have interconnected, stiffening the liver structure and restricting blood flow through the liver. Cirrhosis and its complications cause over 30,000 deaths each year in the United States. The Conatus emricasan program has the potential to improve cirrhosis patients' lives in two major ways:

It may help patients survive longer while waiting for a liver transplant.
It may improve their liver disease status so they no longer need a transplant.

Conatus is studying treatment for patients with chronic liver disease including:

Compensated (asymptomatic) liver cirrhosis
Decompensated (symptomatic) liver cirrhosis

Causes of chronic decompensation or liver failure include:

Infections such as subacute bacterial peritonitis
Hepatitis C virus (HCV)
Hepatitis B virus (HBV)
Metabolic causes, such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)
Autoimmune diseases
Alcohol

Independent published studies have been conducted on cirrhosis treatment. They have shown that levels of caspase-cleaved Cytokeratin 18 (cCK18), a key biomarker of inflammation and apoptosis, are elevated in liver cirrhosis patients. These levels correlate with extent of liver inflammation and cholestasis.
Managing Cirrhosis
There are no approved disease-modifying treatments for cirrhosis. There are currently two main objectives for the management of patients with liver cirrhosis:

Specific treatment of any identifiable causes of chronic liver function, such as HCV or HBV
Prevention of the development or progression of key signs of decompensation

Signs of decompensation may include:

Portal hypertension
Ascites
Hepatic encephalopathy
Esophageal varices, with or without hemorrhage

The continual progression of liver cirrhosis may eventually lead patients to require a liver transplant. During this procedure, the diseased liver is replaced by a donor liver or part of one. There are not enough donor livers available for all cirrhosis patients. Without a liver transplant, progressive cirrhosis eventually leads to liver failure and death.
Conatus Cirrhosis Trials
Conatus is studying emricasan in cirrhosis patients in completed and planned clinical trials as described on our Programs page.

Conatus Pharmaceuticals
We are a biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of novel medicines to treat liver disease. Our lead compound, emricasan, is a first-in-class, orally active pan-caspase protease inhibitor designed to reduce the activity of human caspases, which are enzymes that mediate inflammation and apoptosis. We believe that by reducing the activity of these enzymes, emricasan has the potential to interrupt the progression of liver disease and potentially provide treatment options in multiple areas of liver disease.
We have observed compelling preclinical and clinical trial results that suggest emricasan may have clinical utility in slowing progression of liver disease regardless of the original cause of the disease. To date, emricasan has been studied in over 650 subjects in sixteen clinical trials across a broad range of liver disease etiologies and stages of progression. In multiple clinical trials, emricasan has demonstrated statistically significant, consistent, rapid and sustained reduction in elevated levels of key biomarkers of inflammation and apoptosis implicated in the severity and progression of liver disease. Importantly, these key biomarkers are known to be elevated and to have prognostic value in multiple hepatic indications that we are currently pursuing.In December 2016, Conatus announced an exclusive option, collaboration and license agreement with Novartis for the global development and commercialization of emricasan. In May 2017, Conatus announced that Novartis had exercised its license option following initiation of the Phase 2b ENCORE-LF clinical trial.

The Company hired Parexel International Corporation, a clinical research organization, to digitalize and formally submit its NDA application. Kitov expects the filing to occur during the third quarter of 2017, with a potential FDA approval during the second quarter of 2018.KIT-302 is a combination drug that treats osteoarthritis pain and hypertension simultaneouslyPrimary efficacy endpoint achieved Lead drug candidate KIT-302 achieved its primary efficacy endpoint in a pivotal Phase III trialMarketing potential Pipeline candidates address large, multi-billion dollar marketsProductsKitov’s current pipeline products, KIT-301 and KIT-302, are combination drugs that treat OA pain and HTN simultaneously. In December 2015, KIT-302 successfully achieved the primary efficacy endpoint for its Phase III clinical trial. In August 2016, the United States Patent Office issued a patent covering KIT-302.MarketOf the 27 million Americans with OA, 50% also suffer from HTN, which is also a common side effect of stand-alone OA drugs. With no single medication currently treating both conditions, KIT-301 and KIT-302 are targeting this multi-billion dollar market.MoreReply64aandiWhy is this going down so much todayReplyReplies (12)31ppostmanYesterday was just a minor pull back ,ever stock has some and makes for a great day to buy more !!!Reply72MMA careful reading of Conatus CEO shows a reasonable strategy for start up companies. It must be clear to Conatus that even if its flagship product gets through phase-II with flying colors, in the current environment it cannot rely on VC or the market to go to production. It will sink all company resources to manufacture and market the new miracle drug. And without a product, it is unlikely to see a bidding war between big Pharma to acquire the company. Instead, the strategy now is to continue its R&D on new drugs or derivatives for which a secure and reliable source of income from Novartis (by licensing its lead product) is needed. In other words, Conatus will not be at the mercy of the ups and downs of the market hoping to survive from one quarter to another. It will wait for better times (next M&A mania) that is not expected any time soon (it should be well after the success of its lead product). CNAT is expected to remain within the current trading range ($5.5 to almost $9). It is not expected to breach that trading range until Q1 2018 when Phase-II results start pouring in.MoreReply13ppostmanEarnings coming in a few weeks and then on  ward and up from there !!

Conatus Pharmaceuticals' medicine, emricasan (IDN-6556), is considered investigational, meaning that it is being evaluated in clinical trials and is not yet approved for use by regulatory authorities. Approval by regulatory authorities around the world, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), is the means to make our medicines available to the patient.
How to Access Conatus' Emricasan
At Conatus, our goal is to serve patients by developing the safety and efficacy information that is needed to obtain regulatory approval for our investigational medications. In order to obtain regulatory approval for an investigational medication, the medication must be tested in clinical trials designed to prove whether the medication is safe and efficacious. It is important for patients to participate in clinical trials because that is the only way for companies to generate the essential information needed for regulatory approval, which provides all patients broader access to the medication. Clinical trials generally offer the best opportunity for patients to access an investigational medication.
Current Conatus Trials

To learn more about Conatus' current clinical programs, you can visit www.clinicaltrials.gov.
A Trial of IDN-6556 in Post Orthotopic Liver Transplant for Chronic HCV
A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-controlled Trial of Emricasan, an Oral Caspase Inhibitor, in Subjects With Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Fibrosis (ENCORE-NF)Emricasan, an Oral Caspase Inhibitor, in Subjects With Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Cirrhosis and Severe Portal Hypertension (ENCORE-PH)

Expanded Access Policy
In exceptional circumstances, when a patient with a serious or immediately life-threatening disease does not qualify for any clinical trials and no other medical options remain available, we may decide to allow access to Conatus’ investigational medications outside of a clinical trial when:

It is requested by a physician
Is allowed by law
The conditions for Conatus’ expanded access criteria are met.

When making determinations on requests for expanded access to Conatus’ investigational medications, we review each request as comprehensively as possible and consider the criteria below.
Criteria Used for Considering Requests for Expanded Access

The patient has a serious or immediately life threatening disease or condition and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy for the disease or condition.
The medication is being developed in the indication for which access is sought.
There is sufficient clinical evidence of safety and effectiveness in that indication that the expected benefits will outweigh the known or anticipated risks.
Granting expanded access will not interfere with the development of the investigational medication.
The patient is ineligible or unable to participate in a clinical trial.
Conatus has an adequate supply of investigational medication.
The laws and regulations in the country or region allow for expanded access.

A patient’s physician should request information about how to apply for access to one of Conatus’ investigational medications by contacting David Hagerty, M.D. at dhagerty@conatuspharma.com. All physicians who receive Conatus’ investigational medication for expanded access must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and contractual conditions, including those relating to safety reporting.
More information on expanded access is available from the FDA: http://www.fda.gov/ForPatients/Other/ExpandedAccess/ucm20041768.htm#different-types

POLT-HCV-SVR








Hepatitis C After Liver Transplant
Patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) who receive orthotopic liver transplants are at risk for recurrence of HCV infection in the transplanted organs. This is known as post-orthotopic liver transplant hepatitis C virus (POLT-HCV) infection.
The outlook for POLT-HCV patients is rapidly changing with increasing use of interferon-free hepatitis C antiviral regimens. These treatments are showing high rates of sustained viral response (SVR) and better tolerability than earlier antiviral therapies.
Although successful treatment with antiviral drugs may clear the post-transplant HCV infection, many patients still experience rapid development of fibrosis due to the recurrence of HCV. This may progress to cirrhosis.
Conatus POLT-HCV-SVR Trial
Conatus is studying emricasan in POLT-HCV-SVR liver transplant recipients. The patients have been successfully treated with HCV antiviral therapy, but have residual liver fibrosis or cirrhosis in the transplanted liver as a result of recurrent post-transplant HCV infection. You can read more about the study at clinicaltrials.gov.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
