Non-Standardized

Standardized


What does this mean?









Non-StandardizedNon-Standardized Historical (Portfolio) Performance is the change in unit values including all charges with the exception of surrender charges and the annual service charge. It includes the Mortality and Expense fee, Daily Administration fee, and all other portfolio expenses. It can be reported monthly, but must be accompanied by Standardized performance to the most recent quarter end. The returns are calculated from the inception of the fund, which may predate the inception date used for standardized returns.
Non-Standardized (Subaccount) Performance is the change in unit values including all charges with the exception of surrender charges and the annual service charge. It includes the Mortality and Expense fee, Daily Administration fee, and all other portfolio expenses. It must be accompanied by Standardized performance to the most recent quarter end. The returns are calculated from the date the fund was added to the variable annuity separate account (i.e. the date it was first available as an option in a variable annuity contract).
Adjusted Non-StandardizedAdjusted Non-Standardized Historical (Portfolio) Performance is the change in unit values including all asset-based charges. It accounts for all fees and charges, including any surrender charge that would apply if you terminated the contract at the end of each period indicated and a pro-rata deduction of the annual service charge. It can be reported monthly, but must be accompanied by Standardized performance to the most recent quarter end. The returns are calculated from the inception date of the fund, which may predate the inception date used for standardized returns.
StandardizedStandardized (Subaccount) Performance accounts for all fees and charges, including any surrender charge that would apply if you terminated the contract at the end of each period indicated and a pro-rata deduction of the annual service charge. It gives a historical track record for specific periods of time (1, 5, 10 or since inception if the fund is less than 10 years old.) Per SEC Rules, it must be reported to the most recent quarter-end. The returns are calculated from the date the fund was added to the variable annuity separate account (i.e. the date it was first available as an option in a variable annuity contract).
