RESPONSE OF THE OFFICE OF INSURANCE PRODUCTS
Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (U.S.) and Keyport


DIVISION OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
Life Insurance Company


Based on the facts and representations in your letter dated December 19, 2003, and without necessarily agreeing with your legal analysis, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission against Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (U.S.) ("Sun Life") or Keyport Life Insurance Company ("Keyport") under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act") and Rule 145 thereunder, or Sections 8 and 11 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), if Keyport transfers its separate accounts ("Keyport Accounts") to Sun Life in connection with the proposed merger of Sun Life and Keyport (the "Merger").  In addition, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission if: (1) the change in depositor for the transferred Keyport Accounts as a result of the Merger is effected through the filing of amendments to the registration statements for the Keyport Accounts under the 1940 Act; and (2) new registration statements under the 1933 Act for the transferred Keyport Accounts are filed by Sun Life and the Keyport Accounts to cover any securities issued in connection with the Keyport contracts after the Merger is effected.
Similarly, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder, if, with respect to certain market value adjustment contracts ("MVA Contracts"), Keyport transfers to Sun Life assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under the relevant MVA Contracts, and Sun Life assumes all the obligations and responsibilities of Keyport under such contracts.
Because our position is based on the facts and representations in your letter, you should note that different facts or representations may require a different conclusion.  Further, this response expresses the position of the Division on enforcement only, and does not purport to express any legal conclusion on the issues presented.

Re:	Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (U.S.) and Keyport Life Insurance Company
Dear Mr. Kotapish:
We are writing on behalf of Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (U.S.) ("Sun Life (U.S.)") and Keyport Life Insurance Company ("Keyport") to request that the staff advise us that it would not recommend that the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") take any enforcement action against Sun Life (U.S.) and Keyport:

under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and Rule 145 thereunder, and Sections 8 and 11 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), if Keyport transfers its separate accounts, registered under the 1940 Act as unit investment trusts, to Sun Life (U.S.) (the "Transfers") by operation of law in the proposed merger of Sun Life (U.S.) and Keyport (the "Merger"), as described below; andÂ 
under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder, if, with respect to certain market value adjustment contracts (the "Keyport MVA Contracts"), Keyport transfers to Sun Life (U.S.) assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under the Keyport MVA Contracts, and Sun Life (U.S.) assumes all the obligations and responsibilities of Keyport under such Contracts (the "MVA Transfer"), as described below (the Merger, the Transfers, and the MVA Transfer, and any related transactions are referred to collectively as the "Merger").

In the past, the Commission's staff has granted requests for similar relief.  For the reasons set forth below, we believe that the relief requested here also should be granted.
I.	BACKGROUND
A.	Description of Sun Life (U.S.) and Keyport
Sun Life (U.S.) is a stock life insurance company incorporated under the laws of Delaware on January 12, 1970.1  Its executive office is located at One Sun Life Executive Park, Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts 02481.  Sun Life (U.S.) issues individual and group life insurance policies and annuity contracts and is authorized to do business in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  As of December 31, 2002, Sun Life (U.S.) had assets of approximately $20 billion.
Sun Life (U.S.) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sun Life of Canada (U.S.) Holdings, Inc. ("Sun Life (U.S.) Holdings").  The ultimate parent of Sun Life (U.S.) and Sun Life (U.S.) Holdings is Sun Life Financial Inc. (formerly known as Sun Life Financial Services of Canada, Inc.), a Canadian corporation with common shares listed on the Toronto, New York, and Philippines stock exchanges.
Keyport is a stock life insurance company incorporated under the laws of the State of Rhode Island in 1957.  Its executive office is located at One Sun Life Executive Park, Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts 02481.  Keyport issues individual and group annuity contracts and formerly issued individual life insurance policies.  Keyport is authorized to do business in 49 states, the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands.  As of December 31, 2002, Keyport had assets of approximately $19.6 billion.  Keyport is a wholly owned subsidiary Sun Life (U.S.) Holdings, and is therefore under common control with Sun Life (U.S.).
B.	Sun Life (U.S.) Accounts and Related Contracts
Sun Life (U.S.) has 20 registered separate accounts (the "Sun Life (U.S.) Accounts"), which fund variable life insurance contracts or variable annuity contracts (collectively, the "Sun Life (U.S.) Contracts").  The Sun Life (U.S.) Accounts are separate accounts created pursuant to Delaware insurance law, and each is registered with the Commission under the 1940 Act2 as a unit investment trust or as an open-end, diversified management investment company.  The Sun Life (U.S.) Contracts supported by the Sun Life (U.S.) Accounts are registered as securities with the Commission under the 1933 Act.  The Sun Life (U.S.) Accounts which are registered as unit investment trusts consist of sub-accounts, each of which invests in a series of either an affiliated or unaffiliated open-end, diversified management investment company registered under the 1940 Act.
The Sun Life (U.S.) Contracts permit additional payments and allow transfers among sub-accounts, subject to certain conditions.  The Sun Life (U.S.) Contracts offer a general account option, which is not registered with the Commission in reliance on certain exemptive and exclusionary provisions in the federal securities laws.  In addition, certain Sun Life (U.S.) Contracts offer a fixed account investment option that is registered under the 1933 Act.
Clarendon Insurance Agency, Inc. ("Clarendon"), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Sun Life (U.S.) Holdings, is the principal underwriter for the Sun Life (U.S.) Contracts.  Clarendon is an "affiliated person" (as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(3) of the 1940 Act) of Sun Life (U.S.).
C.	Keyport Accounts and Related Contracts
Keyport has three registered separate accounts (the "Keyport Accounts"):  KMA Variable Account, which funds one variable annuity contract; Variable Account A, which funds 10 variable annuity contracts; and Keyport Variable Account I, which funds one variable life insurance contract.  The Keyport Accounts are separate accounts created pursuant to Rhode Island insurance law, and each is registered as a unit investment trust with the Commission under the 1940 Act.   The variable contracts supported by the Keyport Accounts (the "Keyport Variable Contracts") are registered as securities with the Commission under the 1933 Act.3  The Keyport Accounts consist of sub-accounts, each of which invests in a series of either an affiliated or unaffiliated open-end, diversified management investment company registered under the 1940 Act.
The Keyport Variable Contracts permit additional payments and allow transfers among sub-accounts, subject to certain conditions.4  Certain Keyport Variable Contracts also offer a general account option, which is not registered with the Commission in reliance on certain exemptive and exclusionary provisions in the federal securities laws.
Keyport Financial Services Corp. ("KFSC"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Keyport, is the principal underwriter for the Keyport Contracts.  KFSC is an "affiliated person" (as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(3) of the 1940 Act) of Keyport.  Following the Merger, it is planned that Clarendon will act as the principal underwriter for the Keyport Contracts.
D.	Keyport MVA Contracts
The Keyport MVA Contracts are fixed account annuity contacts, comprised of group and individual single premium annuity contracts (the "Single Premium MVA Contracts") and group and individual flexible premium annuity contracts (the "Flexible Premium MVA Contracts").  The Keyport MVA Contracts offer two general account options, one of which is subject to a market value adjustment provision.  The Keyport MVA Contracts have no variable investment option.
Keyport holds assets attributable to the reserves it must maintain for, and its other liabilities with respect to, the Single Premium MVA Contracts in a non-unitized separate account which is not registered under the 1940 Act.  Keyport no longer offers the Single Premium MVA Contracts, is not accepting additional payments under outstanding Single Premium MVA Contracts, and is not filing post-effective amendments to the 1933 Act registration statement for the Single Premium MVA Contracts.5
Keyport holds assets attributable to the reserves it must maintain for, and its other liabilities with respect to, the Flexible Premium MVA Contracts in a non-unitized separate account which is not registered under the 1940 Act.  The Flexible Premium MVA Contracts are registered as securities with the Commission under the 1933 Act.6  The Flexible Premium MVA Contracts permit additional payments and allow transfers among the general account options, subject to certain conditions.
The Keyport MVA Contracts, together with the Keyport Variable Contacts, are hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Keyport Contracts."
II.	THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION
A.	The Merger
Sun Life (U.S.) Holdings conducts insurance and related operations through various direct and indirect, wholly owned insurance companies, including Sun Life (U.S.) and Keyport.  It proposes to simplify its corporate and operational structure so that it might operate more efficiently and reduce administrative and compliance costs.  To that end, it intends to combine the operations of Sun Life (U.S.) and Keyport through the Merger.  In June 2003, Sun Life (U.S.) and Keyport entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "Merger Agreement") pursuant to which Keyport will merge with and into Sun Life (U.S.) leaving Sun Life (U.S.) as the surviving company.  The Merger, including the Transfers, the MVA Transfer, and related transactions, has been approved by the Boards of Directors of Sun Life (U.S.) and Keyport and  each party's sole shareholder.  The parties have obtained the other necessary formal regulatory approvals and expect to have the Merger become effective on December 31, 2003.7
Upon the effective date of the Merger ("Effective Date"), Sun Life (U.S.) will assume legal ownership of all of the assets of Keyport and will become directly liable for Keyport's liabilities and obligations with respect to the Keyport Contracts then outstanding.  Each Keyport Contract owner will become a contract owner of Sun Life (U.S.) by operation of law.  The Merger will not affect the provisions of, or the rights and obligations under, the Keyport Contracts.  Moreover, the Merger will not dilute or otherwise adversely affect the economic interests of the owners of the Keyport Contracts, nor will the Merger affect the values determined under the Keyport Contracts.  The net unit value of the Keyport Accounts in effect immediately after the transfers will be identical to the net asset value per unit of interest in effect immediately before the transfers.  The Merger Agreement will not affect the current owners of Sun Life (U.S.) Contracts.
The Sun Life (U.S.) Accounts and the Keyport Accounts (collectively, the "Accounts") are not parties to the Merger Agreement, which will be entered into at the insurance company level.  As a result of the Merger, the Accounts, which are registered under the 1940 Act, will continue to maintain their separate account status as unit investment trusts under the 1940 Act and as separate accounts under applicable state insurance law.  The Accounts will not be merged into one another.
No charges will be imposed on, or other deductions made from, the Keyport Accounts or the Sun Life (U.S.) Accounts in connection with the Merger.  In addition, no payments will be required or charges imposed under the Keyport Contracts in connection with, or by virtue of, the Merger that would not otherwise be required or imposed.
No new investment options will be made available to owners of the Keyport Contracts in connection with, or by virtue of, the Merger, nor will any existing investment options be substituted or terminated.  Each sub-account of the Keyport Accounts will continue to invest in the same underlying fund as that sub-account invested in prior to the Merger.
The Merger will not directly affect any of the management investment companies underlying either the Keyport Accounts or the Sun Life (U.S.) Accounts (collectively, the "Funds").  The Funds will not be a party to the Merger or any related transaction.  The investment objectives, policies, and restrictions of the Funds will not be changed as a result of the Merger or any related transaction.  No investment portfolios are proposed to be added to, substituted by, or terminated by the Funds in connection with the Merger or any related transaction.  Moreover, the Merger will not result in any change to the investment advisers for the Funds, the Funds' assets, or the charges imposed on the Funds or their shareholders.  In addition, although the principal underwriter for Keyport may change after the Merger, the principal underwriter will continue to be a wholly owned subsidiary of Sun Life (U.S.) Holdings.
Sun Life (U.S.) and Keyport have determined that no provision of the Keyport Contracts or state law provides the owners of those Contracts (the "Keyport Contract owners") with any right to opt-out of, or to vote on or otherwise consent to, the Merger.  Rather, the only required votes are those of the sole voting stockholders of the merging companies.  Moreover, none of the events affecting the Keyport Accounts in connection with the Merger require a vote of Keyport Contract owners under the 1940 Act.  In addition, as described above, the investment options and contractual rights and obligations under the Keyport Contracts will not change, except that Sun Life (U.S.) will become the depositor of the Keyport Accounts.  Consequently, Keyport Contract owners will have no investment decision to make with respect to the Merger.
All direct and indirect costs of the Merger will be borne by Sun Life (U.S.) or Keyport and not by any owners of Sun Life (U.S.) or Keyport Contracts.
B.	The Transfers
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each of the Keyport Accounts will transfer intact to Sun Life (U.S.) and become part of Sun Life (U.S.) on the Effective Date.  Each transferred Keyport Account will change its name, and have Sun Life (U.S.) as its depositor rather than Keyport.  No other changes to the Keyport Accounts will result from the Merger.
The assets and liabilities that comprise the Keyport Accounts immediately prior to the Merger will remain intact and legally separate from any other business of Sun Life (U.S.), as the surviving company, after the Merger.  In addition, the Keyport Accounts will continue to fund the same Keyport Contracts they did immediately prior to the Merger.
After the Merger, Sun Life (U.S.) intends to accept additional payments under the transferred Keyport Variable Contracts outstanding at the time the Merger is effected, and to continue offering new contracts that are identical to the Contracts currently being offered, but for the change in depositor.8  Sun Life (U.S.) will administer the Keyport Variable Contracts in the same manner as Keyport did immediately prior to the Merger.
C.	The MVA Transfer
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Keyport will transfer assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under the Keyport MVA Contracts to Sun Life (U.S.), and Sun Life (U.S.) will assume Keyport's obligations under such Contracts, on the Effective Date.  As a result of the Merger, each non-unitized separate account of Keyport that funds the Keyport MVA Contracts will become a non-unitized separate account of Sun Life (U.S.).  At the same time, Sun Life (U.S.) will assume legal ownership of the fixed account assets of Keyport and become responsible for all the liabilities and obligations of Keyport under the Keyport MVA Contracts issued prior to the Merger.
The MVA Transfer will not change the terms of the Keyport MVA Contracts, except for the succession of Sun Life (U.S.) as the insurer under the Keyport MVA Contracts, and it will not adversely affect the values determined under, or the economic interests of the owners of, those Contracts.
After the Merger, Sun Life (U.S.) intends to accept additional payments under the transferred Flex Premium MVA Contracts outstanding at the time the Merger is effected, and to continue offering new contracts that are identical to the Contracts currently being offered.  Sun Life (U.S.) will administer the Flex Premium MVA Contracts in the same manner as Keyport did immediately prior to the Merger.
Sun Life (U.S.) does not intend to offer additional Single Premium MVA Contracts or accept additional payments under outstanding Single Premium MVA Contracts or file post-effective amendments to the 1933 Act registration statement for the Single Premium MVA Contracts.
D.	Procedural Matters
Sun Life (U.S.) will file new registration statements on Form N-4 or Form N-6, as applicable, under the 1933 Act to reflect the change in depositor of the Keyport Accounts and Sun Life (U.S.)'s assumption, pursuant to the Merger, of the contractual obligations and liabilities of Keyport under the Keyport Variable Contracts.  The registration statements will include financial statements reflecting consummation of the Merger and reflect Sun Life (U.S.)'s sponsorship of the Keyport Accounts as a result of the Merger, but will retain the historical financial information of the Keyport Accounts.  Sun Life (U.S.) will seek to have the new registration statements declared effective on or immediately following the Effective Date.  The prospectuses included in the new registration statements will be sent to all Keyport Contract owners.
Sun Life (U.S.) also will file a new registration statement on Form S-3 under the 1933 Act for the Flexible Premium MVA Contracts.  Sun Life (U.S.) will seek to have the registration statement declared effective on or immediately following the Effective Date.  The new registration statement will reflect Sun Life (U.S.)'s assumption of the contractual obligations and liabilities of Keyport with respect to the Flexible Premium MVA Contracts pursuant to the Merger.  Each person who owns a Keyport MVA Contract at the time of the MVA Transfer will receive a revised prospectus reflecting the change in insurer.
Following the Effective Date, Sun Life (U.S.) will not make offers or accept payments under the Keyport Contracts until the new registration statements filed with the Commission are effective.
III.	ANALYSIS
A.	Introduction
As discussed more fully below, it is our view, with regard to the proposed Merger (including the Transfers and the MVA Transfer), that: (1) Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder are inapplicable to the Merger, and no registration statements on Form N-14 are required; (2) Section 8 of the 1940 Act is inapplicable to the Merger; and (3) Section 11 of the 1940 Act is inapplicable to the Merger, but if Section 11 is viewed as applicable to the Merger transactions, the transactions will comply with the conditions of Section 11(a) of the 1940 Act, and Rule 11a-2 thereunder.  Neither Sun Life (U.S.) nor Keyport seeks no-action reassurance under Section 17(a) or Section 17(d) of the 1940 Act with respect to the Transfers.9
In support of our views, we note that the proposed Merger is analytically the same as numerous reorganizations that have been the subject of previous no-action requests, seeking substantially identical relief from the provisions of the 1933 Act and 1940 Act noted above, to which the staff responded favorably and which deal with stock and mutual life insurance companies involved in mergers where one or both of such companies issued variable insurance products.10  In connection with the relief sought in this request, the proposed Merger poses no different issues than those present in these previous transactions.
B.	Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 Thereunder Are Inapplicable to the Transfers and the MVA Transfer
1.	Transfers
In our view, the succession of Sun Life (U.S.) to the position of depositor for the Keyport Accounts and co-issuer of the Keyport Variable Contracts, pursuant to the Transfers and any related transactions, will not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security or in the creation of a new or different investment company issuer for purposes of Section 5 of the 1933 Act or Rule 145 thereunder.  Rule 145, an interpretive rule adopted by the Commission, provides guidance on when certain corporate reorganizations may entail the offer or sale of a new security in exchange for outstanding securities of a corporation involved in the reorganization.11
Similar to the facts in previously issued no-action letters,12  the terms of the Merger Agreement will not result in any material change to the Keyport Variable Contracts, except that, by operation of law, the identity of the sponsor/depositor will be different.  These previously issued no-action letters involve circumstances virtually identical to those presented above: two insurance companies merging where one or both of the companies have variable contracts outstanding.  Each of the previously issued no-action letters indicates that, just as in this case, the assets and liabilities that comprised the separate account remained intact after the merger and were legally segregated from the other business of the surviving life insurance company.
In this case, the Keyport Accounts will remain intact after the Merger and the assets of each of the transferred Keyport Accounts will be legally segregated from all other assets of the depositor and will not be combined with those of any other separate account or other entity.  The transferred Keyport Variable Contracts will continue to provide Contract owners with the same rights and benefits after the proposed Merger as before, including surrender rights, loan privileges, annuity options and death benefits.  In addition, the Keyport Variable Contracts will continue to be funded by the transferred Keyport Accounts (albeit under a new name) investing in the same underlying investment vehicles as are currently available under the Keyport Contracts.  The financial history of the transferred Keyport Accounts will be carried forward, and, with the exception of the assumption of liabilities by Sun Life (U.S.) (which will be reflected by filing an amendment to each registration statement of a Keyport Account under the 1940 Act), will not change.  Furthermore, the assumption of the insurance guarantees under the Keyport Variable Contracts by Sun Life (U.S.) by operation of state law will not affect those aspects of the Contracts that cause them to be treated as securities (i.e., the variable nature of the benefits under the Keyport Variable Contracts, which benefits will continue to be based on the same pool of assets).13 
As discussed above, the Merger is not subject, by either state law or federal securities law, to the vote or consent of the Contract owners of either Sun Life (U.S.) or Keyport.  There is no material change to the security aspect of the Keyport Variable Contracts issued by Keyport and no new or different investment options will be made available to the Contract owners as a result of the Merger.  The only changes involved are the change in the depositor of the transferred Keyport Accounts and the assumption of existing Keyport Variable Contracts by Sun Life (U.S.).  Since there will be no vote of the Contact owners relating to a new investment decision, or otherwise, Rule 145 does not apply for the same reasons set forth in the aforementioned no-action letters.14   Based on the foregoing, we have concluded that neither Section 5 of the 1933 Act nor Rule 145 thereunder is applicable to the proposed Transfers and any related transactions.
Moreover, with respect to registration statements under the 1933 Act, we believe that no registration statement on Form N-14 will be required to be filed in connection with the Merger.15  Nonetheless, we believe that the registration statements for the transferred Keyport Variable Contracts issued through each Keyport Account, as separate accounts of Sun Life (U.S.), need to be in effect under the 1933 Act to cover any securities issued after the Merger, which may include any additional payments accepted on the transferred Keyport Variable Contracts outstanding at the time the Merger is effected and any new Keyport Variable Contracts issued thereafter.  As noted above, in connection with effecting the Merger, Sun Life (U.S.) and the Keyport Accounts will file new registration statements with the Commission under the 1933 Act for the transferred Keyport Variable Contracts, which registration statements will be requested to be declared effective in conjunction with the Merger.
These new registration statements, which will be filed on Form N-4 or Form N-6, as applicable, will reflect the change in depositor of the Keyport Accounts and Sun Life (U.S.)'s assumption, pursuant to the Merger, of the contractual obligations and liabilities of Keyport under the Keyport Variable Contracts.  Because the Transfers are to be made in connection with the Merger of Keyport into Sun Life (U.S.), the registration statements also will include appropriate financial information reflecting the Merger.  The new prospectuses will be sent to all owners of Keyport Variable Contracts outstanding at the time the Transfers are effected, and will retain the historical financial information of the Keyport Accounts and will disclose that new premium payments will be accepted under the Keyport Variable Contracts after the Merger.16   Prior to the Effective Date, owners of outstanding Keyport Variable Contracts would have received disclosure from Keyport informing the owners of the proposed Merger, including the Transfers.
2.	MVA Transfer
In our view, the MVA Transfer will not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security for purposes of Section 5 of the 1933 Act.
No change will be made to the Keyport MVA Contracts by virtue of the MVA Transfer, except that Sun Life (U.S.) will succeed Keyport as the insurance company responsible for providing the rights and benefits under the Keyport MVA Contracts.  These rights and benefits (i.e., surrender rights, annuity options, death benefits, etc.) will remain the same.  Keyport will transfer its non-unitized separate accounts that hold assets supporting the reserves and other liabilities under the Keyport MVA Contracts intact to Sun Life (U.S.).  Consequently, when the MVA Transfer becomes effective, Sun Life (U.S.) will hold these assets in the same non-unitized separate accounts in which they were held prior to the transfer.
As discussed above, owners of Keyport MVA Contracts will not have the opportunity to opt-out of or to vote on or consent to the Merger (including the MVA Transfer) and will not, by virtue of the Merger, have available any new or different investment options.  Consequently, owners of Keyport MVA Contracts will have no new investment decision to make in connection with the MVA Transfer.
We believe, however, that the registration statement for the transferred Flexible Premium MVA Contracts needs to be in effect under the 1933 Act to cover any securities issued after the Merger, which may include any additional payments accepted on the transferred Flexible Premium MVA Contracts outstanding at the time the Merger is effected and any new Flexible Premium MVA Contracts issued thereafter.  As noted above, in connection with effecting the Merger, Sun Life (U.S.) and the Keyport Accounts will file a new registration statement with the Commission under the 1933 Act for the transferred Flexible Premium MVA Contracts, which registration statement will be requested to be declared effective in conjunction with the Merger.
The new registration statement, which will be filed on Form S-3, will reflect Sun Life (U.S.)'s assumption of Keyport's contractual obligations and liabilities with respect to the Contracts pursuant to the Merger.  Because the Transfers are to be made in connection with the Merger of Keyport into Sun Life (U.S.), the registration statement also will include appropriate financial information reflecting the Merger.  The new prospectus will be sent to all owners of Flexible Premium MVA Contracts outstanding at the time the Transfers are effected and will disclose that new premium payments will be accepted under the Flexible Premium MVA Contracts after the Merger.  Prior to the Effective Date, owners of outstanding Flexible Premium MVA Contracts will have received disclosure from Keyport informing the owners of the proposed Merger, including the Transfers.
C.	Section 8 of the 1940 Act is Inapplicable to the Transfer of the Keyport Accounts.
It is our view that the succession of Sun Life (U.S.) to the position of depositor for the transferred Keyport Accounts as a result of the Merger will not result in the organization or creation of any new investment company pursuant to Section 8 of the 1940 Act, and, therefore, can, and should, be effected through the amendment of existing registration statements of the Keyport Accounts under the 1940 Act.  The filing of these amendments with the Commission will be made as part of the process of filing new 1933 Act registration statements discussed above for the Keyport Contracts.  These amendments will reflect Sun Life (U.S.) as the depositor of the Keyport Accounts and the transfer of contractual obligations and liabilities from Keyport to Sun Life (U.S.) as of the Effective Date.  This procedure will not necessitate the filing of new notifications of registration or registration statements for the transferred Keyport Accounts pursuant to Section 8 of the 1940 Act.
The proposed Merger will cause a change in the depositor for the Keyport Accounts, which will involve a change in the co-issuer of the Keyport Contracts.  The resulting change in the depositor due to the Transfers of the Keyport Accounts, however, will not change the structure or operations of the Keyport Accounts or the relationship of the Keyport Accounts to their depositor or to the Keyport Contract owners.  The Keyport Accounts will continue to be treated as separate entities for all relevant purposes, including financial reporting.  Sun Life (U.S.) and the Keyport Accounts, accordingly, will amend the existing registration statements for the transferred Keyport Accounts under the 1940 Act on the Effective Date, as discussed above.
D.	Section 11 of the 1940 Act is Inapplicable to the Merger.
Based on the analysis set forth above relating to Section 5 of the 1933 Act, it also is our view that the Merger, including the Transfers and any related transactions, will not involve an exchange of securities issued by an investment company for any other security of an investment company for purposes of Section 11 of the 1940 Act.  Nonetheless, should these transactions be viewed as an offer of an exchange of investment company securities within the meaning of Section 11 of the 1940 Act, we believe that the transactions will comply with the conditions of Section 11(a) of the 1940 Act, and Rule 11a-2 thereunder.  Accordingly, Commission approval should not be required under Section 11 of the 1940 Act in connection with effecting the Merger, including the Transfers and any related transactions.
Similar to the facts in previously issued no-action letters,17  the terms of the Merger Agreement will not result in any change to the Keyport Variable Contracts, except that, by operation of law, the identity of the depositor will change.  These previously issued no-action letters involved circumstances substantially similar to those presented above: two insurance companies merging with one or both of the companies having variable contracts outstanding.  Each of the previously issued no-action letters indicates that, just as in this case, the assets and liabilities which comprised the funding separate account after the merger remained intact, and were legally segregated from the other business of the surviving life insurance company.
In this case, the assets in each of the transferred Keyport Accounts will not be combined with those of any other separate account or other entity.  The transferred Keyport Variable Contracts will continue to provide Contract owners with the same rights and benefits after the proposed Merger as before, including surrender rights, loan privileges, annuity options and death benefits.  In addition, the Keyport Variable Contracts will continue to be funded by the transferred Keyport Accounts (albeit under a new name).  The financial history of the transferred Keyport Accounts will be carried forward, and, with the exception of the assumption of liabilities by Sun Life (U.S.), the Keyport Variable Contracts will not change.  Furthermore, the assumption of the insurance guarantees under the Keyport Variable Contracts by Sun Life (U.S.) by operation of state law will not affect those aspects of the Contracts that caused them to be treated as securities (i.e., the variable nature of the benefits under the Keyport Contracts).18 
IV.	NO-ACTION REQUEST
In view of these circumstances, we respectfully request that the staff issue a letter stating that the staff will not recommend that the Commission take any enforcement action against Sun Life (U.S.) or Keyport under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder in connection with the Transfers and the MVA Transfer or under Sections 8 and 11 of the 1940 Act in connection with the Transfers, if the Merger is effect as described herein.  In addition, we request that the staff further indicate in this letter that the staff will not recommend that the Commission take any action if: (1) the change in the depositor for the transferred Keyport Accounts as a result of the Merger is effected through the filing of amendments to the registration statements for the Keyport Accounts under the 1940 Act; and (2) new registration statements for the transferred Keyport Contracts under the 1933 Act are filed by Sun Life (U.S.) and the Keyport Accounts to cover any securities issued in connection with the Keyport Contracts after the Merger is effected.
If you have any question or require further information with respect to this matter, please call me at (202) 965- 8152 or Joan Boros at (202) 965-8150.

Very truly yours,

4 Keyport has ceased offering certain Keyport Variable Contracts, although those Contracts continue to permit additional payments and to allow transfers among sub-accounts, subject to certain conditions.  See note 3, supra.  Keyport does not file annual post-effective amendments or distribute updated prospectuses to existing Contract owners with respect to these Contracts in reliance on prior Commission staff no-action positions.  See Great-West Life and Annuity Insurance Company (pub. avail. Oct. 23, 1990).
5 KeySelect Annuity Contracts (File No. 333-01783).
6 KeyIndex Flex Annuity Contracts (File No. 333-13609).
7 Regulatory approval of the Merger is necessary in three states.  The Merger has been approved by the state insurance regulators in Delaware and Rhode Island, the domiciliary states of Sun Life (U.S.) and Keyport, respectively, and by the California Department of Insurance.
8 See note 3, supra.  Sun Life (U.S.) currently has no plans to develop and offer additional types of variable contracts through the Keyport Accounts after the Merger.
9 On a number of previous occasions, the Commission staff has been asked to provide no-action assurances (which the staff has granted) under Sections 17(a) and 17(d) of the 1940 Act in situations when insurance companies merged and transferred separate accounts in connection with the merger.  See, e.g., Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. (pub. avail. May 17, 1996); Intramerica Life Ins. Co. (pub. avail. Oct. 29, 1992); California-Western States Life Ins. Co. (pub. avail. Dec. 9, 1991); UNUM Life Ins. Co. (pub. avail. Oct. 24, 1991); Lincoln National Pension Ins. Co. (pub. avail. Dec. 29, 1988); and American General Life Ins. Co. of Delaware (pub. avail. Mar. 13, 1986).  The staff has stated in these no-action letters that neither Section 17(a) nor Section 17(d) of the 1940 Act is applicable in the case of a transaction, like the present one. The staff further stated in Metropolitan Life that it does not intend to issue additional no-action letters in this area absent novel facts and circumstances.  We do not believe that novel facts or circumstances are present with respect to the Transfers and the factors discussed in the forgoing letters.
10 See, e.g., Allstate Life Ins. Co. (pub. avail. Dec. 23, 2002); Sun Life Insurance and Annuity Co. of New York (pub. avail. Dec. 20, 2002); The Manufacturers Life In. Co. (pub. avail. Dec. 27, 2001); Aid Association for Lutherans/Lutheran Brotherhood (pub. avail. Dec. 21, 2001); Jefferson Pilot Financial Ins. Co., Alexander Hamilton Life Ins. Co. of America (pub. avail. Aug. 1, 2002); AUSA Life Ins. Co. (pub. avail. Sept. 18, 1998).
11 Rule 145 under the 1933 Act may apply when there is submitted to security holders for a vote or consent a plan or agreement for, among other things, "a statutory merger or consolidation or similar plan or acquisition in which securities of such corporation or other person held by such security holders will become or be exchanged for securities of any other person."  According to the Preliminary Note to Rule 145, "the thrust of the Rule is that an 'offer,' 'offer to sell,' 'offer for sale,' or 'sale' occurs when there is submitted to security holders a plan or agreement pursuant to which such holders are required to elect, on the basis of what is in substance a new investment decision, whether to accept a new or different security in exchange for their existing security."
12 See the no-action letters cited in note 10, supra.
13 The Merger will affect only the insurance aspects of the Keyport Contracts  (i.e., the insurance company guaranteeing the death benefit and certain other contractual rights) and will not affect those aspects that cause the Keyport Contracts to be treated as securities (e.g., the cash surrender value and investment options available through the Keyport Accounts).
14 See the no-action letters cited in note 10 and the accompanying text to note  11, supra.
15 We note that the Form N-14 registration statement, by its terms, does not apply to separate accounts registered as unit investment trusts.
16 While new registration statements will be filed for certain Keyport Variable Contracts that Keyport has ceased offering, Sun Life (U.S.) will rely on prior Commission no-action positions in discontinuing filing post-effective amendments and delivering updated prospectuses to existing owners of these Contracts.  See Great-West, supra note 4.  We are not requesting any no-action assurances from the staff with respect to the reliance by Sun Life (U.S.) or Keyport on these prior staff positions.
17 See the no-action letters cited in note 10, supra.
18 See the accompanying text to note 13, supra.

General                                                                         

Keyport Life Insurance Company ("Keyport") is a specialty insurance company     
providing  a  diversified  line  of fixed,  indexed  and  variable  annuity     
products  designed to serve the growing retirement savings  market.   These     
annuity  products are sold through a wide ranging network of banks,  agents     
and  securities dealers.  Keyport seeks to (i) maintain its presence in the     
fixed  annuity  market  while expanding its sales of variable  and  equity-     
indexed  annuities, (ii) achieve a broader market presence through the  use     
of  diversified  distribution channels and (iii)  maintain  a  conservative     
approach to investment and liability management.                                

Keyport  is  licensed to do business in all states except New York  and  is     
also  licensed in the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands.  Keyport     
has  been  rated  A+  (Superior) by A.M. Best and  Company  ("A.M.  Best"),     
independent analysts of the insurance industry.  Keyport has been rated  A+     
each  year  since 1976, the first year Keyport was subject to  A.M.  Best's     
alphabetic  rating  system. The A.M. Best's A+ rating  is  in  the  highest     
rating category, which also includes A++.                                       

Keyport's  wholly  owned insurance subsidiaries are Independence  Life  and     
Annuity  Company ("Independence Life") and American Benefit Life  Insurance     
Company,  to  be  renamed Keyport Benefit Life Insurance Company  ("Keyport     
Benefit"), on or about April 1, 1998.  Other wholly owned subsidiaries  are     
Liberty Advisory Services Corporation, an investment advisory company,  and     
Keyport  Financial  Services  Corp.,  a  broker-dealer  (collectively   the     
"Company").                                                                     

The  Company  is  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty  Financial     
Companies,  Inc. ("Liberty Financial") which is a publicly  traded  holding     
company.  Liberty  Financial is an indirect majority  owned  subsidiary  of     
Liberty  Mutual  Insurance  Company  ("Liberty"),  a  multi-line  insurance     
company.                                                                        

Liberty Financial is an asset accumulation and management company providing     
investment  management and retirement-oriented insurance  products  through     
multiple   distribution   channels.    Keyport   issues   and   underwrites     
substantially  all  of  Liberty  Financial's retirement-oriented  insurance     
products.   Liberty  Financial's investment advisor, asset  management  and     
bank   distribution   operating  units  are  The   Colonial   Group,   Inc.     
("Colonial"),  Stein  Roe & Farnham Incorporated  ("Stein  Roe"),   Newport     
Pacific  Management,  Inc.  ("Newport")  and  Independent  Holdings,   Inc.     
("Independent").  Colonial, Stein Roe and Newport manage certain underlying     
mutual  funds  and  other invested assets of Keyport's  separate  accounts.     
Stein Roe also provides asset management services for a substantial portion     
of Keyport's general account.  Independent, through its subsidiary, markets     
Keyport's products through the bank distribution channel.                       

Keyport's  executive  and administrative offices are located  at  125  High     
Street,  Boston Massachusetts 02110, and its home office is at  695  George     
Washington Highway, Lincoln, Rhode Island 02865.                                

Products                                                                        

The  Company  (primarily Keyport) sells a full range of retirement-oriented     
insurance  products,  grouped by whether they  provide  fixed,  indexed  or     
variable returns to policyholders.  Annuities offer a tax-favored means  of     
accumulating  savings  for  retirement needs and  provide  a  tax-efficient     
source  of  income in the payout period.  The Company earns  spread  income     
from fixed and indexed annuities; variable annuities primarily produce  fee     
income for the Company.  The Company's primary financial objectives are  to     
increase policyholder balances through new sales and asset retention and to     
earn required investment spreads on its fixed and indexed-return products.      

Fixed  Annuities. The Company's principal fixed annuity products are single     
premium deferred annuities ("SPDAs").  A SPDA policyholder typically  makes     
a  single  premium  payment at the time of issuance. The Company  obligates     
itself  to credit interest to the policyholder's account at a rate that  is     
guaranteed  for an initial term (typically one year) and is reset  annually     
thereafter,  subject  to  a  guaranteed minimum rate.   Interest  crediting     
continues  until the policy is surrendered or the policyholder  retires  or     
turns age 90.                                                                   

Equity-Indexed  Annuities.   Equity-indexed  annuities  are  an  innovative     
product first introduced to the marketplace in 1995 by the Company when  it     
began   selling   its  KeyIndex   product.   The  Company's  equity-indexed     
annuities  credit  interest to the policyholder at a  "participation  rate"     
equal  to a portion (ranging for existing policies from 60% to 95%) of  the     
change in value of a specified equity index.  KeyIndex is currently offered     
for  one,  five  and  seven-year terms with interest earnings  based  on  a     
percentage  of  the increase in the Standard & Poor's 500  Composite  Stock     
Price  Index ("S&P 500 Index") ("S&P", "S&P 500", and "Standard  &  Poor's"     
are  trademarkes of The McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. and have been  licensed     
for  use  by the Company). With the five and seven-year terms, the interest     
earnings are based on the highest policy anniversary date value of the  S&P     
500  Index  during  the  term.   KeyIndex  also  provides  a  guarantee  of     
principal at the end of the term.  Thus, unlike a direct equity investment,     
even  if  the  S&P  500  Index declines, there is no  market  risk  to  the     
policyholder's  principal.  In late 1996, the Company introduced  a  market     
value  adjusted ("MVA") annuity product, KeySelect, which offers  a  choice     
between  an equity-indexed account similar to KeyIndex and a fixed  annuity     
type  interest  account.   KeySelect offers terms for  each  equity-indexed     
account  of  one, three, five, six and seven years, as well as  a  ten-year     
term  for the fixed interest account. KeySelect shifts some investment risk     
to  the  policyholder, since surrender of the policy before the end of  the     
product term will result in increased or decreased account values based  on     
the  change  in  rates  of designated U.S. Treasury  securities  since  the     
beginning of the term. The Company is continuing to develop new versions of     
the  equity-indexed  annuities,  including versions  registered  under  the     
Securities  Act  which  are  designed to be  sold  through  major  national     
brokerage firms.                                                                

Variable  Annuities.   Variable annuities offer a selection  of  underlying     
investment  alternatives  which  may  satisfy  a  variety  of  policyholder     
risk/return objectives.  Under variable annuities, the policyholder has the     
opportunity  to  select separate account investment options (consisting  of     
underlying  mutual funds) which pass the investment risk  directly  to  the     
policyholder  in  return  for the potential of  higher  returns.   Variable     
annuities  also include guaranteed fixed interest options.   The  Company's     
Keyport  Advisor  variable  annuity currently offers  18  separate  account     
investment choices and four guaranteed fixed interest options.                  

While  the  Company  currently does not offer  traditional  life  insurance     
products,  it manages a closed block of single premium whole life insurance     
policies  ("SPWLs"),  a retirement-oriented tax-advantaged  life  insurance     
product. The Company discontinued sales of SPWLs in response to certain tax     
law  changes  in the 1980s.  The Company had SPWL policyholder balances  of     
$2.0 billion as of December 31, 1997.                                           

Under  the  Internal Revenue Code, returns credited on annuities  and  life     
insurance policies during the accumulation period (the period during  which     
interest or other returns are credited) are not subject to federal or state     
income  tax.   Proceeds payable on death from a life insurance  policy  are     
also  free from such taxes.  At the maturity or payment date of an  annuity     
policy,  the policyholder is entitled to receive the original deposit  plus     
accumulated  returns. The policyholder may elect to  take  this  amount  in     
either  a  lump  sum or an annuitized series of payments  over  time.   The     
return  component  of  such payments is taxed at the  time  of  receipt  as     
ordinary  income at the recipient's then applicable tax rate.   The  demand     
for the Company's retirement-oriented insurance products could be adversely     
affected by changes in this tax treatment.                                      

The  Company's mix of annuity products is designed to include  products  in     
demand  under a variety of economic and market conditions.  Sales of  SPDAs     
tend  to  be sensitive to prevailing interest rates.  Sales can be expected     
to  increase and surrenders to decrease in interest rate environments  when     
SPDA  rates  are higher than rates offered by competing conservative  fixed     
return  investments, such as bank certificates of deposit.  SPDA sales  can     
be  expected  to  decline  and  surrenders to  increase  in  interest  rate     
environments when this differential in rates is not present (as is the case     
at  the  date  of  the  filing of this Report).  SPDA  sales  also  can  be     
adversely  affected by low interest rates (as is the case at  the  date  of     
this Report).

Sales and Asset Retention                                                       
Product  sales  are  influenced  primarily  by  overall  market  conditions     
impacting the attractiveness of the Company's retirement-oriented insurance     
products,  and  by  product  features,  including  interest  crediting  and     
participation  rates,  and innovations and services  that  distinguish  the     
Company's products from those of its competitors.                               

The  Company's  insurance products include important features  designed  to     
promote  both  sales  and asset retention, including  crediting  rates  and     
surrender charges.  Initial interest crediting and participation  rates  on     
fixed  and  indexed  products  significantly  influence  the  sale  of  new     
policies.   Resetting of rates on SPDAs impacts retention of  SPDA  assets,     
particularly  on  policies  where  surrender  penalties  have  expired.  At     
December 31, 1997, crediting rates on 95.0% of the Company's in force  SPDA     
policy  liabilities were subject to reset during the succeeding 12  months.     
In  setting  crediting  and participation rates,  the  Company  takes  into     
account  yield characteristics on its investment portfolio, surrender  rate     
assumptions and competitive industry pricing.  Interest crediting rates  on     
the  Company's  in force SPDAs ranged from 4.30% to 7.94% at  December  31,
1997.  Such policies had guaranteed minimum rates ranging from 3.0% to 5.5%     
as  of  such date.  Initial interest crediting rates on new policies issued     
in  1997  ranged  from  4.60% to 7.94%.  Guaranteed minimum  rates  on  new     
policies issued during 1997 ranged from 3.0% to 5.5%.                           

All  of  the  Company's  annuities permit the policyholder  at  anytime  to     
withdraw all or part of the accumulated policy value. Premature termination     
of  an  annuity  policy results in the loss by the Company  of  anticipated     
future  earnings  related  to  the  premium  deposit  and  the  accelerated     
recognition  of  the  expenses related to policy  acquisition  (principally     
commissions), which otherwise are deferred and amortized over the  life  of     
the  policy.   Surrender  charges provide a measure of  protection  against     
premature  withdrawal of policy values. Substantially all of the  Company's     
insurance  products currently are issued with surrender charges or  similar     
penalties.   Such  surrender  charges for all  policies,  except  KeyIndex,     
typically start at 7% of the policy premium and then decline to zero over a     
five to seven year period  KeyIndex imposes a penalty on surrender of up to     
10%  of  the  premium deposit for the life of the policy. At  December  31,
1997, 83.0% of the Company's SPDAs remained in the surrender charge period.     
Surrender charges generally do not apply to withdrawals by policyowners of,     
depending  on the policy, either up to 10% per year of the then accumulated     
value or the accumulated returns. In addition, certain policies may provide     
for  charge-free withdrawals in certain circumstances and at certain times.     
All  policies  except for certain variable annuities are  also  subject  to     
"free  look" risk (the legal right of a policyholder to cancel  the  policy     
and  receive  back  the  premium deposit, without interest,  for  a  period     
ranging  from  ten days to one year, depending upon the  policy).   To  the     
extent  a  policyholder exercises the "free look" option, the  Company  may     
realize  a  loss  as  a result of any investment losses on  the  underlying     
assets during the free look period, as well as the commissions paid on  the     
sale of the policy.  While SPWLs also permit withdrawal, it generally would     
produce significant adverse tax consequences to the policyholder.               

Keyport's  strong  financial  ratings  are  important  to  its  ability  to     
accumulate  and  retain assets.  Keyport is rated "A+" (Superior)  by  A.M.     
Best,  "AA"  (excellent financial security) by Standard &  Poor's  ("S&P"),     
"A1"  (good  financial  strength) by Moody's and "AA-"  (very  high  claims     
paying  ability)  by  Duff & Phelps.  "A+" is A.M.  Best's  second  highest     
rating.  S&P raised Keyport's rating from "AA-" to "AA" in February,  1998.     
These  ratings reflect the opinion of the rating agency as to the  relative     
financial strength of Keyport and Keyport's ability to meet its contractual     
obligations to its policyholders.  Such ratings are not "market" ratings or     
recommendations to use or invest in Keyport and should not be  relied  upon     
when   making  a  decision  to  invest  in  the  Company.   Many  financial     
institutions  and broker-dealers focus on the claims-paying ability  of  an     
insurer in determining whether to market the insurer's annuities.   If  any     
of  Keyport's ratings were downgraded from their current levels or  if  the     
ratings  of Keyport's competitors improved and Keyport's did not, sales  of     
Keyport's  products, the level of surrenders on existing policies  and  the     
Company's  relationships  with distributors could be  materially  adversely     
affected.  No assurances can be given that Keyport will be able to maintain     
its financial ratings.                                                          

Customer  service  is essential to asset accumulation and  retention.   The     
Company  believes  it  has  a  reputation  for  excellent  service  to  its     
distributors  and  its policyholders.  The Company has  developed  advanced     
technology systems for immediate response to customer inquiries, and  rapid     
processing of policy issuance and commission payments (often at  the  point     
of  sale).  These systems also play an important role in controlling costs.     
Keyport's  operating  expense ratio for 1997 was  0.40%  of  assets,  which     
reflects Keyport's low cost operations.                                         

General Account Investments                                                     

Premium deposits on fixed and equity-indexed annuities are credited to  the     
Company's  general account investments (which at December 31, 1997  totaled     
$13.5  billion).  To maintain its investment spreads at acceptable  levels,     
the Company must earn returns on its general account sufficiently in excess     
of the fixed or indexed returns credited to policyholders.  The key element     
of  this  investment  process  is asset/liability  management.   Successful     
asset/liability  management  requires both  a  quantitative  assessment  of     
overall  policy liabilities (including maturities, surrenders and crediting     
of  interest)  and prudent investment of general account assets.   The  two     
most  important tools in managing policy liabilities are setting  crediting     
rates  and establishing surrender periods.  The investment process requires     
portfolio techniques that earn acceptable yields while effectively managing     
both  interest  rate  risk  and  credit risk.   The  Company  emphasizes  a     
conservative  approach  to asset/liability management,  which  is  oriented     
toward  reducing downside risk in adverse markets, as opposed to maximizing     
spread  in  favorable  markets.  The approach is also  designed  to  reduce     
earnings  volatility.  Various factors can impact the Company's  investment     
spread, including changes in interest rates and other factors affecting the     
Company's general account investments.                                          

The bulk of the Company's general account investments are invested in fixed     
maturity  securities (83.3% at December 31, 1997).  The Company's principal     
strategy  for managing interest rate risk is to closely match the  duration     
of  its  general account investment portfolio to its policyholder balances.     
At  December 31, 1997, the effective duration of its fixed income portfolio     
was  approximately  2.9.  The Company also employs  hedging  strategies  to     
manage  this risk, including interest rate swaps and caps.  In the case  of     
equity-indexed products, the Company purchases S&P 500 Index  call  options     
to  hedge  its  obligations to provide participation rate returns.   Credit     
risk is managed by careful credit analysis and monitoring. At December  31,
1997,  the  Company's fixed maturity portfolio had an overall  average  S&P     
rating  of  A+.   A  portion of the general account  investments  (7.9%  at     
December  31,  1997) are invested in below investment grade fixed  maturity     
securities  to  enhance  overall portfolio yield.  Below  investment  grade     
securities  pose  greater  risks  than investment  grade  securities.   The     
Company  actively manages its below investment grade portfolio to  optimize     
its risk/return profile.  There were no non-income producing investments in     
the Company's fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 1997.                    

As  of  December 31, 1997, the Company owned approximately $3.5 billion  of     
mortgage-backed  securities  (26.2% of its  general  account  investments),     
97.4%  of  which  were  investment grade.  Mortgage-backed  securities  are     
subject to significant prepayment and extension risks, since the underlying     
mortgages may be repaid more or less rapidly than scheduled.                    

As of December 31, 1997, approximately $3.2 billion (23.8% of the Company's     
general  account investments) were invested in securities which  were  sold     
without  registration under the Securities Act and were not freely tradable     
under   the  Securities  Act  or  which  were  otherwise  illiquid.   These     
securities  may be resold pursuant to an exemption from registration  under     
the  Securities  Act.   If the Company sought to sell such  securities,  it     
might be unable to do so at the then current carrying values and might have     
to  dispose  of such securities over extended periods of time at  uncertain     
levels.                                                                         

Marketing and Distribution                                                      

Keyport's  sales  strategy  is  to use multiple  distribution  channels  to     
achieve broader market presence.  During 1997, the bank channel represented     
approximately  51.7% of Keyport's annuity sales, and the brokerage  channel     
represented  approximately    18.2%. The sale of insurance  and  investment     
products through the bank distribution channel is highly regulated.   Sales     
through  other  distributors  of  insurance  products,  such  as  financial     
planners  and  insurance agents, represented approximately 30.1%  of  total     
annuity sales.

Regulation                                                                      

The Company's business activities are extensively regulated.  The following     
briefly  summarizes  the  principal  regulatory  requirements  and  certain     
related matters.                                                                

Keyport's  retirement-oriented insurance products generally are  issued  as     
individual  policies.   The  policy  is  a  contract  between  the  issuing     
insurance  company  and  the  policyholder.  Policy  forms,  including  all     
principal  contract terms, are regulated by state law.  In most cases,  the     
policy  form must be approved by the insurance department or similar agency     
of a state in order for the policy to be sold in that state.                    

Keyport  and Independence are each chartered in Rhode Island and the  State     
of  Rhode Island Insurance Department is their primary oversight regulator.     
Keyport  and Independence Life also must be licensed by the state insurance     
regulators in each other jurisdiction in which they conduct business.  They     
currently  are  licensed to conduct business in 49  states  (the  exception     
being  New  York),  and in the District of Columbia. State  insurance  laws     
generally provide regulators with broad powers related to issuing  licenses     
to  transact  business,  regulating marketing and  other  trade  practices,     
operating   guaranty  associations,  regulating  certain   premium   rates,     
regulating   insurance   holding  company  systems,  establishing   reserve     
requirements,  prescribing  the  form and  content  of  required  financial     
statements  and  reports,  performing  financial  and  other  examinations,     
determining  the  reasonableness  and adequacy  of  statutory  capital  and     
surplus,  regulating the type and amount of investments permitted, limiting     
the  amount of dividends that can be paid and the size of transactions that     
can  be consummated without first obtaining regulatory approval, and  other     
related  matters.   The  regulators  also  make  periodic  examinations  of     
individual  companies and review annual and other reports on the  financial     
conditions   of   all   companies   operating   within   their   respective     
jurisdictions.                                                                  

Keyport  prepares  its statutory-basis financial statements  in  accordance     
with   accounting  practices  prescribed  or  permitted  by  the  Insurance     
Department  of  the  State  of Rhode Island. Certain  statutory  accounting     
practices  are  prescribed  by state laws. Permitted  statutory  accounting     
practices encompass all accounting practices that are not proscribed;  such     
practices may differ between the states and companies within a state.   The     
National  Association of Insurance Commissioners (the "NAIC") currently  is     
in  the process of codifying statutory accounting practices, the result  of     
which  is  expected  to constitute the only source of prescribed  statutory     
accounting  practices.  That project, which is expected to be completed  in     
1998  may  result in changes to the accounting practices that  the  Company     
uses  to  prepare its statutory-basis financial statements.  The impact  of     
any such changes on the Company's statutory-surplus cannot be determined at     
this  time.  No assurance can be given that such changes would not  have  a     
material adverse effect on the Company.                                         

In  recent  years,  various states have adopted new quantitative  standards     
promulgated by the NAIC.  These standards are designed to reduce  the  risk     
of insurance company insolvencies, in part by providing an early warning of     
financial or other difficulties.  These standards include the NAIC's  risk-     
based  capital ("RBC") requirements.  RBC requirements attempt  to  measure     
statutory  capital and surplus needs based on the risks in a company's  mix     
of  products and investment portfolio.  The requirements provide  for  four     
different levels of regulatory attention which implement increasing  levels     
of  regulatory  control (ranging from development  of  an  action  plan  to     
mandatory  receivership).  As of December 31, 1997, Keyport's  capital  and     
surplus  exceeded  the  level  at  which the  lowest  of  these  regulatory     
attention levels would be triggered.                                            

Under the insurance guaranty fund laws existing in each state, insurers can     
be  assessed  for certain obligations of insolvent insurance  companies  to     
policyholders and claimants.  Because assessments typically  are  not  made     
for  several  years  after  an  insurer fails,  Keyport  cannot  accurately     
determine  the precise amount or timing of its exposure to known  insurance     
company  insolvencies at this time.  For certain information regarding  the     
Company's historical and estimated future assessments, see Note 11  to  the     
Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.  The insolvency of large  life     
insurance companies in future years could result in material assessments to     
Keyport by state guaranty funds.                                                

Current Rhode Island insurance law imposes prior approval requirements  for     
certain  transactions  with  affiliates and  generally  regulates  dividend     
payments  by  a Rhode Island-chartered insurance subsidiary to  its  parent     
company.  Keyport may not make dividend payments in excess of the lesser of     
(i)  10%  of its statutory surplus as of the preceding December 31 or  (ii)     
its  statutory  net  gain  from operations for the  preceding  fiscal  year     
without  prior approval by the State of Rhode Island Insurance  Department.     
As  of  December  31, 1997, such restriction would limit dividends  without     
such  approval to approximately $70.3 million.  Keyport has  not  paid  any     
dividends since its acquisition in December, 1988.                              

Competition                                                                     

The  Company's  business activities are conducted in extremely  competitive     
markets.  Keyport competes with a large number of life insurance companies,     
some  of  which  are  larger and more highly capitalized  and  have  higher     
ratings  than Keyport. No one company dominates the industry. In  addition,     
Keyport's  products compete with alternative investment vehicles  available     
through  financial  institutions, brokerage firms and investment  managers.     
Management  believes  that  Keyport competes principally  with  respect  to     
product  features, pricing, ratings and service; management  also  believes     
that  Keyport  can  continue  to compete successfully  in  this  market  by     
offering  innovative products and superior services. In addition, financial     
institutions  and  broker-dealers  focus  on  the  insurer's  ratings   for     
financial  strength  or  claims-paying ability in  determining  whether  to     
market the insurer's annuities.                                                 

Employees                                                                       

As  of  December  31, 1997, the Company had 412 full-time  employees.   The     
Company  provides  its  employees with a broad range  of  employee  benefit     
programs.   The Company believes that its relations with its employees  are     
excellent.                                                                      

Item 2. Properties                                                              

As   of   December   31,  1997,  the  Company  maintained  its   executive,     
administrative  and sales offices in leased facilities. The Company  leases     
approximately  76,000 square feet in a single facility in  downtown  Boston     
pursuant  to  a  lease  which  expires in 2008.  The  Company  also  leases     
approximately  19,800 square feet in a single facility  in  Lincoln,  Rhode     
Island  and  7,700  square feet in a single facility in  Maitland,  Florida     
pursuant to leases which expire in 2007 and 1999, respectively.                 

Item 3. Legal Proceedings
The  Company is from time to time involved in litigation incidental to  its     
business.  In the opinion of Keyport's management, the resolution  of  such     
litigation  is  not  expected  to have a material  adverse  effect  on  the     
Company's financial condition or results of operations.

Results of Operations                                                           

Net income was $113.6 million in 1997 compared to $90.6 million in 1996 and     
$69.6 million in 1995. The improvement of $23.0 million in 1997 compared to     
1996  resulted from higher investment spread, higher fee income and  higher     
net  realized  investment  gains. Partially  offsetting  these  items  were     
increased  amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and  value  of     
insurance  in  force,  higher  operating expenses  and  higher  income  tax     
expense.                                                                        

Investment  spread is the amount by which investment income earned  on  the     
Company's  investments exceeds interest credited to policyholder  balances.     
Investment spread was $253.0 million in 1997 compared to $217.6 million  in     
1996  and $200.2 million in 1995. The amount by which the average yield  on     
investments  exceeds  the average interest credited  rate  on  policyholder     
balances  is  the  investment  spread percentage.  Such  investment  spread     
percentage was 1.91% in 1997, and 1.84% in 1996 and 1995.                       

Investment income was $847.0 million in 1997 compared to $790.4 million  in     
1996  and  $755.9  million in 1995. The increase of $56.6 million  in  1997     
compared to 1996 primarily relates to an $85.6 million increase as a result     
of  a  higher  level  of  average invested assets, partially  offset  by  a     
$29.0 million decrease resulting from a lower average investment yield. The     
1997  investment  income was net of $47.6 million of  S&P  500  Index  call     
option   amortization  expense  related  to  the  Company's  equity-indexed     
annuities  compared to $14.0 million in 1996. The average investment  yield     
was  6.90%  in 1997 compared to 7.16% in 1996.  Investment income increased     
in 1996 compared to 1995 primarily as a result of a higher level of average     
invested  assets, partially offset by a decrease in the average  investment     
yield. The average investment yield was 7.16% in 1996 compared to 7.51%  in     
1995.                                                                           

Interest  credited to policyholders totaled $594.1 million in 1997 compared     
to  $572.7  million  in 1996 and $555.7 million in 1995.  The  increase  of     
$21.4 million in 1997 compared to 1996 primarily relates to a $56.4 million     
increase  as  a result of a higher level of average policyholder  balances,     
partially offset by a $35.0 million decrease resulting from a lower average     
interest  credited  rate.   Policyholder balances  averaged  $11.9  billion     
(including  $10.8  billion of fixed products and $1.1  billion  of  equity-     
indexed  annuities)  in  1997 compared to $10.8  billion  (including  $10.4     
billion of fixed products and $0.4 billion of equity-indexed annuities)  in     
1996.   The  average  interest credited rate  was  4.99%  (5.45%  on  fixed     
products  and 0.85% on equity-indexed annuities) in 1997 compared to  5.32%     
(5.50%  on fixed products and 0.85% on equity-indexed annuities)  in  1996.     
The  Company's equity-indexed annuities credit interest to the policyholder     
at a "participation rate" equal to a portion (ranging for existing policies     
from  60%  to  95%)  of  the change in value of the  S&P  500  Index.   The     
Company's  equity-indexed  annuities  also  provide  a  full  guarantee  of     
principal  if held to term, plus interest at 0.85% annually.  For  each  of     
the   periods   presented,   the   interest  credited   to   equity-indexed     
policyholders  related to the participation rate was offset  by  investment     
income recognized on the S&P 500 Index call options, resulting in an  0.85%     
net  credited rate.  Interest credited to policyholders increased  in  1996     
compared  to  1995  primarily as a result of  a  higher  level  of  average     
policyholder  balances,  partially offset by  a  decrease  in  the  average     
interest  credited rate. Policyholder balances averaged  $10.8  billion  in     
1996  compared to $9.8 billion in 1995.  The average interest credited rate     
was 5.67% in 1995.                                                              

Average  investments  (computed  without  giving  effect  to  Statement  of     
Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 115),  including  a  portion  of  the     
Company's cash and cash equivalents, were $12.3 billion in 1997 compared to     
$11.0  billion  in  1996 and $10.1 billion in 1995. The  increase  of  $1.3     
billion  in  1997 compared to 1996 was primarily due to a 100%  coinsurance     
agreement with respect to a $954.0 million block of SPDAs entered into with     
Fidelity  & Guaranty Life Insurance Company ("F&G Life") during  the  third     
quarter  of  1996 and investment portfolio earnings. The increase  of  $0.9     
billion  in 1996 compared to 1995 was primarily due to the reinvestment  of     
portfolio earnings and the F&G Life transaction.                                

Net  realized investment gains were $24.7 million in 1997 compared to  $5.5     
million in 1996 and net realized investment losses of $4.0 million in 1995.     
Sales  of  fixed maturity investments generally are made to maximize  total     
return.  The  net realized investment gains in 1997 included gains  on  the     
sales  of  fixed  maturity  investments  of  $16.8  million  and  gains  on     
redemption  of  seed  money investments in separate  account  mutual  funds     
sponsored  by  the  Company of $7.9 million.  The net  realized  investment     
gains  in  1996  were  primarily attributable to sales  of  fixed  maturity     
investments and sales of investments received in the F&G Life transaction.      

Surrender  charges on fixed and variable annuity withdrawals generally  are     
assessed at declining rates applied to policyholder withdrawals during  the     
first  five  to seven years of the contract. Total surrender  charges  were     
$16.0  million in 1997 compared to $14.9 million in 1996 and $14.8  million     
in 1995.                                                                        

Total  annuity  withdrawals represented 11.6% of the total average  annuity     
policyholder  and separate account balances in 1997 and 1996  and  9.9%  in     
1995.   Excluding surrenders from the older block of annuities acquired  in     
the  F&G Life transaction, the withdrawal percentages were 10.6% and  10.0%     
in 1997 and 1996, respectively.                                                 

Separate account fees are primarily mortality and expense charges earned on     
variable annuity and variable life policyholder balances. These fees, which     
are  based  on  the  market  values  of the  assets  in  separate  accounts     
supporting  the  contracts, were $17.1 million in 1997  compared  to  $16.0     
million  in  1996 and $13.2 million in 1995.  Such fees represented  1.54%,     
1.68%  and  1.61%  of average variable annuity and variable  life  separate     
account balances in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.                          

Management  fees  are  primarily investment advisory fees  related  to  the     
separate  account assets. The fees are based on the levels of assets  under     
management, which are affected by product sales and redemptions and changes     
in the market values of the investments managed.  Management fees were $3.3     
million in 1997 compared to $2.6 million in 1996 and $1.8 million in  1995.     
The increase of $0.7 million in 1997 compared to 1996 primarily reflects  a     
higher level of average assets under management.                                

Operating  expenses  primarily represent compensation,  selling  and  other     
general  and administrative expenses. These expenses were $49.9 million  in     
1997  compared  to  $43.8 million in 1996 and $44.5 million  in  1995.  The     
increase  in  1997  compared to 1996 was primarily due to  higher  employee     
related  expenses and selling expenses.  The decrease in 1996  compared  to     
1995  was  primarily due to IRS interest penalties of $1.9 million recorded     
in 1995 related to a federal income tax assessment.                             

Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs was $75.9 million in 1997     
compared  to  $60.2  million  in  1996 and $58.5  million  in  1995.  These     
increases  in amortization in 1997 and 1996 were primarily related  to  the     
increase  in  investment  spread  from the  growth  of  business  in  force     
associated  with fixed and equity-indexed products and the increased  sales     
of  variable  annuity  products.  Amortization expense  represented  29.2%,     
27.7%   and   29.2%,  of  investment  spread  for  1997,  1996  and   1995,     
respectively.                                                                   

Amortization of value of insurance in force totaled $10.5 million  in  1997     
compared to $10.2 million in 1996 and $9.5 million in 1995. The increase in     
amortization  in  1997  compared to 1996 was  primarily  due  to  increased     
amortization of $4.0 million related to the F&G Life transaction, partially     
offset   by  decreased  amortization  related  to  a  change  in  mortality     
assumptions.   The increase in amortization in 1996 compared  to  1995  was     
primarily due to $2.7 million of amortization recorded in 1996 relating  to     
the  F&G  Life transaction, partially offset by lower amortization in  1996     
due to an increase in estimated amortization periods in the last quarter of     
1995 of the Company's closed block of single premium whole life insurance.      

Federal  income tax expense was $59.1 million or 34.2% of pretax income  in     
1997  compared to $47.2 million, or 34.3%  pretax income in 1996, and $38.3     
million, or 35.5% of pretax income in 1995.                                     

Effective  July 18, 1997, due to a decrease in the ownership percentage  of     
the  Company's  indirect parent, the Company is no longer included  in  the     
consolidated  federal income tax return of Liberty.  The Company  does  not     
expect this change to have a material effect on its financial condition  or     
its  results  from  operations.  The Company will be  required  to  file  a     
separate federal income tax return until the Company is eligible to file  a     
consolidated federal income tax return with Liberty Financial in 2002.          

Financial Condition                                                             

Stockholder's Equity as of December 31, 1997 was $1.1 billion  compared  to     
$980.8  million  as  of  December 31, 1996. The increase  in  stockholder's     
equity  was due to net income of $113.6 million, as well as an increase  in     
after-tax  unrealized  gains  and losses (net of  adjustments  to  deferred     
policy acquisition costs and value of insurance in force) during the period     
of $8.7 million.                                                                

Investments  not including cash and cash equivalents totaled $12.3  billion     
at  December 31, 1997 compared to $11.5 billion at December 31, 1996.   The     
increase  of $0.8 billion is primarily attributable to the reinvestment  of     
portfolio earnings in 1997.                                                     

The  Company's  general investment policy is to hold fixed maturity  assets     
for  long-term  investment and, accordingly, the Company does  not  have  a     
trading  portfolio.   To  provide  for maximum  portfolio  flexibility  and     
appropriate tax planning, the Company classifies its entire fixed  maturity     
portfolio  as "available for sale" and accordingly carries such investments     
at  fair  value.  The Company's total investments at December 31, 1997  and     
1996  reflected net unrealized gains of $280.3 million and $229.8  million,     
respectively, relating to its fixed maturity and equity portfolios.             

Approximately  $11.0  billion, or 81.7%, of the Company's  general  account     
investments  at  December  31,  1997,  was  rated  by  Standard  &   Poor's     
Corporation, Moody's Investors Service or under comparable statutory rating     
guidelines  established by the NAIC.  At December 31,  1997,  the  carrying     
value  of  investments  in below investment grade securities  totaled  $1.1     
billion,  or  7.9% of general account investments of $13.5  billion.  Below     
investment  grade  securities generally provide higher yields  and  involve     
greater  risks  than  investment  grade securities  because  their  issuers     
typically are more highly leveraged and more vulnerable to adverse economic     
conditions  than investment grade issuers. In addition, the trading  market     
for  these  securities  may  be  more limited  than  for  investment  grade     
securities.                                                                     

Management of the Company's Investments                                         

Asset-liability duration management is utilized by the Company to  minimize     
the  risks of interest rate fluctuations and policyholder withdrawals.  The     
Company  believes  that its fixed and equity-indexed policyholder  balances     
should be backed by investments, principally comprised of fixed maturities,     
that  generate  predictable rates of return. The Company does  not  have  a     
specific target rate of return. Instead, its rates of return vary over time     
depending  on the current interest rates, the slope of the yield curve  and     
the  excess at which fixed maturities are priced over the yield curve.  Its     
portfolio strategy is designed to achieve acceptable risk-adjusted  returns     
by effectively managing portfolio liquidity and credit quality.                 

The  Company  conducts  its  investment operations  to  closely  match  the     
duration  of  the  assets in its investment portfolio to  its  policyholder     
balances. The Company seeks to achieve an acceptable spread between what it     
earns  on its assets and interest credited on its policyholder balances  by     
investing   principally  in  fixed  maturities.  The  Company's  fixed-rate     
products  incorporate surrender charges to encourage persistency  and  make     
the cost of its policyholder balances more predictable. Approximately 83.0%     
of  the  Company's  fixed  annuity policyholder balances  were  subject  to     
surrender charges at December 31, 1997.                                         

As  part of its asset-liability management discipline, the Company conducts     
detailed  computer  simulations that model its  fixed-maturity  assets  and     
liabilities under commonly used stress-test interest rate scenarios.  Based     
on  the results of these computer simulations, the investment portfolio has     
been constructed with a view toward maintaining a desired investment spread     
between  the  yield on portfolio assets and the interest  credited  on  its     
policyholder  balances  under a variety of possible  future  interest  rate     
scenarios.  At  December 31, 1997 the effective duration of  the  Company's     
fixed  maturities investments (including certain cash and cash equivalents)     
was  approximately  2.9.  Effective duration is a common  measure  for  the     
price sensitivity of a fixed-income portfolio to changes in interest rates.     
It  measures  the approximate percentage change in the market  value  of  a     
portfolio  when  interest rates change by 100 basis points.   This  measure     
includes  the  impact  of estimated changes in portfolio  cash  flows  from     
features, such as prepayments and bond calls.                                   

As  a  component of its investment strategy and to reduce its  exposure  to     
interest rate risk, the Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements  and     
interest  rate cap agreements to match assets more closely to  liabilities.     
Swap  agreements are agreements to exchange with counterparty interest rate     
payments  of  differing character (e.g., fixed-rate payments exchanged  for     
variable-rate payments) based on an underlying principal balance  (notional     
principal)  to  hedge against interest rate changes. The Company  currently     
utilizes  swap  agreements to reduce asset duration  and  to  better  match     
interest earned on longer-term fixed-rate assets with interest credited  to     
policyholders.   The  Company had 45 outstanding swap  agreements  with  an     
aggregate  notional principal amount of $2.6 billion and had 39 outstanding     
swap agreements with an aggregate notional principal amount of $2.3 billion     
as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.                                 

Cap agreements are agreements with a counterparty which require the payment     
of  a  premium for the right to receive payments for the difference between     
the  cap interest rate and a market interest rate on specified future dates     
based  on  an  underlying principal balance (notional principal)  to  hedge     
against rising interest rates. The Company had interest rate cap agreements     
with  an aggregate notional amount of $250.0 million and $450.0 million  as     
of December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.                                    

With  respect  to the Company's equity-indexed annuities, the Company  buys     
call  options  on  the  S&P 500 Index to hedge its obligations  to  provide     
returns  based upon this index.  The Company had call options with  a  book     
value  of  $323.3 million and $109.7 million as of December  31,  1997  and     
1996, respectively.                                                             

There are risks associated with some of the techniques the Company uses  to     
match  its  assets and liabilities. The primary risk associated with  swap,     
cap  and call option agreements is counterparty nonperformance. The Company     
believes that the counterparties to its swap and call option agreements are     
financially  responsible  and that the counterparty  risk  associated  with     
these  transactions is minimal.  In addition, swap agreements have interest     
rate  risk  and  call options have stock market risk.   However,  the  swap     
agreements  hedge fixed-rate assets; the Company expects that any  interest     
rate  movements  that adversely affect the market value of swap  agreements     
would  be offset by changes in the market values of such fixed rate assets.     
Similarly,  the  call  options hedge the Company's obligations  to  provide     
returns  on equity-indexed annuities based upon the S&P 500 Index, and  the     
Company believes that any stock market movements that adversely affect  the     
market  value of S&P 500 call options would be substantially  offset  by  a     
reduction  in policyholder liabilities.  However, there can be no assurance     
that  these hedges will be effective in offsetting the potentially  adverse     
effects  of  changes in S&P 500 Index levels.  The Company's  profitability     
could  be  adversely  affected if the value of its  S&P  500  call  options     
increase less than (or decrease more than) the value of the guarantees made     
to equity-indexed policyholders.                                                

The  Company routinely reviews its portfolio of investment securities.  The     
Company   identifies  monthly  any  investments  that  require   additional     
monitoring, and carefully reviews the carrying value of such investments at     
least  quarterly to determine whether specific investments should be placed     
on  a nonaccrual basis and to determine declines in value that may be other     
than  temporary.  There  were no non-income producing  investments  in  the     
Company's  fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 1997.  In making  these     
reviews,  the Company principally considers the adequacy of collateral  (if     
any),   compliance  with  contractual  covenants,  the  borrower's   recent     
financial   performance,  news  reports  and  other  externally   generated     
information  concerning the creditor's affairs. In  the  case  of  publicly     
traded  fixed maturity investments, management also considers market  value     
quotations, if available.                                                       

Liquidity                                                                       

The  Company's  liquidity  needs and financial  resources  pertain  to  the     
management  of  the general account assets and policyholder  balances.  The     
Company  uses cash for the payment of annuity and life insurance  benefits,     
operating  expenses  and  policy acquisition costs,  and  the  purchase  of     
investments. The Company generates cash from annuity premiums and deposits,     
net  investment  income, and from maturities and sales of its  investments.     
Annuity  premiums,  maturing  investments and net  investment  income  have     
historically  been sufficient to meet the Company's cash requirements.  The     
Company  monitors  cash  and cash equivalents  in  an  effort  to  maintain     
sufficient  liquidity  and has strategies in place to  maintain  sufficient     
liquidity  in  changing  interest rate environments.  Consistent  with  the     
nature of its obligations, the Company has invested a substantial amount of     
its  general  account assets in readily marketable securities. At  December
31,  1997,  $10.3  billion,  or  76.2%, of the  Company's  general  account     
investments are considered readily marketable.                                  

To  the extent that unanticipated surrenders cause the Company to sell  for     
liquidity purposes a material amount of securities prior to their maturity,     
such  surrenders  could  have a material adverse  effect  on  the  Company.     
Although no assurance can be given, the Company believes that liquidity  to     
fund withdrawals would be available through incoming cash flow, the sale of     
short-term  or floating-rate instruments, thereby precluding  the  sale  of     
fixed maturity investments in a potentially unfavorable market.                 

Current  Rhode  Island insurance law permits the payment  of  dividends  or     
distributions  from the Company to Liberty Financial, which, together  with     
dividends  and  distributions paid during the preceding 12 months,  do  not     
exceed  the  lesser  of (i) 10% of statutory surplus as  of  the  preceding     
December  31 or (ii) the net gain from operations for the preceding  fiscal     
year.  Any  proposed  dividend  in excess  of  this  amount  is  called  an     
"extraordinary  dividend" and may not be paid until it is approved  by  the     
Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Rhode Island.  As of December 31,
1997,  the  amount  of dividends that the Company could  pay  without  such     
approval was $70.3 million.                                                     

Based  upon the historical cash flow of the Company, the Company's  current     
financial condition and the Company's expectation that there will not be  a     
material adverse change in the results of operations of the Company and its     
subsidiaries during the next twelve months, the Company believes that  cash     
flow  provided  by  operating  activities over  this  period  will  provide     
sufficient liquidity for the Company to meet its liquidity needs.               

Year 2000                                                                       

Many  existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year  in     
the  date  field.  These  programs  were  designed  and  developed  without     
considering  the  impact  of the upcoming change in  the  century.  If  not     
corrected,  many  computer  applications could  fail  or  create  erroneous     
results by or at the Year 2000. This potential problem has become known  as     
the  "Year 2000 issue". The Year 2000 issue affects virtually all companies     
and organizations.                                                              

Computer  applications  which are affected by the  Year  2000  issue  could     
impact  Keyport's  business  functions in  various  ways,  ranging  from  a     
complete  inability to perform critical business functions  to  a  loss  of     
productivity  in  varying degrees. Likewise, the failure of  some  computer     
applications could have no impact on critical business functions.               

Keyport  is assessing and addressing the Year 2000 issue by implementing  a     
four-step  plan. The first two steps involve inventorying all the  computer     
applications  which support Keyport's business functions  and  prioritizing     
computer applications which are affected by the Year 2000 issue based  upon     
the  degree  of  impact each has on the functioning of  Keyport's  business     
units. The first two steps of the plan are substantially complete.              

The  final two steps of the four-step plan involve remediation of  affected     
computer  applications  (i.e., repairing or replacing  programs,  including     
those  which  interface  with third-party computer applications  that  have     
unremediated  Year 2000 issues, and appropriate testing) and reinstallation     
of  computer  applications. For computer applications  which  are  "mission     
critical"  (i.e., their failure would result in the complete  inability  to     
perform critical business functions), Keyport expects to complete the final     
two  steps of the plan by December 31, 1998. Remediation and reinstallation     
of  non-critical  computer applications is scheduled  to  be  completed  by     
December 31, 1999.                                                              

Keyport  believes that the Year 2000 issue could have a material impact  on     
Keyport's  operations  if  the four-step plan is  not  timely  implemented.     
However, based upon the progress that is being made, Keyport believes  that     
the  timetable for implementing the plan will be met and that the Year 2000     
issue  will  not  pose significant operational problems  for  its  computer     
systems.                                                                        

Effects of Inflation                                                            

Inflation  has  not  had  a material effect on the  Company's  consolidated     
results of operations to date. The Company manages its investment portfolio     
in  part  to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. In general,     
the  fair  value  of  the Company's fixed maturity portfolio  increases  or     
decreases in inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates,  and     
the  Company's  net  investment income increases  or  decreases  in  direct     
relationship  with interest rate changes.  For example, if  interest  rates     
decline the Company's fixed maturity investments generally will increase in     
fair  value,  while net investment income will decrease as  fixed  maturity     
investments mature or are sold and the proceeds are reinvested  at  reduced     
rates.  However, inflation may result in increased operating expenses  that     
may not be readily recoverable in the prices of the services charged by the     
Company.

The consolidated financial statements of Keyport and also Liberty Financial     
and  its subsidiaries, including Keyport, for the years ended December  31,
1997 and 1996 have been audited and reported upon by Ernst & Young ("E&Y").     
Similarly,  E&Y will serve as independent auditors of Keyport  and  Liberty     
Financial for 1998.                                                             

For  fiscal  years prior to 1996, the consolidated financial statements  of     
Keyport  and  Liberty  Financial  and its subsidiaries,  were  audited  and     
reported  on  by  KPMG  Peat Marwick LLP ("KPMG").    On  March  13,  1996,     
following  a  competitive proposal process, the Liberty  Financial's  Audit     
Committee  terminated  KPMG's  appointment as independent  accountants  for     
Liberty   Financial  and  its  audited  subsidiaries,  including   Keyport,     
effective  March 14, 1996, and voted to recommend to the Liberty  Financial     
Board   of   Directors  that   E&Y  be  appointed  as  Liberty  Financial's     
independent  accountants for fiscal year 1996. The Liberty Financial  Board     
of  Directors approved this recommendation on April 10, 1996.  On April 11,     
Keyport's Board of Directors approved such engagement of E&Y.                   

In  connection  with the audits of Keyport's financial statements  for  the     
fiscal  year  in  the  period ended December 31, 1995, and  the  subsequent     
interim  period through March 14, 1996, there were no disagreements between     
Keyport  and  KPMG  on  any matter of accounting principles  or  practices,     
financial  statement  disclosure, or auditing scope  or  procedures,  which     
disagreements if not resolved to KPMG's satisfaction would have caused KPMG     
to  make  reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection     
with  KPMG's  audit  reports  on the financial statements  of  Keyport.  In     
addition,   the  audit  reports  of  KPMG  on  the  consolidated  financial     
statements of Keyport as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1995     
did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were such     
reports qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting     
principles.                                                                     

PART III      

Item 10. Directors and Executive Officers of the Registrant                     

Information  relating to the executive officers of the  registrant  appears     
under the caption "Executive Officers of the Registrant" included in Part I     
of this Form 10-K following Item 4.                                             

Item 11. Executive Compensation                                                 

The  tables  that  appear  below,  along with  the  accompanying  text  and     
footnotes, provide information on compensation and benefits for  the  named     
executive  officers, in accordance with applicable SEC  requirements.   All     
the  data regarding values for stock options pertain to options to purchase     
shares  of Keyport's parent corporation, Liberty Financial Companies,  Inc.     
("Liberty Financial").  Such data are hypothetical in terms of the  amounts     
that  an  individual  may  or may not receive,  because  such  amounts  are     
contingent  on continued employment with Keyport and the price  of  Liberty     
Financial's  Common Stock ("Common Stock").  All year-end values  shown  in     
these  tables for outstanding stock options reflect a price of  $37.75  per     
share,  which  was the closing price of the Common Stock on  the  New  York     
Stock  Exchange on December 31, 1997 (the last trading day of 1997).   None     
of  the  named  executive  officers received any  perquisites  during  1997     
exceeding  the lesser of $50,000 or 10% of such officer's total salary  and     
bonus for such year.                                                            

Summary  Compensation Table.  The following table sets  forth  compensation     
information  for  the  past two fiscal years for each  of  Keyport's  chief     
executive  officer  and  the other four most highly  compensated  executive     
officers:

commencing on May 14, 1998, and vests in full upon the death, disability or     
retirement (after age 60) of the optionee.                                      

2  Amounts  represent  hypothetical gains that could be  achieved  for  the     
respective options if such options are not exercised until the end  of  the     
option  term.   These  gains  are based on assumed  rates  of  stock  price     
appreciation  of 5% and 10% in accordance with applicable SEC  regulations,     
compounded  annually  from the dates the options were granted  until  their     
expiration  dates  and, therefore, are not intended  to  forecast  possible     
future  appreciation in the Common Stock.  This table does  not  take  into     
account  appreciation in the price of the Common Stock after  the  date  of

Benefits under the Pension Plans are based on an employee's average pay for     
the five highest consecutive years during the last ten years of employment,     
the  employee's estimated social security retirement benefit and  years  of     
credited  service with Keyport.  The current compensation  covered  by  the     
Pension Plans for each participating executive officer in the above summary     
compensation  table is as follows: Mr. Rosensteel, $695,000;  Mr.  LeFevre,     
$470,000;  Mr.  Bonner, $325,000; Mr. Reinhart, $350,000 and Mr.  Morrison,     
$305,000.   For  purposes of determining benefits payable  upon  retirement     
under  the  Pension  Plans, compensation includes base  salary  and  annual     
bonus.  Benefits are payable in the form of a single-life annuity providing     
for  monthly  payments.  Actuarially equivalent methods of payment  may  be     
elected  by the recipient.  As of December 31, 1997, the executive officers     
named  in  the  above  summary compensation table had  the  following  full     
credited years of service under the Pension Plans: Mr. Rosensteel, 5 years;     
Mr. LeFevre, 18 years; Mr. Bonner, 1 years; Mr. Reinhart, 13 years; and Mr.     
Morrison, 7 years.                                                              

Change   of  Control  Provisions  of  1990  Stock  Option  Plan.    Liberty     
Financial's 1990 Stock Option Plan, as amended (the "1990 Plan"),  provided     
for  the  grant of options to officers and other key employees  of  Liberty     
Financial  for  the purchase of shares of common stock.  As  of  March  20,
1998,   options issued and outstanding under the 1990 Plan included  82,141     
shares  held by Mr. Rosensteel (69,659 of which were vested), 45,372 shares     
held  by Mr. LeFevre (all of which were vested); and 16,000 shares held  by     
Mr.  Reinhart (all of which were vested).   No additional options  will  be     
granted under the 1990 Plan.  Upon a change of control of Liberty Financial     
(defined as the transfer of 50% or more of the equity ownership of  Liberty     
Financial  other  than  solely  pursuant to  a  public  offering  in  which     
securities  are issued for cash), all non-vested options will automatically     
vest  and  Liberty Financial's Compensation and Stock Option Plan committee     
may,  in its discretion, elect to cancel all outstanding options by  paying     
the  holders thereof an amount equal to the difference between the  formula     
value  of  the Common Stock (as defined in the 1990 Plan) and the  exercise     
price of the options.                                                           

Compensation  of  Directors.  Directors of Keyport who are  also  employees     
receive  no compensation in addition to their compensation as employees  of     
Keyport.  The three outside directors (Lippitt, Ballou, and Nyman)  receive     
$2,000  per  quarter, plus $500 for each meeting of the Board of  Directors     
and $200 for each Audit Committee meeting that they attend.  Three meetings     
of  the  Board  of  Directors and two meetings of the Audit  Committee  are     
scheduled annually.                                                             

Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management         

Keyport  is a wholly owned, indirect subsidiary of Liberty Financial  which     
is  a  registrant  under  the Securities Exchange  Act  of  1934.   Liberty     
Financial  is  a  majority  owned, indirect subsidiary  of  Liberty  Mutual     
Insurance Company.                                                              

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions                         

As  noted  in  Item 12, Keyport is a wholly owned, indirect  subsidiary  of     
Liberty Financial.

Keyport Life Insurance Company                                                  

We  have  audited the consolidated balance sheet of Keyport Life  Insurance     
Company  as  of  December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the  related  consolidated     
statements  of income, stockholder's equity, and cash flows for  the  years     
then  ended.  Our  audits also included the financial  statement  schedules     
listed in the Index at Item 14(a). These financial statements and schedules     
are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility  is     
to  express an opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on     
our audits.                                                                     

We  conducted  our  audits in accordance with generally  accepted  auditing     
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit  to     
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free     
of  material  misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test  basis,     
evidence   supporting  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in   the   financial     
statements.   An  audit  also includes assessing the accounting  principles     
used  and  the  significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as     
evaluating  the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe  that     
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.                          

In  our  opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred  to  above     
present  fairly,  in  all  material respects,  the  consolidated  financial     
position  of Keyport Life Insurance Company at December 31, 1997 and  1996,     
and  the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for  the     
years   then   ended  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting     
principles.   Also,  in  our  opinion.  the  related  financial   statement     
schedules,  when  considered in relation to the basic financial  statements     
taken  as  a whole, present fairly in all material respects the information     
set forth therein.

1.  Accounting Policies                                                         

Organization                                                                    

Keyport Life Insurance Company offers a diversified line of fixed, indexed,     
and  variable  annuity  products designed to serve the  growing  retirement     
saving  market.   These annuity products are sold through  a  wide  ranging     
network of banks, agents, and securities dealers.                               

The Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Stein Roe Services Incorporated     
("Stein Roe").  Stein Roe is a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Financial     
Companies,  Incorporated ("Liberty Financial") which is a  majority  owned,     
indirect subsidiary of Liberty Mutual Insurance Company ("Liberty Mutual").     

Principles of Consolidation                                                     

The  consolidated  financial  statements  include  Keyport  Life  Insurance     
Company  and  its wholly owned subsidiaries, Independence Life and  Annuity     
Company  ("Independence Life"), Liberty Advisory Services Corporation,  and     
Keyport Financial Services Corp., (collectively the "Company").                 

The  accompanying consolidated financial statements have been  prepared  in     
accordance  with  generally accepted accounting principles  which  vary  in     
certain respects from reporting practices prescribed or permitted by  state     
insurance regulatory authorities. All significant intercompany transactions     
and  balances have been eliminated.   Certain prior year amounts have  been     
reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.                     

Use of Estimates                                                                

The  preparation  of  financial  statements in  conformity  with  generally     
accepted  accounting principles requires management to make  estimates  and     
assumptions  that  affect the amounts reported in the financial  statements     
and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.       

Investments                                                                     

Investments in debt and equity securities classified as available for  sale     
are  carried at fair value, and after-tax unrealized gains and losses  (net     
of  adjustments to deferred policy acquisition costs and value of insurance     
in force) are reported as a separate component of stockholder's equity. The     
cost  basis  of  securities  is adjusted for declines  in  value  that  are     
determined  to  be  other than temporary.  Realized  investment  gains  and     
losses are calculated on a first-in, first-out basis.

On December 31, 1995, pursuant to the "Guide to Implementation of Statement     
115  on  Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,"
the  Company  made  a one-time reclassification of certain  fixed  maturity     
securities from held to maturity to available for sale. The amortized  cost     
of  those  securities  at the time of transfer was $1.4  billion,  and  the     
unrealized gain of $13.9 million was recorded net of taxes in stockholder's     
equity.                                                                         

For  the  mortgage  backed  bond portion of the fixed  maturity  investment     
portfolio,  the Company recognizes income using a constant effective  yield     
based  on anticipated prepayments over the estimated economic life  of  the     
security.  When  actual prepayments differ significantly  from  anticipated     
prepayments, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments     
to  date  and  anticipated future payments and any resulting adjustment  is     
included in investment income.                                                  

Mortgage loans are carried at amortized cost.  Policy loans are carried  at     
the  unpaid  principal  balances plus accrued interest.   Partnerships  are     
accounted  for  by  using  the  equity method of  accounting.   Partnership     
investments totaled $117.3 million and $72.6 million at December  31,  1997     
and 1996, respectively.                                                         

Derivatives                                                                     

The  Company  uses  interest rate swap and cap  agreements  to  manage  its     
interest  rate risk and call options on the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite     
Stock  Price  Index ("S&P 500 Index") to hedge its obligations  to  provide     
returns based upon this index.                                                  

The  Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements ("swap agreements") and     
interest  rate  cap  agreements ("cap agreements")  to  match  assets  more     
closely to liabilities.  Swap agreements are agreements to exchange with  a     
counterparty  interest rate payments of differing character  (e.g.,  fixed-     
rate  payments exchanged for variable-rate payments) based on an underlying     
principal  balance  (notional  principal) to hedge  against  interest  rate     
changes.   The  Company currently utilizes swap agreements to reduce  asset     
duration  and  to  better match interest rates earned on longer-term  fixed     
rate assets with interest rates credited to policyholders.                      

Cap agreements are agreements with a counterparty which require the payment     
of  a  premium for the right to receive payments for the difference between     
the  cap interest rate and a market interest rate on specified future dates     
based  on  an  underlying  principal balance (notional  balance)  to  hedge     
against rising interest rates.

1.  Accounting Policies (continued)                                             

Hedge accounting is applied after the Company determines that the items  to     
be  hedged  expose  it  to  interest rate or  price  risk,  designates  the     
instruments  as  hedges,  and assesses whether the instruments  reduce  the     
indicated  risks  through the measurement of changes in the  value  of  the     
instruments and the items being hedged at both inception and throughout the     
hedge  period.   From  time  to time, interest rate  swap  agreements,  cap     
agreements and call options are terminated.  If the terminated position was     
accounted  for  as  a  hedge, realized gains or  losses  are  deferred  and     
amortized  over  the remaining lives of the hedged assets  or  liabilities.     
Conversely, if the terminated position was not accounted for as a hedge, or     
if  the  assets  and  liabilities that were hedged  no  longer  exist,  the     
position is "marked to market" and realized gains or losses are immediately     
recognized in income.                                                           

The  net  differential  to  be  paid or  received  on  interest  rate  swap     
agreements is recognized as a component of net investment income.  Premiums     
paid  for  interest rate cap agreements are deferred and amortized  to  net     
investment  income  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  terms  of   the     
agreements.  The unamortized premium is included in other invested  assets.     
Amounts  earned  on  interest  rate  cap  agreements  are  recorded  as  an     
adjustment to net investment income.  Interest rate swap agreements and cap     
agreements  hedging  investments  designated  as  available  for  sale  are     
adjusted  to  fair  value with the resulting unrealized  gains  and  losses     
included in stockholder's equity.                                               

Premiums  paid on call options are amortized to net investment income  over     
the  terms  of  the  contracts.  The call options  are  included  in  other     
invested assets and are carried at amortized cost plus intrinsic value,  if     
any,  of  the call options as of the valuation date.  Changes in  intrinsic     
value  of  the  call  options  are recorded as an  adjustment  to  interest     
credited to policyholders.                                                      

Fee Income                                                                      

Fees  from  investment advisory services are recognized  as  revenues  when     
services  are  provided.  Revenues from fixed and  variable  annuities  and     
single  premium  whole life policies include mortality  charges,  surrender     
charges, policy fees, and contract fees and are recognized when earned.         

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs                                               

Policy acquisition costs are the costs of acquiring new business which vary     
with,  and are primarily related to, the production of new business.   Such     
costs  include  commissions, costs of policy issuance,   underwriting,  and     
selling  expenses.  These costs are deferred and amortized in  relation  to     
the  present  value  of estimated gross profits from mortality,  investment     
spread,  and  expense  margins.   Deferred  policy  acquisition  costs  are     
adjusted  for  amounts relating to unrealized gains  and  losses  on  fixed     
maturity securities the Company has designated as available for sale.  This     
adjustment,  net  of  tax, is included with the change  in  net  unrealized     
investment  gains  or  losses  that  is credited  or  charged  directly  to     
stockholder's  equity.   Deferred  policy  acquisition  costs   have   been     
decreased  by $126.9 million at December 31, 1997 and decreased  by  $103.7     
million at December 31, 1996, relating to this adjustment.

Value of Insurance in Force                                                     

Value  of insurance in force represents the actuarially-determined  present     
value of projected future gross profits from policies in force at the  date     
of  their  acquisition.   This amount is amortized  in  proportion  to  the     
projected  emergence  of profits over periods not exceeding  15  years  for     
annuities  and  25 years for life insurance.  Interest is  accrued  on  the     
unamortized balance at the contract rate of 5.34%, 5.30% and 5.58% for  the     
years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.                     

The  value  of insurance in force is adjusted for amounts relating  to  the     
recognition  of  unrealized investment gains and losses.  This  adjustment,     
net  of tax, is included with the change in net unrealized investment gains     
or  losses  that  is credited or charged directly to stockholder's  equity.     
Value of insurance in force has decreased by $31.8 million at December  31,
1997  and decreased by $26.0 million at December 31, 1996, relating to this     
adjustment.                                                                     

Estimated net amortization expense of the value of insurance in force as of     
December  31,  1997 is as follows (in thousands): 1998  -  $8,701;  1999  -     
$10,890; 2000 - $9,926; 2001 - $8,711; 2002 - $7,694;      and thereafter -     
$39,220.                                                                        

Intangible Assets                                                               

Intangible  assets  consist of goodwill arising from business  combinations     
accounted  for  as a purchase.  Amortization is provided on a straight-line     
basis over twenty-five years.                                                   

Separate Account Assets and Liabilities                                         

The  assets  and liabilities resulting from variable annuity  and  variable     
life policies are segregated in separate accounts. Separate account assets,     
which  are  carried  at fair value, consist principally of  investments  in     
mutual  funds. Investment income and changes in asset values are  allocated     
to the policyholders, and therefore, do not affect the operating results of     
the  Company.  The Company provides administrative services and  bears  the     
mortality  risk  related to these contracts. As of December  31,  1997  and     
1996, Keyport also classified as separate account assets $65.2 million  and     
$73.8  million, respectively, investments in certain mutual funds sponsored     
by affiliates of the Company and other investments.

Policy Liabilities                                                              

Policy  liabilities  consist of deposits received plus  credited  interest,     
less accumulated policyholder charges, assessments, and withdrawals related     
to  deferred  annuities  and  single premium whole  life  policies.  Policy     
benefits that are charged to expense include benefit claims incurred in the     
period in excess of related policy account balances.                            

Income Taxes                                                                    

Income  taxes  have been provided using the liability method in  accordance     
with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," and are calculated as  if     
the companies filed their own income tax returns.                               

Effective  July 18, 1997, due to changes in ownership of Liberty Financial,     
the  Company is no longer included in the consolidated federal  income  tax     
return  of  Liberty  Mutual.   The Company  will  be  eligible  to  file  a     
consolidated  federal  income tax return with Liberty  Financial  in  2002.     
Independence  Life, which until July 18, 1997, was required  under  federal     
tax law to file its own federal income tax return, may join with Keyport in     
a  consolidated  income  tax  return  filing.   Liberty  Advisory  Services     
Corporation and Keyport Financial Services Corp. must file separate federal     
tax returns.                                                                    

Cash Equivalents                                                                

Short-term investments having an original maturity of three months or  less     
are classified as cash equivalents.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements                                                

In  January  1998,  the  FASB voted to proceed  with  the  drafting  of  an     
accounting standard titled "Accounting for Derivative Instruments  and  for     
Hedging Activities."  This accounting standard requires companies to report     
derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in  fair  value     
recorded  in  income or equity.  The accounting standard also  changes  the     
accounting  for  derivatives  used in hedging strategies  from  traditional     
deferral accounting to a current recognition approach which could impact  a     
company's income statement and balance sheet and expand the definition of a     
derivative  instrument.   The  Company is evaluating  the  impact  of  this     
accounting  standard.  This accounting standard will  become  effective  in     
2000.                                                                           

In  June  1996, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards     
No.  125,  "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets  and     
Extinguishment  of  Liabilities" ("SFAS 125"). The relevant  provisions  of     
SFAS  125  relating to securities lending, dollar rolls, and other  similar     
secured transactions become effective in 1998. It is not expected that  the     
adoption  of  SFAS  125  will  have  a material  effect  on  the  Company's     
consolidated financial position or results of operations.                       

2.  Acquisitions                                                                

On August 9, 1996, Keyport entered into a 100 percent coinsurance agreement     
for  a $954.0 million block of single premium deferred annuities issued  by     
Fidelity  &  Guaranty  Life  Insurance Company  ("F&G  Life").  Under  this     
transaction, the investment risk of the annuity policies was transferred to     
Keyport.   However, F&G Life will continue to administer the  policies  and     
will  remain  contractually  liable  for  the  performance  of  all  policy     
obligations. This transaction increased investments by $923.1  million  and     
value of insurance in force by $30.9 million.

As  of December 31, 1997 and 1996, the Company did not hold any investments     
in  fixed  maturities that were classified as held to maturity  or  trading     
securities.   The  amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and  losses,  and     
fair value of fixed maturity securities are as follows (in thousands):

Deferred tax liabilities for the Company's unrealized investment gains  and     
losses,  net of adjustments to deferred policy acquisition costs and  value     
of  insurance inforce were $44.3 million and $39.5 million at December  31,
1997 and 1996, respectively.                                                    

No  investment in any person or its affiliates (other than bonds issued  by

stockholder's equity at December 31, 1997.                                      

At  December 31, 1997, the Company did not have a material concentration of     
financial   instruments  in  a  single  investee,  industry  or  geographic     
location.

The  interest  rate swap agreements expire in 1998 to 2001.   The  interest     
rate  cap  agreements  expire  in 1999 through  2000.   The  call  options'     
maturities range from 1998 to 2002.                                             

The Company currently utilizes swap agreements to reduce asset duration and     
to better match interest rates earned on longer-term fixed rate assets with     
interest  credited  to policyholders.  Cap agreements  are  used  to  hedge     
against  rising  interest rates.  Call options are  used  for  purposes  of     
hedging the Company's equity-indexed products.  The call options hedge  the     
interest credited on these 1, 5 and 7 year term products, which is based on     
the  changes  in  the S&P 500 Index.  At December 31, 1997  and  1996,  the     
Company  had  approximately $155.0 million and $73.1 million, respectively,     
of unamortized premium in call option contracts.

Fair  values  for  swap and cap agreements are based on current  settlement     
values.   The  current settlement values are based on quoted market  prices     
and  brokerage  quotes,  which utilize pricing  models  or  formulas  using     
current assumptions.  Fair values for call options are based quoted  market     
prices.                                                                         

Deferred  losses of $5.1 million and $7.9 million as of December  31,  1997     
and  1996,  respectively,  resulting from  terminated  interest  rate  swap     
agreements are included with the related fixed maturity securities to which     
the hedge applied and are being amortized over the life of such securities.     

There are risks associated with some of the techniques the Company uses  to     
match  its assets and liabilities.  The primary risk associated with  swap,     
cap  and  call  option agreements is the risk associated with  counterparty     
nonperformance.  The Company believes that the counterparties to its  swap,     
cap  and  call option agreements are financially responsible and  that  the     
counterparty risk associated with these transactions is minimal.

As  of  December  31, 1997, the Company had approximately $6.0  million  of     
purchased net operating loss carryforwards (relating to the acquisition  of     
Independence  Life). Utilization of these net operating loss carryforwards,     
which  expire  through 2006, is limited to use against  future  profits  of     
Independence  Life.  The Company believes that it is more likely  than  not     
that it will realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets.                    

Income taxes refunded were $8.0 million in 1997 and income taxes paid  were     
$46.9 million and $44.7 million in 1996 and 1995, respectively.

Keyport  employees and certain employees of Liberty Financial are  eligible     
to  participate in the Liberty Financial Companies, Inc. Pension Plan  (the     
"Plan").   It  is  the  Company's practice to fund  amounts  for  the  Plan     
sufficient  to  meet  the minimum requirements of the  Employee  Retirement     
Income Security Act of 1974.  Additional amounts are contributed from  time     
to  time  when  deemed  appropriate by the Company.  Under  the  Plan,  all     
employees  are vested after five years of service.  Benefits are  based  on     
years  of  service,  the  employee's  average  pay  for  the  highest  five     
consecutive  years  during  the  last ten  years  of  employment,  and  the     
employee's  estimated  social  security  retirement  benefit.  Plan  assets     
consist principally of investments in certain mutual funds sponsored by  an     
affiliated company.

7.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments                                         

The following discussion outlines the methodologies and assumptions used to     
determine  the  fair  value  of the Company's financial  instruments.   The     
aggregate  fair value amounts presented herein do not necessarily represent     
the  underlying  value  of  the Company, and accordingly,  care  should  be     
exercised in deriving conclusions about the Company's business or financial     
condition based on the fair value information presented herein.                 

The  following  methods  and  assumptions  were  used  by  the  Company  in     
determining fair values of financial instruments:                               

Fixed  maturities  and  equity  securities:   Fair  values  for  fixed          
maturity   securities  are  based  on  quoted  market  prices,   where          
available.  For fixed maturities not actively traded, the fair  values          
are determined using values from independent pricing services, or,  in          
the case of private placements, are determined by discounting expected          
future cash flows using a current market rate applicable to the yield,          
credit  quality, and maturity of the securities.  The fair values  for          
equity securities are based on quoted market prices.                            

Mortgage  loans:  The fair value of mortgage loans are  determined  by          
discounting future cash flows to the present at current market  rates,          
using expected prepayment rates.                                                

Policy  loans:   The  carrying value of policy loans approximates  fair         
value.                                                                          

Other  invested  assets:   With the exception  of  call  options,  the          
carrying value for assets classified as other invested assets  in  the          
accompanying  balance  sheets approximates  their  fair  value.   Fair          
values  for  call  options are based on market prices  quoted  by  the          
counterparty to the respective call option contract.                            

Cash  and  cash  equivalents:  The carrying value  of  cash  and  cash          
equivalents approximates fair value.                                            

Policy  liabilities:   Deferred annuity contracts  are  assigned  fair          
value equal to current net surrender value.  Annuitized contracts  are          
valued  based on the present value of the future cash flows at current          
pricing rates.

9.  Statutory Information                                                       

The  Company  is  domiciled  in Rhode Island  and  prepares  its  statutory     
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles and practices     
prescribed  or permitted by the State of Rhode Island Insurance Department.     
Statutory surplus and statutory net income differ from stockholder's equity     
and  net  income reported in accordance with GAAP primarily because  policy     
acquisition costs are expensed when incurred, policy liabilities are  based     
on  different assumptions, and income tax expense reflects only taxes  paid     
or currently payable. The Company's statutory surplus and net income are as     
follows (in thousands):

10.  Transactions with Affiliated Companies                                     

The  Company  reimbursed  Liberty  Financial  and  certain  affiliates  for     
expenses incurred on its behalf for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996     
and   1995.    These  reimbursements  included  corporate,   general,   and     
administrative  expenses, corporate overhead, such as executive  and  legal     
support,  and investment management services.  The total amounts reimbursed     
were  $7.8 million for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996 and  $7.6     
million  for  the  year  ended  December 31, 1995.   In  addition,  certain     
affiliated companies distribute the Company's products and were  paid  $7.2     
million,  $6.4 million and $7.6 million by the Company for the years  ended     
December 31, 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively.                                

Keyport  has  mortgage  notes in the original principal  amount  of  $100.0     
million  on  properties owned by certain indirect subsidiaries  of  Liberty     
Mutual.  The notes were purchased for their face value. Liberty Mutual  has     
agreed  to  provide credit support to the obligors under these  notes  with     
respect  to  certain  payments of principal and interest  thereon.   As  of     
December 31, 1997 and 1996, the amounts outstanding were $39.5 million.         

Dividend  payments to Liberty Financial from the Company  are  governed  by     
insurance laws which restrict the maximum amount of dividends that  may  be     
paid  without  prior  approval  of  the State  of  Rhode  Island  Insurance     
Department.   As  of  December 31, 1997, the maximum  amount  of  dividends     
(based on statutory surplus and statutory net gains from operations)  which     
may  be  paid  by  Keyport  was approximately $70.3  million  without  such     
approval.

Leases: The Company leases data processing equipment, furniture and certain     
office  facilities from others under operating leases expiring  in  various     
years  through  2008.  Rental expense (in thousands)  amounted  to  $3,408,     
$3,213  and  $3,221 for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996  and  1995,     
respectively. For each of the next five years, and in the aggregate, as  of     
December  31,  1997, the following are the minimum future  rental  payments     
under  noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in  excess  of     
one year (in thousands):

           $    15,028

Legal  Matters:  The  Company is involved at various  times  in  litigation     
common  to its business. In the opinion of management, provisions made  for     
potential losses are adequate and the resolution of  any such litigation is     
not  expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's  financial     
condition or its results of operations.                                         

Regulatory  Matters:  Under existing guaranty  fund  laws  in  all  states,     
insurers  licensed  to  do business in those states  can  be  assessed  for     
certain  obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders  and     
claimants. The actual amount of such assessments will depend upon the final     
outcome of rehabilitation proceedings and will be paid over several  years.     
In  1997,  1996  and  1995, the Company was assessed  $5.9  million,  $10.0     
million,  and $8.1 million, respectively. During 1997, 1996 and  1995,  the     
Company   recorded   $1.0  million,  $1.0  million,   and   $2.0   million,     
respectively, of provisions for state guaranty fund association expense. At     
December  31,  1997  and 1996, the reserve for such  assessments  was  $8.0     
million and $12.9 million, respectively.

Item 1. Business




General



Keyport Life Insurance Company ("Keyport") is a specialty insurance company
providing a diversified line of fixed, indexed and variable annuity
products designed to serve the growing retirement savings market. The
Company sells its products through multiple distribution channels,
including banks, agents and brokerage firms.  Keyport seeks to (i) maintain
its presence in the fixed annuity market while expanding its sales of
variable and equity-indexed annuities, (ii) achieve a broader market
presence through the use of diversified distribution channels and (iii)
maintain a conservative approach to investment and liability management.


Keyport's  wholly  owned insurance subsidiaries are Independence  Life  and
Annuity  Company ("Independence Life") and Keyport Benefit  Life  Insurance
Company  ("Keyport Benefit").  Other wholly owned subsidiaries are  Liberty
Advisory  Services  Corp.,  an  investment advisory  company,  and  Keyport
Financial Services Corp., a broker-dealer (collectively the "Company").


The Company is licensed to sell insurance in all states, in the District of
Columbia and the Virgin Islands.


The  Company  is  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty  Financial
Companies,  Inc. ("Liberty Financial"), which is a publicly traded  holding
company.  Liberty  Financial is an indirect majority  owned  subsidiary  of
Liberty Mutual Insurance Company ("Liberty Mutual"), a multi-line insurance
company.


Liberty Financial is an asset accumulation and management company providing
investment  management and retirement-oriented insurance  products  through
multiple    distribution   channels.   Keyport   issues   and   underwrites
substantially  all  of  Liberty  Financial's retirement-oriented  insurance
products.  Liberty Financial's primary investment advisor, asset management
and bank distribution operating units are The Colonial Group, ("Colonial"),
Stein Roe & Farnham Incorporated ("Stein Roe"), Newport Pacific Management,
Inc. ("Newport") and Independent Holdings, Inc. ("Independent").  Colonial,
Stein  Roe  and  Newport manage certain underlying mutual funds  and  other
invested  assets of Keyport's separate accounts.  Stein Roe  also  provides
asset  management  services for a substantial portion of Keyport's  general
account.  Independent, through its subsidiary, markets  Keyport's  products
through the bank distribution channel.








Keyport's  executive  and administrative offices are located  at  125  High
Street,  Boston Massachusetts 02110, and its home office is at  695  George
Washington Highway, Lincoln, Rhode Island 02865.









Products



The  Company (primarily Keyport and Keyport Benefit) sells a full range  of
retirement-oriented  insurance products, grouped by  whether  they  provide
fixed,  indexed  or  variable  returns  to  policyholders.  Annuities   are
insurance  products  designed to offer individuals protection  against  the
risk of outliving their financial assets during retirement. Annuities offer
a  tax-deferred  means  of accumulating savings for  retirement  needs  and
provide  a tax-efficient source of income in the payout period. The Company
earns  spread  income from fixed and indexed annuities; variable  annuities
primarily  produce fee income.  The Company's primary financial  objectives
are to increase policyholder balances through new sales and asset retention
and  to  earn acceptable investment spreads on its fixed and indexed return
products.


The Company's principal retirement-oriented insurance products are
categorized as follows:


Fixed  Annuities.  Fixed  annuity products are principally  single  premium
deferred annuities ("SPDAs").  A SPDA policyholder typically makes a single
premium  payment at the time of issuance. The Company obligates  itself  to
credit  interest to the policyholder's account at a rate that is guaranteed
for  an initial term (typically one year) and is reset annually thereafter,
subject  to a guaranteed minimum rate.  Interest crediting continues  until
the   policy  is  surrendered,  upon  policyholder  death,  or   when   the
policyholder turns age 90.


Equity-Indexed  Annuities.  Equity-indexed  annuities  are  an   innovative
product first introduced to the marketplace in 1995 by the Company when  it
began selling its KeyIndex product.  The Company's equity-indexed annuities
credit  interest to the policyholder at a "participation rate" equal  to  a
portion  (ranging for existing policies from 25% to 95%) of the  change  in
value of a specified equity index.  KeyIndex is currently offered for  one,
five  and seven-year terms with interest earnings based on a percentage  of
the increase in the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index ("S&P
500  Index")  ("S&P", "S&P 500", and "Standard & Poor's" are trademarks  of
The  McGraw  Hill Companies, Inc. and have been licensed  for  use  by  the
Company).   With the five and seven-year terms, the interest  earnings  are
based  on  the highest policy anniversary date value of the S&P  500  Index
during  the term.  KeyIndex also provides a guarantee of principal  at  the
end  of the term.  Thus, unlike a direct equity investment, even if the S&P
500  Index  declines,  there  is  no  market  risk  to  the  policyholder's
principal.   In  late 1996, the Company introduced a market value  adjusted
("MVA")  annuity product, KeySelect, which offers a choice between a  fixed
and  equity-indexed  account similar to KeyIndex and a fixed  annuity  type
interest account. KeySelect offers terms for each equity-indexed account of
one,  three, five, six and seven years, as well as a ten-year term for  the
fixed  interest  account.  KeySelect shifts some  investment  risk  to  the
policyholder, since surrender of the policy before the end of  the  product
term  will  result in increased or decreased account values  based  on  the
change  in rates of designated U.S. Treasury securities since the beginning
of  the  term.  The Company is continuing to develop new  versions  of  the
equity-indexed   annuities,  including  versions   registered   under   the
Securities  Act of 1933 ("Securities Act"), which are designed to  be  sold
through major national brokerage firms.


Variable  Annuities.  Variable annuities offer a  selection  of  underlying
investment   alternatives  that  may  satisfy  a  variety  of  policyholder
risk/return objectives.  Under a variable annuity, the policyholder has the
opportunity  to  select separate account investment options (consisting  of
underlying  mutual funds) which pass the investment risk  directly  to  the
policyholder  in  return  for  the potential of  higher  returns.  Variable
annuities also include guaranteed fixed interest options.  The Company  has
several different variable annuity products that currently offer 18  to  21
separate  account  investment choices, depending on the product,  and  four
guaranteed fixed interest options.


While  the  Company  currently does not offer  traditional  life  insurance
products,  it manages a closed block of single premium whole life insurance
policies  ("SPWLs"),  a retirement-oriented tax-advantaged  life  insurance
product. The Company discontinued sales of SPWLs in response to certain tax
law  changes  in the 1980s.  The Company had SPWL policyholder balances  of
$2.0 billion as of December 31, 1998.


Under  the  Internal Revenue Code, returns credited on annuities  and  life
insurance policies during the accumulation period (the period during  which
interest or other returns are credited) are not subject to federal or state
income  tax.   Proceeds payable on death from a life insurance  policy  are
also  free from such taxes.  At the maturity or payment date of an  annuity
policy,  the policyholder is entitled to receive the original deposit  plus
accumulated  returns. The policyholder may elect to  take  this  amount  in
either  a  lump  sum or an annuitized series of payments  over  time.   The
return  component  of  such payments is taxed at the  time  of  receipt  as
ordinary  income at the recipient's then applicable tax rate.   The  demand
for the Company's retirement-oriented insurance products could be adversely
affected by changes in this tax law.


The  following table sets forth certain information regarding the Company's
retirement-oriented insurance business for the periods indicated.

Sales and Asset Retention

Product  sales  are  influenced  primarily  by  overall  market  conditions
impacting the attractiveness of the Company's retirement-oriented insurance
products,  and  by  product  features,  including  interest  crediting  and
participation  rates,  and innovations and services  that  distinguish  the
Company's products from those of its competitors.


The  Company's mix of annuity products is designed to include  products  in
demand  under a variety of economic and market conditions.  Sales of  SPDAs
tend  to  be sensitive to prevailing interest rates.  Sales can be expected
to  increase and surrenders to decrease in interest rate environments  when
SPDA  rates  are higher than rates offered by competing conservative  fixed
return investments, such as bank certificates of deposit. SPDA sales can be
expected   to   decline  and  surrenders  to  increase  in  interest   rate
environments  when this differential in rates is not present (as  has  been
the case during 1998 and at the date of filing of this report).  SPDA sales
also  can be adversely affected by low interest rates (as has been the case
during 1998 and at the date of filing of this report). The Company believes
that the lack of significant growth in the sale of the Company's SPDAs  has
resulted  primarily  from  this  type of  low  interest  rate  environment.
Conversely,  sales of variable annuities can be expected  to  increase  and
surrenders  of  such  products to decrease in a rising equity  market,  low
interest rate environment.  Similarly sales of equity-indexed annuities can
be  expected  to  increase and surrenders to decrease in  a  rising  equity
market,  low interest rate environment.  While economic conditions  may  be
generally  favorable, high market volatility (as has been the  case  during
1998 and at the date of filing of this report) will result in a higher cost
of  options  associated with equity-indexed annuities.  The result  of  the
higher  option costs is a reduction in participation rates, which  occurred
throughout the year.


The  Company's  insurance products include important features  designed  to
promote  both  sales  and asset retention, including  crediting  rates  and
surrender charges.  Initial interest crediting and participation  rates  on
fixed  and equity-indexed products significantly influence the sale of  new
policies.   Resetting of rates on SPDAs impacts retention of  SPDA  assets,
particularly  on  policies  where  surrender  penalties  have  expired.  At
December  31, 1998, crediting rates on 97% of the Company's in  force  SPDA
policy  liabilities were subject to reset during the succeeding 12  months.
In  setting  crediting  and participation rates,  the  Company  takes  into
account  yield characteristics on its investment portfolio, surrender  rate
assumptions and competitive industry pricing.  Interest crediting rates  on
the  Company's  in force SPDAs ranged from 3.50% to 7.75% at  December  31,
1998.   Such  policies had guaranteed minimum rates ranging  from  3.0%  to
6.35%  as  of such date.  Initial interest crediting rates on new  policies
issued in 1998 ranged from 4.30% to 7.20%.  Guaranteed minimum rates on new
policies issued during 1998 ranged from 3.0% to 4.5%.


Substantially  all  of the Company's annuities permit the  policyholder  at
anytime  to withdraw all or part of the accumulated policy value. Premature
termination  of  an annuity policy results in the loss by  the  Company  of
anticipated  future  earnings  related  to  the  premium  deposit  and  the
accelerated  recognition  of  the expenses related  to  policy  acquisition
(principally commissions), which otherwise are deferred and amortized  over
the  expected life of the policy.  Surrender charges provide a  measure  of
protection against premature withdrawal of policy values. Substantially all
of  the  Company's insurance products currently are issued  with  surrender
charges  or  similar penalties.  Such surrender charges for  all  policies,
except  KeyIndex,  typically start at 7% of the  policy  premium  and  then
decline  to  zero  over  a five to seven year period.  KeyIndex  imposes  a
penalty  on surrender of up to 10% of the premium deposit for the  life  of
the  policy.  At  December  31, 1998, 81% of the  Company's  fixed  annuity
policyholder  balances were subject to surrender charges  or  restrictions.
Surrender charges generally do not apply to withdrawals by policyowners of,
depending  on the policy, either up to 10% per year of the then accumulated
value or the accumulated returns. In addition, certain policies may provide
for  charge-free withdrawals in certain circumstances and at certain times.
All  policies, except for certain variable annuities, are also  subject  to
"free  look" risk (the legal right of a policyholder to cancel  the  policy
and  receive  back  the  premium deposit, without interest,  for  a  period
ranging  from  ten  days to one year, depending upon the  policy).  To  the
extent  a  policyholder exercises the "free look" option, the  Company  may
realize  a  loss  as  a result of any investment losses on  the  underlying
assets during the free look period, as well as the commissions paid on  the
sale  of the policy. While SPWLs also permit withdrawal, it generally would
produce significant adverse tax consequences to the policyholder.


Keyport's  strong  financial  ratings  are  important  to  its  ability  to
accumulate  and  retain assets. Keyport is rated "A"  (Excellent)  by  A.M.
Best,  "AA" (very strong financial security) by Standard & Poor's  ("S&P"),
"A2"  (good) by Moody's and "AA-" (very high claims-paying ability) by Duff
&  Phelps.  Rating agencies periodically review the ratings they issue. S&P
raised  Keyport's  rating from "AA-" to "AA" in March 1998  and  reaffirmed
that  rating in January 1999.  In September 1998, Moody's reduced Keyport's
rating  from  "A1"  to "A2".  In January 1999, A.M. Best reduced  Keyport's
rating  from "A+" to "A". These ratings reflect the opinion of  the  rating
agency  as  to  the  relative financial strength of Keyport  and  Keyport's
ability  to  meet  its  contractual obligations to its policyholders.  Such
ratings  are  not "market" ratings or recommendations to use or  invest  in
Keyport  and should not be relied upon when making a decision to invest  in
the  Company.  Many financial institutions and broker-dealers focus on  the
claims-paying  ability of an insurer in determining whether to  market  the
insurer's  annuities.   If any of Keyport's ratings  were  downgraded  from
their  current  levels or if the ratings of Keyport's competitors  improved
and Keyport's did not, sales of Keyport's products, the level of surrenders
on  existing  policies  and the Company's relationships  with  distributors
could  be  materially adversely affected.  No assurances can be given  that
Keyport will be able to maintain its financial ratings.  The Company's  S&P
rating  was  placed  under  credit watch with negative  implications  as  a
consequence of an acquisition announced by Liberty Mutual in January 1999.


Customer  service  is essential to asset accumulation  and  retention.  The
Company  believes  it  has  a  reputation  for  excellent  service  to  its
distributors  and  its  policyholders. The Company has  developed  advanced
technology systems for immediate response to customer inquiries, and  rapid
processing of policy issuance and commission payments (often at  the  point
of  sale). These systems also play an important role in controlling  costs.
The Company's operating expense ratio for 1998 and 1997 was 0.42% and 0.40%
of assets, respectively, which reflects the Company's low cost operations.



General Account Investments



Premium deposits on fixed and equity-indexed annuities are credited to  the
Company's  general account investments (which at December 31, 1998  totaled
$13.3  billion).   General  account  investments  include  cash  and   cash
equivalents.  To maintain its investment spread at acceptable  levels,  the
Company must earn returns on its general account sufficiently in excess  of
the fixed or indexed returns credited to policyholders.  The key element of
this   investment   process  is  asset/liability  management.    Successful
asset/liability  management  requires both  a  quantitative  assessment  of
overall  policy liabilities (including maturities, surrenders and crediting
of  interest)  and prudent investment of general account assets.   The  two
most  important tools in managing policy liabilities are setting  crediting
rates  and establishing surrender periods.  The investment process requires
portfolio techniques that earn acceptable yields while effectively managing
both  interest  rate  risk  and  credit  risk.  The  Company  emphasizes  a
conservative  approach  to asset/liability management,  which  is  oriented
toward  reducing downside risk in adverse markets, as opposed to maximizing
spread  in  favorable  markets.  The approach is also  designed  to  reduce
earnings  volatility.  Various factors can impact the Company's  investment
spread, including changes in interest rates and other factors affecting the
Company's general account investments.


The bulk of the Company's general account investments are invested in fixed
maturity  securities (84.7% at December 31, 1998).  The Company's principal
strategy  for managing interest rate risk is to closely match the  duration
of  its  general account investment portfolio to its policyholder balances.
The  Company also employs hedging strategies to manage this risk, including
interest rate swaps and caps.  In the case of equity-indexed products,  the
Company  purchases  S&P 500 Index call options and  futures  to  hedge  its
obligations to provide participation rate returns.  Credit risk is  managed
by careful credit analysis and monitoring. A portion of the general account
investments  (8.1%  at December 31, 1998) is invested in  below  investment
grade  fixed maturity securities to enhance overall portfolio yield.  Below
investment  grade  securities  pose greater  risks  than  investment  grade
securities.   The  Company  actively manages  its  below  investment  grade
portfolio  to optimize its risk/return profile. At December 31,  1998,  the
carrying value of fixed maturity investments that were non-income producing
was $30.0 million, which constituted 0.2% of investments.


As  of  December 31, 1998, the Company owned approximately $3.3 billion  of
mortgage-backed  securities  (24.8% of its  general  account  investments),
97.3%  of  which  were  investment grade.  Mortgage-backed  securities  are
subject to significant prepayment and extension risks, since the underlying
mortgages may be repaid more or less rapidly than scheduled.


As of December 31, 1998, approximately $3.6 billion (26.7% of the Company's
general  account investments) were invested in securities  that  were  sold
without  registration under the Securities Act and were not freely tradable
under   the  Securities  Act  or  which  were  otherwise  illiquid.   These
securities  may be resold pursuant to an exemption from registration  under
the  Securities  Act.   If the Company sought to sell such  securities,  it
might be unable to do so at the then current carrying values and might have
to  dispose  of such securities over extended periods of time at  uncertain
levels.



Marketing and Distribution



Keyport's  sales  strategy  is  to use multiple  distribution  channels  to
achieve broader market presence.  During 1998, the bank channel represented
approximately  42.6% of Keyport's annuity sales, and the brokerage  channel
represented  approximately  13.1%. The sale  of  insurance  and  investment
products through the bank distribution channel is highly regulated.   Sales
through  other  distributors  of  insurance  products,  such  as  financial
planners,   insurance  agents  and  an  institutional  channel  represented
approximately 44.3% of total annuity sales.


The  following  table presents sales information in Keyport's  distribution

Regulation



The Company's business activities are extensively regulated.  The following
briefly  summarizes  the  principal  regulatory  requirements  and  certain
related matters.


Keyport's  retirement-oriented insurance products generally are  issued  as
individual  policies.   The  policy  is  a  contract  between  the  issuing
insurance company and the policyholder.  State law regulates policy  forms,
including  all  principal contract terms.  In most cases, the  policy  form
must  be approved by the insurance department or similar agency of a  state
in order for the policy to be sold in that state.


Keyport  and Independence Life are chartered in Rhode Island and the  State
of  Rhode Island Insurance Department is their primary oversight regulator.
Keyport  Benefit  is chartered in the state of New York and  the  New  York
Department  of  Insurance  is  its primary  oversight  regulator.   Keyport
Benefit  operates  exclusively in New York and Rhode Island.   Keyport  and
Independence  Life also must be licensed by the state insurance  regulators
in  each  other jurisdiction in which they conduct business. They currently
are  licensed  to  conduct business in 49 states (the exception  being  New
York),  and  in  the  District of Columbia and the Virgin  Islands.   State
insurance  laws generally provide regulators with broad powers  related  to
issuing licenses to transact business, regulating marketing and other trade
practices,  operating  guaranty associations,  regulating  certain  premium
rates,  regulating insurance holding company systems, establishing  reserve
requirements,  prescribing  the  form and  content  of  required  financial
statements  and  reports,  performing  financial  and  other  examinations,
determining  the  reasonableness  and adequacy  of  statutory  capital  and
surplus,  regulating the type and amount of investments permitted, limiting
the  amount of dividends that can be paid and the size of transactions that
can  be consummated without first obtaining regulatory approval, and  other
related  matters.   The  regulators  also  make  periodic  examinations  of
individual  companies and review annual and other reports on the  financial
conditions   of   all   companies   operating   within   their   respective
jurisdictions.


Keyport  and  Independence  Life  prepare their  statutory-basis  financial
statements in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or  permitted
by  the Insurance Department of the State of Rhode Island.  Keyport Benefit
prepares  its  statutory-basis  financial  statements  in  accordance  with
accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the New York Department  of
Insurance.   State  laws prescribe certain statutory accounting  practices.
Permitted statutory accounting practices encompass all accounting practices
that  are not proscribed; such practices may differ between the states  and
companies   within  a  state.   The  National  Association   of   Insurance
Commissioners  (the  "NAIC")  currently is  in  the  process  of  codifying
statutory  accounting  practices,  the  result  of  which  is  expected  to
constitute  the  only source of prescribed statutory accounting  practices.
That  project,  which is expected to be completed in 1999,  may  result  in
changes  to  the accounting practices that the Company uses to prepare  its
statutory-basis  financial statements.  The impact of any such  changes  on
the  Company's  statutory-surplus cannot be determined at  this  time.   No
assurance can be given that such changes would not have a material  adverse
effect on the Company.


Risk-Based  Capital  Requirements. In recent  years,  various  states  have
adopted  new  quantitative  standards  promulgated  by  the  NAIC.    These
standards   are   designed  to  reduce  the  risk  of   insurance   company
insolvencies, in part by providing an early warning of financial  or  other
difficulties.   These  standards  include  the  NAIC's  risk-based  capital
("RBC")  requirements.   RBC  requirements  attempt  to  measure  statutory
capital and surplus needs based on the risks in a company's mix of products
and  investment  portfolio.  The requirements provide  for  four  different
levels  of  regulatory  attention  which  implement  increasing  levels  of
regulatory control (ranging from development of an action plan to mandatory
receivership).   As  of December 31, 1998, Keyport's  capital  and  surplus
exceeded  the level at which the least severe of these regulatory attention
levels would be triggered.


Guaranty Fund Assessments.  Under the insurance guaranty fund laws existing
in  each  state,  insurers  can  be assessed  for  certain  obligations  of
insolvent  insurance  companies to policyholders  and  claimants.   Because
assessments  typically  are not made for several  years  after  an  insurer
fails, Keyport cannot accurately determine the precise amount or timing  of
its  exposure  to known insurance company insolvencies at this  time.   For
certain information regarding the Company's historical and estimated future
assessments,   see   Note  11  to  the  Company's  Consolidated   Financial
Statements.   The  insolvency of large life insurance companies  in  future
years  could  result in material assessments to Keyport by  state  guaranty
funds.   No assurance can be given that such assessments would not  have  a
material adverse effect on the Company.


Insurance  Holding Company Regulation. Current Rhode Island  insurance  law
permits  the  payment  of dividends or distributions from  the  Company  to
Liberty  Financial,  which, together with dividends and distributions  paid
during  the  preceding 12 months, do not exceed the lesser of  (i)  10%  of
statutory surplus as of the preceding December 31 or (ii) the net gain from
operations for the preceding fiscal year. Any proposed dividend  in  excess
of  this  amount is called an "extraordinary dividend" and may not be  paid
until it is approved by the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Rhode
Island.   The  Company had not paid any dividends since its acquisition  in
1988.  In  1998,  the  Company paid $20.0 million in dividends  to  Liberty
Financial. As of December 31, 1998, the amount of additional dividends that
the Company could pay without such approval was $59.1 million.


General Regulation at Federal Level and Certain Related Matters.
Although  the  federal government generally does not directly regulate  the
insurance  business,  federal  initiatives often  have  an  impact  on  the
business  in a variety of ways. Current and proposed federal measures  that
may  significantly  affect the insurance business  include  limitations  on
antitrust  immunity,  minimum  solvency requirements  and  the  removal  of
barriers  restricting  banks from engaging in the  insurance  business.  In
particular, several proposals to repeal or modify the Bank Holding  Company
Act  of  1956  (which prohibits banks from being affiliated with  insurance
companies)  have  been  made  by  members  of  Congress  and  the   Clinton
Administration. Moreover, the United States Supreme Court held in  1995  in
NationsBank  of  North Carolina v. Variable Annuity Life Insurance  Company
that annuities are not insurance for purposes of the National Bank Act.  In
addition,  the  Supreme Court also held in 1995 in Barnett Bank  of  Marion
City  v.  Nelson  that state laws prohibiting national banks  from  selling
insurance in small town locations are preempted by federal law. The  Office
of  the Comptroller of the Currency adopted a ruling in November 1996  that
permits  national banks, under certain circumstances, to expand into  other
financial  services,  thereby increasing competition for  the  Company.  At
present, the extent to which banks can sell insurance and annuities without
regulation  by  state insurance departments is being litigated  in  various
courts   in  the  United  States.  Although  the  effect  of  these  recent
developments on the Company and its competitors is uncertain, there can  be
no  assurance  that  such developments would not have  a  material  adverse
effect on the Company.



Competition



The  Company's  business activities are conducted in extremely  competitive
markets.  Keyport competes with a large number of life insurance companies,
some  of  which  are  larger and more highly capitalized  and  have  higher
ratings  than Keyport. No one company dominates the industry. In  addition,
Keyport's  products compete with alternative investment vehicles  available
through  financial  institutions, brokerage firms and investment  managers.
Management  believes  that  Keyport competes principally  with  respect  to
product  features, pricing, ratings and service; management  also  believes
that  Keyport  can  continue  to compete successfully  in  this  market  by
offering  innovative products and superior services. In addition, financial
institutions  and  broker-dealers  focus  on  the  insurer's  ratings   for
financial  strength  or  claims-paying ability in  determining  whether  to
market the insurer's annuities.



Employees



As  of  December  31, 1998, the Company had 408 full-time  employees.   The
Company  provides  its  employees with a broad range  of  employee  benefit
programs.   The Company believes that its relations with its employees  are
excellent.

	SUMMARY OF CERTIFICATE FEATURES



	This summary and the detailed information in this prospectus describe participating interests in group and individual deferred annuity contracts and the Certificates issued thereunder. We offer the Certificates to assist you in your retirement
	planning.



	The Certificate


	The Certificate is designed to provide retirement benefits for eligible individuals. Eligible individuals include persons participating in certain trusts or plans and may include employees of an employer. Certain states, however, do not permit us
	to issue Certificates and require us to issue Individual Contracts instead.


	We issue Allocated and Non-Allocated Certificates under group contracts. With Allocated Certificates, each individual's interest is separately accounted for and is held in a specific account established for that individual. We will issue an Allocated
	Certificate to each participant in a Non-Qualified plan and in certain Qualified Plans which will verify participation in a group contract. In such cases, the participant will have a 100% vested interest in all values credited to the individual
	participant's account.


	With Non-Allocated Certificates, however, a participant's interest may be vested in the plan in which they are participating rather than in a Certificate. We will only issue Non-Allocated Certificates in connection with certain Qualified Plans. In
	such cases, the Certificate will usually be owned by the trustee(s) of the plan, and a single account will be established and held on behalf of all participants in the plan on a non-allocated basis.



	Single Premium



	We require a Single Premium of at least $5,000 per Account to accompany the application or the Enrollment Form for an Allocated Certificate. A Single Premium of $500,000 or more requires our approval. The Single Premium does not need to accompany the
	Enrollment form under a group contract. The Single Premium is the only premium payment that we permit or require, but you may purchase more than one Certificate. (See "Enrollment Form and Premium Payments," page 11).


	You may allocate the Single Premium to one of two types of accounts, the Interest Account or the Indexed Account, of varying durations or Terms. Certain states, however, do not permit Indexed Accounts to be available for Certificates issued in those
	states.



	Investments by Keyport


	The Single Premium that is credited to your Account becomes part of our assets. We own our General Account and Separate Account assets and generally invest these amounts in U.S. government securities and certain commercial debt securities having
	maturities that usually match the Terms. We may also invest our assets in various instruments, including equity options, futures, forwards, and other instruments based on the Index to hedge our obligations with respect to Indexed Accounts. We may also buy
	and sell interest rate swaps and caps, Treasury bond futures, and similar instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates. (See "Investments by Keyport," page 20).



	Interest Earned on Accounts


	Interest Accounts earn interest at a fixed rate that we set and guarantee at the beginning of the Term for the duration of the Term. We credit such Guaranteed Interest Rates to Interest Accounts on an annual, compounded basis for the entire
	duration of the selected Term. This means that we add interest to the amount invested, so that credited interest may earn interest. (See "Interest Accounts," page 11.)


	Interest credited to Indexed Accounts, or Index Increase, is calculated by reference to fixed interest rate factors, which are applied to changes in the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index using a formula set forth in the
	Certificate. We set and guarantee Guaranteed Interest Rate Factors at the beginning of a Term for the duration of the Term. If the publication of the Index is discontinued or there is a substantial change in the calculation of the Index, we will
	substitute a suitable index. Index Increases are based on a percentage of the percentage increase in the Index since the beginning of the Term. Index Increases are calculated using the Guaranteed Interest Rate Factors set at the beginning of the Term and
	credited proportionately over the selected Term on each Account Anniversary.


	Index Increases are subject to a maximum and minimum limit, both of which we set and guarantee at the beginning of the Term. The minimum may not be less than zero. Thus, the Indexed Account Value will not decrease to reflect declines in the Index
	value since the beginning of the Term or from Account Anniversary to Account Anniversary. (See "Indexed Accounts," page 12). The amount of Index Increases earned on an Indexed Account may be more or less than the amount of interest earned on an Interest
	Account of the same Term and established at the same time. It is possible that an Indexed Account will not earn Index Increases on Account Anniversaries if the Index value on any of the Account Anniversaries in the Term does not exceed its value at the
	beginning of the Term. (See "Establishment of Guaranteed Interest Rates and Guaranteed Interest Rate Factors," page 13).


	In certain circumstances, the Certificate permits a minimum value to be used, instead of the Indexed Account Value, to calculate benefits under a Certificate. This value, or the Certificate Value, is equal to:






	o





	90% of the Single Premium;







	o





	plus any Excess Interest Credits;







	o





	less any amounts you have withdrawn in a partial surrender, such amounts being reduced by any surrender charge;







	o





	plus, if the Account Value has ever been transferred, a positive or negative amount reflecting the effect of any Market Value Adjustment on the Account Value at the time of the transfer;







	o





	plus interest credited on the foregoing at an annual guaranteed rate of 3% per year.






	The amount used to calculate death benefits, withdrawal amounts, and annuity values will not be less than the Certificate Value, subject to any Market Value Adjustment on the corresponding Account Value. If the Indexed Account
	Value is less than the Certificate Value at the end of a Term, we will credit interest to the Indexed Account so that its value will equal the Certificate Value. (See "Certificate Value," page 14; "Indexed Accounts," page 12).



	Terms


	and Renewal of Terms


	We currently offer initial Terms of one, three, five, six, seven, and ten (Interest Account only) years. From time to time we may discontinue offering terms of certain durations or offer Terms of other durations. The interest rates and interest
	rate factors we declare may vary depending on the duration of the Term. You should contact us to determine the Terms we currently offer. You may transfer from one type of account to the other and/or to Terms of different durations, subject to contractual
	provisions and any surrender charge and Market Value Adjustment.


	At the end of each Term, a new Term of one year will begin, unless you instruct us otherwise within 30 days before the end of the Term. At that time, you may choose another Term from among the Terms we then offer or transfer the Account Value to the
	other type of account. (See "Renewal Terms," page 13).



	Determinations of Guaranteed Interest Rates and Guaranteed Interest Rate Factors


	We consider a variety of factors in setting Guaranteed Interest Rates and Guaranteed Interest Rate Factors for any Term. These factors include the interest rates generally available on the types of instruments in which we invest your Single
	Premium, the duration of the Term, regulatory and tax requirements, sales commissions and expenses we bear, general economic trends, and competitive factors.



	Partial and Total Surrenders


	You may obtain a portion or all of your Account Value, by making a partial or total surrender, subject to certain restrictions. Such surrenders may be subject to a surrender charge and/or a Market Value Adjustment. Generally, we deduct a surrender
	charge from any partial or total surrender made before the end of a Term. However, we will not deduct a surrender charge from the following:







	o





	A partial or total surrender within the first 30 calendar days after the end of any Term, if you notify us in writing before the surrender;






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	the Free Withdrawal Amount of the first partial surrender in a particular Certificate Year; however, any partial surrender amount above the Free Withdrawal Amount or any subsequent partial surrender during the same Certificate
	Year will be subject to a surrender charge;






	Â 


	Â 






	o





	the Free Withdrawal Amount of a total surrender, if no partial surrender was made in the same Certificate Year; otherwise, the total amount surrendered is subject to a surrender charge. (See "Surrender Charge," page 16).






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	The withdrawal of interest earnings from an Interest Account pursuant to our systematic withdrawal program. Systematic withdrawals may not be made from an Indexed Account. (See "Systematic Withdrawal Program," page 15).






	The minimum partial surrender generally is $250. The minimum for partial surrenders under our systematic withdrawal program is $100. After a partial surrender, the minimum Account Value must be at least $2,500. We do not
	permit partial surrenders from the Indexed Account of any Certificate issued under a corporate or Keogh Qualified Plan that is established pursuant to Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.


	The surrender charge equals a percentage of the gross amount surrendered in excess of the Free Withdrawal Amount, before the addition or deduction of any Market Value Adjustment. The surrender charge percentage declines depending on the number of
	years (rounded up) remaining until the end of the Term. The maximum surrender charge currently is 7% for surrenders when seven or more years remain in the Term.


	We may defer payment of any partial or total surrender for up to six months from the date we receive your surrender request. Some states permit only a shorter deferral period. A payment deferral for more than 30 days is unlikely to occur except under
	highly unusual circumstances. (See "Payment upon Partial or Total Surrender," page 16).



	Transfers


	You may transfer the Interest Account Value to another account at any time before the Income Date, subject to certain conditions. You may transfer the Indexed Account Value only at the end of a Term. Any amount you transfer before the end of a
	Term may be subject to a Market Value Adjustment. Presently, we do not charge for transfers, but we may institute a transfer charge on transfers in excess of a certain number of transfers annually. (See "Transfer of Values," page 14; "Market Value
	Adjustment," page 16).



	Market Value Adjustment


	The amount payable upon a partial or total surrender from, or upon the application to an Annuity Option of Account Value of, an Account with a Term of three years or more may be adjusted up or down by a Market Value Adjustment. The scaling factor
	is currently 1.0, which means there will be no reduction of any Market Value Adjustment amount. The Market Value Adjustment is an amount that in certain circumstances we add or subtract from your Account Value to reflect the relative difference between:







	o





	the current Treasury Rate for a period of time equivalent to the






	Â 




	remaining duration of the current Term; and







	o





	the Treasury Rate at the beginning of the Term for a period of






	Â 




	time equal to the full duration of the Term.






	It is possible, therefore, that a significant increase in Treasury Rates from the beginning of a Term would cause your total surrender amount to be less than the original amount credited to your Account. (See "Market Value
	Adjustment," page 16).


	A Market Value Adjustment will not apply to a partial or total surrender within the first 30 calendar days after the end of any Term. With respect to another surrender or annuitization, if a partial surrender has not occurred in the same Certificate
	Year, we base the Market Value Adjustment on the gross amount payable that is in excess of the Free Withdrawal Amount, before deducting any surrender charge. Otherwise, we base the Market Value Adjustment on the gross amount payable, before deducting any
	surrender charge. (See "Market Value Adjustment," page 16).


	A Market Value Adjustment also applies to any transfer from an Interest or Indexed Account with a Term of three years or more, unless the effective date of the transfer is:







	o





	within the last year of the Term, and the transfer is to an account with a Term of three years or more; or






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	within the first 10 calendar days after the end of a Term.






	The Market Value Adjustment upon transfer is based on the Account Value or, if a partial surrender has not occurred in the same Certificate Year, on the Account Value in excess of the Free Withdrawal Amount. (See "Market Value
	Adjustment," page 16).


	The Market Value Adjustment for Indexed Accounts includes a scaling factor, which may reduce the positive or negative amount of any such Market Value Adjustment. The scaling factor is currently 1.0, which means there will be no reduction of any Market
	Value Adjustment amount. The Market Value Adjustment for Interest Accounts does not include a scaling factor. (See "Market Value Adjustment," page 16).



	Annuity Period


	On the Income Date, we will start to pay the designated Annuitant a series of annuity payments under an Annuity Option. The Annuity Option you select determines the timing and basis of the annuity payments. (See "Annuity Period Provisions," page 19)
	.



	Death Benefit


	The Certificate provides for a special death benefit if you die before the Income Date, if the Certificate Owner is not a natural person, or the Annuitant dies before the Income Date. The Designated Beneficiary may claim the special death benefit
	by surrendering the Certificate to us for the special death benefit. The special death benefit is the greater of:







	o





	the Certificate Value;






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	the Certificate Withdrawal Value; or






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	the Account Value; but if the Term that includes the date of death relates to an Indexed Account and the Term's Floor is equal to 0%, we may recalculate the Account Value and the new value will be the same or higher.






	If the surrender request is made after the applicable 90 or 60 day period or upon the death of a Joint Certificate Owner, the Designated Beneficiary will receive the Certificate Withdrawal Value. If the Designated Beneficiary
	chooses not to surrender the Certificate, it may stay In Force for up to five years after the date of death. At the end of the five years, we will pay the Designated Beneficiary the Certificate Withdrawal Value, without deducting any surrender charge.
	(See "Death Provisions," page 17; "Surrender Charge," page 16).



	Premium Taxes


	<R>


	We will deduct the amount of any premium taxes levied by any state or governmental entity when the premium tax is actually paid, unless we defer the deduction until the time of surrender or the Income Date. We cannot describe precisely the amount of
	premium tax you may have to pay on any transaction. The amount of any premium tax charged to your Certificate depends, among other things, on the type of Certificate, your state of residence, the Annuitant's state of residence, our status within those
	states, and the insurance tax laws of those states. Currently premium tax rates range from 0% to 3.5%. Appendix C, on page 66 of this prospectus, contains a schedule of premium tax rates.


	</R>



	Annual Reports to Certificate Owners


	At least once each Certificate Year, we will send you a report which will show the Account Value, the Certificate Withdrawal Value, the Market Value Adjustment used to calculate the Certificate Withdrawal Value, and any surrender charge.





	RISK FACTORS



	An inherent risk of the Certificate is that, if you make a partial or total surrender before the end of the applicable Term, application of any surrender charge and/or Market Value Adjustment might reduce the value of your Account. As a result you
	could receive less than your original Single Premium. (See "Surrender Charge", page 16; "Market Value Adjustment", page 17).


	We base the interest and Index Increases earned by an Account on the Guaranteed Interest Rate and Guaranteed Interest Rate Factors that we declare at the beginning of each Term. The initial and subsequent Guaranteed Interest Rates and Guaranteed
	Interest Rate Factors apply to the original principal sum and reinvested earnings. Our management will decide what Guaranteed Interest Rates and Guaranteed Interest Rate Factors to declare. We cannot predict or guarantee future Guaranteed Interest Rates
	and Guaranteed Interest Rate Factors. (See "Establishment of Guaranteed Interest Rates and Guaranteed Interest Rate Factors", page 13).



	CERTIFICATE OWNERSHIP


	The Certificate Owner is the person or entity designated in the application or Enrollment Form for the Certificate. You may exercise all rights under the Certificate. Joint Certificate Owners are permitted, but not contingent Certificate Owners.


	Prior to the Income Date, you and any Joint Certificate Owner may direct us in writing to change the Certificate Owner, Joint Certificate Owner, Beneficiary, Contingent Beneficiary, Contingent Annuitant, or in certain instances, the Annuitant. You may
	change an irrevocably-named person only with the written consent of that person.


	Because a change of Certificate Owner by means of a gift may be a taxable event, you should consult a competent tax adviser about the tax consequences resulting from such a transfer.


	Qualified Certificates may have limitations on the transfer of ownership. You should consult a competent tax adviser about the tax consequences resulting from such a transfer.



	ENROLLMENT FORM AND SINGLE PREMIUM PAYMENTS


	You must submit a Single Premium of at least $5,000 per Certificate with the Enrollment Form for an Allocated Certificate. We must approve a Single Premium payment of $500,000 or more. You may purchase multiple Certificates, but we reserve the
	right to limit the total premiums you may pay on your Certificates. We also may reject any premium payment.


	We credit the Single Premium to your Account, which is established on the date we receive of a properly completed Enrollment Form, along with the required premium payment. We will issue a Certificate and confirm the receipt of the Single Premium in
	writing. If we issue a contract on a non-allocated basis, a single Account is opened for the Contract Owner.


	Your Account starts earning interest the day after it is established. You may choose to allocate the Single Premium to an Interest Account or an Indexed Account. The Indexed Account is not available for Certificates issued in certain states.


	If we determine that an Enrollment Form is incomplete, we will notify you in writing or by telephone to obtain the necessary information. We will return an incomplete Enrollment Form, along with the Single Premium, if you do not complete it within
	three weeks of its receipt.


	We will permit others to act on your behalf in certain instances, including the following two examples. First, we will accept an application for a Certificate that contains a signature signed under a power of attorney, if a copy of the power of
	attorney is also submitted. Second, we will also issue a Certificate to replace an existing life insurance or annuity policy that was issued by us or an affiliated company without requiring a new application from the applicant.


	Certain dealers and other authorized persons, such as employers and Qualified Plan fiduciaries, will inform us of an applicant's answers to the questions in the application by telephone or order ticket and remit the Single Premium to us. If the
	information is complete, we will issue the Certificate, along with a copy of the completed Enrollment Form, to you so that you may verify the accuracy of the information. We may also ask you to confirm the accuracy of the information by signing and
	returning a copy of the Enrollment Form or a Certificate delivery receipt to us. We confirm all purchases with you in writing and our liability extends only to confirmed purchases.



	ACCUMULATION PERIOD


	Initial Term


	You chose whether to allocate the Single Premium to an Interest Account or an Indexed Account and the duration of the initial Term. We offer Terms of one, three, five, six, seven, and ten years. However, the ten-year Term is only available on an
	Interest Account. We may offer other Terms from time to time. The Indexed Account is not available for Certificates issued in certain states.


	A Term begins on the date the Single Premium is allocated or an amount is transferred to an account and ends when the number of years in the Term elected has elapsed. The last day of the Term is the expiration date for the Term. The subsequent Term
	begins on the first day after the expiration date of the previous Term.


	The Single Premium, less any surrenders and premium taxes, earns and is credited interest and/or Index Increases in accordance with the applicable formula for an account. We credit interest to an Interest Account at the Guaranteed Interest Rates that
	are specified at the beginning of the Term for the duration of the Term. We credit Index Increases to Indexed Accounts by reference to Guaranteed Interest Rate Factors that are specified at the beginning of the Term for the duration of the Term.



	Interest Accounts


	Through the Interest Accounts, we offer specified effective and guaranteed annual rates of interest, for a specified period of time, the Term that you select. Guaranteed Interest Rates may differ among different Terms or Terms established at
	different times. A Guaranteed Interest Rate will not be less than 3% per year. Once we declare a Guaranteed Interest Rate at the beginning of a Term, we will not change it during the Term.


	We will credit interest daily at a compounded rate which will be equal to the Guaranteed Interest Rate. If an amount remains in an Interest Account until the end of the applicable Term, its value will be equal to the amount originally allocated or
	transferred to the Interest Account, less all amounts withdrawn, plus all interest credited.


	Appendix A provides an example of how interest is credited to the Interest Account.



	Indexed Accounts


	Through the Indexed Accounts, we offer Index Increases that depend on increases in a specified Index. Index Increases are determined based on a formula using specified Guaranteed Interest Rate Factors (the Participation Rate, Cap, and Floor) that
	are available for the Terms you select. Guaranteed Interest Rate Factors may differ among different Terms or Terms established at different times. Once these Guaranteed Interest Rate Factors are declared at the beginning of a term, they will never be
	changed during the Term.


	Index Increases may be added to an Indexed Account on each Account Anniversary. If an amount remains in an Indexed Account until the end of the applicable Term, its value will be equal to the amount originally allocated or transferred to the Indexed
	Account, less all amounts withdrawn, plus all Index Increases credited.


	We will calculate and credit Index Increases on each Account Anniversary after the start of a Term. The Certificate contains the formula for calculating the Index Increases. We will credit Index Increases to the Indexed Account proportionately over
	the entire Term.


	Therefore, there are two components of the Index Increases calculated on each Account Anniversary. The first part is the proportionate credit for any increase in the Index from its prior highest Account Anniversary value to its new highest value on
	the current Account Anniversary. The second part is the proportionate credit for any increase in the Index occurring on a prior Account Anniversary(ies). The second part of the Index Increase will always be zero on the first Account Anniversary in any Term.







	o





	Part one is calculated as follows: Multiply the Participation Rate by the percentage increase in the Index from its prior highest Account Anniversary value to its current Account Anniversary value divided by its beginning of
	Term value. The result is then multiplied by the ratio of the number of completed Account Years in the Term to the total number of Account Years in the Term. This percentage is then multiplied by the smaller of the Account Value at the beginning of the
	Term and the Account Value (prior to crediting any Index Increases) on any Account Anniversary in the Term.






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	Part two is calculated as follows: Multiply the Participation Rate by the percentage increase in the Index since the beginning of the Term, calculated using the highest value attained by the Index at any Account Anniversary
	during the Term, excluding the current Account Anniversary. Divide the resulting percentage by the number of Account Years in the Term. This percentage is then multiplied by the smaller of the Account Value at the beginning of the Term and the Account
	Value (prior to crediting any Index Increases) on any Account Anniversary in the Term.






	Part one and two amounts, as calculated above, may be reduced if the Cap is applicable and increased if a Floor in excess of zero is applicable. The sum of the two parts equals the total Index Increase. If the Index on each
	Account Anniversary in a Term is less than the Index at the beginning of the Term, there will not be any Index Increases credited during the Term. Index Increases can never be negative because of the Floor of zero.


	The effect of this formula is that, in the absence of any partial or total surrender during a Term, the total Index Increases credited during a Term will equal:







	o





	the Account Value at the beginning of the Term,







	o





	multiplied by the Participation Rate times the percentage increase in the Index since the beginning of the Term (subject to the Floor and Cap), using the highest value attained by the Index on any Account Anniversary in the Term
	.






	Partial surrenders in excess of Index Increases will reduce the amount of subsequent Index Increases, but do not affect Index Increases previously credited.


	Total Index Increases may be more or less than the amount of interest credited to an Interest Account established at the same time for the same Term, depending on the change in the Index over the course of the Term.


	If no or small Index Increases are earned by an Indexed Account, in time, the value of an Indexed Account may be less than the Certificate Value. In such a circumstance, the Certificate Value is used to calculate any benefit payable under the
	Certificate. If at the end of a Term the value of an Indexed Account is less than the Certificate Value, we will credit the Indexed Account with an End of the Term Increase that is equal to the excess of the Certificate Value over the Indexed Account
	Value. (See "Certificate Value," page 14).


	Currently the Index is the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index ("S&P 500"). The S&P 500 is a widely-accepted and broad measure of the performance of the major United States stock markets. The S&P 500 is a market-value
	weighted measure of changes in the prices of the underlying securities and does not reflect any stock dividend income on the underlying securities. "S&P


	Ã¢


	", "S&P 500


	Ã¢


	", and "Standard & Poor's 500" are trademarks of The McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. that we have licensed
	for use. The Contract is not sponsored, endorsed, sold, or promoted by Standard & Poor's, and Standard & Poor's makes no representation regarding the advisability of purchasing the Certificate.


	If publication of the Index discontinues, or calculation of the Index changes substantially, we will substitute a suitable index and notify you of the substitution.


	Appendix A provides the formula we use to calculate Index Increases and illustrative examples of calculations.



	Renewal Terms


	A new Term will automatically begin at the end of each Term, unless you elect to make a total surrender. (See "Surrenders", page 14). Each new Term will be for one year unless, you notify us in writing within 30 days before the end of a Term, of
	your selection of a different Term or transfer the Account Value to a different type of account. You may choose from among the Terms we offer at that time. We may discontinue offering Terms of certain durations currently available or offer Terms of
	different durations from time to time. The available Guaranteed Interest Rates and Guaranteed Interest Rate Factors may vary based on the duration of the Term selected, and may differ from the rates currently available for new Certificates. You may not
	select a Term that is longer than the number of years remaining until the Income Date. If you do, we will allocate the Account Value to a Term of one year. If less than one year remains until the Income Date, we automatically will allocate the Account
	Value to an Interest Account with a Term of one year.


	The Account Value at the beginning of any subsequent Term will be equal to the Account Value at the end of the previous Term. Absent any partial or total surrender or transfer (the effects of which are described below), the Account Value will earn and
	be credited with interest or Index Increases for each year in the subsequent Term using the Guaranteed Interest Rates or Guaranteed Interest Rate Factors established at the beginning of the subsequent Term for the type of Account and Term selected by you
	or established by default (as described above) in the absence of other instructions.



	Information on Renewal Rates


	We will provide you with a toll-free number to call to inquire about rates for Terms offered at the time. We will notify you in writing of the available Terms before the beginning of each subsequent Term.



	Establishment of Guaranteed Interest Rates and Guaranteed Interest Rate Factors


	You will know the Guaranteed Interest Rate or Guaranteed Interest Rate Factors for the chosen Term at the time of the initial purchase. Guaranteed Interest Rates and Guaranteed Interest Rate Factors may differ among the Terms. We may offer
	differing Guaranteed Interest Rates and Guaranteed Interest Rate Factors for initial allocations, transfers during Terms, and renewal Terms.


	We do not have a specific formula for determining future Guaranteed Interest Rates and Guaranteed Interest Rate Factors. The guaranteed rates and factors will reflect interest rates available on the types of investments in which we invest the proceeds
	of the Account. (See "Investments by Keyport," page 20). Our management may also consider various other factors to determine guaranteed rates and factors for a Term, such as the duration of a Term, regulatory and tax requirements, sales commissions and
	administrative expenses we bear, general economic trends, and competitive factors. The Guaranteed Interest Rates we declare, and the rate of interest we credit to the Certificate Value used in the determination of an Indexed Account Value, however, will
	never be less than 3% annually.



	Our management will make the final determination as to Guaranteed Interest Rates and Guaranteed Interest Rate Factors to be declared. We cannot predict or guarantee future Guaranteed Interest Rates and Guaranteed Interest Rate Factors.


	Certificate Value


	The Certificate provides a minimum value, called the Certificate Value, that we use to calculate benefits under a Certificate when the Certificate Value is higher than the value of an Indexed Account calculated as described above.


	The Certificate Value is equal to:







	o





	90% of the Single Premium;






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	plus any Excess Interest Credits;






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	less all amounts you have withdrawn in a partial surrender, including any applicable surrender charges;






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	plus, if a Market Value Adjustment was applied to a transfer, the positive or negative amount equal to the adjusted Certificate Value(which is the Certificate Value adjusted in proportion to the effect of the Market Value
	Adjustment on the Account Value) less the Certificate Value at the time of the transfer;






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	plus interest credited at an annual guaranteed rate of 3% per year.






	In addition, at each Account Anniversary and at the time of a transfer, we will credit additional interest, called an "Excess Interest Credit", to the Certificate Value, to the extent needed to ensure that the total interest
	(including previous Excess Interest Credits) credited to the Certificate Value equals the total interest or Index Increases ever credited to your Account Value. Interest amounts credited to the Certificate Value will earn interest in subsequent
	Certificate Years.


	The Certificate Value is used to calculate benefits if, for example, the Index were to remain level or decline for several years and accordingly, Index Increases were not credited to an Indexed Account. In such a circumstance, while the value of the
	Indexed Account would not decline, the Certificate Value might rise above the value of the Indexed Account, as a result of the 3% annual interest credited to Certificate Value.



	Transfer of Values


	You may transfer the entire Account Value from an Interest or Indexed Account to another Interest or Indexed Account, subject to the following limitations:







	o





	the transfer must be by Written Request or telephone before the Income Date;






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	you may not exceed any limit we may set; currently, we do not limit the number of transfers in a Certificate Year;






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	you may transfer the Indexed Account Value only during the first 10 calendar days after the end of each full Term;






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	you may transfer the Interest Account Value at any time before the Income Date;






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	the amount transferred shall equal the total Account Value, with any Market Value Adjustment; partial transfers are not permitted;






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	no Market Value Adjustment shall apply to a transfer:






	Â 



	Â 





	Â 




	(i)





	from an account with a Term of less than three years,






	Â 




	(ii)





	in the final year of a Term of three or more years to an account with a Term of three or more years, or






	Â 




	(iii)





	within the first 10 calendar days after the end of each full Term; and






	Â 



	Â 



	Â 






	o





	for transfers not made within the first 10 calendar days of a Term, the Term of the new account cannot be less than the remaining number of Account Years (rounded up) in the existing Term; and






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	the Term of the new account cannot be longer than the number of years remaining until the Income Date.






	While currently transfers are free of charge, we reserve the right to charge $25 per transfer if you make more than four transfers in a Certificate Year. We reserve the right, at any time and without prior notice, to
	terminate, modify, or suspend the transfer privileges described above.



	Surrenders


	You may make a full or partial surrender of your Account at any time prior to the Income Date while the Certificate is In Force. Partial surrenders are subject to the following charges and conditions:







	o





	the surrender is at least $250, unless it is made pursuant to our systematic withdrawal plan, in which case the minimum is $100; and






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	the remaining Account Value after the partial surrender is at least $2,500.






	We reserve the right to change the minimum amount of any partial surrender.


	We do not allow partial surrenders from the Indexed Account of any Certificate issued under a corporate or Keogh Qualified Plan under Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code.


	The net amount of a partial or total surrender will include deductions for any surrender charge and Market Value Adjustment. The amount you receive may be greater or less than the amount subtracted from the Account Value as a result of the surrender.
	As described below, certain partial surrenders are not subject to a surrender charge and/or Market Value Adjustment.


	If a request for a partial surrender would create insufficient account value to keep the Certificate In Force, we will treat the request as a request to surrender only the excess amount over $2,500.


	We will, upon request, inform you of the amount payable upon a full or partial surrender. Any total or partial surrender may be subject to tax in addition to certain Certificate charges and adjustments. (See "Tax Considerations," page 24).



	(a) Systematic Withdrawal Program


	To the extent permitted by law, we will make monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual distributions of interest credited to an Interest Account if you have enrolled in the systematic withdrawal program. All interest distributions are made
	directly to you and are taxed like any other withdrawal or distribution of Account Value. (See "Tax Considerations," page 22.) The minimum withdrawal may not be less than $100. You may not take systematic withdrawals from an Indexed Account. Distributions
	under the systematic withdrawal program are not subject to surrender charges or Market Value Adjustments.



	(b) Partial Surrender


	Procedures and Determination of Surrender Value


	At any time before the Income Date, you may, in writing, request a partial surrender. The surrender amount paid to you will be the requested surrender amount increased or decreased by any Market Value Adjustment and decreased by any surrender
	charge. The surrender charge and the Market Value Adjustment are calculated based on the requested surrender amount. The requested surrender amount will be deducted from your Account Value. For example, if you request a surrender amount of $10,000, the
	surrender charge and the Market Value Adjustment were each 5%, and the Free Withdrawal Amount did not apply, the surrender charge and the Market Value Adjustment would each be 5% of $10,000, for a net surrender payment to you of $9,000 ($10,000-$500-$500).


	We may in our discretion allow you to request the net partial surrender amount that you wish to be paid, instead of the surrender amount described in the prior paragraph. If a Market Value Adjustment applies, however, the amount we actually pay may be
	more or less than the amount requested because of computational rounding. The total amount deducted from the Account Value upon a partial surrender will be the surrender amount (prior to the application of any Market Value Adjustment and any applicable
	surrender charge) that we calculate based on your requested net amount. For example, if you request a net partial surrender amount of $9,000 under the assumptions in the example above the total amount calculated by us and deducted from your account would
	be approximately $10,000.



	(c) Total Surrender Procedures and Determination of Surrender Value


	You may make a total surrender by Written Request. Surrendering the Certificate will end it.


	The surrender value will be determined as of the date we receive the Written Request for surrender. We will pay you the Certificate Withdrawal Value, which is the greater of:







	(i)





	the Account Value, with any Market Value Adjustment, and less any surrender charge; and







	(ii)





	the Certificate Value, adjusted by the ratio of the Account Value (with any Market Value Adjustment) to the unadjusted Account Value.






	We will deduct any premium taxes not previously paid.


	For any total surrender made after the first Certificate Year, you may receive the surrender benefit under an Annuity Option rather than in a lump sum.



	(d) Risk


	The interest and Index Increases credited to your Account are based on guarantees we make. The initial and subsequent Guaranteed Interest Rates and Guaranteed Interest Rate Factors apply to the original principal sum and reinvested earnings.


	An inherent risk in a surrender prior to the end of the applicable Term is that the Market Value Adjustment may reduce your Account Value. (See "Market Value Adjustment," page 16).



	(e) Payment Upon Partial or Total Surrender


	We may defer payment of any partial or total surrender for six months or less from the date of receipt of your request for surrender. It is unlikely that we would defer a surrender payment more than 30 days. Deferred payment may be caused by an
	unusually high number of surrender requests, accompanied by a substantial shift in interest rates. If we decide to defer payment for more than 30 days, we will notify you in writing.



	DEDUCTIONS


	(a) Surrender Charge


	We do not deduct a sales charge from the Single Premium when we receive it. A surrender charge is deducted upon any partial or total surrender, except:







	o





	A partial or total surrender within the first 30 calendar days after the end of any full Term or during the Certificate Year preceding the Income Date.






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	The portion of the first partial surrender in each Certificate Year that does not exceed the Free Withdrawal Amount.






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	As to total surrenders, the portion of the gross surrender amount that does not exceed the Free Withdrawal Amount, if no partial surrender was made in the same Certificate Year.






	The amount of any surrender charge is computed as a percentage of the gross surrender amount in excess of the Free Withdrawal Amount. The percentage used depends on the number of Account Years (rounded up) remaining until the
	end of the account Term. The surrender charge is equal to:







	(i)





	The amount of the partial surrender request, less any Free Withdrawal Amount;





	Â 



	Â 






	(ii)





	Multiplied by the applicable percentage from the Certificate Schedule depending on the number of Account Years (rounded up) remaining until the end of the Term.






	The following chart indicates the surrender charge percentage that will be applied while the specified number of years are remaining.

	We reserve the right to increase or decrease the amount of this charge, and the period of time for which it will apply, on new Certificates up to a maximum of 7% and 10 years. Currently, the charge is 7%. If such amounts
	increase, the increase will only apply to new Certificates issued after full disclosure to new Certificate Owners or to existing Certificate Owners purchasing additional Certificates.


	After each surrender, we will adjust our records to reflect appropriate deductions from the Account Value and the Certificate Value.


	The surrender charge will apply to a full or partial surrender in each Term of a Certificate. Any surrender may, in addition to certain Certificate charges and adjustments, be subject to tax. (See "Tax Considerations," page 22).


	Appendix B provides examples of how the surrender charge is determined.



	(b) Market Value Adjustment


	The amount payable upon a partial or total surrender before the Income Date, a transfer, or application of Account Value to an Annuity Option, may be increased or decreased by the application of a Market Value Adjustment. The Market Value
	Adjustment reflects the difference between:







	(i)





	the current Treasury Rate for a period of time equivalent to the remaining duration of the current Term; and







	(ii)





	the Treasury Rate at the beginning of the Term for a period equal to the full duration of the Term.






	A Market Value Adjustment will not apply to a partial or total surrender, or the transfer of Account Value to an Annuity Option, within the first 30 calendar days after the end of a Term.


	A Market Value Adjustment applies to any other partial or total surrender of, or upon the transfer of Account Value to an Annuity Option from, an account with a Term of three years or more. The Market Value Adjustment calculation upon such a surrender
	may be based on the gross surrender amount before the deduction of any surrender charge.


	A Market Value Adjustment applies to any transfer from an Account with a Term of three years or more to another Account, unless the effective date of the transfer is:







	(i)





	within the final Account Year of the Term and the transfer is to an account with a Term of three years or more; or







	(ii)





	within the first 10 calendar days after the end of any Term.






	The Market Value Adjustment calculation upon transfer may be based on the Account Value. A Market Value Adjustment in connection with a transfer also will result in an adjustment to Certificate Value. (See "Certificate Value,"
	page 14.)


	If you have not previously taken a partial surrender or effected any other transaction potentially subject to a Market Value Adjustment in the same Certificate Year, we subtract an amount not exceeding the Free Withdrawal Amount from the amount used
	to calculate the Market Value Adjustment. Otherwise, we use the amount you requested to be surrendered, transferred, or applied to an Annuity Option as the basis to calculate the Market Value Adjustment.


	The Market Value Adjustment for Indexed Accounts includes a scaling factor. You will know the scaling factor for all Indexed Account Terms at the time of the initial purchase. Scaling factors may differ for Terms of different durations. We may change
	the scaling factors from time to time for new Certificates issued after the time of the change. The scaling factors will never be greater than one. Where a scaling factor is less than one, it will reduce the positive or negative amount of any Market Value
	Adjustment. The scaling factors are shown on the Certificate Schedule and are guaranteed for the life of the Certificate. The scaling factors are currently 1.0. The Market Value Adjustment for Interest Accounts does not include a scaling factor.


	Because the Market Value Adjustment is based on changes in the yields on U.S. Treasury securities, the effect of the Market Value Adjustment will be closely related to the levels of such yields. As a result, should such yields increase significantly
	from the time of purchase of a Certificate, coupled with any surrender charge, the amount you would receive upon a total surrender could be less than the Single Premium.


	Appendix B provides the formula for calculating the Market Value Adjustment, as well as illustrative examples.


	At your request, we will furnish you with illustrations of the Market Value Adjustment on your Account Value, if you make a total or partial surrender before the end of a Term.



	(c) Premium Taxes


	We will deduct the amount of any premium taxes levied by a state or governmental entity when the premium tax is incurred, unless we defer the deduction until the time of surrender or the Income Date. The amount of premium tax payable on any
	transaction involving a Certificate will vary depending on whether the Certificate is Qualified or Non-Qualified, your state of residence, the state of residence of the Annuitant, our status within such states, and the insurance tax laws of such states.
	Currently, premium tax rates range from 0% to 3.5%. Appendix C contains a schedule of premium tax rates.



	DEATH PROVISIONS


	Death provisions do not apply to Non-Allocated Certificates. With Non-Allocated Certificates, Annuitants or payees are unknown until you request that an annuity be effected.



	(a) Non-Qualified Certificates



	Death of Certificate Owner, Joint Certificate Owner or Certain Non-Certificate Owner Annuitants:

	If,

	while the Certificate is In Force, you or any Joint Certificate Owner dies, or if the Annuitant dies when an entity (such as a trust) owns
	the Certificate, we will treat the Designated Beneficiary as the Certificate Owner after such a death. The Designated Beneficiary will be the first person among the following who is alive on the date of death; you; Joint Certificate Owner; Primary
	Beneficiary; Contingent Beneficiary; and otherwise your estate. If you and Joint Certificate Owner are both alive, you will be the Designated Beneficiary together.


	The Designated Beneficiary may receive a death benefit by surrendering the Account. If the decedent was you or the Annuitant (if the Certificate Owner is not a natural person) and the surrender occurs by the later of the 90th day after the death or
	the 60th day after we are notified of the death, the death benefit is the greatest of the following three values:


	If the decedent was you or the Annuitant (if the Certificate Owner is an entity), the Designated Beneficiary may, by the later of the 90th day after the death and the 60th day after we are notified of the death, surrender the Account for the death
	benefit on the date of surrender.


	The death benefit is the greatest of the following three values:







	(i)





	The Certificate Value;






	Â 



	Â 






	(ii)





	The Certificate Withdrawal Value; or






	Â 



	Â 






	(iii)





	The Account Value; but if the Term in which death occurs relates to an Indexed Account and the Term's Floor is 0%, the Account Value is:






	Â 




	(a)





	The Indexed Account Value at the start of the Account Year in which death occurs; except that if death occurs in the last Account Year of the Term and the Designated Beneficiary's surrender occurs after the end of that Term,
	the Indexed Account Value at the end of a Term is used instead;






	Â 



	Â 



	Â 





	Â 




	(b)





	Minus the sum of any partial surrenders since the start of the Account Year in which death occurs.






	Otherwise, the death benefit is the Certificate Withdrawal Value.


	If the Designated Beneficiary does not surrender the Certificate, the Certificate will continue as follows:







	o





	If you or any Joint Certificate Owner dies and the decedent's surviving spouse is the sole Designated Beneficiary, he or she will automatically become the new Certificate Owner as of the date of death. If the Annuitant dies,
	the new Annuitant will be any living contingent Annuitant named in the Enrollment Form, otherwise the surviving spouse. The Certificate may remain In Force until another death occurs. Except for this paragraph, all of the "Death Provisions" will apply to
	that subsequent death.






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	In all other cases, the Certificate may remain In Force for up to five years from the date of death. During this period, the Designated Beneficiary may exercise all ownership rights, including the right to make transfers, or
	partial or total surrenders. If the Certificate is In Force at the end of the five-year period, we will automatically end it by paying to the Designated Beneficiary the Certificate Withdrawal Value, without deducting any surrender charge. If the
	Designated Beneficiary is not alive, we will pay any person(s) named in writing by the Designated Beneficiary; otherwise we will pay the Designated Beneficiary's estate.








	Payment of Benefits

	:

	Instead of receiving a lump sum, you or any Designated Beneficiary may direct us in writing to pay any benefit of $5,000 or more under an Annuity Option that meets the following:







	o





	The first payment to the Designated Beneficiary must be made no later than one year after the date of death;






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	Payments must be made over the life of the Designated Beneficiary or over a period not extending beyond that person's life expectancy; and






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	Any Annuity Option that provides for payments to continue after the death of the Designated Beneficiary will not permit the successor payee to extend the period of time during which the remaining payments are to be made.






	You may also direct us to pay benefits to the Designated Beneficiary under an Annuity Option meeting these same requirements.




	Death of Certain Non-Certificate Owner Annuitants:


	These provisions apply if and while the Certificate is In Force,







	o





	The Annuitant dies,






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	You and the Annuitant are not the same, and






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	You are a natural person.






	The Certificate will continue after the Annuitant's death. The new Annuitant will be any living contingent Annuitant. If there is no living Contingent Annuitant, then you will be the new Annuitant.



	(b) Qualified Certificates



	Death of Annuitant:


	If the Annuitant dies while the Certificate is In Force, the Designated Beneficiary will control the Certificate. The Designated Beneficiary has until the later of the 90th day after the death and the 60th day after we
	are notified of the death to surrender the Certificate for the death benefit. The death benefit is:







	o





	the Certificate Value;






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	the Certificate Withdrawal Value; or






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	your Account Value; but if the Term in which death occurs relates to an Indexed Account and the Term's Floor is 0%, the Account Value is:






	Â 



	Â 





	Â 




	(a)





	the Indexed Account Value at the start of the Account Year in which death occurs; except that if death occurs in the last Account Year of the Term and the Designated Beneficiary's surrender occurs after the end of that Term,
	the Indexed Account Value at the end of a Term is used instead;






	Â 



	Â 



	Â 





	Â 




	(b)





	minus the sum of any partial surrenders since the start of the Account Year in which death occurs.






	If a surrender is after the applicable 90 or 60 day period, the death benefit is the Certificate Withdrawal Value.


	If the Designated Beneficiary does not surrender the Certificate, the Certificate may continue for the period permitted by the Internal Revenue Code. During this period, the Designated Beneficiary may exercise all ownership rights, including the right
	to make partial or total surrenders. If the Certificate is in effect at the end of the period, we will automatically end it then by paying to the Designated Beneficiary the Certificate Withdrawal Value. If the Designated Beneficiary is not alive, we will
	pay any person(s) named by the Designated Beneficiary in writing; otherwise we will pay the Designated Beneficiary's estate.




	Payment of Benefits

	:

	Instead of receiving a lump sum, you or any Designated Beneficiary may direct us in writing to pay any benefit or $5,000 or more under an Annuity Option that meets the following:







	o





	the first payment to the Designated Beneficiary must be made no later than one year after the date of death;






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	payments must be made over the life of the Designated Beneficiary or over a period not extending beyond that person's life expectancy; and






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	any payment option that provides for payments to continue after the death of the Designated Beneficiary will not permit the successor payee to extend the period of time over which the remaining payments are to be made.






	You may also direct us to pay benefits to the Designated Beneficiary under an Annuity Option meeting these same requirements.



	ANNUITY PERIOD PROVISIONS


	Annuity Benefits


	If the Annuitant is alive on the Income Date and the Certificate is In Force, we will begin payments under the payment option(s) you have chosen. We determine the payment by applying the Annuity Value on the Income Date (less any premium taxes not
	previously deducted) in accordance with the option selected. The Annuity Value is the greater of:







	o





	the Account Value after application of any Market Value Adjustment; or






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	the Certificate Value, adjusted to reflect the ratio of the Account Value (after application of the Market Value Adjustment) to the unadjusted Account Value.







	The Income Date and Form of Annuity



	The Income Date, shown on the Certificate Schedule, is the later of the end of the Certificate Year in which the Annuitant's 85th birthday occurs or the end of the 10th Certificate Year.


	For Allocated Certificates, you may elect, at least 30 days before the Income Date, to have the Annuity value applied on the Income Date pursuant to the Annuity Options described below. If you do not make an election, the Annuity value will be applied
	on the Income Date pursuant to Option 2 to provide a monthly life annuity with 10 years of payments guaranteed.


	For Non-Allocated Certificates, you may request that we apply a portion of the Account Value, including any surrender charge and Market Value Adjustment, under an Annuity Option for a participant in your plan. We will issue a Certificate for such
	participant, who is also the Annuitant, and begin annuity payments as you direct.


	You may not make a surrender after the Income Date. Other rules may apply to qualified retirement plans. (See "Qualified Plans," page 24.)



	Change of Annuity Option


	You may change the Annuity Option from time to time, by Written Request. We must receive the request at least 30 days before the Income Date.



	Annuity Options


	Option 1 - Income for a Fixed Number of Year:

	We will pay an annuity for a chosen number of years, not less than 5 or more than 30 years. If on the payee's death, payments under the fixed number of years have not run out, then:






	(a)





	we will make payments to the successor payee for the rest of the period; or





	Â 



	Â 






	(b)





	the successor payee may elect to receive the present value of the remaining payments in a lump sum, commuted at the interest rate used to create the annuity factor for this option.







	Option 2 - Life Income with 10 Years Guaranteed:

	We will pay an annuity income during the lifetime of the payee. If on the payee's death payments have been made for less than 10 years then:







	(a)





	we will make payments to the successor payee for the rest of the 10 year period; or





	Â 



	Â 






	(b)





	the successor payee may elect to receive the present value of the remaining certain payments in a lump sum, commuted at the interest rate used to create the annuity factor for this option.






	The amount of the annuity payments will depend on the age of the payee at the time payments begin and may depend on the payee's sex.



	Option 3 - Joint and Last Survivorship Income:

	We will pay an annuity as long as the payee or a designated second natural person is alive. The amount of the annuity payments will depend on the age of both persons at the time annuity payments
	begin and may depend on each person's sex. You may receive only one annuity payment under this option if both payees die after the receipt of the first payment, or receive only two annuity payments if both payees die after receipt of the second payment,
	and so on.



	Other Annuity Options


	Other options may be arranged with the mutual consent of you and us.



	Frequency and Amount of Payments


	Annuity payments are paid as monthly installments. However, if the net amount available under any Annuity Option is less than $5,000, we have the right to pay such amount in a lump sum. If the payments are less than $100 per payment, we may change
	the frequency of the payments to result in payments of at least $100.



	Proof of Age, Sex, and Survival of Annuitant


	We may require proof of age, sex, or survival of any payee upon whose age, sex or survival payments depend. If the age or sex has been misstated, we will compute the amount payable based on the correct age and sex. If income payments have begun,
	we will pay any underpayment on the next annuity payment and deduct any overpayment, unless repaid in one sum, from future annuity payments until we are repaid in full.



	INVESTMENTS BY KEYPORT


	We invest our assets according to the requirements of applicable state laws regarding investments that may be made by the general accounts and separate accounts of life insurance companies. In general, these laws permit investments, subject to
	specified limits and certain qualifications, in federal, state, and municipal obligations, corporate bonds, preferred and common stocks, real estate mortgages, real estate and certain other investments. (See page 33 for further information on our
	investments).


	All of our General Account assets, the assets of Separate Account C and of certain other Separate Accounts are available to fund claims under a Certificate.


	In establishing the Guaranteed Interest Rates and Guaranteed Interest Rate Factors under the Certificates, we will take into account factors such as the yields available on the instruments in which the proceeds from the Certificates are invested. (See
	"Establishment of Guaranteed Interest Rates and Guaranteed Interest Rate Factors," page 14). Our obligations and the values and benefits under the Certificates, however, will not vary as a result of the returns on the instruments. Also, you, Designated
	Beneficiaries and payees with rights under a Certificate will not participate in the gains or losses of the investment instruments we hold in the Separate Account.


	Our investment strategy will be to invest in debt securities, which we will use to match our liabilities with respect to the Terms to which the proceeds are allocated. It is in our sole discretion to invest in any type of investment that is authorized
	under state law. We expect to invest a substantial portion of the premiums in securities issued by the United States Government, or its agencies or instrumentalities, that may or may not be guaranteed by the United States Government. The government
	securities may include T-Bills, Notes, Bonds, Zero Coupon Securities and Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates such as Government National Mortgage Association backed securities (GNMA Certificates), Federal National Mortgage Association Guaranteed
	Pass-Through Certificates (FNMA Certificates) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Mortgage Participation Certificates (FHLMC Certificates).


	We may invest our assets in various instruments, including equity options, futures, forwards, and others based on the Index in order to hedge our obligations with respect to Indexed Accounts. We may also buy and sell interest rate swaps and caps,
	Treasury bond futures, and other instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates. These derivative instruments will be purchased from counterparties that conform to our policies and guidelines regarding derivative instruments. Investments
	in these instruments generally involve the following types of risks:







	(a)





	in the case of over-the-counter options and forward contracts, there is no guarantee these markets will exist for these investments when we want to close out a position;







	(b)





	futures exchange may impose trading limits which may inhibit our ability to close out positions in exchange-listed instruments; and







	(c)





	if we have an open position with a dealer that becomes insolvent, we may experience a loss.






	While the foregoing generally describes our investment strategy with respect to the proceeds attributable to the Certificates, we are not obligated to invest assets, including the proceeds attributable to the Certificates,
	according to any particular strategy except as may be required by Rhode Island and other state insurance laws.



	AMENDMENT OF CERTIFICATES


	We reserve the right to amend the group contracts and Certificate to meet the requirements of any applicable federal or state laws or regulations. We will notify you in writing of any such amendments.



	ASSIGNMENT OF CERTIFICATES


	You may assign a Certificate at any time, as permitted by applicable law. You must file a copy of any assignment with us. An assignment will not be binding on us until we receive a copy of it. Your rights and those of any revocably-named person
	will be subject to the assignment. Any Qualified Certificate may have limitations on your ability to assign the Certificate. We will not assume responsibility for the validity or effect of any assignment.


	Because an assignment may be a taxable event, you should consult a competent tax adviser as to the tax consequences resulting from any assignment.



	DISTRIBUTION OF CONTRACTS AND CERTIFICATES


	Keyport Financial Services Corp. ("KFSC") serves as the principal underwriter for the Contracts and the Certificates described in this prospectus. KFSC is our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary and is registered with the Securities and Exchange
	Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") as a broker-dealer. KFSC is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD") and is located at 125 High Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02110.


	The Certificate will be sold by insurance agents who are registered representatives of broker-dealers that have entered into selling agreements with KFSC. We will pay a maximum commission to broker-dealers of 5.25% of the Single Premium. We may pay a
	reduced commission percentage applied to the Certificate Owner's Account Value at the start of each Term after the first term or at some other date(s).


	Certificates may be sold with a lower commission structure to (a) our officers, directors or employees or those of our affiliates, or (b) any Qualified Plan established for such a person. Such Certificates will have higher Participation Rates under
	the Indexed Account, reflecting anticipated cost savings to us from the lower commission structure.



	TAX CONSIDERATIONS


	Because tax laws are complicated and tax consequences vary according to the actual status of the Contract Owner or Certificate Owner involved, legal and tax advice may be needed by a person, employer, or other entity contemplating the purchase of a
	contract or Certificate described in this prospectus.


	You should understand that any detailed description of the tax consequences regarding the purchase of a contract or Certificate cannot be made in this prospectus. Special tax rules may apply with respect to certain purchase situations not
	discussed herein. We do not consider any applicable state or other tax laws. For detailed information, you should always consult a competent tax adviser.


	This discussion is based upon our understanding of federal income tax laws as they are currently interpreted. The United States Congress has in the past and may in the future consider legislation that, if enacted, could adversely affect the tax
	treatment of annuity contracts, including distributions and undistributed appreciation. There is no way to predict whether, when or in what form Congress will enact legislation affecting annuity contracts. Any such legislation could have retroactive
	effect regardless of the date of enactment. We are not making any representation regarding the likelihood of continuation of those current federal income tax laws, or of the current interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service.



	Taxation of Keyport


	We are taxed as a life insurance company under Part I of Subchapter L of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Code"). We own assets underlying the Certificates, and any income earned on those assets will be deemed our income.



	Taxation of Annuities


	Section 72 of the Code governs the taxation of annuities. You, a trust or other entity holding a Non-Qualified Certificate as an agent for an individual, are not taxed on increases in Account Value until a distribution occurs in the form of a
	total or partial surrender, an assignment or gift of the Certificate, or annuity payments. The provisions of Section 72 of the Code concerning distributions are briefly summarized below. A trust or other entity owning a Non-Qualified Certificate, other
	than as an agent for an individual, is taxed differently. Increases in Account Value are taxed yearly whether or not a distribution occurs.



	(a) Surrenders, Death Benefit Payments, Assignments, and Gifts


	If you fully surrender your Certificate, the portion of the payment that exceeds your cost basis in the Certificate is subject to tax. For Non-Qualified Certificates, the cost basis is generally the amount of the Single Premium, and the taxable
	portion of the surrender payment is subject to tax as ordinary income. For Qualified Certificates, the cost basis is generally zero, and the taxable portion of the surrender payment is generally taxed as ordinary income. A Designated Beneficiary receiving
	a lump sum surrender benefit after your death or the death of the Annuitant is similarly taxed on the portion of the amount that exceeds your cost basis in the Certificate. If the Designated Beneficiary elects to receive annuity payments that begin within
	one year of the decedent's death, different tax rules apply. (See "Annuity Payments" below).


	Partial surrenders received under Non-Qualified Certificates prior to the Income Date are first included in gross income to the extent the Account Value (plus or minus any Market Value Adjustment) exceeds the Single Premium. To the extent the Account
	Value (plus or minus any Market Value Adjustment) does not exceed the Single Premium, such surrenders are treated as a non-taxable return of principal to you. For partial surrenders under a Qualified Certificate, payments are treated first as a
	non-taxable return of principal up to the cost basis and then a taxable return of income. Since the cost basis of Qualified Certificates is generally zero, partial surrender amounts will generally be fully taxed as ordinary income.


	If you assign or pledge a Non-Qualified Certificate, you will be treated as if you have received the amount assigned or pledged. You will be subject to taxation under the rules applicable to surrenders. If you give away the Certificate to anyone other
	than your spouse, you will be treated for income tax purposes as if you have fully surrendered the Certificate.


	A special computational rule applies if, during any calendar year, we issue to you more than one Certificate or one or more Certificates and one or more of our other annuity contracts. Under this rule, the amount of any distribution includable in your
	gross income is determined under Section 72(e) of the Code. All such contracts will be treated as one contract. We believe that this means the amount of any distribution under any Certificate will be includable in gross income to the extent that, at the
	time of distribution, the sum of the values for all the Certificates or contracts exceeds the sum of the cost bases for all the contracts. This special computational rule applies to "laddered" Certificates, which are multiple Certificates of different
	Terms that are purchased during one calendar year.



	(b) Annuity Payments


	We determine the non-taxable portion of each annuity payment with an "exclusion ratio" formula, which establishes the ratio that the cost basis of the Certificate bears to the total expected value of annuity payments for the term of the annuity.
	The remaining portion of each payment is taxable at ordinary income rates. For Qualified Certificates, the cost basis is generally zero. With annuity payments based on life contingencies, the payments will become fully taxable once the payee lives longer
	than the life expectancy used to calculate the non-taxable portion of the prior payments.



	(c) Penalty Tax


	Payments received by you, Annuitants, and Designated Beneficiaries under the Certificates may be subject to both ordinary income taxes and a penalty tax equal to 10% of the amount received that is includable in income. The penalty tax is not
	imposed on amounts received under the following circumstances.







	o





	after the taxpayer attains age 59-1/2;






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	in a series of substantially equal payments made for life or life expectancy;






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	after your death (or, where an entity owns the Certificate, after the death of the Annuitant);






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	if the taxpayer becomes totally and permanently disabled; or






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	under a Non-Qualified Certificate's annuity payment option that provides for a series of substantially equal payments, provided the Certificate is not issued as a result of a Section 1035 exchange and the first annuity payment
	begins in the first Certificate Year.







	(d) Income Tax Withholding



	We are required to withhold federal income taxes on taxable amounts paid under the Certificates, unless the recipient elects not to have withholding apply. We will notify recipients of their right to elect not to have withholding apply. (See
	"Tax-Sheltered Annuities" ("TSAs"), below, for an alternative type of withholding that may apply to distributions from TSAs that are eligible for rollover to another TSA or an individual retirement annuity or account ("IRA")).



	(e) Section 1035 Exchanges


	You may purchase a Non-Qualified Certificate with proceeds from the surrender of an existing annuity contract. Such a transaction may qualify as a tax-free exchange pursuant to Section 1035 of the Code. It is our understanding that in such an event:






	o





	the new Certificate is subject to the distribution-at-death rules described in "Death Provisions for Non-Qualified Certificates";






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	purchase payments made between 8/14/82 and 1/18/85 and the income allocable to them will, following an exchange, no longer be covered by a "grandfathered" exception to the penalty tax for a distribution of income that is
	allocable to an investment made over ten years prior to the distribution; and






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	purchase payments made before 8/14/82 and the income allocable to them will, following an exchange, continue to receive the following "grandfathered" tax treatment under prior law:






	Â 



	Â 



	Â 





	Â 




	(a)





	the penalty tax does not apply to any distribution;






	Â 



	Â 



	Â 





	Â 




	(b)





	partial surrenders are treated first as a non-taxable return of principal and then a taxable return of income; and






	Â 



	Â 



	Â 





	Â 




	(c)





	assignments are not treated as surrenders subject to taxation.






	Our understanding of the above is principally based on legislative reports prepared by the Staff of the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.



	QUALIFIED PLANS


	The Certificate may be used with several types of Qualified Plans. The tax rules applicable to participants in such Qualified Plans vary according to the type of plan and the terms and conditions of the plan. Therefore, we do not attempt to
	provide more than general information about the use of the Certificate with the various types of Qualified Plans. Participants under such Qualified Plans as well as Certificate Owners, Annuitants, and Designated Beneficiaries are cautioned that the rights
	of any person to any benefits under such Qualified Plans may be subject to the terms and conditions of the plans themselves, regardless of the terms and conditions of the Certificate issued in connection therewith. Following are brief descriptions of the
	various types of Qualified Plans and the use of the Certificate in connection therewith. Purchasers of the Certificate should seek competent advice concerning the terms and conditions of the particular Qualified Plan and use of the Certificate with that
	Plan.



	Tax-Sheltered Annuities


	Section 403(b) of the Code permits public school employees and employees of certain types of charitable, educational and scientific organizations specified in Section 501(c)(3) of the Code to purchase annuity contracts and, subject to certain
	contribution limitations, exclude the amount of premium payments from gross income. Such premium payments may be subject to Social Security ("FICA") taxes. This type of annuity contract is commonly referred to as a "Tax-Sheltered Annuity".


	Section 403(b)(11) of the Code contains distribution restrictions. Specifically, benefits may be paid, through surrender of the Certificate or otherwise, only in the following circumstances:







	o





	when the employee attains age 59-1/2, separates from service, dies or becomes totally and permanently disabled (within the meaning of Section 72(m)(7) of the Code); or






	Â 



	Â 






	o





	in the case of hardship. A hardship distribution must be of employee contributions only and not of any income attributable to such contributions.






	Section 403(b)(11) does not apply to distributions attributable to assets held as of December 31, 1988. Thus, it appears that the legal restrictions apply only to distributions attributable to contributions made after 1988, to
	earnings on those contributions, and to earnings on amounts held as of December 31, 1988. The Internal Revenue Service has indicated that the distribution restrictions of Section 403(b)(11) are not applicable when TSA funds are being transferred tax-free
	directly to another TSA issuer, provided the transferred funds continue to be subject to the Section 403(b)(11) distribution restrictions.


	If you request a distribution from a Certificate, we will notify you if all or part of such distribution is eligible for rollover to another TSA or to an IRA. Any amount eligible for rollover treatment will be subject to mandatory federal income tax
	withholding at a 20% rate, unless you direct us in writing to transfer the amount as a direct rollover to another TSA or IRA.



	Individual Retirement Annuities


	Sections 408(b) and 408A of the Code permit eligible individuals to contribute to an individual retirement program known as an "Individual Retirement Annuity" and "Roth IRA", respectively. These Individual Retirement Annuities are subject to
	limitations on the amount which may be contributed, the persons who may be eligible to contribute, and on the time when distributions may commence. In addition, distributions from certain types of Qualified Plans may be placed on a tax-deferred basis into
	a Section 408(b) Individual Retirement Annuity.



	Corporate Pension and Profit-Sharing Plans


	Sections 401(a) and 403(a) of the Code permit corporate employers to establish various types of retirement plans for employees. Such retirement plans may permit the purchase of the Certificate to provide benefits under the plans.



	Annuity Purchases by Nonresident Aliens


	The discussion above provides general information regarding federal income tax consequences to annuity purchasers who are U.S. citizens or resident aliens. Purchasers who are not U.S. citizens or are resident aliens will generally be subject to
	U.S. federal income tax and withholding on annuity distributions at a 30% rate, unless a lower rate applies in a U.S. treaty with the purchaser's country. In addition, purchasers may be subject to state premium tax, other state and/or municipal taxes, and
	taxes that may be imposed by the purchaser's country of citizenship or residence. Prospective purchasers are advised to consult with a qualified tax adviser regarding U.S., state, and foreign taxation with respect to an annuity purchase.

	C. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition


	1. Results of Operations


	Net income

	was $142.6 million, $94.7 million and $108.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. The increase in the year ended December 31, 2000 primarily related to the net change in unrealized
	and undistributed gains in private equity limited partnerships, coupled with increases in net investment spread, fee income, and decreases in net realized investment gains (losses). These increases were offset by increases in operating expenses, policy
	benefits, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and income taxes. The decrease in the year ended December 31, 1999 compared to December 31, 1998 was primarily attributable to decreases in net realized investment gains.


	Income from operations (income before income taxes, net change in unrealized and undistributed gains in private equity limited partnerships, and net realized gains (losses)) was $203.9 million, $182.1 million and $160.7 million for the
	years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. The increase in 2000 compared to 1999 was primarily attributable to increases in net spread and fee income offset by an increase in operating expense. The increase in 1999 compared to 1998 was
	primarily attributable to the increase in net investment spread.



	Investment spread

	is the amount by which investment income earned on our investments exceeds interest credited to policyholder balances. Investment spread was $317.2 million, $278.6 million and $253.0 million for the years ended
	December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The amount by which the average yield on investments exceeds the average interest credited rate on policyholder balances is the

	investment spread percentage

	. The investment spread percentage was 2.26%, 1.97% and 1.78% for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.


	Investment income was $856.8 million, $805.2 million and $815.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. The increase of $51.6 million in 2000 compared to 1999 is the result of a higher average
	investment yield ($62.2 million) offset by a decrease in average invested assets ($10.6 million). The average investment yield was 6.74% in 2000 compared to 6.25% in 1999. Investment income decreased in 1999 compared to 1998 as a result of a lower average
	investment yield offset by an increase in average invested assets. The average investment yield was 6.25% in 1999 compared to 6.36% in 1998. Net investment income included option amortization related to the Company's equity-indexed annuities of $79.7
	million, $77.2 million and $70.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.


	Interest credited to policyholders totaled $539.6 million, $526.6 million and $562.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The increase of $13.0 million in 2000 compared to 1999 is the result of a
	higher average interest credited rate ($24.1 million) offset by lower average policyholder balances ($11.1 million). Policyholder balances averaged $12.0 billion ($9.7 billion of fixed products and $2.3 billion of equity-indexed annuities) in 2000
	compared to $12.3 billion ($10.1 billion of fixed products and $2.2 billion of equity-indexed annuities) in 1999. The average interest credited rate was 4.48% (5.27% on fixed products and 0.85% on equity-indexed annuities) in 2000 compared to 4.28% (5.00%
	on fixed products and 0.85% on equity-indexed annuities) in 1999. The Company's equity-indexed annuities credit interest to the policyholder at a "participation rate" equal to a portion (ranging for existing policies from 25% to 100%) of the change in
	value of the S&P 500 Index. Our equity-indexed annuities also provide a full guarantee of principal if held to term, plus interest at 0.85% annually. For each of the periods presented, the interest credited to equity-indexed policyholders related to
	the participation rate was offset by investment income recognized on S&P 500 Index call options and futures, resulting in an 0.85% net interest credited rate. Interest credited to policyholders decreased in 1999 compared to 1998 as a result of a lower
	average interest credited. Policyholder balances averaged $12.3 billion in 1999 and 1998. The average interest credited rate was 4.28% in 1999 compared to 4.58% in 1998.



	Average investments

	(computed without giving effect to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115), including a portion of our cash and cash equivalents, were $12.7 billion and $12.9 billion for the year ended December
	31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.



	Net realized investment (losses) gains

	were $(35.8) million, $(41.5) million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The net realized investment losses in 2000 and 1999 included
	losses of $16.7 million and $18.3 million, respectively, for certain fixed maturity investments where the decline in value was determined to be other than temporary.



	Net change in unrealized and undistributed gains in private equity limited partnerships

	is accounted for on the equity method and represents primarily increases in the fair value of the underlying investments of the private
	equity limited partnerships for which we have ownership interests in excess of 3%. This change in unrealized and undistributed gains is recorded net of the related amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs of $58.8 million and net of the amounts
	realized, which are recognized in investment income, of $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The financial information for these investments is obtained directly from the private equity limited partnerships on a periodic basis. The
	corresponding amounts in 1999 and 1998 were immaterial. There can be no assurance that any unrealized and undistributed gains will ultimately be realized or that we not incur losses in the future on such investments.



	Surrender charges

	are revenues earned on the early withdrawal of fixed, equity-indexed and variable annuity policyholder balances. Surrender charges on fixed, equity-indexed and variable annuity withdrawals generally are
	assessed at declining rates applied to policyholder withdrawals during the first five to seven years of the contract. Total surrender charges were $24.3 million, $17.7 million and $17.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
	respectively.


	Total annuity withdrawals represented 16.2% 14.7% and 13.2% of the total average annuity policyholder and separate account balances during 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Higher surrenders are primarily due to increased competition
	from other investment products and a declining interest rate environment.



	Separate account income

	is primarily mortality and expense charges earned on variable annuity and variable life policyholder balances and net spread from institutional business. Mortality and expense charges, which are based on
	the market values of the assets in the separate accounts supporting the contracts, were $39.3 million, $29.1 million and $20.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Variable product fees represented 1.40%, 1.45% and
	1.44% of average variable annuity and variable life separate account balances in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Net spread from institutional contracts was $4.2 million and $4.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 respectively.



	Management fees

	are primarily investment advisory fees related to the separate account assets. The fees are based on the levels of assets under management, which are affected by product sales, redemptions and changes in the
	market values of the investments managed. Management fees were $11.9 million, $8.9 million and $4.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The increases reflect a higher level of average separate account assets under
	management. Average separate account assets were $3.7 billion, $2.6 billion and $1.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.



	Operating expenses

	primarily represent compensation, general and administrative expenses. These expenses were $70.5 million, $54.4 million and $53.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The
	increases during 2000 were due to higher employee related expenses and information technology costs.



	Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs

	relates to the amortization of the costs of acquiring new business, which vary with, and are primarily related to, the production of new annuity business. Such acquisition costs
	included commissions, costs of policy issuance, underwriting and selling expenses.


	Amortization was $116.1 million, $97.4 million, and $77.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The $18.7 million increase in amortization in 2000 compared to 1999 was primarily related to the
	increase in investment spread from the growth of business in force associated with fixed and equity-indexed annuities. The $20.0 increase in amortization in 1999 compared to 1998 was primarily related to the increase in investment spread from the growth
	of business in force associated with fixed and equity-indexed products and the increased sales of variable annuity products during 1999. Amortization expense represented 28.3%, 31.2% and 27.7% of investment spread and separate account fees for 2000, 1999,
	and 1998, respectively.



	Income tax expense

	was $57.1 million, $46.0 million and $52.9 million or 28.61%, 32.69% and 32.76% of pretax income for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in
	2000 compared to 1999 primarily reflects a reduction to the valuation allowance established for unrealized capital losses in the "available for sale" investment portfolio.



	2. Financial Condition


	Stockholder's Equity

	was $1.280 billion and $1.013 billion at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The $266.8 million increase in stockholder's equity consist of a $276.8 million increase in comprehensive income ($134.2
	million of net unrealized investment gains combined with net income of $142.6) offset by $10.0 million in dividends paid to the parent company.



	Investments

	(computed without giving effect to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115), including a portion of our cash and cash equivalents, were $12.6 billion and $12.8 billion at December 31, 2000 and 1999,
	respectively.


	Our general investment policy is to hold fixed maturity investments for long-term investment and, accordingly, we do not have a trading portfolio. To provide for maximum portfolio flexibility and appropriate tax planning, we classify
	our entire fixed maturity portfolio as "available for sale" and carries such investments at fair value. Gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2000 and 1999 were $60.2 million and $330.3 million, respectively.


	Approximately $11.6 billion, or 76.5%, of our general account and certain separate account investments at December 31, 2000, were rated by Standard & Poor's Corporation, Moody's Investors Service or under comparable statutory
	rating guidelines established by the NAIC. At December 31, 2000, the carrying value of investments in below investment grade securities totaled $1.3 billion, or 8.3% of general account and certain separate account investments of $15.1 billion. Below
	investment grade securities generally provide higher yields and involve greater risks than investment grade securities because their issuers typically are more highly leveraged and more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions than investment grade
	issuers. In addition, the trading market for these securities may be more limited than for investment grade securities.


	We routinely review our portfolio of investment securities. We identify any investments that require additional monitoring on a monthly basis, and carefully review the carrying value of such investments at least quarterly to determine
	whether specific investments should be placed on a nonaccrual basis and to determine declines in value that may be other than temporary. In making these reviews, we principally consider the adequacy of collateral (if any), compliance with contractual
	covenants, the borrower's recent financial performance, news reports and other externally generated information concerning the creditor's affairs. In the case of publicly traded investments, management also considers market value quotations, if available.
	As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, the carrying value of fixed maturity investments that were non-income producing was $24.4 million and $22.6 million, respectively, which constitutes 0.16% of general account and certain separate account investments.



	3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk



	Market-Sensitive Instruments and Risk Management


	Market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in market rates and prices. Our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates and equity prices.


	The active management of market risk is integral to our operations. We may use the following approaches to manage our exposure to market risk within defined tolerance ranges: rebalance our existing asset or liability portfolios, change the character
	of future investment purchases, or use derivative instruments to modify the market risk characteristics of existing assets and liabilities or assets expected to be purchased.



	Corporate Oversight


	We generate substantial investable funds from our annuity operations. We believe that our fixed and indexed policyholder balances should be backed by investments, principally comprised of fixed maturities, which generate predictable rates of
	return. We do not have a specific target rate of return. Instead, our rates of return vary over time depending on the current interest rates, the slope of the yield curve and the excess at which fixed maturities are priced over the yield curve. Our
	portfolio strategy is designed to achieve acceptable risk-adjusted returns by effectively managing portfolio liquidity and credit quality.


	We administer and oversee the investment risk management processes primarily through our Investment Committee, our Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors of Liberty Financial. The Investment Committee and Board of Directors provide executive
	oversight of investment activities. The Investment Committee is a senior management committee consisting of the Chief Investment Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Chief Operating Officer and members of senior management of Liberty Financial.
	The Investment Committee meets monthly to provide detailed oversight of investment risk, including market risk.


	We have investment guidelines that define the overall framework for managing market and other investment risks, including the accountabilities and controls over these activities. In addition, we have specific investment policies that delineate the
	investment limits and strategies that are appropriate given our liquidity, surplus, product and regulatory requirements.


	We monitor and manage our exposure to market risk through asset allocation limits, duration limits, and stress tests. Asset allocation limits place restrictions on the aggregate fair value which may be invested within an asset class. Duration limits
	on the aggregate investment portfolio, and, as appropriate, on individual components of the portfolio, place restrictions on the amount of interest rate risk that may be taken. Stress tests measure downside risk to fair value and earnings over longer time
	intervals and for adverse market scenarios.


	The day-to-day management of market risk within defined tolerance ranges occurs as portfolio managers buy and sell within their respective markets based upon the acceptable boundaries established by asset allocation, duration and other limits,
	including but not limited to credit and liquidity.



	Interest Rate Risk


	Interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates. This risk arises from our primary activities, as we invest substantial funds in interest-sensitive assets and also have interest-sensitive
	liabilities. Our asset/liability management emphasizes a conservative approach, which is oriented toward reducing downside risk in adverse markets, as opposed to maximizing spread in favorable markets.


	We manage the interest rate risk inherent in our assets relative to the interest rate risk inherent in our liabilities. One of the measures we use to quantify this exposure is effective duration. Effective duration is a common measure for the price
	sensitivity of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates. It measures the approximate percentage change in the fair value of assets and liabilities when interest rates change by 100 basis points. This measure includes the impact of estimated
	changes in portfolio cash flows from features such as prepayments and bond calls. The effective duration of assets and related liabilities are produced using standard financial valuation techniques. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the estimated difference
	between our asset and liability duration was approximately 0.8 and 1.8, respectively. This positive duration gap indicates that the fair value of our assets is somewhat more sensitive to interest rate movements than the fair value of our liabilities.


	We seek to invest premiums and deposits to create future cash flows that will fund future benefits, claims, and expenses, and earn stable margins across a wide variety of interest rate and economic scenarios. In order to achieve this objective and
	limit our exposure to interest rate risk, we adhere to a philosophy of managing the effective duration of assets and related liabilities. We use interest rate swaps, futures and caps to reduce the interest rate risk resulting from effective duration
	mismatches between assets and liabilities. To the extent that actual results differ from the assumptions utilized, our effective duration could be significantly impacted. Important assumptions include the timing of cash flows on mortgage-related assets
	and liabilities subject to policyholder surrenders. Additionally, our calculation assumes that the current relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates (the term structure of interest rates) will remain constant over time. As a result,
	these calculations may not fully capture the impact of non-parallel changes in the term structure of interest rates and/or large changes in interest rates.


	Our potential exposure due to a 10% increase in prevailing interest rates from December 31, 2000 and 1999 levels was a loss of $79.2 million and $146.3 million, respectively, in fair value of our fixed-rate assets that were not offset by a decrease in
	the fair value of our fixed-rate liabilities. The decrease in potential exposure is primarily due to higher prevailing market interest rates and the decrease in positive duration gap. We expect that our exposure to loss as interest rate changes occur will
	be minimized and that actual losses will be less than the estimated potential loss due to the combination of asset/liability management strategies and flexibility in adjusting crediting rate levels.



	Equity Price Risk


	Equity price risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in a particular stock or stock index. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, we had approximately $76.4 million and $37.9 million, respectively, in common stocks and
	$337.7 million and $701.1 million, respectively, in call options.


	At December 31, 2000 and 1999, we had $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, in equity-indexed annuity liabilities that provide customers with contractually guaranteed participation in price appreciation of the Standard & Poor's 500
	Composite Price Index ("S&P 500 Index"). We purchase equity-indexed options and futures to hedge the risk associated with the price appreciation component of equity-indexed annuity liabilities.


	We manage the equity risk inherent in our assets relative to the equity risk inherent in our liabilities by conducting detailed computer simulations that model our S&P 500 Index derivatives and our equity-indexed annuity liabilities under
	stress-test scenarios in which both the index level and the index option implied volatility are varied through a wide range. Implied volatility is a value derived from standard option valuation models representing an implicit forecast of the standard
	deviation of the returns on the underlying asset over the life of the option or future. The fair values of S&P 500 Index linked securities, derivatives, and annuities are produced using standard derivative valuation techniques. The derivative
	portfolios are constructed to maintain acceptable interest margins under a variety of possible future S&P 500 Index levels and option or future cost environments. In order to achieve this objective and limit our exposure to equity price risk, we
	measure and manage these exposures using methods based on the fair value of assets and the price appreciation component of related liabilities. We use derivatives, including futures, options and total return swaps to modify our net exposure to
	fluctuations in the S&P 500 Index.


	Based upon the information and assumptions we use in our stress-test scenarios at December 31, 2000 and 1999, management estimates that if the S&P 500 Index increases by 10%, the net fair value of our assets and liabilities described above would
	increase (decrease) by approximately $(5.7) million and $1.5 million, respectively. If the S&P 500 Index decreases by 10%, management estimates that the net fair value of our assets and liabilities will decrease by approximately $7.2 million and $0.2
	million, respectively. If option implied volatilities increase by 100 basis points, management estimates that the net fair value of its assets and liabilities will decrease by approximately $1.4 million and $5.2 million, respectively.


	The simulations do not consider the effects of other changes in market conditions that could accompany changes in the equity option and futures markets including the effects of changes in implied dividend yields, interest rates, and equity-indexed
	annuity policy surrenders.



	4. Derivatives


	As a component of our investment strategy and to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk, we utilize interest rate and total return swap agreements and interest rate cap agreements to match assets more closely to liabilities.
	Interest rate swap agreements are agreements to exchange with counterparty interest rate payments of differing character (e.g., fixed-rate payments exchanged for variable-rate payments) based on an underlying principal balance (notional principal) to
	hedge against interest rate changes. We currently utilize interest rate swap agreements to reduce asset duration and to better match interest earned on longer-term fixed-rate assets with interest credited to policyholders. A total return swap agreement is
	an agreement to exchange payments based upon an underlying notional balance and changes in variable rate and total return indices. We utilize total return swap agreements to hedge our obligations related to certain separate account liabilities. We had 69
	and 67 outstanding swap agreements with an aggregate notional principal amount of $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.


	Cap agreements are agreements with a counterparty that require the payment of a premium for the right to receive payments for the difference between the cap interest rate and a market interest rate on specified future dates based on an
	underlying principal balance (notional principal) to hedge against rising interest rates. We had interest rate cap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $50.0 million at December 31, 1999. We had no outstanding interest rate cap agreements as of
	December 31, 2000.


	With respect to our equity-indexed annuities and certain separate account liabilities, we buy call options, futures and certain total return swap agreements on the S&P 500 Index to hedge our obligations to provide returns based
	upon this index. We had total return swap agreements with a carrying value of $23.9 million and $37.8 million as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.


	There are risks associated with some of the techniques we use to match our assets and liabilities. The primary risk associated with swap, cap and call option agreements is counterparty nonperformance. We believe that the counterparties
	to our swap, cap and call option agreements are financially responsible and that the counterparty risk associated with these transactions is minimal. Future contracts trade on organized exchanges and, therefore, have minimal credit risk. In addition, swap
	and cap agreements have interest rate risk and call options, futures and certain total return swap agreements have stock market risk. These swap and cap agreements hedge fixed-rate assets and we expect that any interest rate movements that adversely
	affect the market value of swap agreements would be offset by changes in the market values of such fixed-rate assets. However, there can be no assurance that these hedges will be effective in offsetting the potential adverse effects of changes in interest
	rates. Similarly, the call options, futures and certain total return swap agreements hedge our obligations to provide returns on equity-indexed annuities and certain separate account liabilities based upon the S&P 500 Index, and we believe that any
	stock market movements that adversely affect the market value of S&P 500 Index call options, futures and certain total return swap agreements would be substantially offset by a reduction in policyholder and certain separate account liabilities.
	However, there can be no assurance that these hedges will be effective in offsetting the potentially adverse effects of changes in S&P 500 Index levels. Our profitability could be adversely affected if the value of our swap and cap agreements increase
	less than (or decrease more than) the change in the market value of our fixed rate assets and/or if the value of its S&P Index 500 call options, futures and certain total return swap agreements increase less than (or decrease more than) the value of
	the guarantees made to equity-indexed and certain separate account policyholders.


	In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." In June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS No.
	137 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133." This statement amended SFAS No. 133 to defer its effective date one year to fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. In June
	2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities" - an amendment of SFAS No. 133. This statement makes certain changes in the hedging provisions of SFAS No. 133 and is effective concurrent
	with SFAS No. 133 (collectively hereafter referred to as the "Statement"). The Statement will require us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If the
	derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset by the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other
	comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings. Upon adoption, we will be required to record a cumulative effect adjustment to
	reflect this accounting change.


	We estimate that the cumulative effect, reported after tax and net of related effects of deferred policy acquisition costs, upon adoption at January 1, 2001 will decrease net income and stockholder's equity by approximately $55.0
	million. The adoption of the Statement may increase volatility in reported income due to the requirement to mark all derivatives to fair value and the definition of an effective hedging relationship under the Statement as opposed to certain hedges we
	believe are effective economic hedges. We believe that we will continue to utilize our current risk management philosophy, which includes the use of derivative instruments.



	5. Liquidity and Capital Resources


	Our liquidity needs and financial resources pertain to the management of the general account assets and policyholder balances. We use cash for the payment of annuity and life insurance benefits, operating expenses, policy
	acquisition costs, and investment purchases. We generate cash from annuity premiums, deposits, net investment income, and from maturities and sales of our investments. Annuity premiums, maturing investments and net investment income have historically been
	sufficient to meet our cash requirements. We monitor cash and cash equivalents in an effort to maintain sufficient liquidity and have strategies in place to maintain sufficient liquidity in changing interest rate environments. Consistent with the nature
	of our obligations, we have invested a substantial amount of our general account assets in readily marketable securities. At December 31, 2000, $11.0 billion, or 79.2%, of our general account investments are considered readily marketable.


	To the extent that unanticipated surrenders cause us to sell for liquidity purposes a material amount of securities prior to their maturity, such surrenders could have a material adverse effect on us. Although no assurance can be given, we believe
	that liquidity to fund withdrawals would be available through incoming cash flow, the sale of short-term or floating-rate instruments, thereby precluding the sale of fixed maturity investments in a potentially unfavorable market. In addition, our
	fixed-rate products incorporate surrender charges to encourage persistency and make the cost of our policyholder balances more predictable. Approximately 75% of our fixed annuity policyholder balances were subject to surrender charges or restrictions at
	December 31, 2000.


	Current Rhode Island insurance law permits us to pay dividends or distributions to Liberty Financial, which, together with dividends and distributions paid during the preceding 12 months, do not exceed the lesser of (i) 10% of statutory surplus as of
	the preceding December 31 or (ii) the net gain from operations for the preceding fiscal year. Any proposed dividend in excess of this amount is called an "extraordinary dividend" and may not be paid until it is approved by the Commissioner of Insurance of
	the State of Rhode Island. We paid $10.0 million, $30.0 million and $20.0 million in dividends to Liberty Financial in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. We had not previously paid any dividends since our acquisition in 1988. At December 31, 2000, the
	amount of additional dividends that we could pay without such approval was $51.3 million.


	Based upon our historical cash flow, our current financial condition and our expectation that there will not be a material adverse change in the results of our operations and our subsidiaries during the next twelve months, we believe that cash flow
	provided by operating activities over this period will provide sufficient liquidity for us to meet our liquidity needs.



	6. Strategic Review


	On November 1, 2000, our parent company announced that it has retained an investment banking firm to review its strategic alternatives, including our possible sale. To help retain our employees during the strategic review, we
	implemented a special compensation plan that provides cash retention bonuses to substantially all employees. We recorded a $2.0 million expense in 2000 relating to this plan. The retention bonuses are generally based on employees' base salary and/or
	target incentive compensation amounts, except for sales personnel where retention bonuses are based on sales. The estimated maximum cost of the retention bonuses, assuming all covered employees remain with us, is approximately $28.0 million with fifty
	percent payable on November 1, 2001 and the remainder payable on April 1, 2002. In the event of a change of our control that occurs prior to November 1, 2001, the payments would be accelerated and the retention bonus amount would be reduced, subject to a
	minimum. The estimated minimum retention bonus is approximately $17.0 million and would be recognized if a change of control occurs as of May 14, 2001. The amount of the retention bonus increases from the minimum on May 14, 2001 to the maximum on October
	31, 2001. In calculating the 2000 expense of $2.0 million, a turnover rate of 15% was assumed.



	7. Forward-Looking Statements


	We desire to take advantage of the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the "Reform Act"). Investors are cautioned that all statements, trend analyses and other information contained in
	this report or in any of our filings under Section 13 or 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), relative to the markets for our products and trends in our operations or financial results, as well as other statements including
	words such as "anticipate", "believe", "plan", "estimate", "expect", "intend" and other similar expressions, constitute forward-looking statements under the Reform Act. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties
	and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, that may cause actual results to be materially different from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Such factors include, among other things: (1) general economic conditions and
	market factors, such as prevailing interest rate levels, stock market performance and fluctuations in the market for retirement-oriented savings products, which may adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services and the market value of our
	investments and assets under management and, therefore, the portion of our revenues that are based on a percentage of assets under management; (2) our ability to manage effectively our investment spread (i.e. the amount by which investment income exceeds
	interest credited to annuity and life insurance policyholders) as a result of changes in interest rates and crediting rates to policyholders, market conditions and other factors (our results of operations and financial condition are significantly
	dependent on our ability to manage effectively our investment spread); (3) levels of surrenders and withdrawals of our retirement-oriented insurance products; (4) our ability to manage effectively certain risks with respect to our investment portfolio,
	including risks relating to holding below investment grade securities and the ability to dispose of illiquid and/or restricted securities at desired times and prices, and the ability to manage and hedge against interest rate changes through
	asset/liability management techniques; (5) competition in the sale of our products and services, including our ability to establish and maintain relationships with distributors of our products; (6) changes in our financial ratings or those of our
	competitors; (7) our ability to attract and retain key employees, including senior officers, investment managers and sales executives; (8) the impact of and our compliance with existing and future regulation, including restrictions on the ability to pay
	dividends and any of our obligations under any guaranty fund assessment laws; (9) changes in applicable tax laws which may affect the relative tax advantages and attractiveness of some of our products; (10) the result of any litigation or legal
	proceedings involving us; (11) changes in generally accepted accounting principles and the impact of accounting principles and pronouncements on our financial condition and results of operations; (12) the other risk factors or uncertainties contained from
	time to time in any document incorporated by reference in this report or otherwise filed by us under the Exchange Act. Given these uncertainties, prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements and no
	assurances can be given that the estimates and expectations reflected in such statements will be achieved.



	D. General Account Investments


	Premium deposits on fixed and indexed annuities are credited to our general account and certain separate account investments (which at December 31, 2000 totaled $15.1 billion). Total general account and certain separate account
	investments include cash and cash equivalents. To maintain our investment spread at acceptable levels, we must earn returns on its general account sufficiently in excess of the fixed or indexed returns credited to policyholders. The key element of this
	investment process is asset/liability management. Successful asset/liability management requires both a quantitative assessment of overall policy liabilities (including maturities, surrenders and crediting of interest) and prudent investment of general
	and certain separate account assets. The two most important tools in managing policy liabilities are setting crediting rates and establishing surrender periods. The investment process requires portfolio techniques that earn acceptable yields while
	effectively managing both interest rate risk and credit risk. We emphasize a conservative approach to asset/liability management, which is oriented toward reducing downside risk in adverse markets, as opposed to maximizing spread in favorable markets. The
	approach is also designed to reduce earnings volatility. Various factors can impact our investment spread, including changes in interest rates and other factors affecting our general account and certain separate account investments.


	The bulk of our general account and certain separate account investments are invested in fixed maturity securities (76.4% at December 31, 2000). Our principal strategy for managing interest rate risk is to closely match the duration of
	our general account investment portfolio to its policyholder balances. We also employ hedging strategies to manage this risk, including interest rate swaps and caps. In the case of equity-indexed


	products, we purchase S&P 500 Index call options and futures to hedge its obligations to provide participation rate returns. Credit risk is managed by careful credit analysis and monitoring. A portion of the general account and certain
	separate account investments (8.3% at December 31, 2000) are invested in below investment grade fixed maturity securities to enhance overall portfolio yield. Below investment grade securities pose greater risks than investment grade securities. We
	actively manage our below investment grade portfolio to optimize our risk/return profile. At December 31, 2000, the carrying value of fixed maturity investments that were non-income producing was $24.4 million, which constituted 0.2% of our general
	account and certain separate account investments.


	As of December 31, 2000, we owned approximately $3.3 billion of mortgage-backed securities (21.8% of its general and certain separate account investments), 98.8% of which were investment grade. Mortgage-backed securities are subject to
	prepayment and extension risks, since the underlying mortgages may be repaid more or less rapidly than scheduled.


	As of December 31, 2000, approximately $3.3 billion (21.8% of our general and certain separate account investments) were invested in securities that were sold without registration under the Securities Act and were not freely tradable
	under the Securities Act or which were otherwise illiquid. These securities may be resold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. If we sought to sell such securities, we might be unable to do so at the then current carrying
	values and might have to dispose of such securities over extended periods of time at uncertain levels.



	E. Marketing and Distribution


	Our sales strategy is to use multiple distribution channels to achieve broader market presence. During 2000, the bank channel represented approximately 50.1% of our annuity sales, and the brokerage channel represented approximately
	12.5%. The sale of insurance and investment products through the bank distribution channel is highly regulated. Sales through other distributors of insurance products, such as financial planners, insurance agents and an institutional channel represented
	approximately 37.4% of total annuity sales.


	The following table presents sales information in our distribution channels for the periods indicated (in millions).

	F. Regulation


	Our business activities are extensively regulated. The following briefly summarizes the principal regulatory requirements and certain related matters.


	Our retirement-oriented insurance products generally are issued to individuals. The policy is a contract between the issuing insurance company and the policyholder. State law regulates policy forms, including all principal contract terms. In most
	cases, the policy form must be approved by the insurance department or similar agency of a state in order for the policy to be sold in that state.


	We are chartered in Rhode Island and the State of Rhode Island Insurance Department is our primary oversight regulator. We also must be licensed by the state insurance regulators in each other jurisdiction in which we conduct business. We are
	currently licensed to conduct business in 49 states (the exception being New York), and in the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands. State insurance laws generally provide regulators with broad powers related to issuing licenses to transact
	business, regulating marketing and other trade practices, operating guaranty associations, regulating certain premium rates, regulating insurance holding company systems, establishing reserve requirements, prescribing the form and content of required
	financial statements and reports, performing financial and other examinations, determining the reasonableness and adequacy of statutory capital and surplus, regulating the type and amount of investments permitted, limiting the amount of dividends that can
	be paid and the size of transactions that can be consummated without first obtaining regulatory approval, and other related matters. The regulators also make periodic examinations of individual companies and review annual and other reports on the
	financial conditions of all companies operating within their respective jurisdictions.


	We prepare our statutory-basis financial statements in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the Insurance Department of the State of Rhode Island. State laws prescribe certain statutory accounting practices. Permitted
	statutory accounting practices encompass all accounting practices that are not proscribed; such practices may differ between the states and companies within a state. In 1998, the NAIC adopted codified statutory accounting principles ("Codification").
	Codification will likely change, to some extent, prescribed statutory accounting practices and may result in changes to the accounting practices that we use to prepare our statutory-based financial statements. Codification will require adoption by the
	various states before it becomes the prescribed statutory basis of accounting for insurance companies domesticated within those states. Accordingly, before Codification becomes effective for the Company, the State of Rhode Island must adopt Codification
	as the prescribed basis of accounting on which domestic insurers must report their statutory-basis results to the Insurance Department. The State of Rhode Island has adopted Codification. The adoption of Codification on our statutory-basis financial
	statements in Rhode Island will reduce statutory surplus at January 1, 2001 by $20 million.



	Risk-Based Capital Requirements.

	In recent years, various states have adopted new quantitative standards promulgated by the NAIC. These standards are designed to reduce the risk of insurance company insolvencies, in part by providing an early
	warning of financial or other difficulties. These standards include the NAIC's risk-based capital ("RBC") requirements. RBC requirements attempt to measure statutory capital and surplus needs based on the risks in a company's mix of products and
	investment portfolio. The requirements provide for four different levels of regulatory attention which implement increasing levels of regulatory control (ranging from development of an action plan to mandatory receivership). As of December 31, 2000, our
	capital and surplus exceeded the level at which the least severe of these regulatory attention levels would be triggered.



	Guaranty Fund Assessments.

	Under the insurance guaranty fund laws existing in each state, insurers can be assessed for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. Because assessments typically are not
	made for several years after an insurer fails, we cannot accurately determine the precise amount or timing of its exposure to known insurance company insolvencies at this time. For certain information regarding our historical and estimated future
	assessments, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The insolvency of large life insurance companies in future years could result in material assessments to us by state guaranty funds. No assurance can be given that such assessments would
	not have a material adverse effect on us.



	Insurance Holding Company Regulation.

	Current Rhode Island insurance law permits us to pay dividends or distributions to Liberty Financial, which, together with dividends and distributions paid during the preceding 12 months, do not exceed the
	lesser of (i) 10% of statutory surplus as of the preceding December 31 or (ii) the net gain from operations for the preceding fiscal year. Any proposed dividend in excess of this amount is called an "extraordinary dividend" and may not be paid until it is
	approved by the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Rhode Island. We paid $10.0 million and $30.0 million in dividends to Liberty Financial during 2000 and 1999, respectively. As of December 31, 2000, the amount of additional dividends that we could
	pay without such approval was $51.3 million. In addition, no person or group may acquire, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of our voting stock or voting power unless such person has provided certain required information to the Rhode Island Department
	of Business Regulation and such acquisition is approved by the Department.



	General Regulation at Federal Level and Certain Related Matters.


	Although the federal government generally does not directly regulate the insurance business, federal initiatives often have an impact on the business in a variety of ways. Current and proposed federal measures that may significantly affect the
	insurance business include limitations on antitrust immunity, minimum solvency requirements and the removal of barriers restricting banks from engaging in the insurance business. In particular, several proposals to repeal or modify the Bank Holding
	Company Act of 1956 (which prohibits banks from being affiliated with insurance companies) have been made by members of Congress. Moreover, the United States Supreme Court held in 1995 in NationsBank of North Carolina v. Variable Annuity Life Insurance
	Company that annuities are not insurance for purposes of the National Bank Act. In addition, the Supreme Court also held in 1995 in Barnett Bank of Marion City v. Nelson that state laws prohibiting national banks from selling insurance in small town
	locations are preempted by federal law. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency adopted a ruling in November 1996 that permits national banks, under certain circumstances, to expand into other financial services, thereby increasing competition for
	us. At present, the extent to which banks can sell insurance and annuities without regulation by state insurance departments is being litigated in various courts in the United States. Although the effect of these recent developments on us and our
	competitors is uncertain, there can be no assurance that such developments would not have a material adverse effect on us.


	On November 12, 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 was signed into law. The major provisions of this new law became effective on November 13, 2000. While the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act eliminates legal barriers to affiliates among banks, insurance
	companies and other financial services companies and therefore effectively repeals the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 (which restricted banks from engaging in securities-related businesses), the effect on us and our competitors is uncertain.





	G. Competition



	Our business activities are conducted in extremely competitive markets. We compete with a large number of life insurance companies, some of which are larger and more highly capitalized and have higher ratings than we do. No one company dominates
	the industry. In addition, our products compete with alternative investment vehicles available through financial institutions, brokerage firms and investment managers. Management believes that we compete principally with respect to product features,
	pricing, ratings and service; management also believes that we can continue to compete successfully in this market by offering innovative products and superior services. In addition, financial institutions and broker-dealers focus on the insurer's ratings
	for financial strength or claims-paying ability in determining whether to market the insurer's annuities.





	H. Employees



	As of December 31, 2000, we had 384 full-time employees. We provide our employees with a broad range of employee benefit programs. We believe that our relations with our employees are excellent.

	EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES AND INFORMATION



	The tables that appear below, along with the accompanying text and footnotes, provide information on compensation and benefits for the named executive officers, in accordance with applicable SEC requirements. All the data regarding values for
	stock options pertain to options to purchase shares of our parent corporation, Liberty Financial Companies, Inc. ("Liberty Financial"). Such data are hypothetical in terms of the amounts that an individual may or may not receive, because such amounts are
	contingent on continued employment with us and the price of Liberty Financial's Common Stock ("Common Stock"). All year-end values shown in these tables for outstanding stock options reflect a price of $44.5625 per share, which was the closing price of
	the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on December 29, 2000 (the last trading day of 2000). None of the named executive officers received any perquisites during 2000 exceeding the lesser of $50,000 or 10% of such officer's total salary and bonus
	for such year.

	Â Â Calculated by multiplying the closing price of Liberty Financial's Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant ($26.3538 on May 9, 2000;$23.1875 on May 5, 1999 and $24.5625 on May 11,
	1999; $37.1875 on May 11, 1998 and $24.3125 on October 23, 1998; $28.50 on May 13, 1997) by the number of shares awarded. The number of shares and value of restricted stock held by the named executive officers as of December 29, 2000 (based on the New
	York Stock Exchange closing price of $44.5620 for Liberty Financial's Common Stock at fiscal year end) is as follows: Mr. Polkinghorn: 20,000 shares, $891,240; Mr. LeFevre: 19,500 shares, $868,959; Mr. Morrison: 11,400 shares, $508,007; Mr. Koch: 5,800
	shares, $258,460; and Mr. Reinhart 1,000 shares, $44,562. The restricted stock granted in May 1998 (Mr. LeFevre 2,400 shares; Mr. Morrison 1,700 shares and Mr. Koch 1,500 shares) will vest on May 12, 2004 or any time after May 11, 2000 if for a 10
	consecutive trading day period the closing price of Liberty Financial common stock exceeds $54.45. The restricted stock granted in October 1998 (Mr. LeFevre 5,000 shares) will vest on October 23, 2004 or any time after October 22, 2000 if for a 10
	consecutive trading day period the closing price of Liberty Financial common stock exceeds $35.60. The stock granted to Mr. Polkinghorn on May 5, 1999 (11,500 shares) will vest on May 5, 2005 or any time after May 4, 2001 if for a 10 consecutive trading
	day period the closing price of Liberty Financial Common Stock exceeds $33.95. The restricted stock granted on May 11, 1999 (Mr. LeFevre 4,600 shares, Mr. Morrison 3,700 shares, and Mr. Koch 1,800 shares) will vest on May 11, 2005 or any time after May
	10, 2001 if for a 10 consecutive day trading period the closing price of Liberty Financial Company Common Stock exceeds $35.96. The restricted stock granted on May 9, 2000 (Mr. Polkinghorn 4,000 shares, Mr. LeFevre 4,500 shares, Mr. Morrison 4,500 shares,
	and Mr. Koch 2,500 shares) will vest on May 9, 2006 or any time after May 8, 2002 if for a 10 consecutive trading day period the closing price of Liberty Financial common stock exceeds $26.35. Holders of restricted stock are entitled to vote their
	restricted shares and retain all dividends which may be paid with respect to such shares. In general, in the event of termination of employment, restricted shares are forfeited by the holders and revert to Liberty Financial. The closing price of the

	Amounts represent hypothetical gains that could be achieved for the respective options if such options are not exercised until the end of the option term. These gains are based on assumed rates of stock price
	appreciation of 5% and 10% in accordance with applicable SEC regulations, compounded annually from the dates the options were granted until their expiration dates and, therefore, are not intended to forecast possible future appreciation in the Common
	Stock. This table does not take into account changes in the price of the Common Stock after the date of grant.

	(1) The value of unexercised in-the-money options is calculated by multiplying the number of underlying shares by the difference between the closing price of the Liberty Financial Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange at the end
	of 2000 ($44.562) and the option exercise price of those shares. These values have not been realized. The closing price of the Liberty Financial Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on March 16, 2001 was $44.25.





	Certain Additional Information Regarding Executive Officer Compensation




	Defined Benefit Retirement Programs.

	Each of the executive officers in the above summary compensation table participates in Liberty Financial's Pension Plan and Keyport's Supplemental Pension Plan (collectively, the "Pension
	Plans"). The following table shows the estimated annual pension benefits payable upon retirement for the specified compensation and years of service classification under the Pension Plans.

	Benefits under the Pension Plans are based on an employee's average pay for the five highest consecutive years during the last ten years of employment, the employee's estimated social security retirement benefit and years of credited
	service with Keyport. The current average compensation covered by the Pension Plans for each participating executive officer in the above summary compensation table is as follows: Mr. Polkinghorn, $782,980; Mr. LeFevre, $584,083; Mr. Reinhart, $364,967;
	Mr. Morrison, $380,284; and Mr. Koch, $387,600. For purposes of determining benefits payable upon retirement under the Pension Plans, compensation includes base salary and annual bonus. Benefits are payable in the form of a single-life annuity providing
	for monthly payments. Actuarially equivalent methods of payment may be elected by the recipient. As of December 31, 2000, the executive officers named in the above summary compensation table had the following full credited years of service under the
	Pension Plans: Mr. Polkinghorn, 1 year; Mr. LeFevre, 21 years; Mr. Reinhart, 16 years; Mr. Morrison, 10 years; and Mr. Koch, 3 years. Mr. Polkinghorn and Mr. Koch are not yet vested under the Pension Plan.



	Change of Control Provisions of 1990 Stock Option Plan

	. Liberty Financial's 1990 Stock Option Plan, as amended (the "1990 Plan"), provided for the grant of options to officers and other key employees of Liberty Financial for the
	purchase of shares of common stock. As of March 16

	,

	2001, options issued and outstanding under the 1990 Plan included 12,872 shares held by Mr. LeFevre (all of which were vested) and 12,750 shares held by Mr. Reinhart (all of which were vested). No additional options will be granted under the 1990
	Plan. Upon a change of control of Liberty Financial (defined as the transfer of 50% or more of the equity ownership of Liberty Financial other than solely pursuant to a public offering in which securities are issued for cash), Liberty Financial's
	Compensation and Stock Option Plan committee may, in its discretion, elect to cancel all outstanding options by paying the holders thereof an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the Common Stock and the exercise price of such
	options.



	Compensation of Directors.

	Directors of Keyport who are also employees receive no compensation in addition to their compensation as employees of Keyport. The two outside directors (Lippitt and Nyman) receive $2,000 per quarter,
	plus $500 for each meeting of the Board of Directors and $200 for each Audit Committee meeting that they attend. Three meetings of the Board of Directors and two meetings of the Audit Committee are scheduled annually.





	PROPERTIES



	As of December 31, 2000, we maintained our executive, administrative and sales offices in leased facilities. We lease approximately 96,500 square feet in two facilities in downtown Boston pursuant to leases which expire in 2008. We
	also lease approximately 19,800 square feet in a single facility in Lincoln, Rhode Island pursuant to a lease that expires in 2007. We sub-lease approximately 600 square feet from Independent Financial Marketing Group in Purchase, New York under a lease
	which expires in 2007.





	LEGAL PROCEEDINGS



	We are, from time to time, involved in litigation incidental to our business. In our opinion, the resolution of such litigation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.





	EXPERTS



	Ernst & Young LLP, independent auditors, have audited our consolidated financial statements and schedules at December 31, 2000 and 1999, and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000, as set forth in their report. We've
	included our financial statements and schedules in the prospectus and elsewhere in the registration statement in reliance on Ernst & Young LLP's report, given on their authority as experts in accounting and auditing. Ernst & Young LLP is located
	at 200 Clarendon Street, Boston, Massachusetts.





	LEGAL MATTERS



	Legal matters with respect to our organization, our authority to issue annuity contracts and the validity of the Certificates, as well as matters relating to the Federal securities laws, have been passed upon by Bernard R. Beckerlegge, General
	Counsel. In addition, certain matters relating to the Federal securities laws have been passed upon by Jorden Burt Boros Cicchetti Berenson & Johnson LLP as our Special Counsel.

	Report of Independent Auditors



	Â 


	The Board of Directors


	Keyport Life Insurance Company


	Â 


	We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Keyport Life Insurance Company as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in
	the period ended December 31, 2000. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


	We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
	free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and the significant estimates made by
	management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Keyport Life Insurance Company at December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the consolidated
	results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

	KEYPORT LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY




	Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements



	1.


	Accounting Policies



	Organization


	Keyport Life Insurance Company offers a diversified line of fixed, indexed and variable annuity products designed to serve the growing retirement savings market. These annuity products are sold through a wide-ranging network of
	banks, agents and security dealers throughout the United States.


	The Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Financial Companies, Incorporated ("Liberty Financial"), which is a majority-owned, indirect subsidiary of Liberty Mutual Insurance Company ("Liberty Mutual").



	Principles of Consolidation


	The consolidated financial statements include Keyport Life Insurance Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Independence Life and Annuity Company ("Independence Life"), Keyport Benefit Life Insurance Company ("Keyport
	Benefit"), Liberty Advisory Services Corp. and Keyport Financial Services Corp. (collectively, the "Company").


	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), which vary in certain respects from reporting practices prescribed or
	permitted by state insurance regulatory authorities. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.



	Use of Estimates


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
	from those estimates.



	Investments


	Investments in debt and equity securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value, and aftertax unrealized gains and losses (net of adjustments to deferred policy acquisition costs) are reported as a separate
	component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The cost basis of securities is adjusted for declines in value that are determined to be other than temporary. Realized investment gains and losses are calculated on a first-in, first-out basis,
	net of adjustments for amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.

	1.


	Accounting Policies (continued)


	For the mortgage-backed bond portion of the fixed-maturity investment portfolio, the Company recognizes income using a constant effective yield based on anticipated prepayments over the estimated economic life of the security. When
	actual prepayments differ significantly from anticipated prepayments, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and anticipated future payments, and any resulting adjustment is included in net investment income.


	Mortgage loans are carried at amortized cost. Policy loans are carried at the unpaid principal balances plus accrued interest.



	Partnerships, which are included in other invested assets, are accounted for on either the cost method or equity method. The equity method of accounting is used for all partnerships in which the Company has an ownership interest in
	excess of 3%.


	The net change in unrealized and undistributed gains in private equity limited partnerships primarily represents increases in the fair value of the underlying investments of the private equity limited partnerships that are accounted
	for under the equity method. This change in unrealized and undistributed gains is recorded net of the related amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs of $58.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The net amounts realized, which are
	recognized in investment income, were $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The financial information for these investments is obtained directly from the private equity limited partnerships on a periodic basis. The corresponding amounts in
	1999 and 1998 were insignificant. Partnership investments totaled $439.0 million ($348.7 million excluding the net change in unrealized and undistributed gains in private equity limited partnerships) and $180.7 million at December 31, 2000 and 1999,
	respectively.



	Derivatives


	The Company uses interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage its interest rate risk and call options and futures on the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index ("S&P 500 Index") to hedge its obligations to
	provide returns based upon this index.


	The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements ("swap agreements") and interest rate cap agreements ("cap agreements") to match assets more closely to liabilities. Swap agreements are agreements to exchange with a counterparty
	interest rate payments of differing character (e.g., fixed-rate payments exchanged for variable-rate payments) based on an underlying principal balance (notional principal) to hedge against interest rate changes. The Company currently utilizes swap
	agreements to reduce asset duration and to better match interest rates earned on longer-term fixed-rate assets with interest rates credited to policyholders. The Company also utilizes total return swaps to hedge the value of certain separate account
	liabilities. A total return swap is an agreement to exchange payments based upon an underlying notional balance and changes in variable-rate and total-return indices.


	Â 


	KEYPORT LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY


	Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)


	Â 



	1.


	Accounting Policies (continued)


	Cap agreements are agreements with a counterparty which require the payment of a premium for the right to receive payments for the difference between the cap interest rate and a market interest rate on specified future dates based
	on an underlying principal balance (notional balance) to hedge against rising interest rates.


	Hedge accounting is applied after the Company determines that the items to be hedged expose it to interest rate or price risk, designates the instruments as hedges, and assesses whether the instruments reduce the indicated risks
	through the measurement of changes in the value of the instruments and the items being hedged at both inception and throughout the hedge period. From time to time, interest rate swap agreements, cap agreements and call options are terminated. If the
	terminated position was accounted for as a hedge, realized gains or losses are deferred and amortized over the remaining lives of the hedged assets or liabilities. Conversely, if the terminated position was not accounted for as a hedge, or if the assets
	and liabilities that were hedged no longer exist, the position is "marked to market," and realized gains or losses are immediately recognized in income.


	The net differential to be paid or received on interest rate swap agreements is recognized as a component of net investment income. The net differential to be paid or received on total return swaps is recognized as a component of
	separate account income. Premiums paid for interest rate cap agreements are deferred and amortized into net investment income on a straight-line basis over the terms of the agreements. The unamortized premium is included in other invested assets. Amounts
	earned on interest rate cap agreements are recorded as an adjustment to net investment income. Interest rate swap and cap agreements hedging investments designated as available for sale are adjusted to fair value, with the resulting unrealized gains and
	losses, net of tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Total return swap agreements hedging certain separate account liabilities are adjusted to fair value, with the resulting unrealized gain/loss, net of tax, included in accumulated
	other comprehensive income (loss).


	Premiums paid on call options are amortized into net investment income over the terms of the contracts. The call options are included in other invested assets and are carried at amortized cost plus intrinsic value, if any, of the call
	options as of the valuation date. Changes in intrinsic value of the call options are recorded as an adjustment to interest credited to policyholders. Futures contracts are carried at fair value and require daily cash settlement. Changes in the fair value
	of futures that qualify as hedges are deferred and recognized as an adjustment to the hedged asset or liability. Call options and futures that do not qualify as hedges are carried at fair value; changes in value are immediately recognized in income.



	Fee Income


	Fees from investment advisory services are recognized as revenues when services are provided. Revenues from fixed and variable annuities and single-premium whole life policies include mortality charges, surrender charges, policy
	fees, and contract fees and are recognized when earned.

	1.


	Accounting Policies (continued)



	Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs


	Deferred policy acquisition costs relate to the costs of acquiring new business, which vary with, and are primarily related to, the production of new annuity business. Such acquisition costs include commissions, costs of policy
	issuance, and underwriting and selling expenses. These costs are deferred and amortized in relation to the present value of estimated gross profits from mortality, investment spread and expense margins not exceeding ten years for annuities and 25 years
	for life insurance.


	Deferred policy acquisition costs are adjusted for amounts relating to unrealized gains and losses on available for sale fixed-maturity securities. This adjustment, net of tax, is included with the change in net unrealized investment gains or losses
	that is credited or charged directly to accumulated other comprehensive income. Deferred policy acquisition costs were increased by $43.6 million and $235.7 million at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, relating to this adjustment.



	Intangible Assets


	Intangible assets consist of goodwill arising from business combinations accounted for as a purchase. Amortization is provided on a straight-line basis ranging from ten to 25 years.



	Separate Account Assets and Liabilities


	The assets and liabilities resulting from variable annuities, variable life policies and certain separate institutional accounts are segregated in separate accounts. Separate account assets consist principally of investments in
	mutual funds and fixed maturities and are carried at fair value. Investment income and changes in mutual fund asset values are allocated to the policyholders and, therefore, do not affect the operating results of the Company. The Company earns separate
	account fees for providing administrative services and bearing the mortality risk related to these contracts. The difference between investment income and interest credited on the institutional accounts is reported as separate account fee income.


	As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company also classified $45.7 million and $62.2 million, respectively, of investments in certain mutual funds sponsored by affiliates of the Company as separate account assets.



	Policy Liabilities


	Policy liabilities consist of deposits received plus credited interest, less accumulated policyholder charges, assessments, and withdrawals related to deferred annuities and single-premium whole life policies. Policy benefits that
	are charged to expense include benefit claims incurred in the period in excess of related policy account balances.

	Accounting Policies (continued)



	Income Taxes


	Income taxes have been provided using the liability method in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."


	Effective July 18, 1997, due to changes in ownership of Liberty Financial, the Company is no longer included in the consolidated federal income tax return of Liberty Mutual. The Company will be eligible to file a consolidated federal
	income tax return with Liberty Financial in 2002. In 1998, the Company began filing a consolidated federal income tax return with its life insurance subsidiaries, Independence Life and Keyport Benefit. In 1999, Liberty Advisory Services Corp. ("LASC") and
	Keyport Financial Services Corp. ("KFSC") began filing consolidated federal and state income tax returns.


	The Company and its life insurance subsidiaries have a tax-sharing agreement that allocates income taxes to the Company and its subsidiaries as if each entity were to file separate income tax returns. Tax benefits resulting from losses are paid to the
	extent such losses are utilized in the consolidated income tax return. LASC and KFSC also have a tax-sharing agreement with the same terms as those outlined above.



	Cash Equivalents


	Short-term investments having a maturity of three months or less when purchased are classified as cash equivalents.



	Recent Accounting Pronouncement


	In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." In June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS
	No. 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133." This statement amended SFAS No. 133 to defer its effective date one year to fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. In
	June 2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities" - an amendment of SFAS No. 133. This statement makes certain changes in the hedging provisions of SFAS No. 133 and is effective
	concurrent with SFAS No. 133 (collectively hereafter referred to as the "Statement"). The Statement will require the Company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value
	through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset by the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or
	recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings. Upon adoption, the Company will be required to record a
	cumulative effect adjustment to reflect this accounting change.

	Accounting Policies (continued)


	The Company estimates that the cumulative effect of adopting at January 1, 2001, reported after tax and net of related effects of deferred policy acquisition costs, will decrease net income and stockholder's equity by $55.0
	million. The adoption of the Statement may increase volatility in reported income due to the requirement to mark all derivatives to fair value and the definition of an effective hedging relationship under the Statement as opposed to certain hedges the
	Company believes are effective economic hedges. The Company believes that it will continue to utilize its current risk management philosophy, which includes the use of derivative instruments.



	2. Acquisition


	On January 2, 1998, the Company acquired the common stock of American Benefit Life Insurance Company, renamed Keyport Benefit Life Insurance Company on March 31, 1998, a New York insurance company, for $7.4 million. The acquisition
	was accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, operating results are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. In connection with the acquisition, the Company acquired assets with a fair value of $9.4 million and
	assumed liabilities of $3.2 million. Subsequent to the acquisition, the Company has made additional capital contributions to Keyport Benefit amounting to $57.5 million.

	The interest rate and total return swap agreements expire in 2001 through 2029. The interest rate cap agreement expired in 2000. The S&P 500 call options and futures maturities range from 2001 to 2008.


	At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company had approximately $111.1 million and $128.7 million, respectively, of unamortized premium in call option contracts.


	Fair values for swap and cap agreements are based on current settlement values. The current settlement values are based on quoted market prices and brokerage quotes, which utilize pricing models or formulas using current assumptions.
	Fair values for call options and futures contracts are based on quoted market prices.


	There are risks associated with some of the techniques the Company uses to match its assets and liabilities. The primary risk associated with swap, cap and call option agreements is the risk associated with counterparty nonperformance.
	The Company believes that the counterparties to its swap, cap and call option agreements are financially responsible and that the counterparty risk associated with these transactions is minimal. Futures contracts trade on organized exchanges and,
	therefore, have minimal credit risk.

	5. Income Taxes (continued)


	As of December 31, 2000, the Company had $54.7 million of net unrealized capital losses in its available for sale portfolio. Under federal tax law, utilization of these capital losses, when realized, is limited to use as an offset against past or
	future capital gains. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of December 31, 2000, the $19.1 million deferred tax asset for these unrealized losses has been reduced by a
	valuation allowance of $9.7 million. The Company released $9.4 million of the valuation allowance through income from operations during 2000 due to capital gain income recognized in 2000. As of December 31, 2000, the Company had approximately $3.2 million
	of purchased net operating loss carryforwards (relating to the acquisition of Independence Life). Utilization of these net operating loss carryforwards, which expire through 2006, is limited to $1.5 million per year. The Company believes that it will
	realize the benefit of this item and its remaining deferred tax assets.


	Income taxes paid were $51.5 million in 2000 and $21.5 million in 1998, while income taxes refunded were $7.5 million in 1999.



	6. Retirement Plans


	Keyport employees and certain employees of Liberty Financial are eligible to participate in the Liberty Financial Companies, Inc. Pension Plan (the "Plan"). It is the Company's practice to fund amounts for the Plan sufficient to
	meet the minimum requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Additional amounts are contributed from time to time when deemed appropriate by the Company. Under the Plan, all employees are vested after five years of service.
	Benefits are based on years of service, the employee's average pay for the highest five consecutive years during the last ten years of employment and the employee's estimated social security retirement benefit. The Company also has an unfunded
	nonqualified Supplemental Pension Plan ("Supplemental Plan") collectively with the Plan (the "Plans") to replace benefits lost due to limits imposed on Plan benefits under the Internal Revenue Code. Plan assets consist principally of investments in
	certain mutual funds sponsored by an affiliated company.

	7. Fair Value of Financial Instruments


	The following discussion outlines the methodologies and assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of the Company's financial instruments. The aggregate fair-value amounts presented herein do not necessarily represent
	the underlying value of the Company, and, accordingly, care should be exercised in deriving conclusions about the Company's business or financial condition based on the fair-value information presented herein.


	The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in determining estimated fair value of financial instruments:



	Fixed maturities and equity securities

	: Fair values for fixed-maturity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. For fixed maturities not actively traded, the fair values are determined using values from
	independent pricing services, or, in the case of private placements, are determined by discounting expected future cash flows using a current market rate applicable to the yield, credit quality and maturity of the securities. The fair values for equity
	securities are based on quoted market prices.



	Mortgage loans

	: The fair value of mortgage loans is determined by discounting future cash flows to the present at current market rates, using expected prepayment rates.



	Policy loans

	: The carrying value of policy loans approximates fair value.



	Other invested assets

	: With the exception of call options, the carrying value for assets classified as other invested assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet approximates their fair value. Fair values for call
	options are based on market prices quoted by the counterparty to the respective call option contract.

	Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)



	Â 


	7. Fair Value of Financial Instruments (continued)



	Cash and cash equivalents

	: The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value.



	Separate accounts, assets and liabilities

	: The estimated fair value of assets held in separate accounts is based on quoted market prices. The fair value of liabilities related to separate accounts is the amount payable on
	demand, which includes surrender charges.



	Policy liabilities

	: Deferred annuity contracts are assigned fair value equal to current net surrender value. Annuitized contracts are valued based on the present value of the future cash flows at current pricing rates.


	The fair values and carrying values of the Company's financial instruments are as follows (in thousands):

	9. Statutory Information


	The Company's primary insurance company, Keyport Life Insurance Company, is domiciled in the State of Rhode Island and prepares its statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting principles and practices prescribed or
	permitted by the State of Rhode Island Insurance Department. Statutory surplus and capital and statutory net (loss) income differ from stockholder's equity and net income reported in accordance with GAAP primarily because policy acquisition costs are
	expensed when incurred, policy liabilities are based on different assumptions and income tax expense reflects only taxes paid or currently payable. The Company's statutory surplus and net income (loss) are as follows (in thousands):

	10. Transactions with Affiliated Companies


	The Company reimbursed Liberty Financial and certain affiliates for expenses incurred on its behalf for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998. These reimbursements included corporate, general and administrative expenses,
	corporate overhead, such as executive and legal support, and investment management services. The total amounts reimbursed were $7.5 million, $7.7 million and $7.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. In addition,
	certain affiliated companies distribute the Company's products and were paid $39.4 million, $18.3 million and $10.0 million by the Company for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.


	The Company is contingently liable for certain structured settlement payments being made under single-premium immediate annuities issued by Liberty Life Assurance Company. The Company is also party to guaranty agreements with its
	subsidiaries, Independence Life and Keyport Benefit, whereby it guarantees obligations for certain insurance polices or annuity contracts.


	Dividend payments to Liberty Financial from the Company are governed by insurance laws that restrict the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of the State of Rhode Island Insurance Department. As of
	December 31, 2000, the maximum amount of dividends (based on statutory surplus and statutory net gains from operations) which may be paid by Keyport without such approval was approximately $51.3 million.

	Legal Matters


	The Company is involved at various times in litigation common to its business. In the opinion of management, provisions made for potential losses are adequate, and the resolution of any such litigation is not expected to have a
	material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or its results of operations.



	Regulatory Matters


	Under existing guaranty fund laws in all states, insurers licensed to do business in those states can be assessed for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. The actual amount of such
	assessments will depend upon the final outcome of rehabilitation proceedings and will be paid over several years. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the reserve for such assessments was $6.7 million and $5.9 million, respectively.

	Other


	On November 1, 2000, Liberty Financial announced that it has retained an investment banking firm to review its strategic alternatives, including a possible sale of the Company. To help retain its employees during this strategic
	review, the Company implemented a special compensation plan that provides cash retention bonuses to substantially all employees. The Company recorded a $2.0 million charge in 2000 relating to this plan. The retention bonuses are generally based on
	employees' base salary and/or target incentive compensation amounts, except for sales personnel, where retention bonuses are based on sales. The estimated maximum cost of the retention bonuses, assuming all covered employees remain with the Company, is
	approximately $28.0 million, with fifty percent payable on November 1, 2001 and the remainder payable on April 1, 2002. In the event of a change of control of the Company that occurs prior to November 1, 2001, the payments would be accelerated and the
	retention bonus amount would be reduced, subject to a minimum. The estimated minimum retention bonus is approximately $17.0 million and would be recognized if a change of control occurs as of May 14, 2001. The amount of the retention bonus increases from
	the minimum on May 14, 2001 to the maximum on October 31, 2001. In calculating the 2000 expense of $2.0 million, a turnover rate of 15% was assumed.

	APPENDIX A


	TERM INTEREST ILLUSTRATIONS


	Below are illustrations of how interest is credited to an Interest Account during a ten-year Term and an Indexed Account during a five-year Term. The illustrations also apply to a shorter Term if values for inapplicable years are ignored. We have
	made certain assumptions with respect to the illustrations, as indicated.



	Note

	: the illustrations do not assume any surrender amount during the entire term. A Market Value Adjustment or surrender charge may apply to any such interim surrender. (See "Surrenders"). The hypothetical guaranteed Interest Rate, Guaranteed
	Interest Rate Factors, and Index Increases are illustrative only and are not intended to predict future guaranteed interest rates, rate factors, or future changes in the index. As to Interest Accounts, actual Guaranteed Interest Rates declared for any
	given Term may be more or less than the 6% shown. Likewise, actual Guaranteed Interest Rate Factors declared for Indexed Accounts at any given time may be higher or lower than the factors shown in the illustration, provided that the floor may never be
	less than 0. Moreover, we do not guarantee that the Index will increase during the course of a term or that it will be higher than the Index at the beginning of the Term or at any time during the Term when Index Increases are credited.

	B. Illustration of Index Account



	The Certificate provides that the Index Increase to be credited on each Account Anniversary is the sum of the following two parts:






	(1)





	Part 1 = the proportionate credit for any increase in the Index from its prior highest Account Anniversary value to its value on the current Account Anniversary. The formula for Part 1 is: A x ((C-B)/D) x (E/F) x G






	Â 



	Â 






	(2)





	Part 2 = the proportionate credit for any increase(s) in the Index occurring on a prior Account Anniversary(ies). The formula for Part 2 is: A x ((B-D)/D) x (1/F) x G






	where the values in the formulas are as follows:







	A





	=





	the Participation Rate for the Term





	Â 



	Â 



	Â 






	B





	=





	the highest Index value on all Account Anniversaries, including the Index value at the beginning of the Term, but excluding the value of the Index on the current Account Anniversary. The value of B can never be less than the
	Minimum S&P 500 Index Value nor greater than the Maximum S&P 500 Index Value. The Minimum S&P 500 Index Value and the Maximum S&P 500 Index Value are defined as follows:






	Â 




	Minimum S&P 500 Index Value = [(Floor/Participation Rate for Term) + 1] x [Beginning of Term Index value]






	Â 



	Â 





	Â 




	Maximum S&P 500 Index Value = [(Cap/Participation Rate for Term) + 1] x [Beginning of Term Index value]






	Â 



	Â 



	Â 






	C





	=





	the value of the Index on the current Account Anniversary, not less than B or greater than the Maximum S&P 500 Index Value for the Term





	Â 



	Â 



	Â 






	D





	=





	the Index value at the beginning of the Term





	Â 



	Â 



	Â 






	E





	=





	the number of completed Account Years in the Term





	Â 



	Â 



	Â 






	F





	=





	the total number of Account Years in the Term





	Â 



	Â 



	Â 






	G





	=





	the smaller of the Account Value at the beginning of the term and the Account Value (prior to the crediting of any Index Increases) on any Account Anniversary in the Term, including the current Account Anniversary






	On the first Account Anniversary of any term, substitute D for B in the above formulas.


	If "Death Provisions" provides that the Index Increase is to be recalculated, then: (i) "E" in the formula for Part 1 is equal to "F", and (ii) "(1/F)" in the formula for Part 2 is multiplied by the sum of 1.0 plus the number of Account Years from the
	start of the Account Year of death to the end of the Term.


	Using the assumptions below, we prepared the following three illustrations using different assumptions as to changes in the index value during the course of the term. Note: these assumptions and illustrations are not and are not intended as
	predictions of changes in the Index during the course of any Term. The Index may rise or fall during the course of a Term, and at the end of a Term the Index value may be higher or lower than at the beginning of the term. We are not making any
	predictions, representations, or guarantees as to future changes in the Index. These values are based on the assumption that no partial surrenders are made.

	MARKET VALUE ADJUSTMENT FORMULA AND ILLUSTRATIONS;


	SURRENDER CHARGE CALCULATIONS


	Market Value Adjustment Formula



	The applicable surrender or transfer value is multiplied by the Market Value Adjustment Factor to arrive at the Market Value Adjustment. The formula that is used to determine the Market Value Adjustment factor is: [(1+a)/(1+b)](n/12) - 1


	where the values in the formula are as follows:







	a





	=





	the Treasury Rate for the Term of the Account from which the surrender or transfer amount is being taken;





	Â 



	Â 



	Â 






	b





	=





	the Treasury Rate for a period equal to the time remaining (rounded up to the next whole number of Account Years) to the expiration of the Term for the Account from which the surrender or transfer amount is being taken; and





	Â 



	Â 



	Â 






	n





	=





	the number of complete Account Months remaining before the expiration of the Term for the Account from which the surrender or transfer amount is being taken, multiplied by the applicable Scaling Factor from the Certificate
	Schedule for the Term of the Account from which the amount is being taken, if the Account is an Indexed Account. The first Account Month begins on the day that the Term begins and each subsequent Account Month begins on the same day one month later.







	The Treasury Rate for an Account is the interest rate in the Treasury Constant Maturity Series, as published by the Federal Reserve Board, for a maturity equal to the number of years specified in "a" and "b" above. Weekly
	Series are published at the beginning of the following week. To determine "a", we use the weekly Series first published on or after the most recent Determination Date (which occurs on or before the first day of the Account's current Term), except that if
	the first day is the same as the Determination Date or the date of publication, or any date in between, we instead use the weekly Series first published after the prior Determination Date. To determine "b", we use the weekly Series first published on or
	after the most recent Determination Date (which occurs on or before the date on which the Market Value Adjustment Factor is calculated), except that if the calculation date is the same as the Determination Date or the date of publication, or any date in
	between, we instead use the weekly Series first published after the prior Determination Date. The Determination Dates are the last business days prior to the first and fifteenth days of each month.


	If the number of years specified in "a" or "b" does not equal a maturity in the Treasury Constant Maturity Series, the Treasury Rate will be determined by straight line interpolation between the interest rate for the next highest and next lowest
	maturities.



	Illustrations and Surrender Charge Calculations



	Illustration 1

	:


	Assume that you purchased a Certificate for $10,000 and allocated your interest to an Interest Account with a five-year Term and a Guaranteed Interest Rate of 6%. Exactly two years later, your Account was surrendered when the surrender charge was
	3%. There had been no prior surrenders and the interest earned in the previous twelve months is equal to $636 ($11,236 - $10,600). Therefore, the surrender charge and the Market Value Adjustment do not apply to $636 of the Interest Account Value. At the
	beginning of the Term, the Treasury Rate for 5-year Treasury Notes was 7% and, at the time of the surrender, the Treasury Rate for 3-year Treasury Notes was 4.5%.




	According to the Certificate, the Market Value Adjustment is


	(A - Free Withdrawal Amount) x B = C


	where:







	A

	Â 




	=





	.0735






	Therefore,









	C





	=





	(A - 1,236) x B

	$779.10 is the Market Value Adjustment, which would be added to the Account Value in determining the Certificate Withdrawal Value.







	The Surrender Charge is equal to I x (A - Free Withdrawal Amount), where







	A





	=





	the surrendered amount = $11,236, and






	Â 



	Â 



	Â 






	I





	=





	the Surrender Charge Percentage. Here, I = 3%.








	Therefore,







	The Surrender Charge





	=





	.03 x ($11,236 - 636)






	Â 




	=





	.03 x $10,600

	The Certificate Value

	[((.9 x $10,000 x 1.03) + 330) x 1.03] + 348

	The Adjusted Certificate Value





	=





	$10,236.00 x [($11,236.00 + $779.10) / 11,236.00]






	Â 




	=





	$10,945.76






	Under the Certificate, the Certificate Withdrawal Value is equal to the greater of (1) the amount surrendered, less any Surrender Charge plus any Market Value Adjustment or (2) the Adjusted Certificate Value. Here, the
	Certificate Withdrawal Value would be the greater of ($11,236.00 - $318.00 + $779.10 = $11,697.10) or $10,945.76. Therefore, the Certificate Withdrawal Value is equal to $11,697.10.




	Illustration 2

	:


	Given the same circumstances as in Illustration 1, but using a 3-year Treasury Rate of 7.5% instead of 4.5% at the time of surrender, the Market Value Adjustment is computed as follows:







	B





	=





	[(1+.07)/(1+.075)](36/12) - 1






	Â 




	=





	[(1+.07)/(1+.075)]3 - 1






	Â 




	=





	-.0139






	Therefore,









	C





	=





	(A - 636) x B






	Â 




	=





	($11,236 - 636) x -.0139






	Â 




	=





	Negative $147.34 is the Market Value Adjustment, which would be subtracted from the Account Value in determining the Certificate Withdrawal Value.







	As described in the previous example, the Surrender Charge would equal $318.00.







	The Adjusted Certificate Value





	=





	$10,236.00 x [($11,236.00 - $147.34) / $11,236.00]






	Â 




	=





	$10,101.77






	Accordingly, the Certificate Withdrawal Value would be the greater of ($11,236.00 - $318.00 - $147.34 = $10,770.66) or $10,101.77. Therefore, the Certificate Withdrawal Value is equal to $10,770.66.




	Illustration 3

	:


	Given the same circumstances as in Illustration 2, but assuming (i) an Indexed Account instead of an Interest Account with an Account Value of $11,236, (ii) Index Increases credited in the prior year equal to $1,236.00, and (iii) a scaling factor
	("k") of .9, the Market Value Adjustment is computed as follows:







	B





	=





	[(1+.07)/(1+.075)]((36 x k)/12) - 1






	Â 




	=





	[(1+.07)/(1+.075)]((36 x 9)/12) - 1






	Â 




	=





	[(1+.07)/(1+.075)](2.7) - 1






	Â 




	=





	-.0125






	Therefore,









	C





	=





	(A - 1,236) x B






	Â 




	=





	($11,236 - 1,236) x -.0125






	Â 




	=





	Negative $125.00 is the Market Value Adjustment, which would be subtracted from the Account Value in determining the Certificate Withdrawal Value.







	As described in the previous example, the Surrender Charge would equal $300.00.









	The Certificate Value





	=





	[((.9 x $10,000 x 1.03) + 0) x 1.03] + 687.90






	Â 




	=





	$10,236.00






	Â 



	Â 



	Â 






	The Adjusted Certificate Value





	=





	$10,236.00 x [($11,236.00 - $125.00) / $11,236.00]







	Â 




	=





	$10,122.12






	Accordingly, the Certificate Withdrawal Value would be the greater of ($11,236.00 - $300.00 - $125.00 = $10,811.00) or $10,122.12. Therefore, the Certificate Withdrawal Value is equal to $10,811.00.
