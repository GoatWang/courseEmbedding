Marc E. Rothman, Former Chief Financial Officer Of Motorola Mobility, Inc., Joins VeriFone As Executive Vice President And Chief Financial Officer, Succeeding Robert Dykes Who Is Retiring. (Photo: Business Wire)






Business Wire




Feb 4, 2013 8:00 AM EST













 




























































  VeriFone Systems, Inc. (NYSE: PAY), today announced the appointment of Marc E. Rothman, former chief financial officer of Motorola Mobility, Inc., to executive vice president and chief financial officer, and Jay Parsons to senior vice president, digital media and taxi operations, effective today. Additionally, VeriFone announced the retirements of Chief Financial Officer Robert Dykes, 63, and Vice Chairman Elmore (Bud) Waller, 63. Following a transition of responsibilities, both executives will retire effective February 28, 2013.   Marc E. Rothman, former chief financial officer of Motorola Mobility, Inc., joins VeriFone as executive vice president and chief financial officer, succeeding Robert Dykes who is retiring. (Photo: Business Wire)   “Marc Rothman's experience leading financial strategy and governance, along with his global experience helping to build operations, particularly in emerging markets as both the CFO of Motorola Mobility and in senior finance roles within Motorola, Inc., aligns extremely well with VeriFone’s goals,” said VeriFone Chief Executive Officer Douglas G. Bergeron.  Rothman, 48, joined Motorola, Inc., through the acquisition of General Instrument in 2000, and eventually rose to become worldwide controller of the former Motorola, Inc. He oversaw all financial activities of Motorola Mobility and led the company’s spin-off transaction from its former parent and eventual sale.  Bob Dykes welcomed Rothman as his successor, saying, “My time at VeriFone during expansion of electronic payments into new markets and geographies has been gratifying and exciting. Marc is a perfect choice to oversee the company’s financial and operational performance.”  Parsons, 47, joined VeriFone in September of 2011 and has played an integral role in driving the successful development of VeriFone's interactive digital solutions platform for the petroleum and retail businesses. He previously served 13 years with Catalina Marketing in executive management roles, including executive vice president of its U.S. packaged goods business unit helping manufacturer and retail brands deliver unprecedented performance, and as president of Catalina’s global healthcare business.

From 1995 to 2000, Mr. Rothman served in a number of leadership finance roles at General Instrument, which developed integrated and interactive broadband access solutions, including its Vice President and Corporate Controller.
