AR Capital, the real estate investment company built by Nicholas S. Schorsch and William M. Kahane, said Monday that it would stop creating new investment products and close existing ones to new investors to focus on managing the $19 billion it has in current investments.The company cited “regulatory and market uncertainty” that was affecting its ability to raise investor money.The New York-based firm, once called American Realty Capital, is one of the biggest sponsors of nontraded real estate investment trusts, but it is in the center of a maelstrom.Its most recent troubles began with the collapse a week ago of a $378 million deal to sell a 60 percent stake of a newly formed company holding the $19 billion of assets to the private equity giant Apollo Global Management.

Then on Thursday, Massachusetts’s securities regulator accused an affiliate of the firm — Realty Capital Securities — of faking proxy votes for a September special meeting of shareholders in one of AR Capital’s sponsored investment vehicles. Continue reading the main story

Realty Capital Securities is part of RCS Capital, a publicly traded broker that said last week it was facing possible delisting by the New York Stock Exchange. Its share price has slumped since an accounting scandal at one of Mr. Schorsch’s investment vehicles forced him to resign from the management of American Realty Capital Properties and boards of affiliated entities last year.In its administrative complaint on Thursday, the Massachusetts securities division said the faked votes were for a shareholder meeting that was a prerequisite to having the deal with Apollo move forward.AR Capital said on Monday that Realty Capital Securities would discontinue proxy activities for AR Capital-sponsored vehicles because of the Massachusetts investigation.

AR Capital’s woes come as regulators take a closer look at how nontraded REITs are sold to investors. Nontraded REITs, which invest in various types of real estate, are typically sold through advisers. Unlike publicly traded REITs, nontraded REITs are difficult to sell or liquidate.“There were serious problems with their lack of transparency and the interrelationship with affiliated companies,” said Michael Kitces, the director of financial planning at Pinnacle Advisory Group in Columbia, Md.In September, the broker LPL Financial agreed to pay $1.4 million in a settlement with state regulators regarding its sales practices for nontraded REITs.Regulators have proposed new fiduciary standards for advisers and mandated new disclosures on fees and costs that cut into investors’ principal. AR Capital seems to be saying, Mr. Kitces said, “now that the market is requiring transparency, we don’t think we can sell these any more.”Mr. Kahane, AR Capital’s co-founder, said in a statement on Monday regarding the regulatory changes, “Until there is greater clarity, we have decided to sit this one out.”AR Capital said it would stop taking new money at year end for Business Development Corporation of America II, ARC Healthcare Trust III, New York City REIT II, ARC Hospitality Trust and ARC Global Trust II.

Capitol Records
Profile:


Please note, many Capitol Records issues also carry an EMI logo. This is not a label and EMI should not be added as a label; it instead indicates that Capitol was part of the EMI Group. For LPs the label design may help identify the era of release. See vinylbeat.com & friktech.com links below.  The Capitol Records, Inc. company was founded by the songwriters Johnny Mercer, Buddy DeSylva and record store owner Glenn Wallichs on April 9, 1942 in Hollywood, California. By 1946 Capitol had sold 42 million records and was established as one of the Big Six studios. In 1955, the British company Electric & Musical Industries Ltd. (EMI) acquired Capitol Records, Inc for $8.5 million. In 1979, Capitol was made part of the EMI Music "Worldwide division." In 2001, EMI Group Plc merged Capitol Records label with the Priority Records label. In September 2012 Capitol Records was purchased by Vivendi S.A. (owner of the Universal Music Group) Label Code: LC 0148 / LC 00148

Am nearly out of ink so I am reordering and really like the fact that this order is costing less than my first order due to a % off and free shipping. Your prices are much lower than the big box stores. I am on Social Security and this discount  really helps.Thank You!

A bit more definition would be helpful                                 Overall Rating:               Would Shop Here Again:               Likelihood To Recommend:   Full ratings for this review »                Paradigmpi                           Jul 27, 2017            I really like your inks - have used your brother inks for about 10 years and have found them EXCELLENT.

Jul 27, 2017  I did not realize how bad my first replacements were when I ordered a 2nd set. I now know they are not very good or my first order was ok. I really do not know. I learned a  lesson.
