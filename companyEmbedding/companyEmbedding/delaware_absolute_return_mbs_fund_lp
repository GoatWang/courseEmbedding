    New focus on mortgage-backed securities despite unsettled policy

By 
    Ion Dan
        

    April 13, 2017

With rising interest rates, mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are coming back into the spotlight. In this commentary paper, New focus on mortgage-backed securities despite unsettled policy, portfolio manager Ion Dan notes that an uncertain policy environment, as well as reform of government-sponsored entities looming on the horizon, make the area of MBS potentially of special interest to investors.

The views expressed represent the Manager's assessment of the market environment as of April 2017 and should not be considered a recommendation to buy, hold, or sell any security, and should not be relied on as research or investment advice. Views are subject to change without notice and may not reflect the Manager's views.
IMPORTANT RISK CONSIDERATIONS
Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.

Past performance does not guarantee future results.
Fixed income securities and bond funds can lose value, and investors can lose principal, as interest rates rise. They also may be affected by economic conditions that hinder an issuer’s ability to make interest and principal payments on its debt. Fixed income securities and bond funds may also be subject to prepayment risk, the risk that the principal of a fixed income security that is held by the Funds may be prepaid prior to maturity, potentially forcing the Funds to reinvest that money at a lower interest rate.

    With little liquidity, volatility may linger

By 
    Ion Dan
        

    July 23, 2015



    In December 2014 we wrote about
    our concerns
our concerns
our concerns
    around increasing liquidity risk within the fixed income markets.  Here we build on those comments, with a discussion of macro and micro liquidity, and a look at current conditions like the growing micro-liquidity stress in the U.S. Treasury market — the perceived safe haven for all investors.

The state of macro liquidity

                    Macro liquidity — or global aggregate monetary conditions — is the playing field of central banks.  Macro liquidity is the result not only of the U.S. Federal Reserve's actions, but the actions of central banks around the world. When looking at the macro liquidity environment, it is important to consider not just major central banks' current monetary policies, but also to assess what the most likely changes to those positions will be in the coming 6–12 months.
                

                    From this point of view, the future for macro liquidity poses some troubles for investors. The Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are guiding toward a possible step back in monetary accommodation, while the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank are stepping up balance sheet expansion.

            Implications for market liquidity
            



Implications for market liquidity

                    In April 2015, the International Monetary Fund was warning investors about the implications for market liquidity* as a result of changes in macro liquidity.
                

"As U.S. monetary policy normalizes, the temporary boost to market liquidity provided by monetary accommodation will ebb, revealing a changed capital market landscape. Without the buoyant liquidity provided by the Fed, the liquidity-inhibiting impact of regulatory changes, industry consolidation, and other secular factors will likely become more pronounced. Markets could be increasingly susceptible to episodes in which liquidity suddenly vanishes and volatility spikes. Two recent price disruptions — the Oct. 15, 2014, volatility in U.S. Treasurys and the Jan. 15, 2015, surge in the Swiss franc — involved an initial shock that was likely amplified by market makers’ withdrawal of liquidity support. Many of the factors responsible for lower market liquidity also appear to be exacerbating risk-on/risk-off market dynamics and increasing cross-asset correlations during times of market stress. These phenomena suggest that low market liquidity may act as a powerful amplifier of financial stability risks."


                    To the aforementioned episodes, we can now add the recent repricing in German bunds in terms of magnitude, velocity, and time frame.  Yields rose from 0.07% on April 20 to 0.98% on June 10, quite an impressive move in just 37 trading sessions (data: Bloomberg).
                


                        *Market liquidity refers to the liquidity conditions in a single market, and how easily one can buy and sell assets in that market.  Generally, the less liquidity, the more buying and selling creates volatility in a single market.

Data: Bloomberg.



                German bunds, long considered a safe haven, experienced a notable drop in prices as investors became increasingly optimistic about economies around the world.  The resulting yield expansion happened quickly.  It was another example of limited liquidity having an outsized influence during a change in market sentiment.
            

            With the deterioration in U.S. Treasury market depth, micro liquidity concerns arise
            




                With the deterioration in U.S. Treasury market depth, micro liquidity concerns arise
                

                    Market liquidity also exists at the security level, and was the focus of concern, in our December
                    commentarycommentarycommentary.  As dealer inventories have diminished in most fixed income sectors, it has become much more challenging to buy and sell large blocks of securities.  This is now starting to impact U.S. Treasurys, the bastion of liquidity among all fixed income markets.
                

                    As risk appetites vacillate, Treasurys have become prone to significant price moves (gaps) in both directions — either when risk-on positions are unwound, or when investors want to reduce interest rate exposure.  As such, volatility in Treasurys has been increasing (measured as the 52-week rolling standard deviation/average of 10-year Treasury yields).
                

Rates volatility has picked up



Rates volatility has picked up

                    As the uncertainty of the Fed rate hike draws nearer, implied volatility is perking up, not only in Treasurys but also in currencies (as represented by the Deutsche Bank Currency Volatility Index or CVIX). Equity volatility (represented by the CBOE Volatility Index® or VIX) has been more contained.
                

                    Relative to fixed income markets, equity markets are experiencing less volatility.  Uncertainty about rate hikes is one factor, but constrained liquidity within fixed income markets has also become influential.

                            One concern here is that volatility appears to be contagious, bleeding into multiple fixed income sectors. Volatility is challenging enough when it lingers within a contained space; it poses an even higher hurdle when it spreads to other corners of the markets.
                        



Table created from Bloomberg and Barclays monthly data.


Is there a liquidity issue emerging in Treasurys?



Is there a liquidity issue emerging in Treasurys?

                    Market depth is shown below for 10-year Treasurys. Note the collapse in market depth during the financial crisis in 2008. Importantly, however, the frequency of these drops has increased significantly since 2009.  Historically, market depth has ebbed and flowed with volatility. Surging volatility coincides with less depth, whereas stable markets tend to be deeper.

Treasury trading volume remains robust



Treasury trading volume remains robust

                    Daily trading volumes of Treasurys remain robust at about $500 billion a day and the relative trading volume versus non-Treasury debt seems healthy.
                

                    Non-Treasurys include: agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate debt, municipal bonds, asset-backed securities, agency debt.

Yet liquidity has grown tighter



Yet liquidity has grown tighter

                    However, average daily trading volumes adjusted by gross issuance, amount outstanding, and the level of MOVE further suggest that Treasury price discovery and liquidity are under pressure relative to the size of the market and implied volatility.

Market implications



Market implications

                    U.S. Treasurys have been the cornerstone of the financial system, as the safety asset of choice due to the depth of the market and its liquidity advantage.  If that is falling due to market positioning and regulation, investors might demand a higher risk premium as compensation, which will filter through to other asset classes, potentially creating heightened volatility across the broader fixed income landscape.
                

                    This tendency toward higher volatility is troubling in and of itself, but we think it could be amplified as we move along in 2015.  This is because markets will contend with additional volatility drivers that include:
                

continued mixed signals in U.S. economic data
increased concerns about political risks around the world

                        uncertainty about the timing of the Fed's tightening of credit.
                    


                    Taken together, we believe these circumstances will put a premium on managing risk as we address the challenges to come.  The specter of higher volatility will be folded into every step of our research process, as we seek to position our portfolios to accommodate the increased possibility of market dislocations.

IMPORTANT RISK CONSIDERATIONS
Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal.

Past performance does not guarantee future results.
Fixed income securities and bond funds can lose value, and investors can lose principal, as interest rates rise. They also may be affected by economic conditions that hinder an issuer’s ability to make interest and principal payments on its debt.
Bond funds may also be subject to prepayment risk, the risk that the principal of a fixed income security that is held by the Fund may be prepaid prior to maturity, potentially forcing the Fund to reinvest that money at a lower interest rate.

Overview






Fund Overview
A high-quality core bond investment
PIMCO Mortgage-Backed Securities Fund offers attractive, actively managed risk-adjusted return potential from mortgage-backed securities (MBS) – one of the largest and most liquid fixed income sectors.
Why Invest In This Fund
A solid core holding
With its high quality, intermediate-term portfolio, this fund can be a fundamental part of most any bond allocation. Because MBS have a low correlation (tendency to move in lockstep) with stocks, they may also provide important diversification benefits. Diversification does not protect against loss.
Attractive return potential vs. Treasuries
Agency MBS offer high credit quality and similar levels of interest rate risk to U.S. Treasuries and U.S. agency debentures. At the same time, they typically yield more than Treasuries and are prone to mispricing, which can create return-enhancing opportunities.
30 years of mortgage experience
The fund benefits from PIMCO’s long experience in the mortgage sector and proven investment process. Its managers seek to add value through numerous strategies, including relative value trading and interest rate strategies and the use of proprietary analytics to uncover undervalued securities and manage risk.
Our Expertise
The fund is managed by Michael Cudzil and Daniel Hyman, mortgage specialists who both have over a decade of experience in the sector. The team draws on PIMCO’s robust mortgage research capabilities, which help identify security-specific risks as well as the effect of mortgage performance on other sectors and the broader economy.


PRIMARY BENCHMARK
Bloomberg Barclays U.S. MBS Fixed Rate Index

It is not possible to invest directly in an unmanaged index.

Performance quoted does not reflect any sales charges, if applicable, and performance would be lower if it did.


Differences in the Fund’s performance versus the index and related attribution information with respect to particular categories of securities or individual positions may be attributable, in part, to differences in the pricing methodologies used by the Fund and the index.
        


No assurance is being made that any fund that may have experienced high or unusual performance for one or more periods will continue to experience such performance. High performance is defined as an unusual growth in alpha between reporting periods or total return when measured to historical returns. Unusual performance is defined as an unusual change in performance (+/-) between reporting periods and the portfolio experienced unusual performance for one or more periods.

             Daily YTD return is from the most recent calendar year end.
        

             Growth of $10,000 is calculated at NAV and assumes that all dividend and capital gain distributions were reinvested. It does not take into account sales charges or the effect of taxes. Results are not indicative of future performance.
        

Past performance is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results. For funds with at least a 3-yr history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees) with an emphasis on downward variations and consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating is a weighted average of the performance figures for its 3-, 5- and 10-yr (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Morningstar, Inc.® 2017. All rights reserved. The information contained herein; (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its affiliates; (2) may not be copied or distributed; (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Hollow stars represent a class of shares with inception dates that is different than the inception date of the fund. For the period prior to the inception date of these shares, performance information is based on the performance of the fund’s Institutional Class shares, adjusted to reflect the actual distribution and/or service (12b-1) fees and other expenses paid by the newer share class.
        

             The Lipper Category returns and rankings are calculated by Lipper Inc., a Reuters Company, which is a nationally recognized organization that compares the performance of mutual funds with similar investment objectives. The Category returns represent the average performance of included funds, while rankings compare an individual fund's returns to those of the other funds in its category. Both are based on total return performance, with capital gains and dividends reinvested, with annual operating expenses deducted, but without including front- or back-end sales charges. Rankings begin with the actual share class inception. Rankings are relative to a peer group and do not necessarily mean that the fund had high total returns.

Portfolio Composition Footnotes & Disclosures


disclosures
5The Sharpe Ratio measures the risk-adjusted performance. The risk-free rate is subtracted from the rate of return for a portfolio and the result is divided by the standard deviation of the portfolio returns.
6The information ratio is defined as the portfolio's excess return per unit of risk, or tracking error. For example, an information ratio of 1 means that a portfolio manager generates 100 basis points, or one percent of excess return for every 100 basis points of risk taken.
7Tracking error, a measure of risk, is defined as the standard deviation of the portfolio's excess return vs. the benchmark expressed in percent.
8May include nominal and inflation-protected Treasuries, Treasury futures and options, agencies, FDIC-guaranteed and government-guaranteed corporate securities, and interest rate swaps.
9May include municipals, convertibles, preferreds, and yankee bonds.
10Net Other Short Duration Instruments includes securities and other instruments (except instruments tied to emerging markets by country of risk) with an effective duration less than one year and rated investment grade or higher or, if unrated, determined by PIMCO to be of comparable quality, commingled liquidity funds, uninvested cash, interest receivables, net unsettled trades, broker money, short duration derivatives (for example Eurodollar futures) and derivatives offsets. With respect to certain categories of short duration securities, the Adviser reserves the discretion to require a minimum credit rating higher than investment grade for inclusion in this category. Derivatives Offsets includes offsets associated with investments in futures, swaps and other derivatives. Such offsets may be taken at the notional value of the derivative position which in certain instances may exceed the actual amount owed on such positions.

             Portfolio information in the charts is based on the fund's net assets. These percentages may differ from those used for the fund's compliance calculations, including the fund's prospectus, regulatory, and other investment limitations and policies, which may be based on total assets of the fund or other measurements, may include or exclude various categories of investments from those covered in the portfolio allocation categories shown in this report, and may be based on different classifications and measurements of the fund’s investments and other criteria.
        

             References to specific sectors, securities or issuers are for illustrative purposes only. All holdings are subject to change daily. All share classes have the same portfolio but different expenses.
        

             Duration is a measure of a portfolio’s price sensitivity expressed in years. Effective duration is the duration for a bond with an embedded option when the value is calculated to include the expected change in cash flow caused by the option as interest rates change.

Disclosures 




Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the funds carefully before investing. This and other information are contained in the fund’s prospectus and summary prospectus, if available, which may be obtained by contacting your investment professional or PIMCO representative.   Please read them carefully before you invest or send money.


A word about risk:

 
Investing in the bond market is subject to risks, including market, interest rate, issuer, credit, inflation risk, and liquidity risk. The value of most bonds and bond strategies are impacted by changes in interest rates. Bonds and bond strategies with longer durations tend to be more sensitive and volatile than those with shorter durations; bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise, and the current low interest rate environment increases this risk. Current reductions in bond counterparty capacity may contribute to decreased market liquidity and increased price volatility. Bond investments may be worth more or less than the original cost when redeemed. Investing in foreign denominated and/or domiciled securities may involve heightened risk due to currency fluctuations, and economic and political risks, which may be enhanced in emerging markets.  Mortgage and asset-backed securities may be sensitive to changes in interest rates, subject to early repayment risk, and their value may fluctuate in response to the market’s perception of issuer creditworthiness; while generally supported by some form of government or private guarantee there is no assurance that private guarantors will meet their obligations. Equities may decline in value due to both real and perceived general market, economic, and industry conditions. Derivatives may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity, interest rate, market, credit, management and the risk that a position could not be closed when most advantageous. Investing in derivatives could lose more than the amount invested.  Diversification does not ensure against loss.

        

             Investments made by a Fund and the results achieved by a Fund are not expected to be the same as those made by any other PIMCO-advised Fund, including those with a similar name, investment objective or policies.  A new or smaller Fund’s performance may not represent how the Fund is expected to or may perform in the long-term.  New Funds have limited operating histories for investors to evaluate and new and smaller Funds may not attract sufficient assets to achieve investment and trading efficiencies.  A Fund may be forced to sell a comparatively large portion of its portfolio to meet significant shareholder redemptions for cash, or hold a comparatively large portion of its portfolio in cash due to significant share purchases for cash, in each case when the Fund otherwise would not seek to do so, which may adversely affect performance.
