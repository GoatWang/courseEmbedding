        LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORENEW YORK — AT&T's $49 billion acquisition of DirecTV was formally approved Friday.The merger puts AT&T's John Stankey in a new role as CEO of AT&T Entertainment & Internet Services, where he will run both DIRECTV and AT&T's home solutions operations. Stankey talked to USA TODAY tech columnist Edward C. Baig about what the deal means for AT&T and for consumers.Comments were edited for space and clarity.USA TODAY: What is your vision for the new company?Stankey: The simple vision is we want customers to take their premium entertainment experience and enjoy it anywhere. Our job as a company that provides connectivity, whether it's fixed or mobile, is to make sure that they have that portability.Nobody else has the kind of toolset (and) breath that we now have--scaled content, world class mobile network, broadband network, the technical compatibilities to take all that out over an IP infrastructure. That's the big strategic thrust.And then there's the basic blocking and tackling thrust (to take) two big companies and get the benefits of being able to leverage product distribution. Remove redundancies between the two businesses and make it more cost efficient and more effective. That ultimately generates more cash. And when that cash is generated it will allow us to plow it back into building fiber and broadband.USA TODAY: Will there be changes in branding?Stankey: You'll see us of course start to move to make sure that people know that DirecTV is part of the AT&T family. And you'll see us evolving the branding over time. Our goal is to make sure that customers think about their entertainment with their connectivity.USA TODAY: Back when deal was announced AT&T said it could take 12 to 18 months for new robust wireless offerings? Is that still the case?Stankey: There's good news and bad news. The bad news is that it took a long time to get this (merger) thing approved, probably longer than it should. The good news is that it gives you a little time to think about what you want to do. And you should probably expect weeks (from now) you're going to start to see things in the market that will represent the integration and togetherness of those products. I'm not going to tell you today what the price is and what those products are but they will be out there and I think you'll be surprised by how fast we move out there. We've had 14 months to think about it. And 14 months within the bounds of the law to do some planning.USA TODAY? Will U-verse and DirecTV co-exist?Stankey: We sold to different customer bases. There's some overlap in the markets but we played to the bundle game with U-verse by consolidating product offerings. DirectTV played to people who wanted to buy standalone video. We now can start to cross market products and services. Over the long haul our goal is offer one video product in the market, (with) one video channel lineup, one set of programming relationships, one video brand.To do that, we have to do integration work of the technical platforms. I wouldn't think about it as one going away or the other one going away. It's about how the two of them arrive at a new place that's better. Building that new platform is going to take us 24 to 36 months. Our goal is if you're a consumer of ours today that this transition is done in way that is evolutionary (and) non-invasive. This new platform is very software centric. We'll be able to bring the customer new features and services incrementally.USA TODAY: Does this deal change AT&T's views on net neutrality or its open Internet policy?)Stankey: We're still in favor of an open Internet and still supportive of rules around non-discrimination of traffic. Our issue is with Title II, it's not about whether we think the Internet should be open and fair. We think Title II is a regulatory overreach and it adds a degree of uncertainty into an investment marketplace (when the) FCC at any time can choose to reach in and reset the rules or regulate price or change performance metrics that create problems for consistency in business models. This transaction doesn't change anything about our challenge around that.FCC approves AT&T's acquisition of DirecTVUSA TODAY: What kind of clout does the DirecTV deal give AT&T?Stankey: I think it' s nice to be able to play in a league that's closer to what a vertically integrated Comcast can play in. We don't own content like they do.Our situation is we at least have volume scale. (It is) important to generate returns to invest in fiber and bring more broadband to customers. But we also want that ability so that we can go start working with the people who have the really attractive content to build these new distribution models. If you're talking about 26 million homes that buy video — traditional linear video — and 100 million high quality handsets and customers that are out there, many of whom have smartphones, that's a whole other opportunity to distribute content. That will allow us to do something with these guys that others who don't have this whole set of vertically integrated capabilities—home broadband, mobile, great TV product, etc. — can do.USA TODAY? How does this benefit consumers?Stankey: (The FCC) believed that another player in the market that had some scale would help to suppress the increase that's going on in rates. So I think consumers are going to see an economic value.USA TODAY? Big mergers often bring job loss to the new company. What do you expect?Stankey:  Obviously, there's going to be some functions that are going to be redundant when you put two large businesses together like this. There's two treasury organizations and two legal organizations. But this is about us growing broadband and video share and making this business more competitive. That growth is going to be really good for employees who are in operating roles. When you're growing you need more technicians and more people to talk to customers on the phone and you do more investment with IT. So the vast majority of folks are going to have more than enough work to do over the next several months and years to get this business operating right, aside from some of the corporate overheads that we're going to have to manage through.Email:ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow USA TODAY tech columnist @edbaig on TwitterCONNECTTWEET

History of the company[edit]

The company has a long corporate history, having started as a sole trader business owned by Edward Stanley Gibbons in 1856 and now being a quoted company with a number of subsidiaries.
Before 1900[edit]
The business started when, employed as an assistant in his father's pharmacy shop in Plymouth, Gibbons set up a counter selling stamps.[2] In 1863 he was fortunate enough to purchase from two sailors a sackful of rare Cape of Good Hope triangular stamps.[2]
In 1874 Gibbons moved to a house near Clapham Common in South London and in 1876 he moved again to Gower Street in Bloomsbury near the British Museum.
By 1890 Stanley Gibbons wished to retire and the business was sold to Charles Phillips for £25,000 (equivalent to £15.2 million in 2010).[3] Phillips became Managing Director, with Gibbons as Chairman.[2]
In 1891 a shop was opened at 435 Strand in addition to the Gower Street premises, and in 1893 the shop and offices were amalgamated at 391 The Strand where the company's retail premises remained for many years until they moved to 399 The Strand.

1900–1959[edit]
A new issue department was opened in 1906.
In 1914 the company received a royal warrant from George V.[2]
In 1956 the company celebrated its centenary with an exhibition at the Waldorf Hotel opened by Sir John Wilson. It is in that year that Queen Elizabeth II granted her royal warrant to Stanley Gibbons Ltd as her philatelist.[4]
1960s[edit]
In 1967 the firm expanded into the United States in a joint venture with Whitman Publishing. A magazine and catalogues were produced.
In 1968 the previously privately held Stanley Gibbons Limited was floated on the stock market through a tender arranged by S.G. Warburg & Co. Ltd. The offer was a huge success and was oversubscribed five times. The shares were sold at 20 shillings rather than the minimum tender price of 12 shillings and six pence.[5] It was estimated that there were 30 to 35 sharesholders before the offer and they still owned 66% of the equity after the offer, worth at least £1.8 million before trading began.[6] Prices subsequently slipped back, however, later in the year.
1970s[edit]
In 1970 The Crown Agents acquired a 20% stake in the company and appointed two Directors to the Gibbons board.[7] The stake was sold in 1976 by which time it had grown to 25% of the company.
In 1977 Stanley Gibbons acquired the stock of the firm Chas Nissen, once run by the eminent stamp dealer and philatelist Charles Nissen.
In 1979 Gibbons was bought by Letraset for £19 million in an attempt to diversify away from their dry-lettering business, but the acquisition did not go smoothly and like Flying Flowers later, Letraset faced difficulties integrating Gibbons into its core business.[8] The Chairman of Letraset blamed "indiscriminate expansion" and "imprudent" investment decisions for the problems at Gibbons and was quoted in The Times as saying "We significantly overpaid for what we got."[9] The US$10 million paid by Gibbons for the Marc Haas collection was also questioned.
1980s[edit]
In 1981 Letraset was taken over by Esselte after Esselte fought a takeover battle with Mills & Allen International for the company. Letraset had been fatally weakened by losses sustained in its Stanley Gibbons subsidiary. Later the same year Gibbons was put up for sale by Esselte as they said it did not form a logical part of their long-term development.[10]
In 1981 Gibbons bought the stock of the late H.F. Johnson.
In 1982 Clive Feigenbaum staged a management buy-out followed by an application in 1984 for a listing on the UK's Unlisted Securities Market in order to raise funds for new acquisitions. Following the buy-out, Feigenbaum, the Chairman, had owned over 50% of the shares with the others owned by the rest of the board.[11] The listing went ahead but the shares were suspended within moments of their debut even before trading had begun, following concerns about Feigenbaum's background highlighted in an article in the Sunday Times. The suspension was said to be the fastest on record at that time. The concerns had surrounded Feignebaum's expulsion from the Philatelic Traders Society for breaching their code of ethics and his sale of "23 carat gold" stamps of no postal validity from the island of Staffa. U.S. government tests had shown the stamps, sold at £10 each, to have a gold value of about 5c each. The debacle was said to have caused considerable embarrassment, not just to the company but also to its USM brokers Simon & Coates.[12] Shortly afterwards, Feigenbaum resigned as Chairman and was bought out by a consortium of institutions and individuals for £3 million.[13] A further attempt at a listing was planned for 1985 but did not go ahead.
In 1989 Paul Fraser began to invest in the firm, and he purchased a further 30% stake in the company from New Zealand businessman Sir Ron Brierley who is a stamp collector.[14]
1990s[edit]
Paul Fraser was appointed Executive Chairman in 1990.[15] By 1995 Fraser had acquired 76.83% of Gibbons shares and he purchased the rest of the shares in December 1995.[16]
In June 1998 the company was sold for £13.5 million to Flying Flowers. Paul Fraser took shares in Flying Flowers instead of cash and was left with an 8% stake in the enlarged company following the deal.[17] The merger was not a success and in 2000 the two companies were demerged again after a series of profits warnings and trading problems. Paul Fraser's stake was reduced in value from £13.5 million to £4 million. The de-merged Stanley Gibbons became Communitie.com and was listed on AIM. The chairman of Flying Flowers was quoted as saying the deal "...was at the wrong price and at the wrong time."[18][19]
Since 2000[edit]
In August 2007, Paul Fraser resigned as Executive Chairman[20] and in April 2008 he sold his remaining shares to focus on Paul Fraser Collectibles.[15] Bob Henkhuzens became Interim Chairman and the current Chairman is David Bralsford who works in a non-executive capacity. The company is currently led by Mike Hall as Chief Executive.[21]
On 20 September 2010 the company announced it had acquired the trade and assets of the Benham first day cover and collectibles business from Flying Brands Limited.[22] On 21 November 2013, Stanley Gibbons successfully completed its acquisition of Noble Investments, bringing Apex, Baldwin's, and Dreweatts & Bloomsbury Auctions into the group.[23] In 2014, two further acquisitions followed: On 31 January the company acquired Murray Payne, the world’s leading dealer in British Commonwealth King George VI stamps [24] and on 23 October The Fine Art Auction Group, holding company of the Group's subsidiary, Dreweatts and Bloomsbury, announced that it had acquired Mallett Antiques - a world-renowned dealer in the finest antiques and decorative arts with retail premises on London's Dover St and New York's Madison Avenue.[25]
On 28 January 2015 the company was awarded 'Deal of the Year' at the 2015 Quoted Company Awards for its acquisition of Noble Investments.[26]
In July 2015 the company announced that The Fine Art Auction Group had acquired Bid for Wine, a specialist online wine auctioneer founded in 2008 by barrister Spenser Hilliard and ex-management consultant Lionel Nierop.[27][28]
Stamp catalogues[edit]

Main article: Stanley Gibbons catalogue
The first Stanley Gibbons stamp catalogue was a penny price list issued in November 1865 and reissued at monthly intervals for the next 14 years.[29] The company produces numerous catalogues covering different countries, regions and specialisms; many of them are reissued annually. The catalogues list all known adhesive postage stamp issues and include prices for used and unused stamps.
Unlike other dealers' catalogues, Stanley Gibbons state that their catalogue is a retail price list. In other words, if they had that exact stamp in stock in the exact condition specified, the current catalogue price is the price that they would charge for it. This contrasts with most other catalogues which are produced by firms that do not sell stamps and therefore base their pricing on an average of market values in the country where the catalogue is published.
In practice, the actual price charged by Stanley Gibbons for an individual stamp may be different from the catalogue price because the specimen for sale is of a different grade, the market conditions have changed since the catalogue was produced, the firm has a plentiful or restricted supply of that stamp, or for a variety of other reasons.
Magazines[edit]




Gibbons Stamp Monthly


Gibbons Stamp Monthly is a magazine that lists new issues and publishes articles of interest to philatelists. Gibbons have published a number of journals over the years but only settled on Gibbons Stamp Monthly as their core magazine in 1927.[30] On 23 January 2009, Gibbons acquired the philatelic trade magazine The Philatelic Exporter from Heritage Studios Limited.[31]
Retail stamp business[edit]
As well as publishing, Stanley Gibbons is a stamp dealer with a retail business located on the Strand in their Central London offices offering both older stamps and new issues and fulfilling customer want lists. They produce their own line of other philatelic products, such as albums, stock books, and other accessories.
Auction house[edit]
The company is also a philatelic auction house and has held thousands of international sales since it was established in 1901.
Investment department[edit]
Since around 2000 the company has actively offered stamps as investments and has set up a special office in Guernsey for this activity.[32] The company had offered a similar service in the early 1970s on a small scale. Sales of investment products have been strong in Asia and the Middle East and through the company's email database, however, sales in the United Kingdom have been hampered by the fact that the company's philatelic investment products are not regulated by the UK Financial Services Authority and therefore UK financial institutions and financial advisers have been reluctant to recommend the products as investors would not enjoy the same level of protection they receive when investing in regulated products. Gibbons have stated that they intend to launch a regulated investment fund in order to overcome this obstacle.[33]
As recently as 2002 the company's attitude to philatelic investment was that stamps were purely a hobby. Many in the stamp business still had unpleasant memories of the excesses of the 1970s bubble.[34]
Some financial advisers and stamp dealers have doubted the wisdom of investing in stamps due to the relatively high prices charged by Stanley Gibbons compared to other dealers and the experience of the 1970s when many investors lost out after a speculative bubble in stamps burst.[35] The relatively high initial costs have also provoked comment, estimated at not less than 20% compared with less than 5% for many retail mutual fund type investments. Gibbons have responded by emphasising the high quality of their items and the long-term nature of their investment proposition.
In 2007 financial news website Bloomberg announced it would publish the SG100 Stamp Price Index, an index based upon retail and auction prices for the top 100 most frequently traded stamps in the world.[36]
Other businesses[edit]
The Group's subsidiaries include autograph dealer, Fraser's Autographs, Benham first day cover and collectibles business, online collectibles trading platform, bidStart [21]; Apex Philatelics, Baldwin's Coins, Dreweatts & Bloomsbury Auctions [22], Murray Payne, wine auctioneer Bid for Wine[37] and Mallett Antiques.
Financial information[edit]
The company's accounting year ends on 31 December and in the year ended 31 December 2009 it had total sales of over £23.4 million and a profit before tax of over £4.1 million.[38]
The financial year ending on 31st March 2016 shows total sales of over £59.1 million and a loss before tax of £28.89 million.[39]

History of the company[edit]

The company has a long corporate history, having started as a sole trader business owned by Edward Stanley Gibbons in 1856 and now being a quoted company with a number of subsidiaries.
Before 1900[edit]
The business started when, employed as an assistant in his father's pharmacy shop in Plymouth, Gibbons set up a counter selling stamps.[2] In 1863 he was fortunate enough to purchase from two sailors a sackful of rare Cape of Good Hope triangular stamps.[2]
In 1874 Gibbons moved to a house near Clapham Common in South London and in 1876 he moved again to Gower Street in Bloomsbury near the British Museum.
By 1890 Stanley Gibbons wished to retire and the business was sold to Charles Phillips for £25,000 (equivalent to £15.2 million in 2010).[3] Phillips became Managing Director, with Gibbons as Chairman.[2]
In 1891 a shop was opened at 435 Strand in addition to the Gower Street premises, and in 1893 the shop and offices were amalgamated at 391 The Strand where the company's retail premises remained for many years until they moved to 399 The Strand.

1900–1959[edit]
A new issue department was opened in 1906.
In 1914 the company received a royal warrant from George V.[2]
In 1956 the company celebrated its centenary with an exhibition at the Waldorf Hotel opened by Sir John Wilson. It is in that year that Queen Elizabeth II granted her royal warrant to Stanley Gibbons Ltd as her philatelist.[4]
1960s[edit]
In 1967 the firm expanded into the United States in a joint venture with Whitman Publishing. A magazine and catalogues were produced.
In 1968 the previously privately held Stanley Gibbons Limited was floated on the stock market through a tender arranged by S.G. Warburg & Co. Ltd. The offer was a huge success and was oversubscribed five times. The shares were sold at 20 shillings rather than the minimum tender price of 12 shillings and six pence.[5] It was estimated that there were 30 to 35 sharesholders before the offer and they still owned 66% of the equity after the offer, worth at least £1.8 million before trading began.[6] Prices subsequently slipped back, however, later in the year.
1970s[edit]
In 1970 The Crown Agents acquired a 20% stake in the company and appointed two Directors to the Gibbons board.[7] The stake was sold in 1976 by which time it had grown to 25% of the company.
In 1977 Stanley Gibbons acquired the stock of the firm Chas Nissen, once run by the eminent stamp dealer and philatelist Charles Nissen.
In 1979 Gibbons was bought by Letraset for £19 million in an attempt to diversify away from their dry-lettering business, but the acquisition did not go smoothly and like Flying Flowers later, Letraset faced difficulties integrating Gibbons into its core business.[8] The Chairman of Letraset blamed "indiscriminate expansion" and "imprudent" investment decisions for the problems at Gibbons and was quoted in The Times as saying "We significantly overpaid for what we got."[9] The US$10 million paid by Gibbons for the Marc Haas collection was also questioned.
1980s[edit]
In 1981 Letraset was taken over by Esselte after Esselte fought a takeover battle with Mills & Allen International for the company. Letraset had been fatally weakened by losses sustained in its Stanley Gibbons subsidiary. Later the same year Gibbons was put up for sale by Esselte as they said it did not form a logical part of their long-term development.[10]
In 1981 Gibbons bought the stock of the late H.F. Johnson.
In 1982 Clive Feigenbaum staged a management buy-out followed by an application in 1984 for a listing on the UK's Unlisted Securities Market in order to raise funds for new acquisitions. Following the buy-out, Feigenbaum, the Chairman, had owned over 50% of the shares with the others owned by the rest of the board.[11] The listing went ahead but the shares were suspended within moments of their debut even before trading had begun, following concerns about Feigenbaum's background highlighted in an article in the Sunday Times. The suspension was said to be the fastest on record at that time. The concerns had surrounded Feignebaum's expulsion from the Philatelic Traders Society for breaching their code of ethics and his sale of "23 carat gold" stamps of no postal validity from the island of Staffa. U.S. government tests had shown the stamps, sold at £10 each, to have a gold value of about 5c each. The debacle was said to have caused considerable embarrassment, not just to the company but also to its USM brokers Simon & Coates.[12] Shortly afterwards, Feigenbaum resigned as Chairman and was bought out by a consortium of institutions and individuals for £3 million.[13] A further attempt at a listing was planned for 1985 but did not go ahead.
In 1989 Paul Fraser began to invest in the firm, and he purchased a further 30% stake in the company from New Zealand businessman Sir Ron Brierley who is a stamp collector.[14]
1990s[edit]
Paul Fraser was appointed Executive Chairman in 1990.[15] By 1995 Fraser had acquired 76.83% of Gibbons shares and he purchased the rest of the shares in December 1995.[16]
In June 1998 the company was sold for £13.5 million to Flying Flowers. Paul Fraser took shares in Flying Flowers instead of cash and was left with an 8% stake in the enlarged company following the deal.[17] The merger was not a success and in 2000 the two companies were demerged again after a series of profits warnings and trading problems. Paul Fraser's stake was reduced in value from £13.5 million to £4 million. The de-merged Stanley Gibbons became Communitie.com and was listed on AIM. The chairman of Flying Flowers was quoted as saying the deal "...was at the wrong price and at the wrong time."[18][19]
Since 2000[edit]
In August 2007, Paul Fraser resigned as Executive Chairman[20] and in April 2008 he sold his remaining shares to focus on Paul Fraser Collectibles.[15] Bob Henkhuzens became Interim Chairman and the current Chairman is David Bralsford who works in a non-executive capacity. The company is currently led by Mike Hall as Chief Executive.[21]
On 20 September 2010 the company announced it had acquired the trade and assets of the Benham first day cover and collectibles business from Flying Brands Limited.[22] On 21 November 2013, Stanley Gibbons successfully completed its acquisition of Noble Investments, bringing Apex, Baldwin's, and Dreweatts & Bloomsbury Auctions into the group.[23] In 2014, two further acquisitions followed: On 31 January the company acquired Murray Payne, the world’s leading dealer in British Commonwealth King George VI stamps [24] and on 23 October The Fine Art Auction Group, holding company of the Group's subsidiary, Dreweatts and Bloomsbury, announced that it had acquired Mallett Antiques - a world-renowned dealer in the finest antiques and decorative arts with retail premises on London's Dover St and New York's Madison Avenue.[25]
On 28 January 2015 the company was awarded 'Deal of the Year' at the 2015 Quoted Company Awards for its acquisition of Noble Investments.[26]
In July 2015 the company announced that The Fine Art Auction Group had acquired Bid for Wine, a specialist online wine auctioneer founded in 2008 by barrister Spenser Hilliard and ex-management consultant Lionel Nierop.[27][28]
Stamp catalogues[edit]

Main article: Stanley Gibbons catalogue
The first Stanley Gibbons stamp catalogue was a penny price list issued in November 1865 and reissued at monthly intervals for the next 14 years.[29] The company produces numerous catalogues covering different countries, regions and specialisms; many of them are reissued annually. The catalogues list all known adhesive postage stamp issues and include prices for used and unused stamps.
Unlike other dealers' catalogues, Stanley Gibbons state that their catalogue is a retail price list. In other words, if they had that exact stamp in stock in the exact condition specified, the current catalogue price is the price that they would charge for it. This contrasts with most other catalogues which are produced by firms that do not sell stamps and therefore base their pricing on an average of market values in the country where the catalogue is published.
In practice, the actual price charged by Stanley Gibbons for an individual stamp may be different from the catalogue price because the specimen for sale is of a different grade, the market conditions have changed since the catalogue was produced, the firm has a plentiful or restricted supply of that stamp, or for a variety of other reasons.
Magazines[edit]




Gibbons Stamp Monthly


Gibbons Stamp Monthly is a magazine that lists new issues and publishes articles of interest to philatelists. Gibbons have published a number of journals over the years but only settled on Gibbons Stamp Monthly as their core magazine in 1927.[30] On 23 January 2009, Gibbons acquired the philatelic trade magazine The Philatelic Exporter from Heritage Studios Limited.[31]
Retail stamp business[edit]
As well as publishing, Stanley Gibbons is a stamp dealer with a retail business located on the Strand in their Central London offices offering both older stamps and new issues and fulfilling customer want lists. They produce their own line of other philatelic products, such as albums, stock books, and other accessories.
Auction house[edit]
The company is also a philatelic auction house and has held thousands of international sales since it was established in 1901.
Investment department[edit]
Since around 2000 the company has actively offered stamps as investments and has set up a special office in Guernsey for this activity.[32] The company had offered a similar service in the early 1970s on a small scale. Sales of investment products have been strong in Asia and the Middle East and through the company's email database, however, sales in the United Kingdom have been hampered by the fact that the company's philatelic investment products are not regulated by the UK Financial Services Authority and therefore UK financial institutions and financial advisers have been reluctant to recommend the products as investors would not enjoy the same level of protection they receive when investing in regulated products. Gibbons have stated that they intend to launch a regulated investment fund in order to overcome this obstacle.[33]
As recently as 2002 the company's attitude to philatelic investment was that stamps were purely a hobby. Many in the stamp business still had unpleasant memories of the excesses of the 1970s bubble.[34]
Some financial advisers and stamp dealers have doubted the wisdom of investing in stamps due to the relatively high prices charged by Stanley Gibbons compared to other dealers and the experience of the 1970s when many investors lost out after a speculative bubble in stamps burst.[35] The relatively high initial costs have also provoked comment, estimated at not less than 20% compared with less than 5% for many retail mutual fund type investments. Gibbons have responded by emphasising the high quality of their items and the long-term nature of their investment proposition.
In 2007 financial news website Bloomberg announced it would publish the SG100 Stamp Price Index, an index based upon retail and auction prices for the top 100 most frequently traded stamps in the world.[36]
Other businesses[edit]
The Group's subsidiaries include autograph dealer, Fraser's Autographs, Benham first day cover and collectibles business, online collectibles trading platform, bidStart [21]; Apex Philatelics, Baldwin's Coins, Dreweatts & Bloomsbury Auctions [22], Murray Payne, wine auctioneer Bid for Wine[37] and Mallett Antiques.
Financial information[edit]
The company's accounting year ends on 31 December and in the year ended 31 December 2009 it had total sales of over £23.4 million and a profit before tax of over £4.1 million.[38]
The financial year ending on 31st March 2016 shows total sales of over £59.1 million and a loss before tax of £28.89 million.[39]

History of the company[edit]

The company has a long corporate history, having started as a sole trader business owned by Edward Stanley Gibbons in 1856 and now being a quoted company with a number of subsidiaries.
Before 1900[edit]
The business started when, employed as an assistant in his father's pharmacy shop in Plymouth, Gibbons set up a counter selling stamps.[2] In 1863 he was fortunate enough to purchase from two sailors a sackful of rare Cape of Good Hope triangular stamps.[2]
In 1874 Gibbons moved to a house near Clapham Common in South London and in 1876 he moved again to Gower Street in Bloomsbury near the British Museum.
By 1890 Stanley Gibbons wished to retire and the business was sold to Charles Phillips for £25,000 (equivalent to £15.2 million in 2010).[3] Phillips became Managing Director, with Gibbons as Chairman.[2]
In 1891 a shop was opened at 435 Strand in addition to the Gower Street premises, and in 1893 the shop and offices were amalgamated at 391 The Strand where the company's retail premises remained for many years until they moved to 399 The Strand.

1900–1959[edit]
A new issue department was opened in 1906.
In 1914 the company received a royal warrant from George V.[2]
In 1956 the company celebrated its centenary with an exhibition at the Waldorf Hotel opened by Sir John Wilson. It is in that year that Queen Elizabeth II granted her royal warrant to Stanley Gibbons Ltd as her philatelist.[4]

Some financial advisers and stamp dealers have doubted the wisdom of investing in stamps due to the relatively high prices charged by Stanley Gibbons compared to other dealers and the experience of the 1970s when many investors lost out after a speculative bubble in stamps burst.[35] The relatively high initial costs have also provoked comment, estimated at not less than 20% compared with less than 5% for many retail mutual fund type investments. Gibbons have responded by emphasising the high quality of their items and the long-term nature of their investment proposition.
In 2007 financial news website Bloomberg announced it would publish the SG100 Stamp Price Index, an index based upon retail and auction prices for the top 100 most frequently traded stamps in the world.[36]
Other businesses[edit]
The Group's subsidiaries include autograph dealer, Fraser's Autographs, Benham first day cover and collectibles business, online collectibles trading platform, bidStart [21]; Apex Philatelics, Baldwin's Coins, Dreweatts & Bloomsbury Auctions [22], Murray Payne, wine auctioneer Bid for Wine[37] and Mallett Antiques.
Financial information[edit]
The company's accounting year ends on 31 December and in the year ended 31 December 2009 it had total sales of over £23.4 million and a profit before tax of over £4.1 million.[38]
The financial year ending on 31st March 2016 shows total sales of over £59.1 million and a loss before tax of £28.89 million.[39]

History of the company[edit]

The company has a long corporate history, having started as a sole trader business owned by Edward Stanley Gibbons in 1856 and now being a quoted company with a number of subsidiaries.
Before 1900[edit]
The business started when, employed as an assistant in his father's pharmacy shop in Plymouth, Gibbons set up a counter selling stamps.[2] In 1863 he was fortunate enough to purchase from two sailors a sackful of rare Cape of Good Hope triangular stamps.[2]
In 1874 Gibbons moved to a house near Clapham Common in South London and in 1876 he moved again to Gower Street in Bloomsbury near the British Museum.
By 1890 Stanley Gibbons wished to retire and the business was sold to Charles Phillips for £25,000 (equivalent to £15.2 million in 2010).[3] Phillips became Managing Director, with Gibbons as Chairman.[2]
In 1891 a shop was opened at 435 Strand in addition to the Gower Street premises, and in 1893 the shop and offices were amalgamated at 391 The Strand where the company's retail premises remained for many years until they moved to 399 The Strand.

1900–1959[edit]
A new issue department was opened in 1906.
In 1914 the company received a royal warrant from George V.[2]
In 1956 the company celebrated its centenary with an exhibition at the Waldorf Hotel opened by Sir John Wilson. It is in that year that Queen Elizabeth II granted her royal warrant to Stanley Gibbons Ltd as her philatelist.[4]
1960s[edit]
In 1967 the firm expanded into the United States in a joint venture with Whitman Publishing. A magazine and catalogues were produced.
In 1968 the previously privately held Stanley Gibbons Limited was floated on the stock market through a tender arranged by S.G. Warburg & Co. Ltd. The offer was a huge success and was oversubscribed five times. The shares were sold at 20 shillings rather than the minimum tender price of 12 shillings and six pence.[5] It was estimated that there were 30 to 35 sharesholders before the offer and they still owned 66% of the equity after the offer, worth at least £1.8 million before trading began.[6] Prices subsequently slipped back, however, later in the year.
1970s[edit]
In 1970 The Crown Agents acquired a 20% stake in the company and appointed two Directors to the Gibbons board.[7] The stake was sold in 1976 by which time it had grown to 25% of the company.
In 1977 Stanley Gibbons acquired the stock of the firm Chas Nissen, once run by the eminent stamp dealer and philatelist Charles Nissen.
In 1979 Gibbons was bought by Letraset for £19 million in an attempt to diversify away from their dry-lettering business, but the acquisition did not go smoothly and like Flying Flowers later, Letraset faced difficulties integrating Gibbons into its core business.[8] The Chairman of Letraset blamed "indiscriminate expansion" and "imprudent" investment decisions for the problems at Gibbons and was quoted in The Times as saying "We significantly overpaid for what we got."[9] The US$10 million paid by Gibbons for the Marc Haas collection was also questioned.
1980s[edit]
In 1981 Letraset was taken over by Esselte after Esselte fought a takeover battle with Mills & Allen International for the company. Letraset had been fatally weakened by losses sustained in its Stanley Gibbons subsidiary. Later the same year Gibbons was put up for sale by Esselte as they said it did not form a logical part of their long-term development.[10]
In 1981 Gibbons bought the stock of the late H.F. Johnson.
In 1982 Clive Feigenbaum staged a management buy-out followed by an application in 1984 for a listing on the UK's Unlisted Securities Market in order to raise funds for new acquisitions. Following the buy-out, Feigenbaum, the Chairman, had owned over 50% of the shares with the others owned by the rest of the board.[11] The listing went ahead but the shares were suspended within moments of their debut even before trading had begun, following concerns about Feigenbaum's background highlighted in an article in the Sunday Times. The suspension was said to be the fastest on record at that time. The concerns had surrounded Feignebaum's expulsion from the Philatelic Traders Society for breaching their code of ethics and his sale of "23 carat gold" stamps of no postal validity from the island of Staffa. U.S. government tests had shown the stamps, sold at £10 each, to have a gold value of about 5c each. The debacle was said to have caused considerable embarrassment, not just to the company but also to its USM brokers Simon & Coates.[12] Shortly afterwards, Feigenbaum resigned as Chairman and was bought out by a consortium of institutions and individuals for £3 million.[13] A further attempt at a listing was planned for 1985 but did not go ahead.
In 1989 Paul Fraser began to invest in the firm, and he purchased a further 30% stake in the company from New Zealand businessman Sir Ron Brierley who is a stamp collector.[14]
1990s[edit]
Paul Fraser was appointed Executive Chairman in 1990.[15] By 1995 Fraser had acquired 76.83% of Gibbons shares and he purchased the rest of the shares in December 1995.[16]
In June 1998 the company was sold for £13.5 million to Flying Flowers. Paul Fraser took shares in Flying Flowers instead of cash and was left with an 8% stake in the enlarged company following the deal.[17] The merger was not a success and in 2000 the two companies were demerged again after a series of profits warnings and trading problems. Paul Fraser's stake was reduced in value from £13.5 million to £4 million. The de-merged Stanley Gibbons became Communitie.com and was listed on AIM. The chairman of Flying Flowers was quoted as saying the deal "...was at the wrong price and at the wrong time."[18][19]
Since 2000[edit]
In August 2007, Paul Fraser resigned as Executive Chairman[20] and in April 2008 he sold his remaining shares to focus on Paul Fraser Collectibles.[15] Bob Henkhuzens became Interim Chairman and the current Chairman is David Bralsford who works in a non-executive capacity. The company is currently led by Mike Hall as Chief Executive.[21]
On 20 September 2010 the company announced it had acquired the trade and assets of the Benham first day cover and collectibles business from Flying Brands Limited.[22] On 21 November 2013, Stanley Gibbons successfully completed its acquisition of Noble Investments, bringing Apex, Baldwin's, and Dreweatts & Bloomsbury Auctions into the group.[23] In 2014, two further acquisitions followed: On 31 January the company acquired Murray Payne, the world’s leading dealer in British Commonwealth King George VI stamps [24] and on 23 October The Fine Art Auction Group, holding company of the Group's subsidiary, Dreweatts and Bloomsbury, announced that it had acquired Mallett Antiques - a world-renowned dealer in the finest antiques and decorative arts with retail premises on London's Dover St and New York's Madison Avenue.[25]
On 28 January 2015 the company was awarded 'Deal of the Year' at the 2015 Quoted Company Awards for its acquisition of Noble Investments.[26]
In July 2015 the company announced that The Fine Art Auction Group had acquired Bid for Wine, a specialist online wine auctioneer founded in 2008 by barrister Spenser Hilliard and ex-management consultant Lionel Nierop.[27][28]
Stamp catalogues[edit]




The cover of a 1914-15 edition of the "Part One" British Empire catalogue.


Main article: Stanley Gibbons catalogue
The first Stanley Gibbons stamp catalogue was a penny price list issued in November 1865 and reissued at monthly intervals for the next 14 years.[29] The company produces numerous catalogues covering different countries, regions and specialisms; many of them are reissued annually. The catalogues list all known adhesive postage stamp issues and include prices for used and unused stamps.
Unlike other dealers' catalogues, Stanley Gibbons state that their catalogue is a retail price list. In other words, if they had that exact stamp in stock in the exact condition specified, the current catalogue price is the price that they would charge for it. This contrasts with most other catalogues which are produced by firms that do not sell stamps and therefore base their pricing on an average of market values in the country where the catalogue is published.
In practice, the actual price charged by Stanley Gibbons for an individual stamp may be different from the catalogue price because the specimen for sale is of a different grade, the market conditions have changed since the catalogue was produced, the firm has a plentiful or restricted supply of that stamp, or for a variety of other reasons.
Magazines[edit]




Gibbons Stamp Monthly


Gibbons Stamp Monthly is a magazine that lists new issues and publishes articles of interest to philatelists. Gibbons have published a number of journals over the years but only settled on Gibbons Stamp Monthly as their core magazine in 1927.[30] On 23 January 2009, Gibbons acquired the philatelic trade magazine The Philatelic Exporter from Heritage Studios Limited.[31]
Retail stamp business[edit]
As well as publishing, Stanley Gibbons is a stamp dealer with a retail business located on the Strand in their Central London offices offering both older stamps and new issues and fulfilling customer want lists. They produce their own line of other philatelic products, such as albums, stock books, and other accessories.
Auction house[edit]
The company is also a philatelic auction house and has held thousands of international sales since it was established in 1901.
Investment department[edit]
Since around 2000 the company has actively offered stamps as investments and has set up a special office in Guernsey for this activity.[32] The company had offered a similar service in the early 1970s on a small scale. Sales of investment products have been strong in Asia and the Middle East and through the company's email database, however, sales in the United Kingdom have been hampered by the fact that the company's philatelic investment products are not regulated by the UK Financial Services Authority and therefore UK financial institutions and financial advisers have been reluctant to recommend the products as investors would not enjoy the same level of protection they receive when investing in regulated products. Gibbons have stated that they intend to launch a regulated investment fund in order to overcome this obstacle.[33]
As recently as 2002 the company's attitude to philatelic investment was that stamps were purely a hobby. Many in the stamp business still had unpleasant memories of the excesses of the 1970s bubble.[34]
Some financial advisers and stamp dealers have doubted the wisdom of investing in stamps due to the relatively high prices charged by Stanley Gibbons compared to other dealers and the experience of the 1970s when many investors lost out after a speculative bubble in stamps burst.[35] The relatively high initial costs have also provoked comment, estimated at not less than 20% compared with less than 5% for many retail mutual fund type investments. Gibbons have responded by emphasising the high quality of their items and the long-term nature of their investment proposition.
In 2007 financial news website Bloomberg announced it would publish the SG100 Stamp Price Index, an index based upon retail and auction prices for the top 100 most frequently traded stamps in the world.[36]
Other businesses[edit]
The Group's subsidiaries include autograph dealer, Fraser's Autographs, Benham first day cover and collectibles business, online collectibles trading platform, bidStart [21]; Apex Philatelics, Baldwin's Coins, Dreweatts & Bloomsbury Auctions [22], Murray Payne, wine auctioneer Bid for Wine[37] and Mallett Antiques.
Financial information[edit]
The company's accounting year ends on 31 December and in the year ended 31 December 2009 it had total sales of over £23.4 million and a profit before tax of over £4.1 million.[38]
The financial year ending on 31st March 2016 shows total sales of over £59.1 million and a loss before tax of £28.89 million.[39]

History of the company[edit]

The company has a long corporate history, having started as a sole trader business owned by Edward Stanley Gibbons in 1856 and now being a quoted company with a number of subsidiaries.
Before 1900[edit]
The business started when, employed as an assistant in his father's pharmacy shop in Plymouth, Gibbons set up a counter selling stamps.[2] In 1863 he was fortunate enough to purchase from two sailors a sackful of rare Cape of Good Hope triangular stamps.[2]
In 1874 Gibbons moved to a house near Clapham Common in South London and in 1876 he moved again to Gower Street in Bloomsbury near the British Museum.
By 1890 Stanley Gibbons wished to retire and the business was sold to Charles Phillips for £25,000 (equivalent to £15.2 million in 2010).[3] Phillips became Managing Director, with Gibbons as Chairman.[2]
In 1891 a shop was opened at 435 Strand in addition to the Gower Street premises, and in 1893 the shop and offices were amalgamated at 391 The Strand where the company's retail premises remained for many years until they moved to 399 The Strand.

1900–1959[edit]
A new issue department was opened in 1906.
In 1914 the company received a royal warrant from George V.[2]
In 1956 the company celebrated its centenary with an exhibition at the Waldorf Hotel opened by Sir John Wilson. It is in that year that Queen Elizabeth II granted her royal warrant to Stanley Gibbons Ltd as her philatelist.[4]
1960s[edit]
In 1967 the firm expanded into the United States in a joint venture with Whitman Publishing. A magazine and catalogues were produced.
In 1968 the previously privately held Stanley Gibbons Limited was floated on the stock market through a tender arranged by S.G. Warburg & Co. Ltd. The offer was a huge success and was oversubscribed five times. The shares were sold at 20 shillings rather than the minimum tender price of 12 shillings and six pence.[5] It was estimated that there were 30 to 35 sharesholders before the offer and they still owned 66% of the equity after the offer, worth at least £1.8 million before trading began.[6] Prices subsequently slipped back, however, later in the year.
1970s[edit]
In 1970 The Crown Agents acquired a 20% stake in the company and appointed two Directors to the Gibbons board.[7] The stake was sold in 1976 by which time it had grown to 25% of the company.
In 1977 Stanley Gibbons acquired the stock of the firm Chas Nissen, once run by the eminent stamp dealer and philatelist Charles Nissen.
In 1979 Gibbons was bought by Letraset for £19 million in an attempt to diversify away from their dry-lettering business, but the acquisition did not go smoothly and like Flying Flowers later, Letraset faced difficulties integrating Gibbons into its core business.[8] The Chairman of Letraset blamed "indiscriminate expansion" and "imprudent" investment decisions for the problems at Gibbons and was quoted in The Times as saying "We significantly overpaid for what we got."[9] The US$10 million paid by Gibbons for the Marc Haas collection was also questioned.
1980s[edit]
In 1981 Letraset was taken over by Esselte after Esselte fought a takeover battle with Mills & Allen International for the company. Letraset had been fatally weakened by losses sustained in its Stanley Gibbons subsidiary. Later the same year Gibbons was put up for sale by Esselte as they said it did not form a logical part of their long-term development.[10]
In 1981 Gibbons bought the stock of the late H.F. Johnson.
In 1982 Clive Feigenbaum staged a management buy-out followed by an application in 1984 for a listing on the UK's Unlisted Securities Market in order to raise funds for new acquisitions. Following the buy-out, Feigenbaum, the Chairman, had owned over 50% of the shares with the others owned by the rest of the board.[11] The listing went ahead but the shares were suspended within moments of their debut even before trading had begun, following concerns about Feigenbaum's background highlighted in an article in the Sunday Times. The suspension was said to be the fastest on record at that time. The concerns had surrounded Feignebaum's expulsion from the Philatelic Traders Society for breaching their code of ethics and his sale of "23 carat gold" stamps of no postal validity from the island of Staffa. U.S. government tests had shown the stamps, sold at £10 each, to have a gold value of about 5c each. The debacle was said to have caused considerable embarrassment, not just to the company but also to its USM brokers Simon & Coates.[12] Shortly afterwards, Feigenbaum resigned as Chairman and was bought out by a consortium of institutions and individuals for £3 million.[13] A further attempt at a listing was planned for 1985 but did not go ahead.
In 1989 Paul Fraser began to invest in the firm, and he purchased a further 30% stake in the company from New Zealand businessman Sir Ron Brierley who is a stamp collector.[14]
1990s[edit]
Paul Fraser was appointed Executive Chairman in 1990.[15] By 1995 Fraser had acquired 76.83% of Gibbons shares and he purchased the rest of the shares in December 1995.[16]
In June 1998 the company was sold for £13.5 million to Flying Flowers. Paul Fraser took shares in Flying Flowers instead of cash and was left with an 8% stake in the enlarged company following the deal.[17] The merger was not a success and in 2000 the two companies were demerged again after a series of profits warnings and trading problems. Paul Fraser's stake was reduced in value from £13.5 million to £4 million. The de-merged Stanley Gibbons became Communitie.com and was listed on AIM. The chairman of Flying Flowers was quoted as saying the deal "...was at the wrong price and at the wrong time."[18][19]
Since 2000[edit]
In August 2007, Paul Fraser resigned as Executive Chairman[20] and in April 2008 he sold his remaining shares to focus on Paul Fraser Collectibles.[15] Bob Henkhuzens became Interim Chairman and the current Chairman is David Bralsford who works in a non-executive capacity. The company is currently led by Mike Hall as Chief Executive.[21]
On 20 September 2010 the company announced it had acquired the trade and assets of the Benham first day cover and collectibles business from Flying Brands Limited.[22] On 21 November 2013, Stanley Gibbons successfully completed its acquisition of Noble Investments, bringing Apex, Baldwin's, and Dreweatts & Bloomsbury Auctions into the group.[23] In 2014, two further acquisitions followed: On 31 January the company acquired Murray Payne, the world’s leading dealer in British Commonwealth King George VI stamps [24] and on 23 October The Fine Art Auction Group, holding company of the Group's subsidiary, Dreweatts and Bloomsbury, announced that it had acquired Mallett Antiques - a world-renowned dealer in the finest antiques and decorative arts with retail premises on London's Dover St and New York's Madison Avenue.[25]
On 28 January 2015 the company was awarded 'Deal of the Year' at the 2015 Quoted Company Awards for its acquisition of Noble Investments.[26]
In July 2015 the company announced that The Fine Art Auction Group had acquired Bid for Wine, a specialist online wine auctioneer founded in 2008 by barrister Spenser Hilliard and ex-management consultant Lionel Nierop.[27][28]
Stamp catalogues[edit]




The cover of a 1914-15 edition of the "Part One" British Empire catalogue.


Main article: Stanley Gibbons catalogue
The first Stanley Gibbons stamp catalogue was a penny price list issued in November 1865 and reissued at monthly intervals for the next 14 years.[29] The company produces numerous catalogues covering different countries, regions and specialisms; many of them are reissued annually. The catalogues list all known adhesive postage stamp issues and include prices for used and unused stamps.
Unlike other dealers' catalogues, Stanley Gibbons state that their catalogue is a retail price list. In other words, if they had that exact stamp in stock in the exact condition specified, the current catalogue price is the price that they would charge for it. This contrasts with most other catalogues which are produced by firms that do not sell stamps and therefore base their pricing on an average of market values in the country where the catalogue is published.
In practice, the actual price charged by Stanley Gibbons for an individual stamp may be different from the catalogue price because the specimen for sale is of a different grade, the market conditions have changed since the catalogue was produced, the firm has a plentiful or restricted supply of that stamp, or for a variety of other reasons.
Magazines[edit]




Gibbons Stamp Monthly


Gibbons Stamp Monthly is a magazine that lists new issues and publishes articles of interest to philatelists. Gibbons have published a number of journals over the years but only settled on Gibbons Stamp Monthly as their core magazine in 1927.[30] On 23 January 2009, Gibbons acquired the philatelic trade magazine The Philatelic Exporter from Heritage Studios Limited.[31]
Retail stamp business[edit]
As well as publishing, Stanley Gibbons is a stamp dealer with a retail business located on the Strand in their Central London offices offering both older stamps and new issues and fulfilling customer want lists. They produce their own line of other philatelic products, such as albums, stock books, and other accessories.
Auction house[edit]
The company is also a philatelic auction house and has held thousands of international sales since it was established in 1901.
Investment department[edit]
Since around 2000 the company has actively offered stamps as investments and has set up a special office in Guernsey for this activity.[32] The company had offered a similar service in the early 1970s on a small scale. Sales of investment products have been strong in Asia and the Middle East and through the company's email database, however, sales in the United Kingdom have been hampered by the fact that the company's philatelic investment products are not regulated by the UK Financial Services Authority and therefore UK financial institutions and financial advisers have been reluctant to recommend the products as investors would not enjoy the same level of protection they receive when investing in regulated products. Gibbons have stated that they intend to launch a regulated investment fund in order to overcome this obstacle.[33]
As recently as 2002 the company's attitude to philatelic investment was that stamps were purely a hobby. Many in the stamp business still had unpleasant memories of the excesses of the 1970s bubble.[34]
Some financial advisers and stamp dealers have doubted the wisdom of investing in stamps due to the relatively high prices charged by Stanley Gibbons compared to other dealers and the experience of the 1970s when many investors lost out after a speculative bubble in stamps burst.[35] The relatively high initial costs have also provoked comment, estimated at not less than 20% compared with less than 5% for many retail mutual fund type investments. Gibbons have responded by emphasising the high quality of their items and the long-term nature of their investment proposition.
In 2007 financial news website Bloomberg announced it would publish the SG100 Stamp Price Index, an index based upon retail and auction prices for the top 100 most frequently traded stamps in the world.[36]
Other businesses[edit]
The Group's subsidiaries include autograph dealer, Fraser's Autographs, Benham first day cover and collectibles business, online collectibles trading platform, bidStart [21]; Apex Philatelics, Baldwin's Coins, Dreweatts & Bloomsbury Auctions [22], Murray Payne, wine auctioneer Bid for Wine[37] and Mallett Antiques.
Financial information[edit]
The company's accounting year ends on 31 December and in the year ended 31 December 2009 it had total sales of over £23.4 million and a profit before tax of over £4.1 million.[38]
The financial year ending on 31st March 2016 shows total sales of over £59.1 million and a loss before tax of £28.89 million.[39]

His self-titled debut album was released in 1972, and it is a wildly mixed bag of introspective, acoustic folk-rock (a la James Taylor and others of that sensitive singer-songwriter ilk) and simple rock & roll. Stanley's potential was obvious, and this fact drew producer and Tumbleweed Records co-founder Bill Szymczyk, Joe Walsh, and other well-known musicians to the project. Stanley, Szymczyk, and Walsh went to Denver, assembled and briefly rehearsed an ad hoc band, and cut Michael Stanley in Los Angeles a week later. "Rosewood Bitters" opens the album, and it's still revered among Stanley fans. This relaxed, easygoing tune is based on acoustic guitar strumming and a sweet, gentle melody. Walsh plays slide guitar and Todd Rundgren adds clavinet. The country-flavored "Louisville A.D." features Rick Derringer on pedal steel guitar. "A Friend and Nothing More" slowly builds tension with slow piano, sparse acoustic guitar, resonant synthesizer, and steady drum parts. "Rock and Roll Man" is a conscious attempt to add a foot-stomper to the album, and Stanley forces his sneering vocals; luckily, Walsh redeems things with a piercing guitar solo. "Moving Right Along" is decent folk-rock enhanced by organ, flute, and guitar solos. A radically altered arrangement of Bob Dylan's "Subterranean Homesick Blues" closes the album. Stanley would release one more solo album before forming the Michael Stanley Band and becoming a superstar in Ohio, but it all began with the uneven yet promising Michael Stanley. ~ Bret Adams
