Lets Take Profitability As A Major Consideration: Laredo Petroleum, Inc. (LPI), CommScope Holding Company, Inc. (COMM)

By Homer Porter -   July 18, 2017

Shares of Laredo Petroleum, Inc. (NYSE:LPI) are on a recovery track as they have regained 20.76% since bottoming out at $9.2 on Jul. 28, 2016. Thanks to a rise of almost 3.54% in the past five days, the stock price is now down -21.43% so far on the year — still in weak territory. In this case, shares are down -32.54% from $16.47 , the 52-week high touched on Dec. 01, 2016, and are keeping their losses at 5.21% for the past 12 months.
LPI Target Price Reaches $15.26
 Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to hold Laredo Petroleum, Inc. (LPI)’s shares projecting a $15.26 target price. Analysts‟ target price forecasts are a prediction of a stock‟s future price, generally over the 12 months following the release date (Asquith et al., 2005). This forecast is a point estimate that provides investors with a benchmark against which to directly compare stock price in the short run.Target prices made by analysts employed by large brokers, who have access to a greater resource pool, are more likely to be met over the 12-month forecast period.
 How Quickly Laredo Petroleum, Inc. (LPI)’s Sales Grew?
 LPI’s revenue has grown at an average annualized rate of about 3.4% during the past five years. However, the company’s most recent quarter increase of 77.3% looks attractive. The sales growth rate for a stock is a measure of how the stock’s sales per share (SPS) has grown over a specific period of time. It tells an investor how quickly a company is increasing its revenues. The sales growth rate helps investors determine how strong the overall growth-orientation is for a stock or portfolio.
CommScope Holding Company, Inc. Achieves Below-Average Profit Margin 





  The best measure of a company is its profitability, for without it, it cannot grow, and if it doesn’t grow, then its stock will trend downward. Increasing profits are the best indication that a company can pay dividends and that the share price will trend upward. Creditors will loan money at a cheaper rate to a profitable company than to an unprofitable one; consequently, profitable companies can use leverage to increase stockholders’ equity even more. Profitability ratios compare different accounts to see how efficiently a business is generating profits. These ratios show how well income is generated through operations, and are important to both creditors and investors. They help determine the company’s ability to continue operating. Currently, Laredo Petroleum, Inc. net profit margin for the 12 months is at -1.78%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 4.29%, and the sector’s average is 82.22%. In that light, it seems in weak position compared to its peers and sector. The profit margin measures the amount of net income earned with each dollar’s worth of revenue. It shows the percentage of sales that remain after all of the company’s expenses have been paid. The higher the ratio, the better.
 CommScope Holding Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:COMM) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -18.71% since hitting a peak level of $42.75 on May. 01, 2017. Meanwhile, due to a recent pullback which led to a fall of almost -7.14% in the past one month, the stock price is now with underperforming -6.59% so far on the year — still in weak zone. In this case, shares are 22.88% higher from $28.28, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Aug. 12, 2016, but are collecting gains at -6% for the past six months.
Analysts See CommScope Holding Company, Inc. 8.13% Above Current Levels 
 The good news is there’s still room for CommScope Holding Company, Inc. (COMM) to grow. At recent closing price of $34.75, COMM has a chance to add $8.13 or 23.4% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($42.88) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 1.8 looks like a buy. It has a 36-month beta of 1.19 , so you might be in for a bumpy ride.
 Are CommScope Holding Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:COMM) Earnings Growing Rapidly?
 For the past 5 years, CommScope Holding Company, Inc.’s EPS growth has been nearly 19.6%. Sure, the percentage is encouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 7.08%, annually.
Is COMM Turning Profits into Returns?
 CommScope Holding Company, Inc. (COMM)’s ROE is 18.11%, while industry’s is 4.14%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 13.41%. The return on equity (ROE), also known as return on investment (ROI), is the best measure of the return, since it is the product of the operating performance, asset turnover, and debt-equity management of the firm. If a firm can borrow money and use it to achieve a higher return than the cost of the debt, then the leveraging creates additional revenue that accrues to stockholders as increased equity.
 CommScope Holding Company, Inc.’s ROA is 3.29%, while industry’s average is 1.95%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company’s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 9.61. The return on assets (ROA) (aka return on total assets, return on average assets), is one of the most widely used profitability ratios because it is related to both profit margin and asset turnover, and shows the rate of return for both creditors and investors of the company. ROA shows how well a company controls its costs and utilizes its resources.

Real-time prices are provided by Bats Exchange on individual U.S. equities quote pages. During market hours, the real-time Bats price displays and new trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash"). Volume always reflects consolidated markets. If the symbol has pre-market or post-market trades, that information will also be reflected along with the last (closing) price from the symbol's exchange. Real-time prices are available during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST).  Note: The Bats Exchange currently accounts for approximately 11-12% of all U.S. equity trading each day. As a result, the real-time prices displayed may have minor discrepancies when comparing the information with other sites offering real-time data, or with brokerage firms. If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the Bats exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related Stocks For comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.Most Recent Stories View the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).

Plank Enterprises Announces Move to an Expanded HQ



Plank Enterprises Announces Move to an Expanded HQ
Posted on 23 August 2008
Eau Claire, Wis. – A move to expanded headquarters has been announced by  Plank Enterprises, the holding company for LDPI Lighting, a  manufacturer of lighting products for industrial and commercial  applications; LPI Lift Systems, a manufacturer of personnel lifts and  aerial work platforms; Badger Industrial Supply & Equipment, an  industrial distributor, and Pro-Cise Machine & Tool, designers and  builders of precision manufacturing components.
The move to the 125,000 sq. ft. building at 4404 Anderson Dr.,  Eau Claire, will expand company’s space for manufacturing, shipping and  administration by over 75 percent. Plank Enterprises currently occupies  approximately 70,000 sq. ft. in the Banbury Place complex where they  have been headquartered since 1993.
“Each of the operating  companies has been growing rapidly, and our new facility offers us a  flexible work space which allows us to react quickly to changing markets  and improve on manufacturing processes,” said Michael Ottum, President  of Plank Enterprises.
He added the company is also expanding its  marketing, entering new markets and intensifying its international sales  efforts. Plank Enterprises recently hired John Konkel to serve as  director of international sales and marketing, a newly created position.  Mr. Konkel has extensive international marketing and management  experience having served Fortune 500 companies and joint ventures in  Japan, Europe and South America.
Ottum explained the company  will complete its move before the end of the year. The company will  remain fully operational throughout the moving process.
LDPI’s  broad line of lighting products includes fluorescent, incandescent and  HID lighting fixtures for applications where special circumstances  exist, such as explosive, hazardous, corrosive, or wet/damp  environments.
LPI Lift Systems products are designed for safety and worker convenience in a variety of work environments.
Badger  Industrial Supply & Equipment distributes a broad variety of  material handling products, offering high quality, economical  alternatives for industrial equipment and safety needs.
Pro-Cise  Machine & Tool’s precision components are designed for  manufacturing processes including modern CNC turning and machining  centers.
