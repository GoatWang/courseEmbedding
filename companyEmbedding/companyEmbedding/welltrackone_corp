For Medicare Patients - Info on the Annual Wellness VisitWellTrackONE Corporation

Patient Information

					Information for Medicare Patients about the Annual Wellness Visit.				
 
 
 
 




For patients, the Annual Wellness Visit, AWV, is an evaluation designed to help you, your family and your physician develop an ongoing health plan that will keep you healthy, safe and independent for a long time.
You’ll rest easier as a patient knowing you’re getting the best possible care from your physician. Now, your doctor can accurately determine risk factors such as depression, functional, cognitive, safety, and constitutional issues. You will be able to receive treatments for these risks from your physician and their caregivers. And the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit is absolutely free of charge.  Every year!
Physical Exam or Wellness Visit? What Medicare Covers
Posted by Medicare Made Clear
The following information comes directly from Medicare.gov:
Yearly “Wellness” visits: If you’ve had Part B for longer than 12 months, you can get this visit to develop or update a personalized prevention help plan to prevent disease and disability based on your current health and risk factors. Your provider will ask you to fill out a questionnaire, called a “Health Risk Assessment,” as part of this visit. Answering these questions can help you and your provider develop a personalized prevention plan to help you stay healthy and get the most out of your visit. It also includes:
– A review of your medical and family history
– Developing or updating a list of current providers and prescription
– Height, weight, blood pressure, and other routine measurements
– Detection of any cognitive impairment
– Personalized health advice
– A list of risk factors and treatment options for you
– A screening schedule (like a checklist) for appropriate preventive services. Get details about coverage for screenings, shots, and other preventive services.

This visit is covered once every 12 months (11 full months must have passed since the last visit).
Who’s eligible?

All people with Medicare are covered for the AWV.

Your costs in Original Medicare
You pay nothing for the “Welcome to Medicare” preventive visit or the yearly “Wellness” visit if your doctor or other qualified health care provider accepts assignment. The Part B deductible doesn’t apply.
However, if your doctor or other health care provider performs additional tests or services during the same visit that aren’t covered under these preventive benefits, you may have to pay coinsurance, and the Part B deductible may apply.
Read an article about this benefit on USNews.com.
Note: Your doctor or other health care provider may recommend you get services more often than Medicare covers. Or, they may recommend services that Medicare doesn’t cover. If this happens, you may have to pay some or all of the costs. It’s important to ask questions so you understand why your doctor is recommending certain services and whether Medicare will pay for them.
For more information about the AWV, visit the Medicare website or on MyMedicareMatters.org.

WellTrackONE Corporation, a Risk Management Company, is the industry leader in providing wellness programs and enabling organizations to significantly increase their revenue, decrease cost and predict risk of chronic disease.
WellTrackONE offers an effective way to collect data from Medicare patients and compile that data for documentation of required reports powered by a proprietary evidence-based risk stratification engine. Our population health management tool allows organizations to risk-stratify their patient population to identify high risk chronic disease and fall-risk problems before they occur.
WellTrackONE utilizes our THEO and PreventONE products for the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) and our
CareONE product for Medicare Advantage and Commercial organizations.

How Does PreventONE™ Work?
Watch our video to see how the PreventONE™ system helps physicians, ACOs, hospitals, IPAs and Post-Acute Care Facilities administer the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit for all your Medicare patients year after year with no change in workflow by physicians or your staff. The Annual Wellness Visit is a catalyst for a physician to grow their business with substantial revenue without having to change their current day-to-day operations. WellTrackONE utilizes their PreventONE™ system to work with your organization and offer your Medicare patients access to their Annual Wellness Visits year after year. We provide a full service wellness solution, including scheduling, screening and documentation that allows you to provide wellness visits for all your Medicare patients in a seamless process.
 


 
 
 
 
 





 

How Does THEO Work?
THEO is a wellness screening for ALL your Medicare patients that come in for their regularly scheduled appointments. An iPad is used in either the waiting room or exam room and the patient will complete this wellness self-assessment. This is the perfect use of the patient’s time as they wait to see their physician! THEO utilizes the time patients wait to see the physician,  identifies additional preventative services, has high patient satisfaction, requires no extra CMA or nurse and maximizes AWV completion at your practice.

WellTrackONE Corporation, a Risk Management Company, is the industry leader in providing wellness programs and enabling organizations to significantly increase their revenue, decrease cost and predict risk of chronic disease.
WellTrackONE offers an effective way to collect data from Medicare patients and compile that data for documentation of required reports powered by a proprietary evidence-based risk stratification engine. Our population health management tool allows organizations to risk-stratify their patient population to identify high risk chronic disease and fall-risk problems before they occur.
WellTrackONE utilizes our THEO and PreventONE products for the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) and our
CareONE product for Medicare Advantage and Commercial organizations.

How Does PreventONE™ Work?
Watch our video to see how the PreventONE™ system helps physicians, ACOs, hospitals, IPAs and Post-Acute Care Facilities administer the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit for all your Medicare patients year after year with no change in workflow by physicians or your staff. The Annual Wellness Visit is a catalyst for a physician to grow their business with substantial revenue without having to change their current day-to-day operations. WellTrackONE utilizes their PreventONE™ system to work with your organization and offer your Medicare patients access to their Annual Wellness Visits year after year. We provide a full service wellness solution, including scheduling, screening and documentation that allows you to provide wellness visits for all your Medicare patients in a seamless process.
 


 
 
 
 
 





 

How Does THEO Work?
THEO is a wellness screening for ALL your Medicare patients that come in for their regularly scheduled appointments. An iPad is used in either the waiting room or exam room and the patient will complete this wellness self-assessment. This is the perfect use of the patient’s time as they wait to see their physician! THEO utilizes the time patients wait to see the physician,  identifies additional preventative services, has high patient satisfaction, requires no extra CMA or nurse and maximizes AWV completion at your practice.
