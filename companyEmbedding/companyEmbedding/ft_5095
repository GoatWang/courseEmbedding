Nominal Tape Widths vs Actual Widths







 Tape rolls are cut to standard tape industry metric widths of approx. 24mm per 1-inch of nominal width ordered. As a result ACTUAL tape widths are normally 5% narrower than the NOMINAL width shown in inches. Examples:


1" Nominal width = 15/16" (24mm) Actual width
2" Nominal width = 1-7/8" (48mm) Actual width
3" Nominal width = 2-13/16" (72mm) Actual width


Note that tape rolls are NOT guaranteed to be splice-free.


 Custom Tape WidthsMay be Available!


Need custom sized or "full-cut" width tapes? Many of our tapes come to our converter as full wide width "log rolls" (not pre-cut), and can be custom cut to widths not shown in the pricing table.
Contact us today for pricing and minimum requirements to order your desired tape in a custom width.
Please note that since this tape comes in "log roll" format most rolls ship on a plain white core (i.e. with no branding or text inside the core).












Product Description
Patco 5095 Auto Headliner Anti-Squeak, Anti-Itch Tape is used for itching & squeaking prevention within a headliner assembly. It creates a barrier between foam and the roof of a vehicle and is an alternative to commonly used felt tape. Patco 5095 creates an aggressive and permanent bond to headliner foam (will bond to Dow IMPAXX™ foam) and various other surfaces. All used for wire harness attachment to car headliner and other substrates. Comes on a paper release liner for ease of application. Patco 5095 is thicker and has higher tensile strength then Patco 5075, yet 5075 has slightly higher adhesion.

hot melt rubber (synthetic)
Offers the widest range of application flexibility available. Exhibits excellent processing performance whether manually or automatically applied. Has superior tensile strength, adhesion properties and holding force which ensures consistent, reliable seals. Hot melt adhesive will bond faster to a surface which is referred to as quick-grab or quick-stick. It typically has higher tack (will feel stickier to the touch), but is also softer. It has lower heat resistance, shear resistance, and sometimes UV resistance than an acrylic adhesive. NOTE: it is called hot melt because the adhesive is applied hot by the manufacturer and then hardens as it cools (you do not need to apply heat to the tape yourself).
natural rubber
Properties are similar to that of hot melt rubber, but natural rubber often holds where other adhesives won't (recycled fibers, dust, cold, heat and heavy loads). It provides good overall adhesion and moisture resistance.
acrylic
Offer excellent performance, especially for applications in temperatures less than 40°F and greater then 120°F. It provides excellent clarity, has high shear strength, is usually more permanent/durable even when exposed to moisture, and it ages well over extended periods in fluorescent and sunlight. Since it remains clear for the life of the application and does not yellow over time it is ideal for applications such as sealing white cartons. While it has good initial adhesion it does take 24-48 hours to cure and to achieve its maximum bond strength (has gradual adhesion buildup). Another difference between hot melt rubber and acrylic adhesive is if you fold tape over making the two adhesive sides touch the acrylic adhesive will remain attached to the carrier (e.g. paper, film) while a hot melt adhesive will stick to itself and pull off of the carrier. It is the best choice for clarity, UV resistance and aging characteristics.
silicone
Is great for extreme temperature applications since silicone adhesive can work in continuous operating temperatures from -100°F to 500°F. They also exhibit good chemical resistance, retain electrical properties, and remove cleanly with little or no residue.
zinc oxide
Zinc oxide based adhesive formula is a skin-friendly adhesive which is commonly used on sports medicine tapes.


Thickness, AKA caliper or gauge, refers to the distance from one surface of a tape backing, or adhesive, to the other.
1 mil = 1/1000 of an inch
Examples: 1/16 inch = 62.5 mils; 1/32 inch = 31.25 mils

5095 Ribbon is a performance resin product with excellent print quality, durability and chemical resistance on a wide range of substrates from coated papers to gloss synthetics. The 5095 ribbon requires lower burn temperatures than other ribbons in its class. This ribbon is an excellent choice for high-density codes and high-resolution graphics. The 5095 can print Z-Ultimate products at speeds up to 8 inches per second.
