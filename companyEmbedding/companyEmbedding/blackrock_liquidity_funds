Equity Beta
Beta is a measure of the tendency of securities to move with the market as a whole. A beta of 1 indicates that the security&#39;s price will move with the market. A beta less than 1 indicates the security tends to be less volatile than the market, while a beta greater than 1 indicates the security is more volatile than the market.<br/><br/>Calculated vs. S&amp;P 500

Standard Deviation (3y)
Standard deviation measures how dispersed returns are around the average. A higher standard deviation indicates that returns are spread out over a larger range of values and thus, more volatile.

as of 30-Jun-2017



0.26%




Distribution Yield
The annual yield an investor would receive if the most recent fund distribution and current fund price stayed the same going forward. It’s calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution and dividing by the fund’s net asset value (NAV) from the as-of date.

as of 24-Jul-2017



1.35%




12m Trailing Yield
The yield an investor would have received if they had held the fund over the last twelve months assuming the most recent NAV. The 12-Month yield is calculated by assuming any income distributions over the past twelve months and dividing by the sum of the most recent NAV and any capital gain distributions made over the past twelve months.

as of 24-Jul-2017



1.18%




30 Day SEC Yield
A standard calculation of yield introduced by the SEC in order to provide fairer comparison among funds. This yield reflects the interest earned after deducting the fund&#39;s expenses during the most recent 30-day period by the average investor in the fund. Negative 30-Day SEC Yield results when accrued expenses of the past 30 days exceed the income collected during the past 30 days.

as of 24-Jul-2017



1.48%




30 Day SEC Yield Month End
A standard calculation of yield introduced by the SEC in order to provide fairer comparison among funds. This yield reflects the interest earned after deducting the fund&#39;s expenses during the most recent 30-day period by the average investor in the fund.

Effective Duration
Effective Duration measures the sensitivity of the price of a bond with or without embedded options to changes in interest rates, taking into account the likelihood of the bond being called, put and/or sunk prior to its final maturity date while incorporating after-tax impacts on the bond. The options-based duration model used by BlackRock employs certain assumptions and may differ from other fund complexes. Effective Duration is measured at the individual bond level, aggregated to the portfolio level, and adjusted for leverage, hedging transactions and non-bond holdings, including derivatives.

as of 25-Jul-2017



0.32 yrs




Weighted Avg Maturity
The average length of time to the repayment of principal for the securities in the fund. This metric considers the likelihood that bonds will be called or prepaid before the scheduled maturity date.

as of 25-Jul-2017



0.89 yrs




Option Adjusted Spread
The weighted average incremental yield earned over similar duration US Treasuries, measured in basis points. This metric considers the likelihood that bonds will be called or prepaid before the scheduled maturity date.

Average Yield
The discount rate that equates the present value of a bond’s cash flows with its market price (including accrued interest).

Credit quality ratings on underlying securities of the fund are received from S&P, Moody’s and Fitch and converted to the equivalent S&P major rating category. This breakdown is provided by BlackRock and takes the median rating of the three agencies when all three agencies rate a security the lower of the two ratings if only two agencies rate a security and one rating if that is all that is provided. Unrated securities do not necessarily indicate low quality. Below investment-grade is represented by a rating of BB and below. Ratings and portfolio credit quality may change over time.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.


The Fund is actively managed and does not seek to replicate the performance of a specified index. The Fund may have a higher portfolio turnover than funds that seek to replicate the performance of an index.


Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments.


Securities with floating or variable interest rates may decline in value if their coupon rates do not keep pace with comparable market interest rates. The Fund’s income may decline when interest rates fall because most of the debt instruments held by the Fund will have floating or variable rates.


The Fund is not a money market fund and is not subject to the strict rules that govern the quality, maturity, liquidity and other features of securities that money market funds may purchase. Under normal circumstances, the Fund’s investments may be more susceptible than a money market fund is to credit risk, interest rate risk, valuation risk and other risks relevant to the Fund’s investments. The Fund does not seek to maintain a stable net asset value of $1.00 per share. The Fund will hold securities with floating or variable interest rates which may decline in value if their coupon rates do not reset as high, or as quickly, as comparable market interest rates. Although floating rate notes are less sensitive to interest rate risk than fixed rate securities, they are subject to credit and default risk, which could impair their value.


Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined for most ETFs), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.


Index returns are for illustrative purposes only. Index performance returns do not reflect any management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Indexes are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index. Past performance does not guarantee future results.


After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown. The after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.


Certain sectors and markets perform exceptionally well based on current market conditions and iShares Funds can benefit from that performance. Achieving such exceptional returns involves the risk of volatility and investors should not expect that such results will be repeated.


The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).

Can ETFs help enhance liquidity?








 


Jun 30, 2015














Even as exchange traded funds (ETFs) have become increasingly popular among many types of investors, some misperceptions have arisen, including that they are less liquid, or harder to sell than other investments. In fact, the opposite has been true. ETFs are not only generally easy to trade, but they also can play an important role in rebalancing supply and demand during market volatility.Here’s a look at where ETF liquidity comes from and why it matters for investors.
It’s been said that liquidity is like oxygen: you only notice it when it’s gone. And indeed, under normal conditions, liquidity is taken for granted, with enough buyers and sellers in the market to avoid dramatic changes in an asset’s price as it trades.
That balance can be upset during market crises, when there are often many more sellers than buyers. Liquidity risk is the possibility that a lack of liquidity will make it difficult and costly to enter and, more importantly, to exit trading positions.
ETFs are funds that trade on an exchange, like individual securities. And just like mutual funds and securities, ETF investments will be more or less liquid depending on market conditions; the more liquid they are, the easier and more cost-effectively they tend to trade.









ETF liquidity is derived from two main sources that are constantly interacting, based on market activity.









Because ETF exchange trades match buyers/sellers with no direct trading of the ETF’s underlying holdings, ETF liquidity on exchanges is incremental to underlying market liquidity.
Where does ETF liquidity come from? It’s derived from two main sources that are constantly interacting, based on market activity:
Source 1: The underlying ETF basket
As with mutual funds, ETFs “wrap” a collection of securities, known as the basket. That ETF wrapper is then divided into shares, which are traded freely over an exchange just as a stock is traded. Buying and selling a collective exposure is much easier and cheaper than trying to trade each of the individual securities separately.
The starting point for any discussion on ETF liquidity begins with the basket, and the process for creating and redeeming shares. New shares are created by authorized participants (APs), the specialized firms that buy and sell an ETF’s published basket (a representative portion of its investment portfolio) in exchange for shares; those shares are provided by an ETF sponsor like iShares.
Since the basket can be exchanged for shares at any point (and vice versa), an ETF will be at least as liquid as its underlying basket of securities. Thus, an ETF with an underlying basket of large-cap U.S. stocks will generally be more liquid, with a tighter bid/ask spread, than one that tracks a basket of international small-cap stocks.
Source 2: The stock exchange
ETFs have access to an additional layer of liquidity on the exchange (the New York Stock Exchange, for example). This is where you’ll find almost all individual investors and financial advisors trading ETFs.
ETF liquidity on an exchange is driven largely by supply and demand, as buyers and sellers meet throughout the trading day, just as they would with an individual stock. The ability to match buyers and sellers in this market, without the need to create or redeem shares from the basket, benefits investors by lowering overall transaction costs and fostering greater liquidity.









ETF liquidity on an exchange is driven largely by supply and demand, as buyers and sellers meet throughout the trading day, just as they would with an individual stock.









Most ETF shares trade hands many more times on the exchange than through the creation/redemption process. This is very different from mutual funds, whose only source of liquidity is the fund provider.
Managing liquidity risk in volatile markets
In turbulent markets, there is often an imbalance in the number of buyers and sellers. What happens to ETFs on extreme days, when there is a strong influx of sellers all at once?
In such a case, the APs may step in as a buyer of ETF shares from investors, priced at the value of the securities in the basket. Those shares are handed back to the ETF sponsor in exchange for physical shares of the underlying securities, which the APs can then resell on the market.
Ultimately, reducing the number of shares available on the exchange can improve the liquidity of the market as a whole, by helping to restore the balance of supply and demand. (See “Do ETFs add market volatility?”)






ETF vs. mutual fund liquidity
ETFs and mutual funds have a number of similarities. Both are structured to provide diversified exposure to an asset class or sector, and sliced into shares that reflect a portion of the underlying holdings.
However, during many market environments, ETFs can actually access an additional layer of liquidity on the stock exchange where buyers and sellers can offset each other's transactions without necessarily having to trade in the underlying market.
