Investment Process







Stuyvesant Capital - Since 1978





















Our Expertise



Our Investment ProcessOur investment process begins with a global macro analysis from which we develop a client appropriate risk/reward profile. This gives us a wider range of investment opportunities, allowing us to better diversify risk across domestic sectors and multiple markets.Our investment process is based on a traditional top-down global macroeconomic trend analysis.Step 1: Determine the optimal global investment opportunities.Step 2: Implement tactical strategies to reflect anticipated trend changes (i.e. asset allocation shift between equities, bonds, and cash).Step 3: Use BCA Research's sector/industry rotation strategy in order to overweight those areas with improving cyclical trends, while underweighting those with deteriorating trends.Step 4: Screen individual securities for balance sheet strength and management efficiency using Stuyvesant's Ratio Analysis.  Determine "fair value" for each investment using our Earnings and Dividend Discount Model.Step 5: Continuously monitor the positions in a portfolio context to ensure an adequate valuation cushion between our portfolio holdings and the market.  This risk control measure should provide our investments with support during periods of market weakness.Stuyvesant Capital Management favors a medium to long term investment strategy.  For core equities we emphasize large and mid capitalization stocks. We have a strict buy/sell discipline.  Our risk exposure is monitored continually and we regularly review our clients’ investments and objectives.  We take advantage of global equity diversification, investing in the U.S. market, emerging markets and EAFE (Europe, Australia and Far East).  Capital preservation has always been and will always be a top priority at Stuyvesant Capital Management.

Asset Allocation







Stuyvesant Capital - Since 1978





















Products & Services



Asset AllocationIn our balanced portfolios, assets are allocated between equities, fixed income securities and cash.  Strategic asset allocation is based on client’s investment goals:  growth, current income, and risk tolerance. We work with each client to tailor appropriate investment guidelines.  The result is a strategic benchmark with specific asset weightings.The next step is to optimize risk and adjusted portfolio returns through tactical asset allocation. This process is ongoing and is governed by change in the risk-free rate relative to expected returns on both stocks and bonds, as well as the relative returns of stocks versus bonds.Tactical asset allocation measures the risk exposure of an asset class and the expected return from that class. The firm will hold cash in lieu of stocks or bonds when it is determined that risks are too high. The goal is to adjust the strategic benchmark reflecting changes in the global macro economy.

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

Gold Coast Federal Credit Union


                                            Gold Coast Federal Credit Union Overdraft fees are ridiculous! I was charged a $38 fee for not having $2.00 in my checking account. I called to speak to a representative about the matter and he was very rude. I was also told I am going to be charged a $8.00 fee everyday my...show more

AAA Insurance


                                            I submitted a claim for a burglary in April. The beginning of this joke is that the girl that answered the 800 number didn't know where claims were sent. She had me send my claim to the Walnut Creek, California office. When I contacted the adjuster IN OKLAHOMA CITY, he said...show more

Stay far, far away from this nightmare of an experience from the website to the customer service line to the joke of a mobile app. Overdraft fees are insane at $37, sometimes more if they cover it.

                                            While the card offers nice perks, just like every other crappy card, there are hidden fees. I purchased 1400 dollars worth of stuff, and believing I had 12 months to pay off, I didn't worry about it for the first two months. The next time I looked they had hit me with 100$...show more

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?
