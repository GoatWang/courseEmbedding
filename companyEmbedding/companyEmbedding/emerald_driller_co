(OTCMKTS:VTGDF) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Vantage Drilling - The Jackup Emerald Driller Spuds First Wildcat For Ophir In ThailandOct.22.15 | About: Vantage Drilling (VTGDF) Fun Trading Special situations, contrarian, long/short equity, valueSummaryThe jackup Emerald Driller spudded its first well in Thailand for UK Ophir. A potential eight-well option could be exercised until March 2016, depending on the results.The Emerald Driller secured a two-well extension at a reduced day rate of $80k/d until January 2016, or a 50-day contract.We are still waiting for official news regarding what the company intends to do. A restructuring seems unavoidable at the moment; the question is: What will it be?This article is an update of my preceding article on Vantage Drilling (OTCPK:VTGDF), published on Sept. 30, 2015.

Image: Jackup Emerald Driller, taken from Vantage's website.
On Oct. 21, 2015, we learned the following from Upstreamonline.com:

The independent spun the bit on the Soy Siam prospect probe on Block G4/50 in the western part of the Gulf with the jack-up Emerald Driller.
The G4/50-10 well is targeting Tertiary Miocene sandstones that are equivalent in age to Ophir's producing Bualuang oilfield just 15 kilometres to the north.
Soy Siam has estimated mean prospective resources of 25 million barrels of oil, with a 21% chance of success...
...Once the first probe is drilled, the Vantage Drilling-owned rig will move onto the Parichat South West prospect, where there is a cluster of four fault blocks.
'Each fault block has multiple stacked, Miocene and Oligocene reservoir targets,' Ophir said. The southwest fault block is the initial target, with mean prospective resources again of 25 million barrels of oil, but with a 32% chance of success.
If that well is successful, Ophir said the Parichat South East prospect 'would form an immediate follow-on location.'
'There is considerable additional potential in the event of success in either of these wells,' the company said.



Source: Personal composite.
The estimated cost of the two firm wells is around $18 million, with drilling expected to take a combined 50 days. Initially, the JU Emerald Driller was contracted initially by Ophir until September 2015 at a dayrate of $156k/d. However, after renegotiating -- blend and extend type -- Vantage Drilling was able to push the contract for two-well until early January 2016, and also secure an option for eight-well at a new dayrate of $80k/d applied retroactively from June 2015. Depending on the new results, the company will probably be able to secure a two- or three-month extension at $80k/d.

Since the termination of the Titanium Explorer, we haven't heard anything from the company and what they intend to do. A restructuring under Chapter 11 is probably on its way, but unfortunately CEO Paul Bragg has been totally silent. The stock price totally collapsed to just a few pennies after being delisted from NYSE to pink sheets, where it is still trading under the ticker VTGDF.


VTGDF data by YCharts
This situation is not dramatic in and of itself, and a few investors -- such as myself -- expected this outcome, especially after the termination of the Titanium Explorer. However, the most damaging is this type of inadmissible "nonchalance," and the lack of basic respect toward shareholders that public companies in financial trouble always exhibit. It should be required by law that a company maintains a sufficient and timely communication flow with its shareholders, especially in those situations. I can't imagine the distress of so many small investors being forced to wait without knowing their ultimate fate. It also creates a material disadvantage compared to the bondholders who are negotiating now and probably "trade" the stock somehow.
I have seen this exact situation with Hercules Offshore (OTCPK:HEROQ) and, recently, with Paragon Offshore (PGN). As soon as financial troubles are on the horizon, the umbilical connection between the company and its shareholders is definitely severed. Thus, nothing has been announced regarding what the final decision will be. Worse, after delisting, some traders are not even able to trade the stock anymore.
Also, Vantage Drilling is involved with numerous lawsuits and disputes that haven't been solved until now. For instance, a huge dispute arose regarding the executive Hsin Chi Su, known as Nobu Su, and his alleged manipulation while on the Vantage Drilling board of directors. Su was involved with Vantage Drilling through F3 Capital, which owns a significant number of VTGDF shares and has been disputed by Vantage Drilling, claiming wrongdoing and asking the court in Texas to return the shares to the company. This whole affair is like the Petrobras bribery case in connection with the Titanium Explorer now terminated by Petrobras, which was working in the Gulf of Mexico at the time.

As noted on Aug. 6, 2015:

Brazilian prosecutors on Thursday presented formal charges against Jorge Zelada, the former head of state-run oil firm Petrobras' international division, and five others, saying they favored U.S. company Vantage Drilling in a rig contract.
The most recent charges presented in Brazil's largest-ever corruption scandal included money laundering and corruption, and Zelada will stand trial with dozens of other engineering tycoons and former Petrobras executives if a judge accepts them.
One of the six charged by the prosecutor was Hsin Chi Su, chief executive of Taiwanese shipping firm TMT.
The federal prosecutor's office in the southern city of Curitiba said in a statement that Su and the others paid bribes of $31 million to Zelada, other ex-Petrobras officials, and Brazil's PMBD political party.
The PMDB, or Brazil Democratic Movement Party, is part of President Dilma Rousseff's governing coalition.

Of course, on Oct. 20, 2015, F3 Capital denied any or all allegations of misconduct -- what a surprise:
F3 Capital denies any involvement in misconduct or corruption whatsoever in relation to all of the matters concerning the drillship Titanium Explorer, Vantage Drilling and Petrobras.
I am hopeful that this situation will be resolved soon. I believe the company has a strong case against Nobu Su/F3 capital, and should get a favorable judgement. However, the Titanium Explorer has been terminated and Petrobras alleged some unclear technical breach to refuse to pay any compensation, which has been contested by the company in a Texas court. The other dispute is about the under-construction Cobalt Explorer termination by Vantage Drilling. The matter is still being negotiated with the shipyard and legal claims have been filed.
Conclusion
Vantage Drilling is drifting and has now been frozen in time. In a few weeks, the shares totally collapsed and were delisted. The company and Paul Bragg, who is supposedly in charge of the communication between the company and its shareholders, are refusing to come up with any updates that could help us figure out what's going on. Just an honest global assessment would be sufficient.

We still do not know why Petrobras terminated the Titanium Explorer and when we can expect a court judgement in the Nobu case, if ever. In this condition, what's left for all shareholders is perhaps a little hope that, somehow, the restructuring in progress will leave some crumbs for the common shareholders. However, I do not have any high expectations at the moment. Only time will tell.
