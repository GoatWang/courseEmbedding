Making a Difference





Through extraordinary innovation, OvaScience seeks to transform the world’s understanding of a woman’s biology and empower women worldwide. The Company’s treatments focus on addressing the following:





INCREASING LIVE BIRTH RATES AND REDUCING THE NUMBER OF IVF CYCLES
By improving egg health, we believe we may increase the number of higher quality embryos resulting from an IVF cycle and, in so doing, reduce the IVF cycles required.

REDUCING THE INCIDENCE OF MULTIPLE BIRTHS
OvaScience’s EggPC technology may allow for the transfer of fewer embryos per cycle and, as a result, lower the incidence of multiple births and the associated complications.


LOWERING THE OVERALL COST OF IVF
If we reduce the number of IVF cycles required for a live birth and reduce the incidence of multiple births, we believe our treatments also may lower the overall costs associated with IVF.

REDUCING THE NEED FOR HORMONAL HYPERSTIMULATION
Currently in preclinical development, the OvaTureSM treatment could reduce, or possibly eliminate, the need for hormonal hyperstimulation for the maturation of fertilizable eggs.

Technology
Each treatment option OvaScience is developing utilizes the breakthrough discovery of EggPCSM cells – immature egg cells found inside the protective ovarian lining.






















OvaScience’s proprietary technology platform leverages the breakthrough discovery of egg precursor (EggPCSM) cells. EggPC cells are immature egg cells found inside the protective ovarian lining that have the potential to be matured into new, fertilizable eggs. It was long believed a woman was born with a set number of eggs that die over time. The presence of EggPC cells changes that fundamental understanding about female biology, and opens up extraordinary possibilities to help women improve their fertility.
 EggPC cells were first discovered by one of OvaScience’s scientific founders, Jonathan Tilly, Ph.D. Subsequent research demonstrated that EggPC cells exist in human ovaries and have the potential to develop into mature eggs, thereby replenishing a woman’s egg supply.
  OvaScience’s EggPC technology platform is the foundation for each of our fertility treatments. To learn more about the application of our technology, visit our Treatments section.

Fertility
OvaScience wants to transform what we know about a woman’s biology and reshape the conversation around fertility.






















Think of eight women you know. Research suggests that at least one of them is facing fertility challenges. The rate of female infertility is sobering – and yet the topic is often avoided and sometimes secretive.
  This avoidance has led to a lack of awareness about female fertility in society today. Most people have no idea how common fertility challenges are for women or how daunting it can be to overcome these obstacles.
  Female fertility is a vastly underserved area. There are not enough options today that specifically address female fertility, egg health or egg production. The success of in vitro fertilization (IVF), the current standard of care, is highly dependent on the woman’s age, but overall has an average success rate of 30%.
 
  OvaScience wants to transform what we know about a woman’s biology and reshape the conversation around infertility, while helping women around the world by developing new fertility treatments. How are we doing that? Through extraordinary innovation. 








Fertility Myths & Facts













[Myth #1]
“Women are born with a set number of eggs that die over time. “
+ Reveal Truth


[The Facts]
The breakthrough discovery of egg precursor (EggPCSM) cells in humans changed the long-held belief that women have a finite supply of eggs – and opens up extraordinary possibilities to help women improve their fertility.
  EggPC cells are immature egg cells found inside the protective ovarian lining that have the potential to be matured into healthy, young, fertilizable eggs. OvaScience is leveraging EggPC cells to create treatments that can expand a woman’s egg reserve and help her produce new eggs without hormone injections.
+ Next Myth




[Myth #2]
“IVF usually results in pregnancy.”
+ Reveal Truth


[The Facts]
IVF does not always result in pregnancy. The success of IVF, the current standard of care, is highly dependent on the woman’s age, but overall has an average success rate of 30%. OvaScience is focused on improving IVF success rates.
+ Next Myth




[Myth #3]
“Delaying IVF until later in life will not impact rate of success.”
+ Reveal Truth


[The Facts]
IVF success rates are frequently tied to the age of the patient. While most women know that age impacts their fertility, often they do not realize that it can impact IVF outcomes too. OvaScience’s treatments have the potential to increase IVF success rates by improving egg health, increasing egg reserve and developing the next generation of IVF.
+ Next Myth




[Myth #4]
“Only a small percentage of women need fertility assistance.”
+ Reveal Truth


[The Facts]
The prevalence of women facing fertility challenges worldwide is staggering. It shocks many people to learn that one in eight women struggle with infertility. (World Health Organization) There is a vast need for new treatment options as there are not enough options.
+ Next Myth




[Myth #5]
“If IVF fails, there are other fertility treatment options to try.”
+ Reveal Truth


[The Facts]
IVF is the standard of care. If it is not successful, women often consider doing another IVF cycle, stopping, using a donor egg or adopting. OvaScience is working to improve IVF success rates with the introduction of egg-based treatments.

OvaScience, Inc. 




OvaScience makes miracles happen. Founded in 2011, with the goal of improving the treatment of infertility, the company assembled a team of scientists, physicians and advisers that are recognized leaders in the field of reproductive medicine. In 2015, baby Zain Rajani was born.  Zain was the first baby born with the assistance of OvaScience's first product (AUGMENT) which increases the success of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and uses the mothers own cellular energy to revitalize her egg.  For Bessemer, backing the OvaScience founders in 2011 was an easy decision.   We’d funded Michelle Dipp, Christoph Westphal, and Rich Aldrich before.  (In fact, we’ve funded Christoph five times!)  OvaScience (NASDAQ: OVAS) became a public company in 2012.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

OvaScience Inc (NASDAQ:OVAS) Is A Potentially Rewarding Biotech Play

OvaScience Inc (NASDAQ:OVAS) is an interesting one. At the end of last week, the company traded for just $1.32 dollars a share, coming off the back of a long-term depreciation that saw the company lose more than 97% of its valuation subsequent to 2015 highs. It’s had a couple of fresh CEO hires throughout its life to date, but hasn’t had much luck in terms of marketing its portfolio of fertilization aid products globally.

Over the last few months, however, certain steps have been taken to turn things around, and as action this week demonstrates, it looks as though these steps are starting to have the desired effect.
At last count, the company traded for $1.91 a share – a more than 46% appreciation on it end of last week pricing. It’s nothing spectacular and it’s far, far from a full recovery, but it’s a start.
A start, that is, and we think there’s plenty more run-room left on this one, with this thesis driven by the fact that, from the perspective of risk reward ratios, it’s incredibly attractive.
Here is what we are looking at.
For those familiar with this company’s legacy operations, namely its Augment fertility boosting product, the easiest thing would be to forget what you know. As per the recent pivot, the company is now focusing on the development of two new fertility products altogether, with one serving as the primary and one as a sort of secondary, follow-up pipeline asset. It may offload Augment near term, which could mean a nice capital injection, but operationally it’s discontinued.
Going forward, the majority of this company’s valuation is rooted in the former of these two assets, what’s called OvaPrime.
Last week, OvaScience announced that it had completed enrollment in an ongoing clinical study of the treatment. It’s a tolerability study right now, designed to assess the safety of OvaPrime in women with either primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) or poor ovarian response (POR). To explain briefly how it works, women have what are called egg precursor (EggPCSM) cells in the lining of their ovaries, which are a sort of immature egg cell. With OvaPrime, OvaScience is attempting to convert the cells into mature and fertile egg cells and – in doing so – overcome issues associated with the two above conditions, POI and POR in female patients.
From a near-term catalyst perspective, we should get data from at least 20 of these patients hitting press before the end of 2017. The company also expects to complete biopsies in all 70 patients by the end of this year, and have topline available on all 70 by the end of the first half 2018.
Fertility science is an incredibly large market. It’s also one that is crying out for new options. If OvaScience can prove this treatment’s safety as part of this ongoing study, it can carry forward into an efficacy study, and that’s where the real catalysts will come.
As per a fresh CEO appointment early this month, the guy at the helm is Christopher Kroeger, who is perhaps best well known for his role overseeing the sale of Cardioxyl to Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) for $2.1 billion in 2015. He took a sabbatical, then, in his own words (in relation to wanting to find a new biotech CEO role), “looked at a number of companies, a key focus was good people and science that I think is transformational.”
He chose OvaScience.
This is as good an endorsement as any in our eyes, and his compensation at the company is very much tied to OvaScience’s success, as illustrated by this inducement grant announced earlier this week.
Perhaps most interestingly, aside from the science, that is, is that this company recently restructured and freed up around $10 million of operating capital annually. Combined with cash on hand, it’s this will see it through first quarter 2020, removing any near to medium term valuation risk for shareholders looking to pick up an exposure at current levels.
Sure, it’s not a great idea to try and catch a falling knife, but in this instance, this company really could be at an inflection point and – as a speculative exposure – is well worth a look.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
