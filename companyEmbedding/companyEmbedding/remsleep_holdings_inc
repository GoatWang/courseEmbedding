(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND PLAN OF OPERATIONS.  Forward-looking Statements  We and our representatives may from time to time make written or oral statements that are "forward-looking," including statements contained in this quarterly report and other filings with the SEC, reports to our stockholders and news releases. All statements that express expectations, estimates, forecasts or projections are forward-looking statements. In addition, other written or oral statements which constitute forward-looking statements may be made by us or on our behalf. Words such as "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "believe," "seek," "estimate," "project," "forecast," "may," "should," variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in or suggested by such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this quarterly report to conform forward-looking statements to actual results. Important factors on which such statements are based are assumptions concerning uncertainties, including but not limited to, uncertainties associated with the following:  Inadequate capital and barriers to raising the additional capital or to obtaining the financing needed to implement our business plans;  �  Our failure to earn revenues or profits;  �  Inadequate capital to continue business;  �  Volatility or decline of our stock price;  �  Potential fluctuation in quarterly results;  �  Rapid and significant changes in markets;  �  Litigation with or legal claims and allegations by outside parties; and  �  Insufficient revenues to cover operating costs.  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto which are included in this quarterly report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ substantially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements included in this discussion as a result of various factors.  Overview  REMSleep Holdings, Inc., f/k/a/ Kat Gold Holdings Corp. (the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 6, 2007. Following its acquisition of Handcamp on June 4, 2010, a gold property located in the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada ("Handcamp"), the Company changed its business model to that of a mineral acquisition, exploration and development company focused primarily on gold properties. On August 26, 2010, the Company's name was changed from Bella Viaggio, Inc. to Kat Gold Holdings Corp.  On January 5, 2015 the name of the Company was changed to REMSleep Holdings, Inc. and the business model was changed to reflect the new direction of the Company; to develop and distribute products to help people affected by sleep apnea.  REMSleep Holdings, Inc. has a patent pending new, innovative sleep apnea product that will meet multiple market needs and be able to reach a large percentage of patients worldwide. REMSleep was founded by two principals with over 35 years of sleep-industry experience, including working at some of the pioneering companies. They have substantial direct knowledge of all current continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) equipment on the market and what it is lacking. This expertise led to the invention of the DeltaWave CPAP interface.  The goal of RemSleep is to achieve optimum compliance and comfort for CPAP patients. Years of research and development have led to the revolutionary DeltaWave CPAP interface, a design that addresses the stubborn issues that continue to affect a patient's ability to comply with treatment. The DeltaWave interface does not disrupt normal breathing mechanics, is not claustrophobic, causes zero work of breathing (WOB), minimizes or eliminates drying of the sinuses, uses less driving pressure, and allows users to feel safe and secure while sleeping.  RemSleep is confident that DeltaWave's unique design will provide patients with a more compliant CPAP interface that provides improved comfort, ease of use, and encourages deep restful sleep. The market for sleep treatment and equipment was $7.96 billion in 2011 and will reach a projected $19.72 billion by 2017, with North America accounting for a majority of the market. More than 8 million CPAP interfaces are sold annually in the U.S., with another 2.5 million globally. There are also an estimated 80 million people with undiagnosed sleep apnea.  The DeltaWave will be launched into the U.S. market first, while CE marking is obtained. REMSleep has already begun discussions with potential industry distributor partners in the U.S., and has received strong interest from a potential distribution partner in Germany that has sales channels/distribution partners throughout the EU. They have no current product like the REMSleep DeltaWave and are awaiting samples for evaluation. REMSleep has also been in contact with two internet retailers. One sells directly to patients online (the largest internet reseller of sleep products), and the other is working with trucking firms (selling direct to drivers).  REMSleep's founders have extensive experience in the sleep industry, and have direct experience in starting companies and introducing unique products. COB Russell Bird, for example, found great success with start-ups Medical Gases Australia and Medical Industries America (both started out of garages before being multimillion-dollar ventures). Tom Wood helped found Innomed Technologies, and has product-development experience developing highly successful products in the industry. The two founders have worked in collaboration for more than 10 years and are now focused on bringing to market the best-in-class DeltaWave CPAP interface, with the goal of becoming a leading product manufacturer and distributor in this fast-growing global market. The owners have invested $100,000 in R&D for the DeltaWave, and are seeking an investment of $1 million for the full launch.  Research and Development  We are currently engaged in the research and development of new products with the intent of launching them in the future. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully develop new products or bring any new products to market.  Our website is: http://www.remsleeptech.com/.  Cash Requirements  We operate with virtually no capital. We have no long term debt and have been able to meet our past financial obligations, including operational expenses, exploration expenses and acquisition costs, on a current basis.  Going Concern  As of June 30, 2016, there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern as we have not generated sufficient cash flow to fund our proposed business.  We have suffered recurring losses from operations since our inception. In addition, we have yet to generate an internal cash flow from our business operations or successfully raised the financing required to develop our proposed business. As a result of these and other factors, our independent auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our future success and viability, therefore, are dependent upon our ability to generate capital financing. The failure to generate sufficient revenues or raise additional capital may have a material and adverse effect upon us and our shareholders.  Management's plans with regard to these matters encompass the following actions:  Liquidity and Capital Resources  We had a cash balance of $12 as of the date of June 30, 2016.  Cash flow from operations.  The net cash provided by operating activities was ($29,088) for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and ($72,318) for the six months ended June 30, 2015.  Cash Flows from Investing  The net cash provided by investing activities was $0 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and ($10,331) for the six months ended June 30, 2015.  Cash Flows from Financing  The net cash provided by financing activities was $28,992 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and $82,649 for the six months ended June 30, 2015.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.  Critical Accounting Policies  We prepare financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our combined and consolidated financial statements and related notes. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information, our own historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. We believe the following accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.  Business Activities. We have not yet earned any revenue from operations. Accordingly, our activities have been accounted for as those of a "Development Stage Enterprise" as set forth in Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 7, "Accounting and Reporting for Development Stage Enterprises" ("SFAS No. 7"). Among the disclosures required by SFAS No. 7 are that our financial statements be identified as those of a development stage operation, and that the statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows disclose activity since the date of our inception.  Basis of Presentation. Our financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with GAAP, whereby revenues are recognized in the period earned and expenses when incurred. We follow SFAS No. 7 in preparing our financial statements.  Management's Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Comprehensive Income (Loss). We adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income," which establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements. There were no items of comprehensive income (loss) applicable to us during the period covered in the financial statements.  Long-Lived Assets. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, we review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may not be recoverable. When such factors and circumstances exist, including those noted above, we compare the assets' carrying amounts against the estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated by those assets over their estimated useful lives. If the carrying amounts are greater than the undiscounted cash flows, the fair values of those assets are estimated by discounting the projected cash flows. Any excess of the carrying amounts over the fair values are recorded as impairments in that fiscal period.  Statement of Cash Flows. For purposes of the statement of cash flows, we consider all highly liquid investments (i.e., investments which, when purchased, have original maturities of three months or less) to be cash equivalents.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates the recorded amounts because of the liquidity and short-term nature of these items.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  We have reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe that any future adoption of such pronouncements will have a material impact on our financial condition or the results of our operations.  Results of Operations  The three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015  For the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015, total revenues were $0 and $0, respectively; and net losses were $3,230 and $38,613 respectively. The net losses were attributable to operating expenses and primarily to impairment charges.  For the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015, total revenues were $0 and $0, respectively; and net losses were $(29,547) and $(72,776) respectively. The net losses were attributable to operating expenses and primarily to impairment charges.  Feb 22, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

RemSleep Holdings, Inc. (OTCMKTS:RMSL) Files An 8-K Changes in Registrant’s Certifying AccountantITEM 4.01 Change in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.
On July 19, 2017, our independent registered public accounting firm, KLJ & Associates, LLP (“KLJ”), resigned as our independent registered public accounting firm. Our audit reports on our consolidated financial statements for each of the two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During our two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016 and during the subsequent interim period from January 1, 2017 through July 19, 2017, (i) there were no disagreements (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) between us and KLJ on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedures that, if not resolved to our satisfaction, would have caused us to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its reports, except that management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2016 and that it had weaknesses in personnel and keeping record keeping up to date; and (ii) there were no “reportable events” as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
We provided KLJ with a copy of the disclosures in this report prior to filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). A copy of KLJs letter dated July 21, 2017 to the SEC, stating whether it agrees with the statements made in this report, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this report.
(b) Engagement of New Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.
On July 21, 2017, our Board of Directors approved the engagement of Michael Gillepsie & Associates, PLLC (“Gillespie”), as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2017, effective immediately.
During the two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016 and during the subsequent interim period from January 1, 2017 through July 21, 2017, neither we or anyone on our behalf consulted with Gillespie regarding either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the our financial statements, and neither a written report nor oral advice was provided to us that Gillespie concluded was an important factor considered by us in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue, or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a “disagreement” or a “reportable event”, each as defined in Regulation S-K Item 304(a)(1)(v), respectively.
ITEM 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
Exhibit 16.1: Letter from KLJ & Associates. LLP dated July 21, 2017 to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The DeltaWave interface does not disrupt normal breathing mechanics, is not claustrophobic, causes zero work of breathing (WOB), minimizes or eliminates drying of the sinuses, and uses less driving pressure.

	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	For the Period Ended March 31, 2017










	NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES







	Business Activity






	REMSleep Holdings, Inc., f/k/a/ Kat Gold Holdings Corp. (the Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 6, 2007. Following its acquisition of Handcamp on June 4, 2010, a gold property located in the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada (Handcamp), the Company changed its business model to that of a mineral acquisition, exploration and development company focused primarily on gold properties. On August 26, 2010, the Companys name was changed from Bella Viaggio, Inc. to Kat Gold Holdings corp. As of this annual report, the Company has not generated any revenues but has incurred expenses related to the drilling and exploration of Handcamp. On January 5, 2015 the name of the Company was changed to REMSleep Holdings, Inc. and the business model was changed to reflect the new direction of the Company; to develop and distribute products to help people affected by sleep apnea. On May 30, 2015 REMSleep LLC was formerly merged into REMSleep Holdings, Inc.






	Basis of Presentation






	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices, establishing and maintaining a system of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud. The Companys system of internal accounting control is designed to assure, among other items, that (1) recorded transactions are valid; (2) all valid transactions are recorded and (3) transactions are recorded in the period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which present fairly the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the respective periods being presented.





	The Companys condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).


	 


	The unaudited condensed consolidated financial information furnished herein reflects all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring items, which in the opinion of management are necessary to fairly state the financial position of the Company and the results of its operations for the periods presented. This report should be read in conjunction with the Companys financial statements and notes thereto included in the Companys Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 

	SEC

	) on March 31, 2017. The Company assumes that the users of the interim financial information herein have read or have access to the audited financial statements for the preceding fiscal year and that the adequacy of additional disclosure needed for a fair presentation may be determined in that context. Accordingly, footnote disclosure, which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the Companys Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 has been omitted. The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year ending December 31, 2017 or any other period.






	Accounting Basis






	The Company uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP accounting). The Company has adopted a December 31 fiscal year end.






	Use of Estimates






	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.






	Cash and Cash Equivalents










	7







	For purposes of the Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.






	Comprehensive Income (Loss)






	The Company reports comprehensive income and its components following guidance set forth by section 220-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification which establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in the consolidated financial statements.

	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	For the Period Ended March 31, 2017







	Long-Lived Assets






	The Company evaluates the recoverability of its fixed assets and other assets in accordance with section 360-10-15 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Disclosure requires recognition of impairment of long-lived assets in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds its expected cash flows. If so, it is considered to be impaired and is written down to fair market value, which is determined based on either discounted future cash flows or appraised values. The Company adopted the statement on inception. No impairments of these types of assets were recognized during the period ended December 31, 2016.






	Risk and Uncertainties






	As of January 5, 2015, the Company is subject to risks common to manufacturing and health product providers.






	Advertising Costs






	Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. The Company does not incur any direct-response advertising costs.






	Stock-Based Compensation






	The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the fair value method following the guidance set forth in section 718-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosure about stock based compensation. This section requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award- the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service.






	Fair Value for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities






	The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("paragraph 820-10-35-37") to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.





	The three levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:





	Level 1: Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets and liabilities as of the reporting date.





	Level 2: Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.





	Level 3: Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by the market data.





	The carrying amounts of the Company's financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts receivable, rent deposit, accounts payable, customer deposits and notes payable approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.





	There were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the period ended March 31, 2017.

	REMSleep Holdings, Inc. f/k/a KAT GOLD HOLDINGS CORP.




	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	For the Period Ended March 31, 2017










	Fair Value of Financial Statements






	The Companys financial instruments consist of cash and security deposits. The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximate fair value due to either length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial statements.






	Loss Per Share






	Net loss per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during each period. There were no potentially dilutive shares outstanding as of March 31, 2017 and 2016.






	Income Taxes






	Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax basic of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized. It is the Company's policy to classify interest and penalties on income taxes as interest expense or penalties expense. As of March 31, 2017 there have been no interest or penalties incurred on income taxes.






	Recent Accounting Pronouncements






	The Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements will cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.






	NOTE 2 - CAPITAL STOCK






	On January 5, 2016, the Company issued 1 million common shares with a fair value of $30,000 to an investor in exchange for a like amount of expenses that the investor paid on behalf of the Company. The fair value of the shares was based on the price quoted on the OTC bulletin board on the grant date.





	On January 20, 2016, the Company issued as compensation for services provided a total of 1,000,000 common shares with a fair value of $15,000 to a third party. The fair value of the shares was based on the price quoted on the OTC pink sheets on the grant date.





	On February 25, 2016, the Company issued 2 million Class A preferred shares. On April 26, 2016 the Company issued 1.5 million Class A preferred shares. The fair value of the shares was based on the price quoted on the OTC pink sheets on the grant date for the common shares as the preferred shares have a preference to a 1 to 1 conversion to common stock. The Company recognized compensation expense to officers.





	On February 23, 2016, the Company issued as compensation for services provided a total of 200,000 common shares with a fair value of $3,000 to a third party. The fair value of the shares was based on the price quoted on the OTC pink sheets on the grant date.





	On October 5, 2016, the Company issued as compensation for services provided a total of 250,000 common shares with a fair value of $40,000 to a third party. The fair value of the shares was based on the price quoted on the OTC pink sheets on the grant date.





	On January 15, 2017, the Company issued as compensation for services provided a total of 100,000 common shares with a fair value of $5,000 to a third party. The fair value of the shares was based on the price quoted on the OTC pink sheets on the grant date.





	On March 6, 2017, the Company issued as compensation for services provided a total of 650,000 common shares with a fair value of $390,000 to a third party. The fair value of the shares was based on the price quoted on the OTC pink sheets on the grant date.

	ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND PLAN OF OPERATIONS.






	Forward-looking Statements





	There are forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report. All statements that express expectations, estimates, forecasts or projections are forward-looking statements. In addition, other written or oral statements which constitute forward-looking statements may be made by us or on our behalf. Words such as expect, anticipate, intend, plan, believe, seek, estimate, project, forecast, may, should, variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in or suggested by such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this quarterly report to conform forward-looking statements to actual results. Important factors on which such statements are based are assumptions concerning uncertainties, including but not limited to, uncertainties associated with the following:





	·


	Inadequate capital and barriers to raising the additional capital or to obtaining the financing needed to implement our business plans;


	·


	Our failure to earn revenues or profits;


	·


	Inadequate capital to continue business;


	·


	Volatility or decline of our stock price;


	·


	Potential fluctuation in quarterly results;


	·


	Rapid and significant changes in markets;


	·


	Litigation with or legal claims and allegations by outside parties; and


	·


	Insufficient revenues to cover operating costs.





	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto which are included in this quarterly report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ substantially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements included in this discussion as a result of various factors.






	Overview






	We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 6, 2007. On August 26, 2010, we changed our name from Bella Viaggio, Inc. to Kat Gold Holdings Corp. 


	Effective January 1, 2015, we entered into an exchange agreement to purchase 100% of the outstanding interests of RemSleep LLC in exchange for 50,000,000 common shares of RemSleep Holdings, Inc.s stock (the Exchange Agreement). As a result of the exchange, RemSleep LLC became our wholly-owned subsidiary and constitutes our business and operations and we changed our name to REMSleep Holdings, Inc. to reflect our new business model of developing and distributing sleep apnea products.






	12










	Our officers have 35 years of sleep-industry experience, including working at sleep industry companies. Our officers invented our DeltaWave CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) interface (the DeltaWave). We have developed the DeltaWave as an innovative new device to treat patients with sleep apnea. The patent-pending DeltaWave product is a nasal-pillows type interface designed to result in better comfort and, therefore, better compliance. The Delta Wave is specifically designed with unique airflow characteristics to enable patients with sleep apnea to breathe normally. A survey that appeared in DME Business found that 89% of patients stated that mask-interface comfort was their primary concern. The primary issue that we have addressed with the DeltaWave is the work of breathing component. We believe that our DeltaWave is designed to effectively address the stubborn issues that continue to affect a patients ability to comply with treatment, as follows:





	·


	Does not disrupt normal breathing mechanics;


	·


	Is not claustrophobic;


	·


	Causes zero work of breathing (WOB);


	·


	Minimizes or eliminates drying of the sinuses;


	·


	Uses less driving pressure; and


	·


	Allows

	users to feel safe and secure while sleeping.






	We plan to conduct clinical trials to test product effectiveness.





	Our goal is to develop sleep products that achieve optimum compliance and comfort for CPAP patients.





	On June 28, 2016, we applied for a patent for a new, innovative sleep apnea product that serves as an interface for the delivery of CPAP therapy and other respiratory needs.





	Our website is located at: http://www.remsleeptech.com.






	Going Concern






	As of March 31, 2017, there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern as we have not generated sufficient cash flow to fund our proposed business.





	We have suffered recurring losses from operations since our inception. In addition, we have yet to generate an internal cash flow from our business operations or successfully raised the financing required to develop our proposed business. As a result of these and other factors, our independent auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our future success and viability, therefore, are dependent upon our ability to generate capital financing. The failure to generate sufficient revenues or raise additional capital may have a material and adverse effect upon us and our shareholders.





	Managements plans with regard to these matters encompass the following actions: (i) obtaining funding from new investors to alleviate our working capital deficiency, and (ii) implementing a plan to generate sales. Our continued existence is dependent upon our ability to resolve our liquidity problems and increase profitability in our current business operations. However, the outcome of managements plans cannot be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these risks and uncertainties.






	Liquidity and Capital Resources






	We had no cash as of the date of March 31, 2017.






	Cash flow from operations.






	The net cash flow used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were ($414,434) as compared to ($26,031) for the same period ended 2016.






	13











	Cash Flows from Investing






	The net cash flow provided by investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $395,000 as compared to $3,000 for the same period ended 2016.






	Cash Flows from Financing






	The net cash flows from financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $19,434 as compared to $22,992 for the same period ended 2016.






	Results of Operations







	The three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016






	For the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016, total revenues were $0 and $0, respectively, and net losses from operations were $414,663 and $26,260, respectively. The net losses were attributable to costs attributable to operating as a public company, in particular, common stock with a valuation of $390,000 that was issued to an investor relations firm in the first quarter of 2017.






	Off Balance Sheet Arrangements






	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.






	Critical Accounting Policies






	We prepare financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our combined and consolidated financial statements and related notes. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information, our own historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. We believe the following accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.






	Business Activities

	.





	We have not yet earned any revenue from operations. Accordingly, our activities have been accounted for as those of a Development Stage Enterprise as set forth in Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 7, Accounting and Reporting for Development Stage Enterprises (SFAS No. 7). Among the disclosures required by SFAS No. 7 are that our financial statements be identified as those of a development stage operation, and that the statements of operations, shareholders equity and cash flows disclose activity since the date of our inception.






	14











	Basis of Presentation.






	Our financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with GAAP, whereby revenues are recognized in the period earned and expenses when incurred. We follow SFAS No. 7 in preparing our financial statements.






	Managements Use of Estimates

	.





	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.






	Comprehensive Income (Loss).






	We adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, which establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements. There were no items of comprehensive income (loss) applicable to us during the period covered in the financial statements.






	Long-Lived Assets.






	In accordance with SFAS No. 144, we review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may not be recoverable. When such factors and circumstances exist, including those noted above, we compare the assets carrying amounts against the estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated by those assets over their estimated useful lives. If the carrying amounts are greater than the undiscounted cash flows, the fair values of those assets are estimated by discounting the projected cash flows. Any excess of the carrying amounts over the fair values are recorded as impairments in that fiscal period.






	Statement of Cash Flows.






	For purposes of the statement of cash flows, we consider all highly liquid investments (i.e., investments which, when purchased, have original maturities of three months or less) to be cash equivalents.


	Fair Value of Financial Instruments





	Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates the recorded amounts because of the liquidity and short-term nature of these items.






	Recent Accounting Pronouncements






	We have reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe that any future adoption of such pronouncements will have a material impact on our financial condition or the results of our operations.









	ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.






	Not Applicable






	15














	ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES






	Disclosure Controls and Procedures





	Each of our principal executive and principal financial officer has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a - 15(e) and 15d - 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on their evaluation, each such person concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2017. Our management intends, during the 2017 fiscal year, to design and implement processes and procedures that will provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.





	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.





	Our management has evaluated whether any change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the last fiscal quarter. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the relevant period that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	2.


	Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;


	 


	3.


	Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;


	 


	4.


	The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:

	ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS



	 






	We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 6, 2007. On August 26, 2010, we changed our name from Bella Viaggio, Inc. to Kat Gold Holdings Corp.


	Effective January 1, 2015, we entered into an exchange agreement to purchase 100% of the outstanding interests of RemSleep LLC in exchange for 50,000,000 common shares of RemSleep Holdings, Inc.s stock (the Exchange Agreement). As a result of the exchange, RemSleep LLC became our wholly-owned subsidiary and constitutes our business and operations and we changed our name to REMSleep Holdings, Inc. to reflect our new business model of developing and distributing sleep apnea products.





	Our officers have 35 years of sleep-industry experience, including working at sleep industry companies. Our officers invented our DeltaWave CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) interface (the DeltaWave). We have developed the DeltaWave as an innovative new device to treat patients with sleep apnea. The patent-pending DeltaWave product is a nasal-pillows type interface that will result in better comfort and, therefore, better compliance. The Delta Wave is specifically designed with unique airflow characteristics to enable patients with sleep apnea to breathe normally. A survey that appeared in DME Business found that 89% of patients stated that mask-interface comfort was their primary concern. The primary issue that we have addressed with the DeltaWave is the work of breathing component. We believe that our DeltaWave is designed to effectively address the stubborn issues that continue to affect a patients ability to comply with treatment, as follows:





	·


	Does not disrupt normal breathing mechanics;


	·


	Is not claustrophobic;


	·


	Causes zero work of breathing (WOB);


	·


	Minimizes or eliminates drying of the sinuses;


	·


	Uses less driving pressure; and


	·


	Allows users to feel safe and secure while sleeping.





	We plan to conduct clinical trials to test product effectiveness.





	Our goal is to develop sleep products that achieve optimum compliance and comfort for CPAP patients.





	On June 28, 2016, we applied for a patent for a new, innovative sleep apnea product that serves as an interface for the delivery of CPAP therapy and other respiratory needs.

	Industry Background







	The market for sleep treatment and equipment was $7.96 billion in 2011 and will reach a projected $19.72 billion by 2017, with North America accounting for a majority of the market. More than 8 million CPAP interfaces are sold annually in the U.S., with another 2.5 million globally. There are also an estimated 80 million people with undiagnosed sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is a condition that affects millions of people in the United States alone. An increasingly sedentary lifestyle and bad working habits has led to obesity and otherwise poor cardiac and aerobic health. This has led to a fast-growing epidemic of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which greatly reduces the quality of sleep one gets and can ultimately result in hypertension, heart failure, stroke, and at the least, reduced performance in everyday life. The market for sleep treatment and equipment was $7.96 billion in 2011 and will reach a projected $19.72 billion by 2017, with North America accounting for a majority of the market. More than 8 million CPAP interfaces are sold annually in the U.S., with another 2.5 million globally. There are also an estimated 80 million people with undiagnosed sleep apnea. Sleep apnea results in numerous afflictions that affect peoples day-to-day lives and can eventually contribute to serious health conditions. While peoples knowledge of this affliction has grown strongly in recent years, and the market is expanding fast nationwide, up to 80% of people with sleep apnea may be undiagnosed

	1

	 a market of millions of new potential users. Even those who are tested and prescribed a sleep apnea machine often give up after a short time due to discomfort or what is called the work of breathing with traditional machines. In fact, over 50% of patients give up on using CPAP therapy after 6 months. This is a major waste of resources and a very telling statistic.





	A major challenge in the current market is not only to get more patients diagnosed but to also increase CPAP compliance. According to market analyst Frost & Sullivan, The development of finer and ergonomic CPAP devices will help increase patient ability to adhere to sleep therapy. The market is also seeing a rise in newer technologies that replace elaborate practices, target patient comfort to improve compliance, and help drive acceptance of sleep monitoring devices.





	A growing knowledge of sleep apnea and its treatment has helped to increase awareness with the public. In addition to making the use of a CPAP or related device less intimidating, a move toward affordable and prescription-based technology can greatly expand the market Evolving technologies will also influence patient preferences for products, treatment modalities, and diagnostic locations, states Frost & Sullivan. As such, the global sleep apnea treatment market is expected to shift to home-based diagnostics for early identification and treatment of patients as well as portable devices that can reduce sleep apnea with minimal inconvenience.





	Sleep apnea causes breathing interruptions of between 10 to 20 seconds that can occur hundreds of times during a night, disrupting the natural sleep rhythm and depriving people of the restorative sleep they need to be energetic, mentally sharp, and productive the next day. CPAP can be a very effective method used to treat sleep apnea, but as noted, noncompliance remains a stubborn issue for both physicians and patients. CPAP technology therefore is constantly being updated and improved, and the new CPAP devices are lighter, quieter, and more comfortable.





	Health care spending continues to grow rapidly on an annual basis in the United States. Spending was $2.7 trillion in 2011 and, in 2013, it reached over $3.6 trillion. It is projected to reach over $4 trillion by 2015. By 2022, spending is projected to reach $5 trillion, or around 20% of GDP, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

	3

	Growing alongside this market is the U.S. life science industry, which will grow an estimated 2.2% in 2014 to $93 billion. This includes R&D spending, with growth primarily from smaller biopharmaceutical innovators and medical device manufacturers. The global life science industry will reach $201 billion in 2014.

	Within this market, sleep apnea products have experienced rapid growth. In the past couple decades there has been a rapid increase in the technological developments in the field of sleep apnea diagnosis and treatment. The result has been strong growth for sleep apnea devices globally. Demand for new and innovative treatment methodologies is driving growth, helping to provide patients with a healthy lifestyle. Obstructive sleep apnea is destroying the health of millions of Americans, and the problem has only gotten worse over the last two decades, according to American Academy of Sleep Medicine President Dr. Timothy Morgenthaler. The effective treatment of sleep apnea is one of the keys to success as our nation attempts to reduce health care spending and improve chronic disease management.





	Sleep problems are considered a global epidemic, with sleep apnea as a major contributor to the disorder. An estimated 100 million people worldwide have sleep apnea, though more than 80% of these people are undiagnosed. The market for sleep apnea diagnostic and therapeutic devices on a global level was $7.96 billion in 2011 and will reach a projected $19.72 billion by 2017, according to a study from Markets & Markets.

	6

	Nationwide in the U.S., there are more than 1,600 businesses in the Sleep Disorder Clinics market, according to research firm IBISWorld. These businesses have combined annual revenue of $7 billion and have maintained a combined annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.8% from 2008 to 2013. Sleep clinics have gained exposure during the period due to the rising number of sleep disorders, states IBISWorld. Moreover, health insurance policies are increasingly covering all or at least part of the costs of tests and, as more patients have been able to gain greater access to specialized sleep clinics, industry revenue grows.






	4










	There are also more than 972,000 physicians and 365,000 doctors offices,

	11

	as well as nearly 5,800 hospitals.12 In addition, the market for U.S. home healthcare is served by about 30,000 businesses with combined annual revenue of $59 billion. The market includes medical and skilled nursing services; medical equipment, supplies, and medication services; personal care; and therapeutic services (like physical and respiratory therapy).

	Government Regulations




	 



	FDA



	 


	Our products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety, efficacy and adherence to FDA Quality System Regulation, and related manufacturing standards. Medical device products are subject to rigorous FDA and other governmental agency regulations in the United States and similar regulations of foreign agencies abroad. The FDA regulates the design, development, research, preclinical and clinical testing, introduction, manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, marketing, distribution, import and export, and record keeping for such products, to ensure that medical products distributed in the United States are safe and effective for their intended use. In addition, the FDA is authorized to establish special controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of most devices. Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions, fines, civil and administrative penalties, injunctions, suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter supply contracts, and criminal prosecution.


	 


	Unless an exemption applies, the FDA requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a Section 510(k) premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval, or PMA, before introducing it into the U.S. market. The type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the devices safety and effectiveness.


	 


	Our products currently marketed in the United States are marketed in reliance on 510(k) pre-marketing clearances as either Class I or Class II devices. The process of obtaining a Section 510(k) clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and often clinical data, which in some cases can be extensive, to demonstrate that the device is substantially equivalent to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the FDA to be substantially equivalent to such a pre-1976 device, a predecessor device is referred to as predicate device. As a result, FDA clearance requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time. In addition, in some cases, the FDA may require additional review by an advisory panel, which can further lengthen the process. The PMA process, which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for high-risk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life, may take several years and requires the submission of extensive performance and clinical information.


	 


	Medical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved. After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, may require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval and payment of an FDA user fee. The determination as to whether a modification could significantly affect the devices safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. The FDA is currently reviewing its guidance describing when it believes a manufacturer is obligated to submit a new 510(k) for modifications or changes to a previously cleared device. The FDA is expected to issue revised guidance to assist device manufacturers in making this determination. It is unclear whether the FDAs approach in this new guidance will result in substantive changes to existing policy and practice regarding the assessment of whether a new 510(k) is required for changes or modifications to existing devices.

	Any devices we manufacture and distribute pursuant to clearance or approval by the FDA are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies. These include product listing and establishment registration requirements, which help facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory actions. As a medical device manufacturer, our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the FDA. We are required to adhere to applicable regulations setting forth detailed cGMP requirements, as set forth in the QSR, which require, manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process. Noncompliance with these standards can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of devices, withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecutions. We believe that our design, manufacturing and quality control procedures are in compliance with the FDAs regulatory requirements.


	 


	We must also comply with post-market surveillance regulations, including medical device reporting, or MDR, requirements which require that we review and report to the FDA any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury. We must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur.


	 


	Labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. Medical devices approved or cleared by the FDA may not be promoted for unapproved or un-cleared uses, otherwise known as off-label promotion. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution.


	 



	Other Healthcare Laws



	 


	Even though we do not submit claims or bill governmental programs and other third-party payers directly for reimbursement for our products sold in the United States, we are still subject to laws and regulations that may restrict our business practices, including, without limitation, anti-kickback, false claims, physician payment transparency and data privacy and security laws. The government has interpreted these laws broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us.


	 


	The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.


	 


	The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes any request or demand for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The civil False Claims Act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled, such as a rebate. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil False Claims Act.


	 


	The Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them to have committed a violation.


	 


	Also, many states and countries outside the U.S. have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs.






	7







	 


	Under HIPAA, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information used or disclosed by covered entities including health care providers, such as us. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in health care transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. Penalties for violations of HIPAA regulations include civil and criminal penalties. In addition to federal privacy and security regulations, there are state laws governing confidentiality and security of health information that are applicable to our business. New laws governing privacy may be adopted in the future as well. Failure to comply with privacy requirements could result in civil or criminal penalties, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.


	 


	Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities. The Physician Payment Sunshine Act was enacted in law as part of PPACA, which imposed new annual reporting requirements on device manufacturers for payments and other transfers of value provided by them, directly or indirectly, to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their family members. A manufacturers failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities.


	 


	The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal and civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.

	Overview




	 


	We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 6, 2007. Following our acquisition of Handcamp on June 4, 2010, a gold property located in the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, we changed our business model to that of a mineral acquisition, exploration and development company focused primarily on gold properties. On August 26, 2010, our name was changed from Bella Viaggio, Inc. to Kat Gold Holdings Corp. Effective January 1, 2015, we entered into an exchange agreement to purchase 100% of the outstanding interests of RemSleep LLC in exchange for 50,000,000 common shares of RemSleep Holdings, Inc.s stock. As a result of the exchange, RemSleep LLC became our wholly-owned subsidiary and constitutes our business and operations and we changed our name to REMSleep Holdings, Inc. to reflect our new business model of developing and distributing sleep apnea products.





	We have a patented new, innovative sleep apnea product that will meet multiple market needs and be able to reach a large percentage of patients worldwide. We were founded by two principals with over 35 years of sleep-industry experience, including working at some of the sleep apnea pioneering companies. With their knowledge of current CPAP equipment on the market and what it is lacking, they invented the DeltaWave.







	Research and Development







	We are currently engaged in the research and development of new products with the intent of launching them in the future. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully develop new products or bring any new products to market.







	Reports to Security Holders







	We are subject to the reporting, proxy and other requirements of the Exchange Act and we intend to file and make available to our shareholders with annual reports containing financial statements audited by our independent auditors and quarterly reports containing unaudited financial statements for each of the first three quarters of each year, as well as proxy or information statements.





	The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an internet site on which reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC are made available. The address of that site is

	www.sec.gov

	.







	Laws and






	Regulations







	While our intended business activities do not currently violate any laws, any regulatory changes that impose additional restrictions or requirements on us or on our potential customers could adversely affect us by increasing our operating costs or decreasing demand for our products or services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.







	Operating Results





	 





	Revenues.


	We generated revenues of $0 for the year end December 31, 2016, and no revenue in the prior fiscal year.


	 




	Operating expenses.


	We had operating expenses of $197,093 for the year end December 31, 2016, the majority of which was compensation, common stock issuance, and professional fees to prepare and bring our SEC filings up to date. This is compared to operating expenses in the amount of $86,373 for the fiscal year end December 31, 2016.


	 




	Net Loss.


	Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 was ($197,093), compared to ($86,373) for the year end December 31, 2015.









	Liquidity and Capital Resources




	 



	Current and Expected Liquidity



	 


	Cash as of December 31, 2016 was $-0- against total current liabilities of $311,685.

	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates




	 


	Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Preparation of the statements in accordance with these principles requires that we make estimates, using available data and our judgment, for such things as valuing assets, accruing liabilities and estimating expenses. The following is a discussion of the most critical estimates that we must make when preparing our financial statements.


	 




	Revenue Recognition.


	We apply paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. We recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. We consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, (iii) collectability is reasonably assured and (iv) goods have been shipped and/or services rendered.


	 




	Income Taxes and Deferred Income Taxes.


	We use the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as reported for financial statement purposes and income tax purposes and for the future use of net operating losses. We have recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax asset. The valuation allowance reduces deferred income tax assets to an amount that represents managements best estimate of the amount of such deferred income tax assets that more likely than not will be realized.


	 





	Recent Accounting Pronouncements





	 


	We evaluate all accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board during each reporting period to assess their impact on and applicability to our accounting practices and our financial reporting and disclosures.





	We have reviewed all accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board since we last issued financial statements and have determined that none of them have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

	ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA














	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM





	To the Board of Directors


	REMSleep Holdings, Inc.  Des Moines, Iowa





	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of REMSleep,Holdings, Inc.,(the Company) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the related statements of operations, stockholders deficit and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.





	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  The Company has determined that it is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.





	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of REMSleep Holdings, Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the results of their operations and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.





	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that REMSleep Holdings, Inc. will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred losses from operations and is in need of additional capital to grow its operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans with regard to these matters are described in Note 7. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	For the Year Ended December 31, 2016








	NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES






	Business Activity






	REMSleep Holdings, Inc., f/k/a/ Kat Gold Holdings Corp. (the Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 6, 2007. Following its acquisition of Handcamp on June 4, 2010, a gold property located in the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada (Handcamp), the Company changed its business model to that of a mineral acquisition, exploration and development company focused primarily on gold properties. On August 26, 2010, the Companys name was changed from Bella Viaggio, Inc. to Kat Gold Holdings corp. As of this annual report, the Company has not generated any revenues but has incurred expenses related to the drilling and exploration of Handcamp. On January 5, 2015 the name of the Company was changed to REMSleep Holdings, Inc. and the business model was changed to reflect the new direction of the Company; to develop and distribute products to help people affected by sleep apnea.





	On May 30, 2015 REMSleep LLC was formerly merged into REMSleep Holdings, Inc.






	Basis of Presentation






	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices, establishing and maintaining a system of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud. The Companys system of internal accounting control is designed to assure, among other items, that (1) recorded transactions are valid; (2) all valid transactions are recorded and (3) transactions are recorded in the period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which present fairly the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the company for the respective periods being presented.






	Accounting Basis






	The Company uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP accounting). The Company has adopted a December 31 fiscal year end.






	Use of Estimates






	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.






	Cash and Cash Equivalents






	For purposes of the Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.






	Comprehensive Income (Loss)






	The Company reports comprehensive income and its components following guidance set forth by section 220-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification which establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in the consolidated financial statements.






	F-6











	Long-Lived Assets






	The Company evaluates the recoverability of its fixed assets and other assets in accordance with section 360-10-15 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Disclosure requires recognition of impairment of long-lived assets in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds its expected cash flows. If so, it is considered to be impaired and is written down to fair market value, which is determined based on either discounted future cash flows or appraised values. The company adopted the statement on inception. No impairments of these types of assets were recognized during the period ended December 31, 2016.






	Risk and Uncertainties






	As of January 5, 2015, the Company is subject to risks common to manufacturing and health product providers.






	Advertising Costs






	Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. The Company does not incur any direct-response advertising costs.






	Stock-Based Compensation






	The company accounts for stock-based compensation using the fair value method following the guidance set forth in section 718-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosure about stock based compensation. This section requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award- the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service.






	Fair Value for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities






	The company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("paragraph 820-10-35-37") to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.





	The three levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:





	Level 1: Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets and liabilities as of the reporting date.





	Level 2: Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.





	Level 3: Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by the market data.





	The carrying amounts of the company's financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts receivable, rent deposit, accounts payable, customer deposits and notes payable approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.





	There were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended December 31, 2016.






	Fair Value of Financial Statements






	The Companys financial instruments consist of cash and security deposits. The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximate fair value due to either length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial statements.






	F-7











	Loss Per Share






	Net loss per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during each period. There were no potentially dilutive shares outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.






	Income Taxes






	Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax basic of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized. It is the company's policy to classify interest and penalties on income taxes as interest expense or penalties expense. As of December 31, 2016 there have been no interest or penalties incurred on income taxes.

	ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE






	We have had no disagreements with our independent auditors on accounting or financial disclosures.









	ITEM 9A (T). CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES






	Our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, Tom Wood, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on that evaluation, they have concluded that, as of December 31, 2015, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.






	Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting






	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control, as is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the reported financial information is presented fairly, that disclosures are adequate and that the judgments inherent in the preparation of financial statements are reasonable. There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal controls, including the possibility of human error and overriding of controls. Consequently, an effective internal control system can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance with respect to reporting financial information.





	Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and the receipts and expenditures of company assets are made and in accordance with our management and directors authorization; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.





	Management has undertaken an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in the Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based upon this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2016. We had weaknesses in personnel and keeping record keeping up to date. Contingent upon adequate financing, we plan on hiring new professionals on 2017 to improve these weaknesses.





	This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to the temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the company to provide only managements report in this annual report.






	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting






	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	Indemnification of Directors and Officers






	Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws both provide for the indemnification of our officers and directors, to the fullest extent, permitted by Nevada law.






	Limitation of Liability of Directors






	Pursuant to the Nevada General Corporation Law, our Articles of Incorporation exclude personal liability for our Directors for monetary damages based upon any violation of their fiduciary duties as Directors, except as to liability for any breach of the duty of loyalty, acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, or any transaction from which a Director receives an improper personal benefit. This exclusion of liability does not limit any right which a Director may have to be indemnified and does not affect any Directors liability under federal or applicable state securities laws.

	Engaging in any type of business practice; or

	Audit Committee and Financial Expert






	We do not have an Audit Committee. Our director performs some of the same functions of an Audit Committee, such as: recommending a firm of independent certified public accountants to audit the annual financial statements; reviewing the independent auditors independence, the financial statements and their audit report; and reviewing managements administration of the system of internal accounting controls. The Company does not currently have a written audit committee charter or similar document.





	We have no financial expert. We believe the cost related to retaining a financial expert at this time is prohibitive. Further, because of our start-up operations, we believe the services of a financial expert are not warranted.






	Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance






	Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), requires our executive officers and directors, and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of an issuers common stock, which has been registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership with the SEC. Our officers/directors are in the process of filing their Forms 3.






	Corporate Governance







	Nominating Committee






	We do not have a Nominating Committee or Nominating Committee Charter. Our Board of Directors performs some of the functions associated with a Nominating Committee. We have elected not to have a Nominating Committee in that we are an initial-stages operating company with limited operations and resources.

	ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS






	The following tables set forth the ownership, as of the date of this report, of our common stock by each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, our directors, and our executive officers and directors as a group. To the best of our knowledge, the persons named have sole voting and investment power with respect to such shares, except as otherwise noted. There are not any pending or anticipated arrangements that may cause a change in control.





	The information presented below regarding beneficial ownership of our voting securities has been presented in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not necessarily indicative of ownership for any other purpose. Under these rules, a person is deemed to be beneficial owner of a security if that person has or shares the power to vote or direct the voting of the security or the power to dispose or direct the disposition of the security. A person is deemed to own beneficially any security as to which such person has the right to acquire sole or shared voting or investment power within 60 days through the conversion or exercise of any convertible security, warrant, option or other right. More than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities. The percentage of beneficial ownership by any person as of a date is calculated by dividing the number of shares beneficially owned by such person, which includes the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment power within 60 days, by the sum of the number of shares outstanding as of such date plus the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment power within 60 days. Consequently, the denominator used for calculating such percentage may be different for each beneficial owner. Except as otherwise indicated below and under applicable community property laws, we believe that the beneficial owners of our common stock listed below have sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares shown.

	(1) The following table sets forth, as of April __, 2017, certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of shares of our common stock by: (i) each person known to us to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent (5%) of our outstanding shares of common stock, (ii) each director or nominee for director of our Company, (iii) each of the executives, and (iv) our directors and executive officers as a group. Unless otherwise indicated, the address of each shareholder is at our principal office address at 699 Walnut Street, Suite 400, Des Moines, Iowa 50309-3962.


	(2) Beneficial ownership is calculated based on the 63,212,227 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of the date hereof, together with securities exercisable or convertible into such shares within sixty (60) days of the date hereof for each stockholder. The shares of common stock issuable pursuant to those convertible securities, options or warrants are deemed outstanding for computing the percentage ownership of the person holding such convertible securities, options or warrants but are not deemed outstanding for the purposes of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.


	(3) Also includes Tom Woods ownership of 2,000,000 Preferred A Shares, which shares may be converted on a 1 to 1 basis. No Preferred A Shares have been converted.


	(4) Also includes Russell Birds ownership of 1,500,000 Preferred A Shares, which shares may be converted on a 1 to 1 basis. No Preferred A Shares have been converted.






	Changes in Control






	There are no arrangements, known to us, including any pledge by any person of securities of the Company, the operation of which may at a subsequent date result in a change in our control.

	ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE







	Director Independence






	We currently do not have any independent directors, as the term independent is defined in Section 803A of the NYSE Amex LLC Company Guide. Since the OTC Markets does not have rules regarding director independence, the Board makes its determination as to director independence based on the definition of independence as defined under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and American Stock Exchange (Amex).






	Related Party Transactions






	We have received support from our officer and Chairman who have paid expenses for vendor payments on our behalf. These direct vendor payments are treated as capital contributions and shareholder loans in our financial statements, specifically booked as outstanding loans of $85,217 and $108 and $87,151 and $108 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

	Audit-Related Fees

REMSleep Holdings Inc. Announces the DeltaWave and its Patent Application -- A New Revolutionary CPAP Nasal Interface Device Designed to Improve Treatment for Sleep Apnea Patients


/EINPresswire.com/ -- DES MOINES, IA--(Marketwired - Jul 24, 2017) -  REMSleep Holdings, Inc. (OTC PINK: RMSL) (OTC PINK: RMSLD) www.remsleeptech.com is pleased to announce that it has filed a non-provisional patent with the US Patent and Trademark Office (Patent number 15/595,990 filed on March 16, 2017). The patent is titled "New Generation Sleep Apnea Device" and will ultimately be marketed under the product name "DeltaWave." 
The patent pending DeltaWave is designed to allow patients to breathe normally while on CPAP Therapy, a breakthrough that should increase patient compliance dramatically. The DeltaWave is less claustrophobic than traditionally used products, very lightweight, minimizes or eliminates drying of the sinuses and requires less driving pressure due to its unique generous airflow dynamics. REMSleep Holdings is confident that DeltaWave's unique design will benefit a wide range of patients offering a more compliant interface by providing improved air flow dynamics and more ease of breathing, resulting in deep restful sleep.
Sleep Apnea is a condition that causes a person to have periodic episodes of interrupted breathing during sleep. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) inhibits restorative sleep, carrying significant implications such as cognitive impairment and even sudden cardiac death. Treatment of this affliction to date has created a $4.9 Billion market with industry estimates anticipating a $6.7 Billion market by year 2021. Treating this Global Epidemic is currently addressed by patients using Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machines and Interfaces (masks). Unfortunately, current models continue to have issues that cause patients to give up on treatment. Patient non-compliance is becoming a mounting concern for the medical community.
It is estimated that approximately 50% of Sleep Apnea sufferers who own a CPAP system are unable to continue treatment because of non-compliance. Tom Wood, CEO, comments, "Our goal is to reach a significant number of these patients with our new DeltaWave Interface and provide a more compliant and comfortable treatment for these, and new patients diagnosed with Sleep Apnea. Years of research and development have led us to the DeltaWave, a design that addresses the stubborn issues that continue to affect a patient's ability to comply with treatment. The new DeltaWave is truly different and unique because it addresses patient air intake deprivation and does not interrupt a patient's normal respiratory rate."
About REMSleep Holdings, Inc.
                            REMSleep Holdings, Inc. was founded to design and manufacture devices and products for the treatment of sleep apnea and other respiratory conditions. With over 50 years of collective experience in CPAP therapy, the REMSleep team has extensive knowledge and understanding of CPAP and the challenges of patient compliance. REMSleep Holdings, Inc. has a new patent pending, innovative sleep apnea product that will meet multiple market needs and be able to reach and address a large percentage of the patient population who continue to struggle with CPAP compliance.

                            Some statements in this release may contain forward-looking information. All statements, other than of historical fact, that address activities, events or developments that the Company believes, expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future (including, without limitation, statements regarding potential acquisitions and financings) are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are generally identifiable by use of the words "may", "will", "should", "continue", "expect", "anticipate", "estimate", "believe", "intend", "plan" or "project" or the negative of these words or other variations on these words or comparable terminology. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's ability to control or predict, that may cause the actual results of the Company to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from current expectations include, among other things, without limitation, the inability of the Company to obtain sufficient financing to execute the Company's business plan; competition; regulation and anticipated and unanticipated costs and delays, and other risks disclosed in the Company's public disclosure record on file with the relevant securities regulatory authorities. Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause results or events not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. No information in this news release should be construed to be an indication of the Company's future revenues, results of operations or its stock price.
