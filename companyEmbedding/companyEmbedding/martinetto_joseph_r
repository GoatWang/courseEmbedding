Claremont McKenna College

                  As one of the nation's most selective private liberal arts colleges, CMC sits among the intellectually-stimulating, socially-fulfilling, seven-college community known as The Claremont Colleges, a system modeled after England's Oxford University. Founded in 1946, CMC is the youngest of the nation's top colleges and enrolls approximately 1,200 students.

Claremont McKenna College (CMC) educates its students for thoughtful and productive lives and responsible leadership in economics, government and public affairs.

With this broad-based foundation graduates leave CMC well prepared for the challenges of the 21st century. Many go on to pursue careers in law, business, government, foreign service, international relations, public policy, museum administration, science and education, or to pursue graduate study.

The College's cutting-edge research institutes provide students unprecedented opportunities to work alongside their professors and discover how what they learn in the classroom links to life in the world behond. The world comes to Claremont McKenna through a vibrant and renowned speakers series in which world leaders, thinkers, artists and visionaries visit campus through the Marian Miner Cook Athenaeum and other public programming.

In September 2007, Robert A. Day, the Founder and Chairman of The TCW Group, Inc., pledged a $200 million personal gift to establish the Robert Day School of Economics and Finance and its unique programs. This was the largest recorded gift to a liberal arts institution, the largest gift in the field of finance and economics, and among the top 20 largest gifts ever given to a college or university.

      Schwab’s executive vice president of finance and a 16-year veteran of 
      the company, will succeed Joseph R. Martinetto as the company’s chief 
      financial officer, effective May 16 following Schwab’s annual 
      stockholders meeting.
    


      Mr. Martinetto, 55, who marks his 20th anniversary with 
      Schwab this year, will continue as senior executive vice president at 
      Schwab, reporting to President and CEO Walt Bettinger and maintaining 
      oversight of several functions including: the company’s banking, 
      technology and operations units; its real estate and corporate 
      development and strategy teams; and community services. Mr. Martinetto 
      will also continue serving on the company’s executive council, as a 
      trustee of the Schwab Family of Mutual Funds and Exchange Traded Funds, 
      and as a member of the boards of Charles Schwab Bank and Charles Schwab 
      & Co, Inc. Named CFO in 2007, Mr. Martinetto subsequently helped Schwab 
      successfully navigate the country’s recent financial crisis and the 
      Federal Reserve’s zero interest rate policies, while guiding growth in 
      Schwab’s balance sheet from less than $50 billion in 2007 to over $220 
      billion today.
    

      “Joe’s leadership and judgment have been central to Schwab’s success 
      over the past decade, and I look forward to his continued partnership 
      and counsel for years to come,” said Mr. Bettinger. “I’m grateful for 
      Joe’s ongoing commitment as a senior executive at Schwab, as well as his 
      skill at developing a talented bench of executives to ensure smooth 
      transitions into important roles like CFO. With Peter succeeding Joe, we 
      are promoting a strong leader with outstanding business acumen who has 
      the confidence of our board of directors, Joe and me.”
    

      Mr. Martinetto commented, “Peter and I have been working together 
      towards this transition since the middle of 2015. We are closely aligned 
      regarding the importance of sustaining the company’s commitment to 
      profitable growth and the expense discipline that makes it possible. 
      Peter is ready to lead the company’s financial management in a manner 
      consistent with our longstanding values while also helping Schwab 
      continue to evolve as one of the nation’s largest investment services 
      firms.”
    

      Appointed executive vice president of finance in July 2015, Mr. 
      Crawford, 48, leads the company’s treasury and controller functions, as 
      well as planning and enterprise finance. He joined Schwab in 2001 after 
      serving at McKinsey & Company, where he was an engagement manager in the 
      Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Sao Paulo and Hong Kong offices.
    

      During his tenure at Schwab, Mr. Crawford has held increasing levels of 
      responsibility for a wide range of businesses and product lines, 
      including product management for Schwab Funds, and management of 
      Schwab’s cash products, its core client segment offerings, the company’s 
      fixed income offering, and its third party investment platforms. He also 
      served as chief of staff to Chairman Charles Schwab. Crawford holds a 
      bachelor’s degree from Yale University, where he graduated magna cum 
      laude, and a master of business administration degree from the Stanford 
      Graduate School of Business.
