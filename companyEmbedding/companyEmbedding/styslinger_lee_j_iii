The Green Truck Summit, presented by International Truck, is produced jointly by NTEA and CALSTART. It runs March 5-6 in conjunction with the NTEA’s Work Truck Show 2013 at the Indiana Convention Center in Indianapolis, Ind. Exhibits at The Work Truck Show are open March 6 to 8, 2013.On March 5, the summit kicks off with a talk from Lee J. Styslinger III, chairman and chief executive officer of Altec, Inc.

The company also deploys vehicles that operate on compressed natural gas. In April, Altec opened a new green-focused assembly plant in California. The facility was built using sustainable construction and is currently used to produce the company’s Green Fleet line of equipment.



“Under Mr. Styslinger’s leadership, Altec is at the forefront of commercially viable clean work trucks,” said John Boesel, CALSTART president and CEO. “Their equipment provides fuel savings, reduced emissions and other competitive advantages to fleets nationwide.”On day two, Pacheco will share his insights into clean energy deployment with Green Truck Summit attendees. NREL provides expertise that spans basic research, analysis, and a deep understanding of the barriers to broad use of energy efficiency and renewable energy technology.

Lee Joseph Styslinger, Jr.
The following biographical sketch was compiled at the time  of induction into the Academy in 1998 and updated in January 2013. 

When Lee Joseph Styslinger, Jr. left The University of Alabama at age 19 to  take over the management of his father's truck equipment company, no one could  have predicted he would turn the company into a worldwide leader in its  industry. 
Styslinger was born in Birmingham in 1933 to Lee J.  Styslinger Sr. and Margaret McFarland Styslinger, where his father had moved at  age 33 because it resembled his hometown of Pittsburgh. There, at the start of  the Depression, Lee Styslinger, Sr. founded Alabama Truck Equipment Co. with a  handful of employees in a building that had originally been a furniture  manufacturing plant. The company then manufactured flatbed trailers and  customized trucks for industrial use, and made a name for itself as one of the first  to use non-rusting aluminum truck parts when steel was in short supply for  World War II.
Lee Styslinger Jr. always intended to follow in his father's  footsteps. He attended St. Paul's elementary school and graduated from St.  Bernard Preparatory School in Cullman. He then attended the University with  plans to graduate with a degree in mechanical engineering. Instead, his  father's death in 1952 left him responsible for the management of Alabama Truck  Equipment Co. sooner than he had anticipated. 
When he took over as general manager of the company, the business  was owned by his mother and operated as a proprietorship. The company  manufactured utility bodies for Alabama Power Co., a line of bottler bodies for  Coca-Cola and Buffalo Rock, a line of dairy bodies, dump bodies, bakery bodies  for McGough Bakeries, van bodies for Baggett and Jack Cole Motor Freight and  any special type body a business needed. 
Styslinger, at only 19, wanted to appear as grown-up as  possible, so one of the first things he did as manager was buy a hat and  wire-rimmed glasses. Four years later, he was named president of the company.  Styslinger convinced his family to form a corporation and allow him to buy 51  percent of the stock. The company was incorporated, not including the land,  which still belonged to Styslinger's mother, and the name changed to Altec,  Inc. 
Styslinger, who had been studying accounting in night school  at The University of Alabama at Birmingham, decided the company could no longer  afford to be in the manufacturing business. When the company incorporated, it  switched to distributing equipment made by other manufacturers and narrowed its  focus to products for the utility industry. 
By 1963, Altec's sales volume had increased exponentially  over 1952 figures, and the company’s workforce had grown significantly. With  more money to work with, Styslinger returned again to manufacturing. Styslinger  formed Altec Manufacturing Co., a separate entity, to manufacture the bodies  that were part of the total utility equipment package. Altec, Inc. continued as  a distributor of digger derricks and aerial platforms. From the mid-'60s  through the early '70s, Altec began to stretch its wings. A Northern Division  was established in Indianapolis to provide sales and assembly services to the  booming Indiana and Illinois markets, and a service center was opened in  Atlanta, GA. 
In 1973, during the energy crisis, Altec made the risky  decision to go into competition with its own suppliers and constructed a  factory in St. Joseph, Mo., where the company began designing its own products.  The decision was a good one. By 1979 the company's Midwest Division was a  full-scale manufacturer of digger derricks for electric and telephone  utilities. 
Today, Altec, Inc. is the holding company for Altec  Industries, Altec Worldwide, Global Rental, Altec Capital Services, Altec  NUECO, Altec HiLine, Altec Supply, Altec Service Group, and Altec Ventures. The  company manufactures and sells equipment to the electric utility,  telecommunication, tree care, lights and signs, and contractor markets in North  America and in more than 100 countries throughout the world. 
Altec has continued its growth under the Styslinger family's  leadership. Styslinger has three sons with his wife, the former Catherine  Smith, and all three, Lee Joseph III, Jon Cecil and Mark Joseph, are employed  by Altec. Lee J. Styslinger III is now Chairman and CEO, Jon is President, and Mark  is senior vice president. Lee III and Mark reside in Birmingham, and Jon is in  Kansas City, Mo. 

  Lee Styslinger, Jr. has proven his commitment not only to  his business but also to doing his civic duty. He has held positions on the  Board of Trustees for Highlands Day School and the Birmingham Symphony  Association and has served on the Board of Directors of such organizations as  the American National Red Cross, Children's Harbor, Junior Achievement of  Greater Birmingham and St. Vincent's Hospital. He is a past member of the  Birmingham Music Club, the Birmingham Council of the Boy Scouts of America and  the Metropolitan Development Board. Since 1998 he has served as finance  chairman for the Birmingham Museum of Art. Styslinger and his wife attend St. Francis  Xavier Catholic Church. 
Styslinger is also active in the business community. He  currently serves on the board of directors for Advanced Labelworx, Inc.,  Electronic Healthcare Systems, Jemison Investment Company, Inc., and  MeadWestvaco Corporation. In the past he has served on the boards of a number  of companies including Complete Health, Health Services Foundation, Regions  Financial Corporation, Saunders System and Southern Research Institute. He has  served on the Board of Governors and Executive Board of both the United States  and Birmingham Area chambers of commerce. He is a past member of the National  Alliance of Businessmen, the Equipment Manufacturers Institute and the National  Association of Manufacturers. Styslinger has been named to the Alabama Academy  of Honor and was an honoree for Re-Entry Ministries' Builders of Birmingham. 
  In  2002 he was inducted into the Alabama Business Hall of Fame, and in 2004, the  Birmingham Business Hall of Fame.
Styslinger attributes most of the success of his company to  the Altec associates and to his father. Altec's philosophy about its associates  is "Work should be to an adult what play is to a child — enjoyable." 
In a speech he gave to the Rotary Club of Birmingham on  Altec's 60th anniversary, Styslinger said of his father, "My  only hope is that I am able to inspire in others at least a fraction of the  strength he left for me." Styslinger's hope has already become fact; he  has passed a legacy of strength on to his sons and a strong, growing corporation  on to the world.
