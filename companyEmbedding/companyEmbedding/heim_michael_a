Tampa Male Hormone Replacement Clinic
Andropause
Also known as male menopause, andropause is the slow decline in testosterone that begins around age 40 for most men and continues throughout life. By the time most men reach the age of 70, they can have testosterone levels that are 75% less than that of a 25 year old. These declining levels lead to a host of symptoms typically chalked up to, “just getting older,” but we now know that this doesn’t have to be the case. For years we have treated women’s declining hormone levels to help prevent chronic health problems and disease and to alleviate symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats and irritability. Men however are much less likely to seek help for the symptoms of low testosterone which include decreased sex drive, decreased quality of erections, irritability, fatigue after meals and exercise intolerance. You may feel like you have lost your, “edge,” in the work place, decreased concentration and focus, as well as decreased muscle mass and increased body fat.
The good news is we now know that you can reverse these symptoms with natural bio-identical testosterone replacement. If your physician has told you that your testosterone level is in the “normal range,” yet you have experienced the symptoms of low testosterone, let Dr. Heim evaluate your blood work to determine if you could benefit from treatment. You may need additional blood work to get the whole picture.
If you are ready to, “get your edge back,” look and feel younger and restore the vigour of youth, call our office today for a free consultation with Dr. Heim to see if you are a candidate for testosterone replacement. There is no reason to live with the symptoms of low testosterone when you can safely restore your youthful levels with proper treatment. Enjoy better results in the gym, improved sex drive and performance, and reduced fatigue that comes with optimizing your testosterone levels. It’s time to stop just getting by and start living your life again.

Patient Reviews & Testimonials
I am 49 year-old Hispanic female. Since I can remember, even at 5 years old, I’ve had RAGE episodes. My mother and grandmother told me the rage was genetic. My grandmother was a miserable person and full of rage. My mother has episodes, but not to the extent of my grandmother. 
Around age 30, the RAGE increased. At 48, I noticed it was happening about Day 15 to 25 of my menstrual cycle. I finally realized my behavior left me with almost no friends and affected my behavior at work. 
It took me 1 year to find Dr. Heim. He was recommended by another hormone replacement doctor as the only one in the west coast of Florida with the most hours of training in the field.    But, this was not the first time someone told me about Dr. Heim. An ex-boyfriend told me his ex-wife was visiting Dr. Heim and this man was NOT Happy. His ex-wife was shedding pounds, felt great and looked spectacular!
I wish I had visited Dr. Heim 10 YEARS AGO! The result, NO MORE RAGE EPISODES… that is RIGHT!!!!! It is NOT GENETIC, simply a hormonal imbalance. How could that be? My annual blood work was perfect (didn’t include hormonal testing), including my thyroid.
The first couple of months under treatment people were complimenting me, but they could not pinpoint the change. I had never heard people complimenting me about my new attitude and outlook in life, NEVER. It was the old miserable me!
I can guarantee, without a shadow of a doubt, your LIFE WILL CHANGE. Please don’t wait as long as I waited to seek professional help. I would have saved myself and the few people still in my life, 10 HORRIBLE YEARS!
~Eyra C.
Let’s just be honest, finding a good doctor is like looking for a needle in hay stack. I’m a former pharmaceutical rep and believe me when I tell that I feel sorry patients in some offices. Dr. Heim is the kind of Doctor I wish everyone had the pleasure to meet. Dr. Heim is one of a kind. He takes the time to listen to your concerns, does an excellent blood panel and takes the time to explain everything. He treats the whole body. He even does chiropractic adjustments. He is NOT pushing meds or diets or anything that even remotely makes you feel like he’s interested in any other than YOUR OVER ALL WELL BEING. He also provides IV therapy and joint pain therapy. Just because you’re not ‘sick in bed’ doesn’t mean you can’t up you’re game and feel better everyday!
~Katie M.
My family & I first met Dr. Heim 6 years ago and drive from Miami to see him- he has an amazing wealth of knowledge, truly professional & open in his approach, he truly know how to bring the body back to health & balance – he investigates and treats the body from what is lacking and source of the problem vs just a prescriptions that can simply mask symptons (but does not hesitate to prescribe when and as needed). Dr Heim has a personal approach, very easy to talk to, it feels like you are chatting to an old friend who trul y cares about your wellness and listens. He provides the solution most aligned to the needs, body and comfort of the patient – with incredible results. I would recommend him to anyone who is concerned with wellness –and living a healthy lifestyle – everyone I know who has seen him has also been equally impressed. The practice and staff are also extremely helpful and obliging and I can truly say I actually look forward to my visits.
~Tracey Bayer
I would recommend Dr Heim to anyone feeling the effects of “getting a little older”… and I HAVE!!! I have been THRILLED with the improvement I’ve seen in my symptoms, energy level, stamina, strength and appearance. I have more than a handful of friends going to Dr Heim and all of them are equally pleased. Dr Heim takes a real interest in helping you to feel your very best. He provides very individualized attention. He is NOT providing “one size fits all” treatments like so many other practices. He does thorough testing & analysi s and takes the time to review the results with you in terminology that you can understand. He really listens to your concerns and comes up with a treatment protocol individual to just you. He is very personable and easy to talk to, as is everyone in his office. If you’re looking at this then you’re considering going to see Dr Heim – DO IT – you’ll be so happy you did!! I PROMISE 🙂 –
~Julia Alarcon
Dr. Heim is an amazing doctor. He truly knows the human body and its intricacies, and always listens attentively to my questions and concerns. His office offers a great number of services, and I love how they have really easy, straightforward pricing. I cannot recommend this office enough!
~Felipe Fulgencio
Dr. Heim made me feel right at home. His demeanor was very calming, and it enabled me to spe ak freely about my health concerns. The staff also made me feel comfortable and welcome from the very first visit. I would surely recommend this doctor to anyone seeking a true professional.
~Angela Theriac
I am so glad to have been referred to Dr. Heim’s practice. I kn ow that I am in good hands. His integrative approach to health is exactly what I was looking for. His staff is awesome, so helpful and efficient. I could’t be happier with the care that I have had so far. ~Patrick Butcher
Love Dr. Heim and his staff! I’ve taken both the blood and saliva tests and haven’t felt this good in years. I also LOVE the new IV therapy.
~Katie Alexander Wills

Natural Detoxification Services: Detox Your Body
Call 813-384-3107 to schedule your detox today.
Detoxification is the act of cleansing the body of its impurities and toxins. It’s been practiced since the time of ancient Chinese medicine, and for good reason. Removing and eliminating toxins helps the body feel refreshed and rejuvenated while accomplishing a wide range of health benefits. 
The Process of Detoxification
Toxins enter the body through air, food, and water, and come to rest in the blood. As the blood builds up these foreign impurities, you may begin to feel lethargic or notice skin problems, digestive discomfort, weight gain, or chronic pain. 
The body is supposed to automatically detoxify the blood by neutralizing toxins through the colon and liver, but this natural system frequently needs assistance to work efficiently. Purposeful detoxification stimulates the liver to drive toxins from the body, promotes elimination through the intestines, kidneys, and skin, and improves blood circulation. 
A smart detox begins by eliminating alcohol, coffee, cigarettes, and refined foods, all of which just put more toxins in the body. It also helps to stop using chemical-based household products like cleaners and deodorants. There are plenty of natural and homemade alternatives! 
The strongest detox includes a great deal of water and whole food nutrients to hydrate and refuel the body. It’s best to use a detox kit, which will support the body in every stage of detox and make the process even more effective. To improve on the detox process even more, consider nutritional IVs as a part of the detox process. 
Signs That You Need to Detox 
With more toxins in our environment than ever before, regular detoxification is critical to continued health and wellness. It’s likely that your body is struggling with a build-up of toxins in the blood if you can relate to any of these descriptions:

Fatigue despite regular sleep
Constipation 
Skin issues like acne, rosacea, and itching
Bloating
Difficulty concentrating 
Trouble losing weight
Irritability
Bad breath
Intense cravings
Insomnia 
Unexplained headaches

Dr. Heim at the Center for Health and Age Management can help you identify the best route for detoxification so that you can reap the benefits of a cleansed and purified system. You’ll feel more energetic and vibrant, and your body will once again achieve the balance it needs to ward off illness and pain.  
The Core Restore Kit 
Just about anybody can benefit from detoxing, especially with the use of the Core Restore Kit. This comprehensive 7-day program provides the body with nutrients that reduce toxic burden and support the liver as it detoxifies the body. Its three active formulas—Core Support, Alpha Base, and PhytoCore—work synergistically to eliminate environmental toxins, hormone disruptors, and other harmful impurities. When you use the Core Restore Kit, your body receives a steady stream of micronutrients, phytonutrients, and easily digested protein that help purify the liver for optimal detoxification.  
Dr. Heim is a detoxification expert and is here to help you purify your body and answer any questions you may have on your journey to total wellness. Contact us today for more information.

Tampa Prolotherapy and PRP Treatments
Regenerative Injection Treatments that work
Dr. Heim injecting PRP (platelet rich plasma) injection to treat chronic Achilles tendinitis. Harnessing the body’s natural ability to heal itself.
Prolotherapy, PRP (Platelet Rich Plasma), Stem Cells and Ozone are non-surgical, regenerative injection treatments that stimulates the body’s own healing process to heal acute and chronic tendon, ligament, and cartilage injuries such as torn meniscus, plantar fasciitis, rotator cuff injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome, and tennis and golfer’s elbow among others. It is believed than many injuries are a result of ligament and tendon laxity which cause instability and pain in our joints.
Regenerative injection treatments are usually used when other treatments such as anti-inflammatory medications, physical therapy and surgery are not an option or have failed to provide benefit but can be used as first line treatment for these conditions as well.
During prolotherapy treatment, a precise injection of a mild irritant solution such as lidocaine mixed with sterile dextrose and water is injected directly on the torn ligament, stretched tendon, or injured cartilage, creating a mild or controlled injury that stimulates the body’s natural healing process. This controlled inflammation increases blood flow to the area and naturally stimulates the body to repair itself. This process brings growth factors and healing blood cells that encourage the growth of new ligament or tendon fibers. This process results in a stronger, tighter tissue structure that corrects instability and removes the source of pain.
During PRP treatment, a patient’s blood is drawn and then spun in a centrifuge to separate the red blood cells from the plasma. The Plasma is then injected directly into the area of injury using the same injection technique as Prolotherapy. Plasma contains a high concentration of growth factors and healing blood cells so, not only are you stimulating the body’s natural healing process with the injection, but you are delivering a high concentration of the bodies natural healing cells directly to the site of injury and pain. These areas typically have little blood flow which is why they fail to completely heal at times and can turn in to chronic injuries and pain. PRP is being widely used by professional athletes to recover from injuries quickly and without surgery.
Stem cells are cells the body produces that have the ability to change in to any cell type. When mixed with platelet rich plasma and injected in the same manner as prolotherapy and PRP, you combine the immune stimulating effects of prolotherapy, the healing properties of PRP and the tools to regenerate tissue. Although not currently approved by the FDA, stem cell treatments are being widely used worldwide for musculoskeletal disease and injury and provides a great alternative to conventional treatments such as surgery. 
Ozone gas is used as sole treatment or more commonly as an addition to prolotherapy, PRP, for stem cell treatments. Ozone provides injured tissue with concentrated levels of oxygen, one of the main requirements needed for healing. It also stimulates the immune system, increases circulation and reduces inflammation all of which helps to accelerate healing and reduce pain. 
A single prolotherapy or PRP treatment sets the stage for healing but the regenerative and strengthening that occurs continues for months after treatment. Although some patients may only need a single injection session, treatment usually consists of a series of injections every 2 – 4 weeks until the desired result is obtained. Response from treatments depend on health and nutrition status of the patient, severity of the injury and how long the injury has been present.
What to expect after treatment
Patients can expect to experience mild to moderate pain and inflammation after Regenerative injection treatments. This is normal and expected as the body goes through the normal inflammatory and injury repair process as if the area has a new injury. Pain subsides after 3 – 4 days and may be treated with non – anti-inflammatory medication such as tylenol or a prescription pain medication. It is important not to use anti-inflammatory medication such as Advil, Aleve, ibuprofen, naproxen or aspirin as they will inhibit the healing process. After the initial discomfort, patients may feel benefit right away but may take a couple weeks to start feeling improvement. The repair process however can go on for 1 – 2 years after the treatment. Patients can generally return to activity within a week after treatment.
Injuries and conditions commonly treated by our regenerative procedures include:

Achilles tendonitis
ACL injuries
Biceps tendinosis
Golfer’s elbow
Iliotibial band syndrome
Ligament injuries
Osteoarthritis
Rotator cuff injuries
Sports injuries
Tennis elbow

Joint Rejuvenation Protocol
Avoid or Delay surgery with Dr. Heim’s Joint rejuvenation program!
Arthritis and injuries such as meniscus or cartilage tears that traditionally may require surgery may now be treated successfully with Stem Cell Treatments. These protocols may allow you to heal without the need for surgery or allow you to delay surgery for years and avoid the time-consuming recovery that comes with it.
Dr. Heim has developed a proprietary joint rejuvenation protocol using a combination of treatments including Stem Cell, PRP and ozone administration, Nutritional supplements and a diet program designed to maximize your bodies ability to heal and regenerate. The Heim Rejuvenation protocols do not just involve injecting stem cells into a joint and hoping for the best. Over many years, Dr. Heim has developed a strategy that gives your body the tools to heal and regenerate.
Just as a garden does not thrive without proper care, the body does not easily repair itself without the proper tools. A thriving garden takes proper soil preparation, nourishing seeds with nutrients and water and protection from the elements. Likewise your body requires the same thoughtful care.That is why Dr. Heim will analyze all areas of your health including diet, hormones, sleep, exercise and stress and make specific recommendations to maximize your health and ability to heal. By preparing your body prior to treatment with a low inflammation diet, nourishing your joints with a proprietary nutritional supplement program, and treating the areas of injury and pain with concentrated doses of Stem cells and other healing nutrients Dr. Heim creates the optimal environment for healing and regeneration. Injections are performed under ultrasound guidance to allow for maximum accuracy
The Heim Regenerative Medicine difference
There are more and more practitioners adding PRP treatments to their practices. The training to truly understand and apply the principles of regenerative medicine however is crucial to to getting results. Many providers are simply injecting PRP into the joint space of the knee for instance, when in reality, treatment must be targeted to the structures that maintain the integrity of the joint as a whole. Whereas one provider might perform a single injection to treat a knee, Dr. heim will many times inject as many as 10 or more sights on the same knee in addition to injecting into the joint space. The injection techniques used with regenerative medicine is truly an art that takes many hours of training in order to perfect. In the last 12 months alone, Dr. heim has attended over 100 hours of training including ultrasound guided injection training on human cadavers. In addition, he attended an intensive week long course/medical mission trip where the 20 providers who attended, under the supervision of experts in the field, treated over 700 patients in 5 days. Dr Heim is dedicated to continuing education in the field of regenerative medicine so you can be confident that you are getting the best treatment available.
Another benefit of treatment at Heim Regenerative Medicine Center is the global approach to helping your body heal. The best injection technique in the world cannot provide results if your body is unable to heal itself properly. Hormone imbalance and nutritional deficiencies can inhibit healing and leave you susceptible to re injury. Dr. Heim can analyze your blood work to determine a program that can optimize your ability to recover. Treatments might include hormone replacement, nutritional supplements and IV nutrition therapy that can specifically target tissue healing.

FAQ’s
 How much does an anti-aging program cost?  Initial visit $300.00. After completing comprehensive blood work and body composition analysis, you will spend 60 minutes, one on one with Dr. Heim reviewing your lab work, health history, and health goals. You will receive detailed, individualized recommendations for diet, exercise, and nutritional supplements for your unique needs. If appropriate, you may also be prescribed bioidentical hormone replacement treatments. Follow up visits generally are required every 3 – 6 months and the fee for those visits is $150.  
 How much do medications and supplements cost?  Medications and supplements depend on the individual program a patient is on and can range anywhere from 75.00- 150.00 per month for basic hormone replacement and supplements. Anti-aging therapy is individualized and a patient’s needs can change over time, as your body becomes healthier and more balanced your treatment needs may change. Testosterone treatment for men using weekly injections costs around $35.00 per month. Topical hormone creams range from $30.00 – $65.00 per month depending on how many hormones are included.		 
 What can I expect from anti-aging treatment?  Effects of treatment are different for everyone but when patients make anti-aging lifestyle changes and their hormones are in balance, they typically experience more energy and vitality, better sexual function and improved sex drive, less depression and anxiety, better quality of sleep, improved sense of well-being, reduction or elimination of hormone deficiency symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats and mood swings, better focus and concentration. You may see increased fitness levels and better exercise tolerance which can lead to increased muscle mass and decreased body fat. Hair and skin tend to look and feel better. In short, you will begin to feel like you did 10 or 15 years ago.		 
 What type of weight loss program will I be on?  As a board certified bariatrician, Dr. Heim will create a program that is tailored to your needs. Your Program may include meal replacement supplements, weight loss medications, specialized injections, and nutritional supplements. You will be counseled on the proper exercise to maximize your weight loss and minimize loss of muscle which will result in decreasing metabolism. Generally most patients go through an initial week of dieting designed to detox the body and prepare it for the dietary phase which can last anywhere from 4 – 12 weeks or longer depending on how much weight you need to lose. Diets usually consist of a combination of meal replacement supplements and regular food. Following the diet phase you will gradually return to eating a regular healthy diet designed to maintain your weight loss and maximize your health.		 
 How often do I have to come to the office?  After the initial 2 – 3 weeks patients are seen every 2 – 4 weeks for office visits but are encouraged to come in weekly (at no charge) to weigh in on the body composition scale so that we can track your weight on the weeks you are not being seen by the doctor. Office visits are generally more frequent in the beginning of the program to ensure you are making good progress and not having any medical complications.		 
 How much does the weight loss program cost?  Initial visit is $300.00 and includes Bariatric focused medical history and physical, EKG if needed, body composition and metabolic rate testing, blood pressure screening, and diet and exercise counseling. Follow up visits are $75.00 and include brief physical exam, body composition testing, fat burner vitamin injections and diet and exercise counseling as needed. Full meal replacement program costs $50.00 – 80.00 every one – two weeks. As you progress through the program, you will use less supplements and costs decrease accordingly. Dr. Heim may recommend over nutritional supplements as well.		 
 What about blood work?  You may get any needed blood work through the preferred lab of your insurance carrier and the lab will bill your insurance company or through our office at a special discounted fee that we have negotiated with a local lab.
Lab fees for basic weight loss program through our office are $85.00 and includes full thyroid panel, cholesterol panel, a complete blood count (CBC), and Complete Metabolic Profile (CMP). A complete hormone panel for Anti-aging programs are around $250.00 which includes the weight loss panel plus appropriate hormone levels. If you have had blood work completed in the past 6-12 months we may not need to repeat those tests which will reduce the cost of any blood work done through our office. Dr. Heim may recommend saliva hormone testing, food allergy testing or stool analysis if needed.  
 Can I keep my primary care physician?  We encourage you to continue regular follow-up with your primary care physician and keep them informed of any changes in your health status. Our programs are designed to drastically improve your health and your need for prescription medication may be reduced or in some cases eliminated. Dr. Heim may make adjustments or discontinue any current medications if medically appropriate and will always recommend that you keep your personal physician informed of these changes. Dr. Heim also provides full service primary care services if desired.
