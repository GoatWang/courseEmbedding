What are analysts saying about Lincoln Electric Holdings stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Lincoln Electric Holdings stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Lincoln Electric will benefit from focus on customers and execution of its 2020 vision. The company’s focus on investment in long-term, profitable growth, with its broad range of product launches and strategic acquisitions, will also aid growth. It will also gain from consistent focus on cost reduction and strong cash flow generation. Despite increase in interest expenses, the company’s strong balance sheet position and share repurchases will drive its performance. Lincoln Electric also has a positive record of earnings surprises in the last few quarters. Driven by these positives, the stock outperformed the broader industry in the past one year. However, Lincoln Electric's results will be hurt by higher interest expenses, stronger U.S. dollar and weakness in industrial production. Ongoing declines in the energy and heavy fabrication sectors also remain headwinds." (7/19/2017)

What are analysts saying about Lincoln Electric Holdings stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Lincoln Electric Holdings stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Lincoln Electric will benefit from focus on customers and execution of its 2020 vision. The company’s focus on investment in long-term, profitable growth, with its broad range of product launches and strategic acquisitions, will also aid growth. It will also gain from consistent focus on cost reduction and strong cash flow generation. Despite increase in interest expenses, the company’s strong balance sheet position and share repurchases will drive its performance. Lincoln Electric also has a positive record of earnings surprises in the last few quarters. Driven by these positives, the stock outperformed the broader industry in the past one year. However, Lincoln Electric's results will be hurt by higher interest expenses, stronger U.S. dollar and weakness in industrial production. Ongoing declines in the energy and heavy fabrication sectors also remain headwinds." (7/19/2017)
