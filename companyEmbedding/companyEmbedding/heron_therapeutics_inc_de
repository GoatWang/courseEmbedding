	EXHIBIT 99.1





	Heron Therapeutics Reports Financial Results for the

	Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 and Recent Corporate Progress



	SAN DIEGO, Calif.  (BUSINESS WIRE)  May 10, 2017  Heron Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: HRTX) (the
	Company or Heron), a commercial-stage biotechnology company focused on developing novel
	best-in-class treatments to address some of the biggest unmet patient needs, today reported
	financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and highlighted recent corporate
	progress.



	Recent Corporate Progress





	Pain Franchise





	Expanded Phase 2 Program of HTX-011 with Initiation of TKA and Nerve Block Studies.

	Heron
	initiated Phase 2 studies of HTX-011 in two new surgical models, total knee arthroplasty
	(TKA) and breast augmentation (pectoral pocket nerve block), to complement its four
	successful Phase 2 studies in abdominoplasty, bunionectomy, and hernia repair. Heron
	anticipates initiating Phase 3 studies of HTX-011 this year and filing a New Drug
	Application (NDA) in 2018.




	CINV Franchise





	SUSTOL



	®



	Sales Increase; Product Added to National Comprehensive Cancer Network
	(NCCN



	®



	)




	Antiemesis Guidelines.

	Net product sales of SUSTOL
	(granisetron) extended-release injection for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $3.6
	million, compared to $1.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. In addition,
	SUSTOL was granted a Category 1 recommendation by the NCCN for use in the prevention of
	acute and delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in patients receiving




	highly or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC or MEC). The NCCN guidelines identify
	SUSTOL as a preferred agent for preventing CINV following MEC




	and highlight the
	unique, extended-release formulation of SUSTOL.




	Received Notice of CINVANTI (HTX-019) PDUFA Date.

	The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
	(FDA) set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of November 12, 2017 for a
	decision on the Companys NDA for CINVANTI. If approved, CINVANTI will strengthen Herons
	CINV portfolio by adding a second, complementary therapeutic agent in this category.


	The first quarter of 2017 was a productive period for Heron, highlighted by the completion of
	several highly-successful Phase 2 studies of HTX-011 in multiple post-operative pain models and the
	inclusion of SUSTOL in the NCCN guidelines, said Barry D. Quart, Pharm.D., Chief Executive Officer
	of Heron. Looking ahead, we are focused on the commencement of Phase 3 studies of HTX-011, as well
	as the approval of CINVANTI by year-end 2017.



	Financial Results



	In January 2017, Heron completed an underwritten public offering of its common stock for net
	proceeds of $163.7 million. As of March 31, 2017, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and
	short-term investments of $165.2 million, compared to $51.1 million as of December 31, 2016. Based
	on the Companys current operating plan and projections, it believes that available cash, cash
	equivalents and short-term investments are sufficient to fund operations for at least one year.


	Net product sales of SUSTOL for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $3.6 million, which
	represents 184% sequential quarter-over-quarter growth over the $1.3 million of net product sales
	of SUSTOL for the three months ended December 31, 2016.


	Herons net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $50.3 million, or $1.00 per share,
	compared to $33.4 million, or $0.92 per share for the same period in 2016. Net loss for the three
	months ended March 31, 2017, included non-cash, stock-based compensation expense of $8.0 million
	compared to $5.4 million for the same period in 2016.


	Herons net cash used for operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $50.6
	million, compared to $32.4 million for the same period in 2016.


	The increases in net loss and net cash used for operating activities for the three months ended
	March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 were primarily due to increased clinical and
	manufacturing costs related to the development of HTX-011 and CINVANTI.

	needs. Heron is developing novel, patient-focused solutions that apply its innovative science and

	Forward-Looking Statements



	This news release contains forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities
	Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Heron cautions readers that forward-looking statements are based on
	managements expectations and assumptions as of the date of this news release and are subject to
	certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including,
	but not limited to, those associated with: the projected sufficiency of our capital position for
	future periods, the market opportunity for SUSTOL, CINVANTI, HTX-011 and new products generally,
	timing of potential generic forms of palonosetron and the potential impact on sales of SUSTOL, the
	timing and outcome of the End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA for HTX-011, whether the FDA approves
	the CINVANTI NDA as submitted, the timing of the NDA filing for HTX-011, the progress in the
	research and development of HTX-011 and our other programs, including the timing of preclinical,
	clinical, and manufacturing activities, safety and efficacy results from our studies, and other
	risks and uncertainties identified in the Companys filings with the Securities and Exchange
	Commission. Forward-looking statements reflect our analysis only on their stated date, and Heron
	takes no obligation to update or revise these statements except as may be required by law.

Our Mission
At Heron, our mission is to improve the lives of patients by developing best-in-class medicines that address unmet medical needs. By applying our innovative science and technologies to therapeutic agents with well-known pharmacology, we aim to develop patient-focused solutions that potentially:
Are more effective than other pharmaceutical agents in the same class;
Are safer or better-tolerated than other pharmaceutical agents in the same class;
Broaden the clinical use of a pharmaceutical agent and potentially reduce the dependence on other classes of drugs with more harmful side effects; and
Enable multimodal treatments that more fully address the multiple mechanisms of a disease or disorder.
Also, by applying our technologies to already-approved pharmacological agents and utilizing the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, we seek to potentially accelerate the development and lower the clinical and regulatory risk of our product candidates.

We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of the 150,000,000 shares of
common stock that we are offering will be approximately $56.4 million, or
approximately $64.9 million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to
purchase 22,500,000 additional shares of common stock, based on the public
offering price of $0.40 per share and after deducting the underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We will retain broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from the sale
of our securities offered hereby. Except as described in any prospectus
supplement, we currently anticipate using the net proceeds from the sale of our
securities offered hereby primarily for general corporate purposes, which
include, but are not limited to, funding our ongoing and future clinical trials,
funding the commercial launch of APF530, if and when it receives regulatory
approval, and for general and administrative expenses. We may also use a portion
of the net proceeds to pay off outstanding indebtedness, if any, and/or acquire
or invest in complementary businesses, products and technologies. Further, from
time to time we may evaluate acquisition opportunities and engage in related
discussions with other companies.

Pending the use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest the net proceeds in
short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities.


APF530 is expected to face significant competition for the prevention of delayed
CINV, principally from Eisai’s Aloxi (palonosetron). In addition to Aloxi,
APF530 will compete with entrenched generic forms of granisetron (formerly
marketed by Roche as Kytril) and ondansetron (formerly marketed by
GlaxoSmithKline as Zofran). Generic versions of Aloxi may become available after
its scheduled patent expiration date, which was recently extended to 2024. There
are ongoing challenges to the Aloxi patents which may shorten the effective
patent term. We are also aware of several companies that have developed or are
developing both generic and new formulations of granisetron, including
transdermal formulations such as ProStrakan’s Sancuso® (granisetron transdermal
patch).

There are several companies that are developing new formulations of existing
drugs using novel drug delivery technologies. Many of these companies have
substantially greater financial, research and development, manufacturing, sales
and marketing and distribution resources and experience than we do. The
following are some of our major competitors among drug delivery system
developers: Alkermes, Inc., Durect Corporation, and Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Smaller or early stage companies and research institutions may also prove to be
significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with
large and established pharmaceutical companies. We will also face competition
from these parties in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and
management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration
for clinical trials, and acquiring and in-licensing technologies and products
complementary to our programs or potentially advantageous to our business. If
any of our competitors succeed in obtaining approval from the FDA or other
regulatory authorities for their products sooner than we do or for products that
are more effective or less costly than ours, our commercial opportunity could be
significantly reduced. Major technological changes can happen quickly in the
biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and the development of
technologically improved or different products or drug delivery technologies may
make our product candidates or platform technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.


Company Description
A.P. Pharma, Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company developing products
using its proprietary Biochronomer™ polymer-based drug delivery platform. This
drug delivery platform is designed to improve the therapeutic profile of
injectable pharmaceuticals by converting them from products that must


 be
injected once or twice per day to products that need to be injected only once
every one or two weeks.

The Company’s lead product candidate, APF530 (also known as SUSTOL), is being
developed for the prevention of both acute chemotherapy-induced nausea and
vomiting (CINV) for patients undergoing moderately or highly emetogenic
chemotherapy and for the prevention of delayed CINV for patients undergoing
moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. One of the most debilitating side effects of
cancer chemotherapy, CINV is a leading cause of premature discontinuations of
treatment. There is only one injectable 5-HT3 antagonist approved for the
prevention of delayed-onset CINV, so this indication represents an area of
particular unmet medical need. APF530 contains the 5-HT3 antagonist granisetron
formulated in the Company’s proprietary Biochronomer drug delivery system, which
allows therapeutic drug levels to be maintained for five days with a single
subcutaneous injection. This five-day range is designed to cover the delayed
phase of CINV. Granisetron was selected for APF530 because it is widely
prescribed by physicians based on a well-established record of safety and
efficacy. APF530 targets a large market opportunity, with approximately 7
million doses of chemotherapy annually in the U.S. alone.

In May 2009, we filed a New Drug Application (NDA) seeking approval for APF530
with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA issued a Complete
Response Letter for the APF530 NDA in March 2010. In September 2012, we
resubmitted our NDA for APF530 and, in March 2013, we received a second Complete
Response Letter, which identified several remaining issues that need to be
addressed prior to approval of the APF530 NDA in its current form. We are
currently working on addressing these issues and expect to resubmit the APF530
NDA in the first quarter of 2014. Additionally, we are exploring the potential
use of our Biochronomer polymer with other drugs and intend to pursue the
clinical development or one or more other drug candidates based on our
proprietary delivery platform.

In November 2013, we initiated a program to expand our pipeline of sustained
release products, including a new program targeting the relief of post-surgical
pain. As of 2012, approximately 25 million procedures associated with
post-operative pain were conducted in the U.S., which is expected to grow to
32.5 million by 2022. In addition, U.S. post-operative pain market sales are
expected to grow 1.6% annually from approximately $3.1 million in 2012 to $3.6
billion by 2022. This market growth is primarily being driven by the increasing
number of procedures and by new reformulations.

We own the worldwide rights to APF530 and are in the early stages of building
the commercial infrastructure necessary to commercialize APF530 in the U.S. on
our own, assuming approval by the FDA.

Company Overview
At Heron, our mission is to improve the lives of patients by developing best-in-class medicines that address major unmet medical needs. We are developing novel, patient-focused solutions that apply our innovative science and technologies to already-approved pharmacological agents.
Our product portfolio includes the following:
SUSTOL® (granisetron) extended-release injection is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is indicated in combination with other antiemetics in adults for the prevention of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) or anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) combination chemotherapy regimens.
CINVANTI™ (HTX-019), also being developed for the prevention of CINV, has the potential to become the first polysorbate 80 free, intravenous formulation of aprepitant, a neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor antagonist. We filed an NDA for CINVANTI (HTX-019) using the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway in January 2017.
HTX-011 is our long-acting formulation of the local anesthetic bupivacaine in a fixed-dose combination with the anti-inflammatory meloxicam for the prevention of post-operative pain. Targeting both pain and inflammation has allowed HTX-011 to demonstrate an advantage over current standard of care in multiple surgical models-bunionectomy, hernia repair and abdominoplasty (tummy tuck)-in Phase 2 studies.
SUSTOL and our investigational product candidates utilize our innovative science and technology platforms, including our proprietary Biochronomer® drug delivery technology, which can deliver therapeutic levels of a wide range of otherwise short-acting pharmacological agents over a period of days to weeks with a single injection.
