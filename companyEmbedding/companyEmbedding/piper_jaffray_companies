The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

About Piper Jaffray Companies

Beyond Minneapolis

Piper Jaffray focuses on investment banking, asset management,
institutional brokerage, and equity research. Headquartered in
Minneapolis, the firm serves middle-market corporations, private
equity firms, government entities, and institutional
investors. It operates more than 30 offices across the U.S.,
and offices in London, Zurich, and Hong Kong. Services include
advisory, public finance, capital markets products, and
institutional equity and fixed income sales and trading.  The
firm's proprietary research covers 600 companies and its analysts
regularly receive awards for their stock-picking
prowess. Piper Jaffray's history can be traced back to 1895,
when it established a commercial paper brokerage in Minneapolis,
servicing grain elevators and milling businesses. Following
subsequent mergers, the firm's shares debuted on the NASDAQ
exchange in 1986; in 1992, the firm name was trimmed to Piper
Jaffray Inc. A $730 million acquisition by U.S. Bancorp in
1997 marked the end of Piper Jaffray's independence, but the tie-up
was short-lived: in 2003, Piper Jaffray spun off, becoming an
independent public company. A final restructuring came in 2006
when Piper Jaffray sold its private client business to UBS for $510
million. Today, Piper Jaffray is led by Andrew Duff, who
serves as CEO and chairman. The firm employs more than 1,000
people.
