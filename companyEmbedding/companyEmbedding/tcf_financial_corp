Online Statements

What is an Online Statement?
An Online Statement is an electronic version of the paper statement you receive monthly for your checking and savings accounts. It includes all of the same information that you currently receive in your paper statement, including canceled check images, legal notices and the back page of your statement.
How much do Online Statements cost?
Online Statements are free.
Which accounts are eligible for Online Statements?
All checking and statement savings accounts are eligible for Online Statements. To receive statements online for combined checking and savings statement accounts, call our Customer Service and request that those accounts be uncombined.
Can I get Online Statements if my checking and savings statements are combined?
No. Combined checking and savings statements are not eligible for Online Statements. To receive statements online for those accounts, call Customer Service and request that those accounts be uncombined.
Why should I sign up for Online Statements?
Online Statements are both safe and convenient.  Accessible only during a secure online banking session, Online Statements help guard your personal information while reducing the clutter and hassle of paper statements.  View up to 3 years of past statements online anytime and from anywhere you have Internet access.
Online Statements may also save you fees if your checking account is subject to the paper statement fee. For more information on the paper statement fee, view the Deposit Account Services & Prices Schedule for your state.
How do I enroll in Online Statements?
Log in to TCF Online Banking and select the Accounts Tab followed by: Statements -> Manage Delivery Options.  Under the Delivery Method column in the drop down boxes, select "Online Only" for each account that you want to receive an Online Statement. Preview your selections and then select Submit.
When will I begin receiving my statements online?
You will automatically have a minimum of two months of statements available online after you enroll. Your next statement will appear online at the same time you would receive your paper statement.
Will I still receive a statement in the mail?
If you enroll your accounts in Online Statements, you will no longer receive a paper statement in the mail for those accounts. However, if you signed up for Online Statements in a branch, you must first log in to Online Banking from a non TCF computer to fully complete the enrollment process.
What software do I need to view my statements online?
Your Online Statement will be presented to you electronically in Portable Document Format (PDF). To view, print or save the PDF, you will need to download a free copy of Adobe® Acrobat Reader.
Do I have to enroll all of my accounts?
No, you can choose which accounts you would like to enroll in Online Statements.
How do I sign up for Online Statements if the only delivery option is "paper only" or not all my accounts are listed in online banking?
Call Customer Service and we can help you sign up for Online Statements.
Will my Online Statement look like my paper statement?
Yes. Your Online Statement will look identical to your paper statement, including canceled check images, legal notices and will also include the back page of your statement.
How will I know when my statement is available online?
You will receive a secure notification to your TCF Online Banking mailbox when your statement is available to view online. You can also set up an alert to your email address.
How do I view my statement?
Log in to TCF Online Banking, select the Accounts Tab, and then the Statements option.  Select the account and time period you would like to view.
Can I print and save my statement?
Yes, you can print your statement from Online Banking.
How long is my statement available for viewing online?
Your statements will be available online for 3 years.
Will I still see images of my canceled checks?
Yes, if you received images of your canceled checks with your paper statement.
How can I get copies of past statements?
You will have 3 years of statements available online. Call Customer Service to obtain copies of statements older than 3 years (fees may apply for copies; see the Deposit Account Services & Price Schedule for your state).
Can joint account owners view statements online?
Yes, any joint account owner can sign up that account for Online Statements.
Will I still receive the inserts that are mailed with my paper statement?
Yes. All inserts (policy changes, account notices, privacy information, marketing information, etc.) will be included in the PDF.



Bill Pay

How do I sign up for TCF Online Bill Payment?
To pay your bills online, you must first enroll in TCF Online Banking. To add Online Bill Payment to your existing TCF Online Banking service:

Log in to Online Banking
Select Bill Payment tab
Select Enroll

What bills can I pay online?
You can pay almost any bill online that is payable in the United States.  There is an exception for payments to many  government agencies.
Do you guarantee the payment will arrive on time?
Payment timing can vary by payee, and delivery dates are based on the way payments are delivered to payees.  If your payee has electronic payment capability, it will take about two days for your payee to receive your payment.  If we have to send a check, it could take up to four days for your payee to receive your payment.  Payee lead times, the amount of time your payee requires to process a payment, may also vary.  
TCF’s bill payment service includes a Smart Calendar, which can help you determine when you should schedule a payment based on the payee’s delivery method and the lead times.  When making your payments, select the appropriate Due Date, and the calendar will automatically display available Due Dates for that payee.  The earliest available Due Date for payees may vary based on delivery method and payee processing times. Please note that payee posting and cut-off times vary.  
Please check with your payee for exact details on how payments are credited.
Can I set up reminders for bills that need to be paid?
Yes.  You can set up your own reminders for any bills that need to be paid.  We will automatically display the amount and the number of days remaining until a payment is due in your payee list.
What is an eBill?
An eBill is an electronic version of your paper bill that you can elect to receive directly into your online banking under the Payments tab.  You can then view your entire bill and pay immediately or schedule future payments directly.  
eBills are available for many payees and will be set up for only those payees you choose.  Once you have an eBill set up for a payee and start receiving it, your payee may stop sending you a paper bill as you will now receive your eBill in TCF bill payment service.  
It typically takes 1-2 billing cycles for you to begin receiving your bill online.

The most recent short interest data has been released for the 04/13/2017 settlement date, which shows a 1,867,749 share increase in total short interest for TCF Financial Corp , to 7,838,207, an increase of 31.28% since 03/31/2017. Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded.

Disclaimer of Warranties and Limits of Liability
For purposes of this section, the "TCF-Related Parties" means: 
          (1) TCF; (2) TCF's employees, officers and directors; (3) TCF's 
          affiliates (that is, parties that own TCF, are owned by TCF, or are 
          under common ownership with TCF); (4) TCF's agents, licensors, 
          independent contractors and subcontractors; and (5) third party service 
          providers that the TCF-Related Parties use.
The Site and services therein are provided to you as-is. The 
          TCF-Related Parties therefore make no warranties of any kind for the 
          Site or services. This includes both express warranties and implied 
          warranties. Implied warranties include implied warranties of 
          merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. A warranty is a 
          guaranty that the Site or services will meet certain standards.
The TCF-Related Parties do not warrant that the site or services 
          will be uninterrupted or error free, or that defects will be corrected. 
          They also do not warrant that the Site is free of viruses or other 
          harmful components. They also do not warrant the timeliness, accuracy, 
          reliability or completeness of the Site or services.
Without limitation, the TCF-Related Parties will not be liable to
          you for any loss, claim, injury, or damage in connection with: (1) 
          these Terms of Use; (2) your use of the Site or inability to use the 
          Site; (3) any problems with the communications between you and us; (4) 
          any unauthorized interception of the communications between you and us; 
          (5) any computer virus; or (6) the actions or inactions of any third 
          parties. This limitation on the TCF-Related Parties' liability applies, 
          even if any of them are aware of the possibility that any events 
          described in (1) through (6) could occur.
In no event will any of the TCF-Related parties be liable to you 
          for any: (1) incidental damages; (2) consequential damages; (3) special 
          damages; (4) indirect damages; or (5) punitive damages. This limitation 
          of liability applies, whether you base an action against the TCF-Related
          Parties on: (a) a contract; (b) a warranty; (c) a tort (such as claim 
          of negligence, recklessness, or intentional act); or (d) any other 
          theory. This limitation of liability applies even if any of the 
          TCF-Related Parties know about the possibility of such damages. 
          Therefore, by way of example, the TCF-Related Parties will not be liable
          to you for lost data, lost profits or goodwill, investment losses, 
          finance charges, lost opportunities, cost of obtaining substitute

Disclaimer of Warranties and Limits of Liability
For purposes of this section, the "TCF-Related Parties" means: 
          (1) TCF; (2) TCF's employees, officers and directors; (3) TCF's 
          affiliates (that is, parties that own TCF, are owned by TCF, or are 
          under common ownership with TCF); (4) TCF's agents, licensors, 
          independent contractors and subcontractors; and (5) third party service 
          providers that the TCF-Related Parties use.
The Site and services therein are provided to you as-is. The 
          TCF-Related Parties therefore make no warranties of any kind for the 
          Site or services. This includes both express warranties and implied 
          warranties. Implied warranties include implied warranties of 
          merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. A warranty is a 
          guaranty that the Site or services will meet certain standards.
The TCF-Related Parties do not warrant that the site or services 
          will be uninterrupted or error free, or that defects will be corrected. 
          They also do not warrant that the Site is free of viruses or other 
          harmful components. They also do not warrant the timeliness, accuracy, 
          reliability or completeness of the Site or services.
Without limitation, the TCF-Related Parties will not be liable to
          you for any loss, claim, injury, or damage in connection with: (1) 
          these Terms of Use; (2) your use of the Site or inability to use the 
          Site; (3) any problems with the communications between you and us; (4) 
          any unauthorized interception of the communications between you and us; 
          (5) any computer virus; or (6) the actions or inactions of any third 
          parties. This limitation on the TCF-Related Parties' liability applies, 
          even if any of them are aware of the possibility that any events 
          described in (1) through (6) could occur.
In no event will any of the TCF-Related parties be liable to you 
          for any: (1) incidental damages; (2) consequential damages; (3) special 
          damages; (4) indirect damages; or (5) punitive damages. This limitation 
          of liability applies, whether you base an action against the TCF-Related
          Parties on: (a) a contract; (b) a warranty; (c) a tort (such as claim 
          of negligence, recklessness, or intentional act); or (d) any other 
          theory. This limitation of liability applies even if any of the 
          TCF-Related Parties know about the possibility of such damages. 
          Therefore, by way of example, the TCF-Related Parties will not be liable
          to you for lost data, lost profits or goodwill, investment losses, 
          finance charges, lost opportunities, cost of obtaining substitute 
          services, or other economic damages.
The laws of some states may prohibit the limitation of liability 
          for consequential damages, or incidental damages, or other kinds of 
          damages. In those states, to the extent their laws apply, the limitation
          of liability with respect to consequential damages, or incidental 
          damages (or other damages specified by law in such states), may not 
          apply.
Severability
If any provision of these Terms of Use is determined to be 
          unenforceable, or invalid, such determination shall not affect the 
          validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions.
Non Deposit Investment or Insurance Products and Services
The Site contains information or links to other websites about 
          investment or insurance products or services, such as securities 
          brokerage, annuities, mutual funds, and life insurance. These products 
          and services are not obligations or deposits of TCF National Bank, they 
          are not guaranteed by TCF National Bank, and they are not FDIC insured. 
          These products and services are subject to risks, including the possible
          loss of the amount you invest. The value of any securities described in
          this website or other linked websites can fall as well as rise and an 
          investor may get back less than the amount invested. Past performance is
          not necessarily a guide to future performance.
