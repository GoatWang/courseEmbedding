Mr. Grzebinski previously served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, a position he has held since 2010.
C. Andrew Smith has been elected Executive Vice President – Finance. Mr. Smith will assume the role of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer after the filing of Kirby's 2013 Form 10-K. Mr. Smith, a Certified Public Accountant, brings to Kirby 20 years of extensive business and financial experience. Prior to joining Kirby, he served as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Benthic Geotech and was previously Chief Financial Officer for both Global Industries, LTD and NATCO Group.

Mr. Pyne stated, "The election of David Grzebinski as President and Chief Operating Officer and Andy Smith as Executive Vice President – Finance is the first step in the succession plan we announced in April 2013, with the goal of transitioning my Chief Executive Officer's position to David during 2014, and the Chief Financial Officer's position to Andy in February 2014. I intend to remain an active and engaged Chairman and I am looking forward to working with David and Andy and the Kirby management team in creating value for our shareholders."

Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated as a result of various factors, including cyclical or other downturns in demand, significant pricing competition, unanticipated additions to industry capacity, changes in the Jones Act or in U.S. maritime policy and practice, fuel costs, interest rates, weather conditions, and timing, magnitude and number of acquisitions made by Kirby. Forward-looking statements are based on currently available information and Kirby assumes no obligation to update any such statements.
