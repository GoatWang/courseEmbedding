Economic Comment - February 18, 2016
Written by Economic Advisor, Norman Robertson
In December of 2015, the Federal Reserve raised its policy rate – 

the federal funds rate – for the first time in almost ten years.  

Furthermore, the quarter-point increase represented the end of a seven-

year period in which the rate was held at near zero.

Economic Comment - January 21, 2016
Written by Economic Advisor, Norman Robertson
Once again, worries about the economic situation and outlook in 

China have sent shock waves through the equity markets around the 

globe.  Since the end of last year, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones 

Industrial Average have both fallen more than 10% which is generally 

regarded as a stock market correction.  Other major market indices, 

including those in China, Japan and the U.K., all posted similar declines 

during the first two weeks of 2016.  It was, to say the least, a gloomy 

start to 2016.

Economic Comment - November 9, 2015
Written by Economic Advisor, Norman Robertson
News that private nonfarm payroll employment in October posted a robust –and better-than-expected –gain of 268,000 has clearly increased the likelihood of a Federal Reserve rate increase in December.  However, the month-to-month volatility in job growth makes it very difficult to determine the underlying trend of employment growth.  Put another way, does October’s gain represent a significant strengthening of the job market or an aberration in a slowing trend of hiring by U.S. companies?

Economic Comment - October 21, 2015
Written by Economic Advisor, Norman Robertson

                While we do not see a recession in 2016, we believe that the 
chances of a downturn have climbed to the vicinity of 35%.  As matters 
now stand, our forecast of real GDP growth in 2016 calls for an increase 
of about 2%, which would be less than the expected gain of 2.4% in 
2015.  And the risks to this forecast are, in our view, mainly on the 
downside.

Economic Comment - July 6, 2015
Written by Economic Advisor, Norman Robertson

            The Greek crisis has already prompted a near blizzard
            of articles, commentaries and
            opinions that has sought to explain the implications and ramifications of the seemingly
            never-ending
            Greek financial crisis, the latest manifestation of which was that Greece was the
            first developed country to default on its debt to the International Monetary Fund after missing a
            $1.7 billion payment.

Economic Comment - April 23, 2015
Written by Economic Advisor, Norman Robertson
For some time now, the Federal Reserve and most forecasters have displayed considerable optimism regarding economic activity in 2015.  Forecasts of real GDP growth in 2015 have generally been in the 3-3½% range, representing a significant improvement over last year’s 2.4%.

Economic Comment - December 11, 2014

To judge from recent comments in the media and elsewhere, one gets the impression that at long last the U.S. economy is rapidly gathering strength and momentum.

A Note From The Chairman - October 27, 2014
Written by Chairman, Bob Kopf
Recently a friend of mine asked me a simple, yet penetrating, question that I had, surprisingly, 

never received in the nearly twenty years of Smithfield’s existence:  what factors should one consider in 

the selection of an investment manager?  Following is my attempt to answer my friend’s question.

What's Going On? - June 13, 2014
Written by Economic Advisor, Norman Robertson
Is the U.S. economy entering a period of more rapid growth? Many observers expect that, after a dismal weather related first quarter, overall economic activity will rebound in the second quarter – and beyond.

Blame the Weather? – March 14, 2014
Written by Economic Advisor, Norman Robertson
The on-going crisis in Ukraine, along with its possible impact on the global economy, has
			clearly been a major contributor to the recent volatility in U.S. equity prices. At the same time,
			however, many of the reports on economic activity during January and February were distorted by
			the severe winter weather in many parts of the country. As a consequence, the equity markets have
			found it difficult to assess the significance of recent economic statistics, many of which were
			decidedly downbeat.

Unsettled Outlook – February 13, 2014
Written by Economic Advisor, Norman Robertson
Another disappointing employment report. In January, nonfarm payroll employment posted a slender gain of 113,000, which was only slightly better than the dismal 75,000 reported in December.

Mixed Signals - January 24, 2014
Written by Economic Advisor, Norman Robertson
Economists have a habit of predicting that the coming year will be better than the last one.  Not surprisingly then, real GDP in 2014 is expected to post a gain in the range of 2.5-3%, representing a significant improvement over last year’s estimated increase of about 1.8%.  As of now, however, there is very little in the way of hard evidence to indicate that the economy is picking up speed.

Economic Comment - November 19, 2013
Written by Economic Advisor, Norman Robertson
Since the beginning of 2013, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Price Index has gained some 25%, far outstripping the estimated 4.5% increase for overall economic activity – as measured by the GDP – and a similar advance projected for corporate profits after taxes. Equity prices, it would seem, have become disconnected, not only from the economy as a whole, but from corporate earnings as well. What accounts for the evident upsurge in investor confidence and sentiment?

Economic Comment - October 30, 2013

The flow of economic statistics, which was temporarily halted during the government shutdown, is once again underway. What do they show?

Common Factors Affecting Retirement Income
Prepared by Broadridge Investor Communication Solutions, Inc. Copyright 2013
When it comes to planning for your retirement
            income, it's easy to overlook some of the common
            factors that can affect how much you'll have available
            to spend. If you don't consider how your retirement
            income can be impacted by investment risk, inflation
            risk, catastrophic illness or long-term care, and taxes,
            you may not be able to enjoy the retirement you
            envision.

The Impact of Inflation
Prepared by Broadridge Investor Communication Solutions, Inc. Copyright 2013
Inflation occurs when there is more money
            circulating than there are goods and services
            to buy. The process is like trying to attend a
            sold-out concert at the last minute; there is
            more demand for tickets than there are tickets
            to go around. As a result, tickets may trade
            hands for far more than their stated prices.
            When there's a lot of demand for goods and
            services, their prices usually go up. The law of
            supply and demand produces price inflation.

The Power of Dividends in a Portfolio
Prepared by Broadridge Investor Communication Solutions, Inc. Copyright 2013
It wasn't so long ago that many investors regarded
                dividends as roughly the financial equivalent of a
                record turntable at a gathering of MP3 users--a
                throwback to an earlier era, irrelevant to the real
                action.

BBB Reason for Ratings


        BBB rating is based on 13 factors: Get the details about the factors considered.










BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned

Note from the Chairman















"Trust” Is Part of Our Name for a Reason
We cannot think of a better word to define us. It hearkens back to an earlier era, when each customer’s legacy was attended and protected with the utmost care. Our traditional view of customer service is what sets us apart – and, ultimately, what keeps families with us for generations.
An Uncommon Degree of Service
Smithfield Trust customers can expect much more from us than a typical, larger firm. We know each and every one of them by name, and we give them direct access to any member of our team at any time.
Our investment advisors continually monitor the day-to-day developments that affect our customers’ accounts, a fact that is reflected in our personalized monthly letter.
No Conflicts of Interest
Smithfield Trust is a fee-based company, which means we are not motivated by commissions and therefore are always working in our customers’ best interests. We do not own any funds, nor do we offer mutual funds because of the additional fees involved.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
