Sales Growth Analysis: Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. (ROIC), Ball Corporation (BLL)

By Heather Davidson -   July 24, 2017 



 








Share on Facebook
Tweet on Twitter










Shares of Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. (NASDAQ:ROIC) observed rebound of 8.51% since bottoming out at $18.45 on Nov. 10, 2016. Thanks to a rise of almost 0.4% in the past five days, the stock price is now down -5.25% so far on the year — still in weak territory. In this case, shares are down -13.15% from $23.05 , the 52-week high touched on Jul. 29, 2016, but are collecting gains at -11.57% for the past 12 months.
ROIC Target Price Reaches $23
 Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to hold Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. (ROIC)’s shares projecting a $23 target price. Analysts‟ target price forecasts are a prediction of a stock‟s future price, generally over the 12 months following the release date (Asquith et al., 2005). This forecast is a point estimate that provides investors with a benchmark against which to directly compare stock price in the short run.Target prices made by analysts employed by large brokers, who have access to a greater resource pool, are more likely to be met over the 12-month forecast period.
 How Quickly Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. (ROIC)’s Sales Grew?
 ROIC’s revenue has grown at an average annualized rate of about 35.6% during the past five years. However, the company’s most recent quarter increase of 17.5% looks attractive. The sales growth rate for a stock is a measure of how the stock’s sales per share (SPS) has grown over a specific period of time. It tells an investor how quickly a company is increasing its revenues. The sales growth rate helps investors determine how strong the overall growth-orientation is for a stock or portfolio.
Ball Corporation Achieves Below-Average Profit Margin 





  The best measure of a company is its profitability, for without it, it cannot grow, and if it doesn’t grow, then its stock will trend downward. Increasing profits are the best indication that a company can pay dividends and that the share price will trend upward. Creditors will loan money at a cheaper rate to a profitable company than to an unprofitable one; consequently, profitable companies can use leverage to increase stockholders’ equity even more. Profitability ratios compare different accounts to see how efficiently a business is generating profits. These ratios show how well income is generated through operations, and are important to both creditors and investors. They help determine the company’s ability to continue operating. Currently, Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. net profit margin for the 12 months is at 15.69%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 43.73%, and the sector’s average is 27.93%. In that light, it seems in weak position compared to its peers and sector. The profit margin measures the amount of net income earned with each dollar’s worth of revenue. It shows the percentage of sales that remain after all of the company’s expenses have been paid. The higher the ratio, the better.
 Ball Corporation (NYSE:BLL) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed 0.12% since hitting a peak level of $42.96 on Jul. 21, 2017. Thanks to an increase of almost 2.73% in the past one month, the stock price is now outperforming with 14.35% so far on the year — still in strong zone. In this case, shares are 23.03% higher from $34.88, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Aug. 03, 2016, and are keeping their losses at 14.48% for the past six months.
Analysts See Ball Corporation 2.23% Above Current Levels 
 The good news is there’s still room for Ball Corporation (BLL) to grow. At recent closing price of $42.92, BLL has a chance to add $2.23 or 5.2% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($45.15) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 2.2 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 0.95 , so you might not be in for a bumpy ride.
 Are Ball Corporation (NYSE:BLL) Earnings Growing Rapidly?
 For the past 5 years, Ball Corporation’s EPS growth has been nearly -9.3%. Sure, the percentage is discouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 11.25%, annually.
Is BLL Turning Profits into Returns?
 Ball Corporation (BLL)’s ROE is 19.59%, while industry’s is 8.13%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 14.22%. The return on equity (ROE), also known as return on investment (ROI), is the best measure of the return, since it is the product of the operating performance, asset turnover, and debt-equity management of the firm. If a firm can borrow money and use it to achieve a higher return than the cost of the debt, then the leveraging creates additional revenue that accrues to stockholders as increased equity.
 Ball Corporation’s ROA is 3.29%, while industry’s average is 3.65%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company’s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 8.72. The return on assets (ROA) (aka return on total assets, return on average assets), is one of the most widely used profitability ratios because it is related to both profit margin and asset turnover, and shows the rate of return for both creditors and investors of the company. ROA shows how well a company controls its costs and utilizes its resources.

Is Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. Stock a Buy Now?
Solid dividend, growth opportunities, aggressive management -- what's not to like?











                Michael Douglass
            

                (TMFEnterprise)



            
            Apr 16, 2016 at 9:22AM
            
            






Source: iStock.
With a 3%-plus dividend, a focus on grocery-anchored shopping centers (everyone needs groceries, right?), and plenty of growth opportunity, Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. (NASDAQ:ROIC) has plenty going for it.
It's worth a second look, anyway.
But as we dig deeper, the key question is simple: Is the stock a buy now, at these prices?
StrategyROIC's portfolio is anchored in high-quality West Coast assets. Management concentrates on top-of-the-line properties in or near big population centers (think L.A., Portland, and Seattle). ROIC's portfolio is heavily focused in high-net-worth areas within these larger markets, which gives its tenants access to customers with an attractive demographic profile.





ROIC tends to own whole shopping centers instead of individual, stand-alone buildings. A holistic, shopping center-based strategy gives ROIC a powerful lever that, if used correctly, can catalyze tremendous growth to its rents across the board. By increasing the rent in individual spaces over time, it can gradually improve its tenant profile -- thereby creating a virtuous cycle of tenant and rent upgrades.
 I'll let COO Richard Schoebel explain it a bit better, in this quote from ROIC's Q4 2015 earnings call. (All quotes come from S&P Global Market Intelligence.

"Just to give you a quick example, one of our shopping centers in Northern California, we recaptured an underperforming anchor space that were replaced with a much stronger supermarket operator. Additionally, capitalizing on this new grocery as a draw, we recently signed 2 new anchor leases at the property."

ROIC leverages that new tenant to draw in other, more attractive tenants -- setting off a domino effect of better tenants and escalating rents, leading to more money up front for the REIT, and a shopping center increasingly filled with tenants that ROIC's affluent demographic finds most attractive. That should lead to increased foot traffic, enabling tenants to make even more money, and ultimately lead to even more rent increases. It's a win-win-win across the board, so long as ROIC is careful and disciplined in where it targets these adjustments, always carefully balancing them against the need to keep space filled and the cash flow coming in. Of course, with a portfolio currently 97.2% leased -- and with 99% of that particularly important anchor space leased -- it's clear that management is keeping a very good balance thus far.
Potential problemsLike all REITs, ROIC uses debt to acquire new properties and is sensitive to interest rate increases. The Federal Reserve plans to raise rates twice this year, so that's a potential issue. If the cost of borrowing increases, it's tougher to find profitable acquisitions, and more money gets eaten up by current interest payments if the debt is floating-rate.





Yet ROIC has done good work to lessen the potential pain. At the end of 2015, ROIC had roughly $991 million in debt, of which $436 million was floating-rate and therefore could become more expensive to the company if interest rates increase. But the company is already responding proactively, having converted $100 million of that $436 million to fixed-rate loans since the beginning of 2016.
Another issue is ROIC's geographic concentration. It offers one product in one area -- shopping centers on the U.S. West Coast. It's dependent not just on national economic factors, but also on factors that could be specific to the West Coast. And while ROIC has done well in navigating current challenges -- in its most recent call, Schoebel said a recent minimum-wage increase "had no impact on the rent that [tenants are] willing to pay" -- potential macro problems shouldn't be discounted.
Let's talk numbersROIC trades at about 12.6 times 2015's funds from operations (FFO – a supplementary measure REITs use to measure their net income once they zero out certain non-cash expenses, such as depreciation). That's cheaper than larger retail REITs such as Realty Income, which trades at roughly 24 times 2015 FFO, and National Retail Properties, trading at 22 times 2015 FFO. It also probably reflects some of the perceived risk of geographic concentration ROIC has. So shares are arguably, well, rather cheap.
Management just boosted ROIC's already solid 3% annual dividend by 6% for 2016, reflecting confidence in the business' growth prospects. At the midpoint of 2016 guidance, the dividend would eat up about 71% of FFO, which looks pretty safe (anything above 85% is a bit suspect), so all appears well on that end, too.





So is it a buy?Reasonable valuation? Check. Safe dividend? Check. Good business model? Check. Management that's executing well? Check.
For me, that's a yes: This stock is a buy.

intangibles, anchor lease termination fees, net of contractual amounts, and expense and recovery adjustments related to prior periods.NON-GAAP DISCLOSURESFunds from operations (“FFO”), is a widely recognized non-GAAP financial measure for REITs that the Company believes when considered with financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, provides additional and useful means to assess its financial performance.  FFO is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate the performance of REITs, most of which present FFO along with net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP.  The Company computes FFO in accordance with the “White Paper” on FFO published by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”), which defines FFO as net income attributable to common stockholders (determined in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring, sales of depreciable property and impairments, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for partnerships and unconsolidated joint ventures.The Company uses cash net operating income (“NOI”) internally to evaluate and compare the operating performance of the Company’s properties.  The Company believes cash NOI provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level, and when compared across periods, can be used to determine trends in earnings of the Company’s properties as this measure is not affected by the non-cash revenue and expense recognition items, the cost of the Company’s funding, the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses, gains or losses from the acquisition and sale of operating real estate assets, general and administrative expenses or other gains and losses that relate to the Company’s ownership of properties.  The Company believes the exclusion of these items from operating income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating the Company’s properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.  Cash NOI is a measure of the operating performance of the Company’s properties but does not measure the Company’s performance as a whole and is therefore not a substitute for net income or operating income as computed in accordance with GAAP.  The Company defines cash NOI as operating revenues (base rent and recoveries from tenants), less property and related expenses (property operating expenses and property taxes), adjusted for non-cash revenue and operating expense items such as straight-line rent and amortization of lease intangibles, debt-related expenses and other adjustments.  Cash NOI also excludes general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, acquisition transaction costs, other expense, interest expense, gains and losses from property acquisitions and dispositions, extraordinary items, tenant improvements and leasing commissions.  Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating cash NOI, and accordingly, the Company’s cash NOI may not be comparable to other REITs.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
