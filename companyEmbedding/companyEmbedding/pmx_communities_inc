Home Care FAQ | Care Indeed


















































  

Care Indeed (650) 328-1001 


Home Care FAQs

Q. What is Care Indeed Home Care Services?
A. Care Indeed provides  in-home caregiving services for the elderly in these counties: Santa Clara, San Mateo, Alameda, San Francisco, and Contra Costa. We also cater to the needs of East Bay and its surrounding areas’ residents. We offer extensive in-home care services for seniors who embrace their independence and the personal dignity that goes with it. Our in-home care services are provided by insured caregivers who have passed a national criminal background check and have undergone an extensive interviewing  process and evaluation. If a senior family member needs in-home care services, we are an excellent provider with exemplary references.
Q. What is non-medical in-home care?
A. Generally for non-medical care, there are no intensive rehabilitative sessions, monitoring heart rhythms, or managing blood-sugar levels. Instead, we see that the basic needs of those who cannot fully function by themselves receive the appropriate care. Such needs include personal care, meal preparation, and maintaining a safe home environment.
Q. What type of caregiver can I expect?
A. The benefit of requesting a caregiver from our network is the assurance that your loved ones will receive care from a highly qualified, trained professional. Our company is staffed by certified nursing assistants, home health aides or home companions who are professional, educated, and experienced in elder care or children with disabilities. We know it is important that you feel safe letting someone come into your home, therefore, we require that all caregivers are screened as required by law and receive training in emergency response as well as in the nuances of backup care.
Q. What tips should I follow?
A. Once care has been scheduled, you can request that the agency call you and discuss the caregiver’s background or training and the specific needs of your family. Be prepared to discuss rules, meals, schedules, expectations, special needs, etc. We recommend that you schedule the caregiver to come to your home at least 30 minutes prior to needing care. This will give your family time to get acquainted with the caregiver, provide a tour of your home, answer any additional questions and provide rules, expectations and a list of your emergency contact information. Request our In-Home Care liability insurance when you schedule care, for your peace of mind.
Q. Can I request the same caregiver the next time I need backup care?
A. Our Backup Care Specialists will request the same caregiver as much as we can; however, this is not guaranteed due to caregiver availability, location and/or time constraints.
Q. Can my health insurance cover for the cost of home care?
A. Generally, Private pay, Medicare and Medicaid do not pay for long-term home care but long-term care insurance does cover the costs depending on what type of policy you have. We cater to the individual needs of our clients so they only pay for the services and care they require.
Q. Can I have home care in other locations aside from my home?
A. Yes, long-term care can be provided in nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and retirement communities.  We also offer companionship services to clients during a hospital stay.
Q. What is In-home Respite?
A. In-home respite services consists of a caregiver who works in the family home so that the family member can leave the house for a period of time. These services are usually provided by our company. We recruit, screen, and train workers, with no contract and no long-term commitment for our clients. This type of respite is usually less disruptive to the individual needing care, provided there is a good match between the caregiver and the individual.
Q. What is an assessment of need?
A. An assessment means gathering all the relevant and vital information about you or the person receiving the care so your case is fully understood. The kind of assessment you have will depend on the informed needs. We may need to involve other people, such as your family, close family friends, or your doctor to understand your needs more thoroughly. However, we will always ask your permission before we contact them. All information is treated as confidential.
Q. Is home care only available for seniors?
A. No, home care is available to any person who requires any type of assistance from a caregiver. We provide care to people of all ages.
Q. Why should I choose home health care?
A. Home health care is another option for receiving health care services. With a private caregiver, a client can receive personalized care in a quick and effective manner. Many people also believe that returning to one’s home can sometimes speed up recovery as well as improve the quality of life for the family and the client.

PMX Communities Inc. Introduces The LXIV Marijuana Terminal






GlobeNewswire



Feb 11, 2014 10:10 AM EST













 




























































    BOCA RATON, Fla., Feb. 11, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PMX Communities Inc. (OTCQB:PMXO), a precious metals incubation company announces the diversification of their product line of dispensing machines with the introduction of the LXIV Marijuana terminal.  The LXIV will be similar in appearance to our precious metals terminal successfully tested in Florida 2013. PMX expects the first machine to be located in Colorado. The security features and touch screen technology will remain similar. The terminal will vend single products packaged in plastic opaque child resistant bags compliant with the new Colorado Marijuana Rules. The internal software will have the ability to monitor the products inventory remotely and record daily sales. The terminal reader will not accept credit cards or cash, but it will dispense with a swipe of a prepaid magnetic striped card. These loyalty cards will be sold in the Marijuana dispensary store, and can only be used in their programmed terminal.  "Making certain we adhere to the regulations detailed in the cannabis retail legislation and staying updated to any code changes will be our first priority. Commercializing a new product can be a difficult task, and we will conservatively and professionally launch the LXIV terminal in the same manner we did our first precious metals machine. We are hoping this new venture becomes a revenue stream for PMX," stated Lindsey R. Perry, JR, CEO of PMX Communities, Inc.  PMX Gold Bullion Sales, Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of PMX Communities, Inc., launched the MGIV gold terminal in Town Center, Boca Raton in January 2013. The MGIV gold terminal is the first US made specialty-dispensing machine that allows consumers to purchase varying denominations of fine gold bullion bars and coins with a touch of a screen and a swipe of their global credit and debit cards.

	On July 18, 2016, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the number of shares available for issuance through the 2011 stock awards plan from 10,000,000 common shares to 17,700,000 common shares.





	The Company is focused on working to build a new avenue to market their terminals globally. As well, the Company is looking for new opportunities for their shareholders.







	Operations




	The Company has developed its PMX Gold Bullion Dispensing Terminal prototype called the MGIV and deployed the first prototype in Boca Raton, Florida, U.S.A. The terminal is an unmanned dispenser, which allows for gold dispensing and deposit and account management functions. The terminal also incorporated conventional ATM and touch-screen technology.





	The Company has been assigned the ownership rights to two U.S. Provisional Patent Applications and a final International Patent Application Number PCT/US2012/020486 (Unattended Precious Metal Distribution System, Methods and Apparatus), and has filed next stage patent applications for its proprietary precious metals machine, in Australia, South Africa and the United States of America.


	 


	The first original focus was the consumer demand for essentially one commodity gold through a dispensing terminal. Specifically, we were addressing the markets of physical gold ownership by retail investors, as well as developing and offering an ancillary set of financial services that would complement the purchase and sale of gold and other precious metals by retail investors.





	During 2016, we re-evaluated the direction for our terminals.  With precious metals making a turn around, we are looking to distribution networks for the machines, and we are pursuing avenues to license our terminal technologies and sell terminals.







	Employees




	We employ part-time employees on an as needed basis.  We also have various consultants, lawyers and others that work for us on different aspects of our operations.  As operations increase and revenues allow, we will have to employ an additional undetermined number of employees, consultants and contracted professionals to assist with the development of the Companys business plan.

	Trends and Uncertainties





	The registrant has developed its PMX Gold Bullion Dispensing Terminal prototype called the MGIV and deployed the first prototype in Boca Raton, Florida, U.S.A. The terminal is an unmanned dispenser, which allows for gold dispensing and deposit and account management functions. The terminal also incorporated conventional ATM and touch-screen technology. After a successful six months test, the MGIV was removed in July 2013 from the first location.


	 


	The registrant has been assigned the ownership rights to two U.S. Provisional Patent Applications and a final International Patent Application Number PCT/US2012/020486 (Unattended Precious Metal Distribution System, Methods and Apparatus), and has filed next stage patent applications for its proprietary precious metals machine, in Australia, South Africa and the United States of America.





	During 2016, we continued to look for opportunities for the company dispensing terminals. As precious metals become more valuable in the marketplace we hope a return to placing the terminals in venues such as malls is a strong possibility.







	Results of Operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015







	For the year ended December 31, 2016, we did not record any revenues.  We incurred depreciation costs of $21,934, impairment loss on assets of $39,314 and selling, general and administrative expenses of $73,170.  We incurred interest expenses of $23,627.  As a result, we recorded a net loss of $159,827 for the year ended December 31, 2016.





	For the year ended December 31, 2015, we did not record any revenues.  We incurred depreciation costs of $33,408 and selling, general and administrative expenses of $86,175.  We incurred interest expenses of $25,307 and interest expenses for related party loans of $9,810. We recorded a gain on forgiveness of accounts payable of $35,495.  As a result, we had a net loss of $119,205 for the year ended December 31, 2015.





	The $40,622 difference in net loss between the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is primarily the result of decreased gains on the forgiveness of accounts payable.  We recorded a decrease in depreciation expenses of $9,692 and a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses of $13,005.  Our interest expenses decreased by $11,490, and our gain on the forgiveness of accounts payable was reduced by $35,495 for the year ended December 31, 2016.

	Liquidity and Capital Resources







	For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a net loss of $159,827.  We recorded a positive adjustment of $42,000 for common stock issued for services, a positive adjustment of $23,716 for depreciation, $39,314 for impairment of assets, and $24,550 for expenses paid by related party on behalf of the Company.  We recorded a positive change of $2,260 due to accounts payable and $24,627 due to accrued interest.  As a result, we had net cash used in operating activities of $4,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016.





	For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a net loss of $119,205.  We recorded a negative adjustment of $35,495 due to settlement income and a positive adjustment of $16,000 for common stock issued or to be issued for services and $33,408 for depreciation.  We had positive changes of $4,500 for a security deposit, $1,804 for accounts payable, and $41,773 for accrued interest.  As a result, we had net cash used in operating activities of $57,215 for the year ended December 31, 2015.





	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not pursue any investing activities.





	For the year ended December 31, 2016, we received $4,000 as proceeds from related party notes payable, resulting in net cash provided by financing activities of $4,000 for the period.





	For the year ended December 31, 2015, we received $57,202 as proceeds from related party notes payable, resulting in net cash provided by financing activities of $57,202 for the period.





	Our internal and external sources of liquidity have included proceeds raised from subscription agreements and private placements and advances from related parties.  We are currently not aware of any trends that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our liquidity.  We are attempting to increase the sales to raise much needed cash for the fulfillment of the Companys business plan.





	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements





	The Company had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2016.





	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.





	The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the reported amounts of revenues and expenses and the valuation of our assets and contingencies. We believe our estimates and assumptions to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our financial statements are based on the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern we would experience additional losses from the write-down of assets.





	The Company uses the fair value recognition provision of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, which requires the Company to expense the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of such instruments. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of any equity instruments on the grant date.





	The Company also uses the provisions of ASC 505-50, Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees, to account for stock-based compensation awards issued to non-employees for services. Such awards for services are recorded at either the fair value of the services rendered or the instruments issued in exchange for such services, whichever is more readily determinable, using the measurement date guidelines enumerated in ASC 505-50.

	New Accounting Pronouncements





	The Company has adopted all recently issued accounting pronouncements.  The adoption of the accounting pronouncements, including those not yet effective, is not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Company.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM









	To the Sole Director and Stockholders


	PMX Communities, Inc.





	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of PMX Communities, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) as of December 31, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the year then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the entitys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.





	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.





	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of PMX Communities, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.





	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a working capital deficit that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of PMX Communities, Inc. as of December 31, 2015, and the related statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the period ended December 31, 2015.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

	PMX Communities, Inc. and Subsidiaries




	Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


	For the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015





	NOTE 1  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS





	PMX Communities, Inc.  "PMX" was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 29, 2004 under the name Merge II, Inc. and changed its name to PMX Communities, Inc. effective February 10, 2009. PMX's year end is December 31.





	On September 28, 2010, PMX formed PMX Gold, LLC, (PMX Gold) a Florida limited liability company as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company to assist with evaluating and pursuing opportunities within the Gold Mining and Retail Gold Sales Industries.





	On September 28, 2011, PMX formed PMX Gold Bullion Sales Inc. (PMX Bullion), a Florida corporation as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.





	PMX, (through its wholly owned subsidiaries PMX Gold, LLC and PMX Gold Bullion Sales Inc.) focuses on the development of leveraged opportunities within the Retail Gold Sales and Gold Mining Industries.





	PMX Communities, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are hereafter referred to as the Company.





	On July 18, 2016, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the number of shares available for issuance through the 2011 stock awards plan from 10,000,000 common shares to 17,700,000 common shares.





	NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN





	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Company has a working capital deficit, has incurred reoccurring net losses and has not yet established revenue producing activities which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.





	Based on the above considerations, there is a substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company's ability to further implement its business plan and generate future profits or attain working capital through debt or equity financing.  Management hopes that with precious metals making a turn around, they will obtain distribution networks for the machines.  Management hopes to find avenues to license their terminal technologies and sell terminals which will bring sufficient revenues and investment into the Company to sustain its growth and operations.  Furthermore, management believes organic growth through a new strategy in the Companys subsidiaries will assist the Company in achievement of its goals. There is no assurance that this series of events will be satisfactorily completed. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.





	NOTE 3  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





	Basis of Presentation





	Our financial statements are stated in United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP").





	Cash and Cash Equivalents





	The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.






	18












	Use of Estimates





	The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the period presented.





	We make our estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available. We believe that our significant estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, based upon information available at the time they were made. Actual results could differ from these estimates, making it possible that a change in these estimates could occur in the near term.





	Principles of Consolidation





	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PMX Communities, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, PMX Gold, LLC and PMX Gold Bullion Sales, Inc. All inter-company transactions have been eliminated.





	Financial Instruments and Fair Value





	The Companys balance sheet includes certain financial instruments, including accounts payable, accrued expenses and notes payable. The carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate their fair value because of the relatively short period of time between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization.





	ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entitys own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:





	Level 1


	Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities





	Level 2


	Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.





	Level 3


	Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.









	19









	Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of December 31, 2016. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.





	Equipment





	Equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of five years for equipment, five years for molds and seven years for furniture and fixtures.





	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets





	The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets and the related estimated remaining useful lives when events or circumstances lead management to believe that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts. In such circumstances, those assets are written down to estimated fair value. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset's estimated fair value and its book value.





	Common Stock, Common Stock Options and Warrants





	The Company uses the fair value recognition provision of ASC 718, "Compensation-Stock Compensation," which requires the Company to expense the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of such instruments. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of any equity instruments on the grant date.





	The Company also uses the provisions of ASC 505-50, "Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees," to account for stock-based compensation awards issued to non-employees for services. Such awards for services are recorded at either the fair value of the services rendered or the instruments issued in exchange for such services, whichever is more readily determinable, using the measurement date guidelines enumerated in ASC 505-50.





	Income Taxes





	Under the asset and liability method prescribed under ASC 740, Income Taxes, the Company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes. The liability method measures deferred income taxes by applying enacted statutory rates in effect at the balance sheet date to the differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts on the financial statements. The resulting deferred tax assets or liabilities are adjusted to reflect changes in tax laws as they occur. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.





	The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of an uncertain tax position only after considering the probability that a tax authority would sustain the position in an examination. For tax positions meeting a "more-likely-than-not" threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the benefit expected to be realized upon settlement with the tax authority. For tax positions not meeting the threshold, no financial statement benefit is recognized. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no uncertain tax positions. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has approximately $3,725,000 in net loss carry forwards. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions as general and administrative expenses. The Company currently has no federal or state tax examinations nor has it had any federal or state examinations since its inception. The tax years for December 31, 2011-2016 remain subject to review by federal and state tax authorities.

	Revenue Recognition





	The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized and realizable.





	- Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; and


	- Delivery has occurred; and


	- Price is fixed or determinable; and


	- Collectability is reasonably assured





	Subject to these criterions, the Company recognizes revenue at the time the merchandise is purchased and the machine dispenses the relevant merchandise. The Company offers its individual customers a 14-day warranty if the item is returned and if the TEP packaging is not broken. The customer will receive their money back. The Company estimates an allowance for sales returns based on historical experience with product returns. The Company closely follows the provisions of ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, which includes the guidelines of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 as described above.





	Income (loss) Per Common Share





	Basic income (loss) per share is calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each reporting period. Diluted loss per share includes potentially dilutive securities such as outstanding options and warrants, using various methods such as the treasury stock or modified treasury stock method in the determination of dilutive shares outstanding during each reporting period. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no warrants issued and outstanding.





	Recent Authoritative Accounting Pronouncement





	In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (ASU 2014-15). ASU 2014-15 is intended to define managements responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organizations ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this ASU are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-15 will have on its financial statements.






	21












	Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.







	NOTE 4  PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT





	Components of property and equipment are as follows:

	Depreciation for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $23,716 and $33,408, respectively. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Through its analysis, the Company determined that the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets, therefore, an impairment loss of $39,314 was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016.





	NOTE 5  NOTES PAYABLE





	Promissory Notes carry outstanding principal balances of $157,367 and $153,367 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Related accrued interest was $115,644 and $92,017 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  As of December 31, 2016, these notes are due on demand as their maturity dates have passed and are considered to be in default.  These notes bear interest at a rate of 5% to 12% per annum.

	Item 9.  Changes In and Disagreements With Accountants On Accounting And Financial Disclosure






	None









	Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures








	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of December 31, 2016.  We do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control.  Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible.  However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals.  Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded such controls and procedures to be not effective as of December 31, 2016 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.






	Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting



	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  Our internal control over financial reporting is the process designed by and under the supervision of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, or the persons performing similar functions, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  These officers have evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

	Internal Control over Financial Reporting  Guidance for Smaller Public Companies

	.





	Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 and concluded that it was not effective because of the material weakness described below:





	In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, material weaknesses became evident to management regarding our inability to generate all the necessary disclosure for inclusion in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission due to the lack of resources which resulted in lack of multiple levels of supervision and review and a lack of segregation of duties. A material weakness is a significant deficiency in one or more of the internal control components that alone or in the aggregate precludes our internal controls from reducing to an appropriately low level the risk that material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.





	The Company hired an outsource certified public accountant to work with our CFO and management on an as needed basis to eliminate the material weaknesses.  We will continue to aggressively recruit experienced professionals to ensure that we include all necessary disclosures in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although we believe that this corrective step will enable management to conclude that the internal controls over our financial reporting are effective when the staff is trained, we cannot assure you these steps will be sufficient. We may be required to expend additional resources to identify, assess and correct any additional weaknesses in internal control.






	24









	This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.  Managements report was not subject to attestation by the Companys registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only managements report in this annual report.






	Evaluation of Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting



	Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have evaluated changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2016.  Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, or those persons performing similar functions, did not identify any change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.






	Important Considerations



	The effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error, and the risk of fraud. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time. Because of these limitations, there can be no assurance that any system of disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management.

	Business Experience of Officers, Directors and Significant Employees





	Lindsey R. Perry, Jr. has been the chairman, chief executive officer, and chief financial officer of PMX Communities since April 19, 2012.  Mr. Perry graduated from Bucknell University in 1977 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in accounting.





	The above named director will serve in his capacity as director until our next annual shareholder meeting to be held within six months of our fiscal year's close.  Directors are elected for one-year terms.





	Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance





	To our knowledge, other than Lindsey Perry, no director, officer or beneficial owner of more than ten percent of any class of our equity securities, failed to file on a timely basis reports required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act during 2015.






	Code of Ethics Policy



	We have not yet adopted a code of ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller or persons performing similar functions.






	Corporate Governance



	There have been no changes in any state law or other procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to our board of directors.  In addition to having no nominating committee for this purpose, we currently have no specific audit committee and no audit committee financial expert.  Based on the fact that our current business affairs are simple, any such committees are excessive and beyond the scope of our business and needs.

	None of our directors, executive officers and control persons has been involved in any of the following events during the past ten years:

Home Care FAQ | Care Indeed


















































  

Care Indeed (650) 328-1001 


Home Care FAQs

Q. What is Care Indeed Home Care Services?
A. Care Indeed provides  in-home caregiving services for the elderly in these counties: Santa Clara, San Mateo, Alameda, San Francisco, and Contra Costa. We also cater to the needs of East Bay and its surrounding areas’ residents. We offer extensive in-home care services for seniors who embrace their independence and the personal dignity that goes with it. Our in-home care services are provided by insured caregivers who have passed a national criminal background check and have undergone an extensive interviewing  process and evaluation. If a senior family member needs in-home care services, we are an excellent provider with exemplary references.
Q. What is non-medical in-home care?
A. Generally for non-medical care, there are no intensive rehabilitative sessions, monitoring heart rhythms, or managing blood-sugar levels. Instead, we see that the basic needs of those who cannot fully function by themselves receive the appropriate care. Such needs include personal care, meal preparation, and maintaining a safe home environment.
Q. What type of caregiver can I expect?
A. The benefit of requesting a caregiver from our network is the assurance that your loved ones will receive care from a highly qualified, trained professional. Our company is staffed by certified nursing assistants, home health aides or home companions who are professional, educated, and experienced in elder care or children with disabilities. We know it is important that you feel safe letting someone come into your home, therefore, we require that all caregivers are screened as required by law and receive training in emergency response as well as in the nuances of backup care.
Q. What tips should I follow?
A. Once care has been scheduled, you can request that the agency call you and discuss the caregiver’s background or training and the specific needs of your family. Be prepared to discuss rules, meals, schedules, expectations, special needs, etc. We recommend that you schedule the caregiver to come to your home at least 30 minutes prior to needing care. This will give your family time to get acquainted with the caregiver, provide a tour of your home, answer any additional questions and provide rules, expectations and a list of your emergency contact information. Request our In-Home Care liability insurance when you schedule care, for your peace of mind.
Q. Can I request the same caregiver the next time I need backup care?
A. Our Backup Care Specialists will request the same caregiver as much as we can; however, this is not guaranteed due to caregiver availability, location and/or time constraints.
Q. Can my health insurance cover for the cost of home care?
A. Generally, Private pay, Medicare and Medicaid do not pay for long-term home care but long-term care insurance does cover the costs depending on what type of policy you have. We cater to the individual needs of our clients so they only pay for the services and care they require.
Q. Can I have home care in other locations aside from my home?
A. Yes, long-term care can be provided in nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and retirement communities.  We also offer companionship services to clients during a hospital stay.
Q. What is In-home Respite?
A. In-home respite services consists of a caregiver who works in the family home so that the family member can leave the house for a period of time. These services are usually provided by our company. We recruit, screen, and train workers, with no contract and no long-term commitment for our clients. This type of respite is usually less disruptive to the individual needing care, provided there is a good match between the caregiver and the individual.
Q. What is an assessment of need?
A. An assessment means gathering all the relevant and vital information about you or the person receiving the care so your case is fully understood. The kind of assessment you have will depend on the informed needs. We may need to involve other people, such as your family, close family friends, or your doctor to understand your needs more thoroughly. However, we will always ask your permission before we contact them. All information is treated as confidential.
Q. Is home care only available for seniors?
A. No, home care is available to any person who requires any type of assistance from a caregiver. We provide care to people of all ages.
Q. Why should I choose home health care?
A. Home health care is another option for receiving health care services. With a private caregiver, a client can receive personalized care in a quick and effective manner. Many people also believe that returning to one’s home can sometimes speed up recovery as well as improve the quality of life for the family and the client.
