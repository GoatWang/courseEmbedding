NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns ratings and Rating Outlooks to the notes issued by 
      Volkswagen Auto Loan Enhanced Trust 2014-1 (VALET 2014-1) as follows:
    

      --$288,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$418,000,000 class A-2 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$418,000,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$126,000,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Strong Collateral Quality: The weighted average (WA) FICO score of 763 
      is consistent with recently issued VALET transactions and, combined with 
      the strong internal credit-tier distribution, indicates a strong 
      borrower. The concentration of extended term loans has decreased from 
      the previous transactions.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement: VALET 2014-1 incorporates a 
      sequential-pay structure. Initial credit enhancement (CE) is 3.10% of 
      the initial adjusted pool balance, growing to 3.50% consistent with 
      recent Volkswagen transactions. Annual excess spread is expected to be 
      2.07%. Consistent with expected ratings of 'AAAsf', CE is sufficient to 
      cover in excess of a 5.0x multiple of Fitch's base case expected 
      lifetime cumulative net losses (CNLs) of 1.20%.
    

      Strong Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses and delinquencies on 
      Volkswagen Credit Inc.'s (VCI) portfolio and securitizations have shown 
      continued improvement from the peak levels observed in the 2007 and 2008 
      vintages and have stabilized at low levels since 2010.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: Fitch rates the parent Volkswagen Group 'A-' 
      with a Positive Rating Outlook. Volkswagen has recorded positive 
      corporate financial results in recent years, and its overall corporate 
      health has remained strong.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of VCI would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      Stable Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Fitch believes VCI to be a 
      capable originator, underwriter and servicer. These capabilities are 
      further evidenced by historical portfolio delinquency and loss 
      experience and securitization performance.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. In turn, it could result in potentially adverse rating actions on 
      the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to 
      all classes of VALET 2014-1 to increased losses over the life of the 
      transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the notes display some 
      sensitivity to increased defaults and losses. In fact, they could lead 
      to potential downgrades of up to one category under Fitch's moderate 
      (1.5x base case loss) scenario. The notes could experience downgrades of 
      up to three rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) 
      scenario.

      transaction can be found in Volkswagen Auto Loan Enhanced Trust 
      2014-1--Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for 
      the asset class as detailed in Fitch's April 17, 2012 special report,

THIS PURCHASE AGREEMENT is made and entered into as of April 30, 2014 (as amended from time
to time, this Agreement) by VW CREDIT, INC., a Delaware corporation (VCI), and VOLKSWAGEN AUTO LEASE/LOAN UNDERWRITTEN FUNDING, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Purchaser). 
WITNESSETH:  WHEREAS, the
Purchaser desires to purchase from VCI a portfolio of motor vehicle receivables, including motor vehicle retail installment sales contracts and/or installment loans that are secured by new and used automobiles, minivans and sport utility vehicles;
and  WHEREAS, VCI is willing to sell such portfolio of motor vehicle receivables and related property to the Purchaser on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement.  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements set forth herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:  ARTICLE I 
DEFINITIONS AND USAGE  SECTION
1.1 Definitions. Except as otherwise defined herein or as the context may otherwise require, capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein are defined in Appendix A to the Sale and Servicing Agreement dated as of the
date hereof (as from time to time amended, supplemented or otherwise modified and in effect, the Sale and Servicing Agreement) among Volkswagen Auto Loan Enhanced Trust 2014-1, VCI, as servicer, the Purchaser, as seller, and
Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as indenture trustee, which also contains rules as to usage that are applicable herein.  SECTION 1.2
Other Interpretive Provisions. For purposes of this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires: (a) accounting terms not otherwise defined in this Agreement, and accounting terms partly defined in this Agreement to the extent not
defined, shall have the respective meanings given to them under GAAP (provided, that, to the extent that the definitions in this Agreement and GAAP conflict, the definitions in this Agreement shall control); (b) terms defined in Article
9 of the UCC as in effect in the relevant jurisdiction and not otherwise defined in this Agreement are used as defined in that Article; (c) the words hereof, herein and hereunder and words of similar import
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement; (d) references to any Article, Section, Schedule, Appendix or Exhibit are references to Articles, Sections, Schedules, Appendices and Exhibits in or to

ARTICLE II 
PURCHASE  SECTION 2.1
Agreement to Sell and Contribute on the Closing Date. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, VCI agrees to transfer, assign, set over, sell and otherwise convey to the Purchaser without recourse (subject to
the obligations herein) on the Closing Date all of VCIs right, title and interest in, to and under the Receivables, the Collections after the Cut-Off Date, the Receivable Files and the Related Security relating thereto, described in an
Assignment in the form of Exhibit A delivered on the Closing Date (collectively, the Purchased Assets), having a Net Pool Balance as of the Cut-Off Date equal to $1,334,566,845.00, which sale shall be effective as of the
Cut-Off Date. The sale, transfer, assignment, contribution and conveyance made hereunder does not constitute and is not intended to result in an assumption by the Purchaser of any obligation of the Originator to the Obligors, the Dealers or any
other Person in connection with the Receivables or the other assets and properties conveyed hereunder or any agreement, document or instrument related thereto. 
SECTION 2.2 Consideration and Payment. In consideration of the transfer of the Purchased Assets conveyed to the Purchaser pursuant to
Section 2.1 on the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall pay to VCI on such date an amount equal to the estimated fair market value of the Purchased Assets, which amount shall be paid (a) in cash to VCI and (b) by a capital
contribution by VCI of an undivided interest in such Purchased Assets that increases its equity interest in the Purchaser in an amount equal to the excess of the estimated fair market value of the Purchased Assets over the amount of cash paid by the
Purchaser to VCI.  ARTICLE III 
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS 
SECTION 3.1 Representations and Warranties of VCI. VCI makes the following representations and warranties as of the Closing Date on
which the Purchaser will be deemed to have relied in acquiring the Purchased Assets. The representations and warranties will survive the conveyance of the Purchased Assets to the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, the conveyance of the Purchased
Assets to the Issuer pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement and the Grant thereof by the Issuer to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the Indenture: 
(a) Existence and Power. VCI is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its state of organization and has,
in all material respects, all power and authority required to carry on its business as now conducted. VCI has obtained all necessary licenses and approvals in each jurisdiction where the failure to do so would materially and adversely affect the
ability of VCI to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents or the enforceability or collectibility of the Receivables or any other part of the Purchased Assets. 
(b) Authorization and No Contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by VCI of each Transaction Document to which it is a
party (i) have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of VCI and (ii) do not contravene or constitute a default under (A) any applicable law, rule or regulation, (B) its organizational documents or
(C) any

Purchase Agreement (VALET 2014-1)



material agreement, contract, order or other instrument to which it is a party or its property is subject (other than violations of which do not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of
any of such agreements and which, individually or in the aggregate, would not materially and adversely affect the transactions contemplated by, or VCIs ability to perform its obligations under, the Transaction Documents). 
(c) No Consent Required. No approval or authorization by, or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance by VCI of any Transaction Document other than (i) UCC filings, (ii) approvals and authorizations that have previously been obtained and filings that have previously been made and (iii) approvals,
authorizations or filings which, if not obtained or made, would not have a material adverse effect on the enforceability or collectibility of the Receivables or any other part of the Purchased Assets or would not materially and adversely affect the
ability of VCI to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents.  (d) Binding Effect. Each Transaction Document to which
VCI is a party constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of VCI enforceable against VCI in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
receivership, conservatorship or other similar laws affecting creditors rights generally and, if applicable, the rights of creditors of corporations from time to time in effect or by general principles of equity. 
(e) No Proceedings. There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of VCI, threatened against VCI before or by
any Governmental Authority that (i) assert the invalidity or unenforceability of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents, (ii) seek to prevent the issuance of the Notes or the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents, (iii) seek any determination or ruling that would materially and adversely affect the performance by VCI of its obligations under this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents, or (iv) relate to VCI that would materially and adversely affect the federal or Applicable Tax State income, excise, franchise or similar tax attributes of the Notes. 
(f) Lien Filings. VCI is not aware of any material judgment, ERISA or tax lien filings against VCI. 
(g) State of Incorporation; Name; No Changes. VCIs state of incorporation is the State of Delaware. VCIs exact legal name is
VW Credit, Inc. VCI has not changed its name whether by amendment of its Articles of Incorporation, by reorganization or otherwise, and has not changed its state of incorporation, within the four months preceding the Closing Date. 
SECTION 3.2 Representations and Warranties of VCI as to each Receivable. VCI hereby makes the representations and warranties set forth
on Schedule I as to the Receivables, sold, contributed, transferred, assigned, set over and otherwise conveyed to the Purchaser under this Agreement on which such representations and warranties the Purchaser relies in acquiring the
Receivables. Such representations and warranties shall survive the sale of the Receivables to the Issuer under the Sale and Servicing Agreement, and the Grant of the Receivables by the Issuer to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the Indenture.
Notwithstanding any statement to the contrary contained herein or in any other Transaction Document, VCI shall not be required to notify any insurer with respect to any Insurance Policy obtained by an Obligor or to notify any Dealer about any aspect
of the transaction contemplated by the Transaction Documents.

Purchase Agreement (VALET 2014-1)


SECTION 3.3 Repurchase upon Breach. Upon discovery by or notice to the Purchaser or VCI of
a breach of any of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.2 with respect to any Receivable at the time such representations and warranties were made which materially and adversely affects the interests of the Issuer or
the Noteholders in such Receivable, the party discovering such breach or receiving such notice shall give prompt written notice thereof to the other party; provided, that delivery of the Servicers Certificate shall be deemed to
constitute prompt notice by VCI and the Purchaser of such breach; provided, further, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect any obligation of VCI hereunder. If the breach materially and adversely affects the
interests of the Issuer or the Noteholder in such Receivable, then VCI shall either (a) correct or cure such breach or (b) repurchase such Receivable from the Purchaser, in either case on or before the Payment Date following the end of the
Collection Period which includes the 60th day (or, if VCI elects, an earlier date) after the date that VCI became aware or was notified of such breach. Any such breach or failure will be deemed not to have a material and adverse effect if such
breach or failure does not affect the ability of the Purchaser (or its assignee) to receive and retain timely payment in full on such Receivable. Any such purchase by VCI shall be at a price equal to the Repurchase Price. In consideration for such
repurchase, VCI shall make (or shall cause to be made) a payment to the Purchaser equal to the Repurchase Price by depositing such amount into the Collection Account prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time on such date of repurchase. Upon payment of
such Repurchase Price by VCI, the Purchaser shall release and shall execute and deliver such instruments of release, transfer or assignment, in each case without recourse or representation, as may be reasonably requested by VCI to evidence such
release, transfer or assignment or more effectively vest in VCI or its designee any Receivable and any related Purchased Assets repurchased pursuant hereto. It is understood and agreed that the obligation of VCI to repurchase any Receivable as
described above shall constitute the sole remedy respecting such breach available to the Purchaser.  SECTION 3.4 Protection of
Title.  (a) VCI shall authorize and file such financing statements and cause to be authorized and filed such continuation and other
statements, all in such manner and in such places as may be required by law fully to preserve, maintain and protect the interest of the Purchaser under this Agreement in the Receivables (other than any Related Security with respect thereto, to the
extent that the interest of the Purchaser therein cannot be perfected by the filing of a financing statement). VCI shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) to the Purchaser file-stamped copies of, or filing receipts for, any document filed as
provided above, as soon as available following such filing.  (b) VCI shall not change its name, identity, corporate structure or
jurisdiction of organization in any manner that would make any financing statement or continuation statement filed by VCI in accordance with paragraph (a) above seriously misleading within the meaning of Sections 9-506, 9-507 or 9-508 of the UCC, unless it shall have given the Purchaser at least five days prior written notice thereof and, to the extent necessary, shall have promptly filed amendments to previously filed
financing statements or continuation statements described in paragraph (a) above (or shall have made arrangements to take such action substantially simultaneously with such change, if it is not practicable to take such action in
advance).

Purchase Agreement (VALET 2014-1)


(c) VCI shall give the Purchaser at least ten days prior written notice of any change of
location of VCI for purposes of Section 9-307 of the UCC and shall have taken all action prior to making such change (or shall have made arrangements to take such action substantially simultaneously with
such change, if it is not possible to take such action in advance) reasonably necessary or advisable in the opinion of the Purchaser to amend all previously filed financing statements or continuation statements described in paragraph
(a) above.  (d) VCI shall maintain (or shall cause its Sub-Servicer to maintain) accounts and records as to each Receivable
accurately and in sufficient detail to permit (i) the reader thereof to know at any time the status of such Receivable, including payments and recoveries made and payments owing (and the nature of each) and (ii) reconciliation between
payments or recoveries on (or with respect to) each Receivable and the amounts from time to time deposited in the Collection Account in respect of such Receivable. 
(e) VCI shall maintain (or shall cause its Sub-Servicer to maintain) its computer systems so that, from time to time after the conveyance under
this Agreement of the Receivables, the master computer records (including any backup archives) that refer to a Receivable shall indicate clearly the interest of the Purchaser (or any subsequent assignee of the Purchaser) in such Receivable and that
such Receivable is owned by such Person. Indication of such Persons interest in a Receivable shall not be deleted from or modified on such computer systems until, and only until, the related Receivable shall have been paid in full or
repurchased.  (f) If at any time VCI shall propose to sell, grant a security interest in or otherwise transfer any interest in motor
vehicle receivables to any prospective purchaser, lender or other transferee, VCI shall give to such prospective purchaser, lender or other transferee computer tapes, records or printouts (including any restored from backup archives) that, if they
shall refer in any manner whatsoever to any Receivable, shall indicate clearly that such Receivable has been sold and is owned by the Purchaser (or any subsequent assignee of the Purchaser). 
SECTION 3.5 Other Liens or Interests. Except for the conveyances and grants of security interests pursuant to this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents, VCI shall not sell, pledge, assign or transfer the Receivables or other property transferred to the Purchaser to any other Person, or grant, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien (other than Permitted Liens)
on any interest therein, and VCI shall defend the right, title and interest of the Purchaser in, to and under such Receivables or other property transferred to the Purchaser against all claims of third parties claiming through or under VCI. 
SECTION 3.6 Perfection Representations, Warranties and Covenants. VCI hereby makes the perfection representations, warranties and
covenants set forth on Schedule II hereto to the Purchaser and the Purchaser shall be deemed to have relied on such representations, warranties and covenants in acquiring the Purchased Assets.

Purchase Agreement (VALET 2014-1)


ARTICLE IV 
MISCELLANEOUS  SECTION 4.1
Transfers Intended as Sale; Security Interest.  (a) Each of the parties hereto expressly intends and agrees that the transfers
contemplated and effected under this Agreement are complete and absolute sales, transfers, assignments and contributions rather than pledges or assignments of only a security interest and shall be given effect as such for all purposes. It is further
the intention of the parties hereto that the Receivables and related Purchased Assets shall not be part of VCIs estate in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency of VCI. The sales and transfers by VCI of the Receivables and related Purchased
Assets hereunder are and shall be without recourse to, or representation or warranty (express or implied) by, VCI, except as otherwise specifically provided herein. The limited rights of recourse specified herein against VCI are intended to provide
a remedy for breach of representations and warranties relating to the condition of the property sold, rather than to the collectibility of the Receivables. 
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Receivables and other Purchased Assets are held to be property of VCI, or if for any
reason this Agreement is held or deemed to create indebtedness or a security interest in the Receivables and other Purchased Assets, then it is intended that: 
(i) This Agreement shall be deemed to be a security agreement within the meaning of Articles 8 and 9 of the New York UCC and
the UCC of any other applicable jurisdiction;  (ii) The conveyance provided for in Section 2.1 shall be deemed
to be a grant by VCI of, and VCI hereby grants to the Purchaser, a security interest in all of its right (including the power to convey title thereto), title and interest, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, in and to the Receivables and other
Purchased Assets, to secure such indebtedness and the performance of the obligations of VCI hereunder;  (iii) The
possession by the Purchaser or its agent of the Receivable Files and any other property as constitute instruments, money, negotiable documents or chattel paper shall be deemed to be possession by the secured party or possession by the
purchaser or a person designated by such purchaser, for purposes of perfecting the security interest pursuant to the New York UCC and the UCC of any other applicable jurisdiction; and 
(iv) Notifications to persons holding such property, and acknowledgments, receipts or confirmations from persons holding such
property, shall be deemed to be notifications to, or acknowledgments, receipts or confirmations from, bailees or agents (as applicable) of the Purchaser for the purpose of perfecting such security interest under applicable law.

ARTICLE III  CERTIFICATE
AND TRANSFER OF CERTIFICATE  SECTION 3.1. Initial Ownership. Upon the formation of the Issuer and until the issuance of the
Certificate, the Seller is the sole beneficiary of the Issuer; and upon the issuance of the Certificate, the Seller will no longer be a beneficiary of the Issuer, except to the extent that the Seller is the Certificateholder. 
SECTION 3.2. Authentication of Certificate. Concurrently with the sale of the Transferred Assets to the Issuer pursuant to the Sale and
Servicing Agreement, the Owner Trustee shall cause the Certificate to be executed on behalf of the Issuer, authenticated and delivered to or upon the written order of the Seller, signed by its chairman of the board, its president, its chief

SECTION 3.5. Transfer of Certificate.  
(a) The Certificateholder may assign, convey or otherwise transfer all or any of its right, title and interest in the
Certificate; provided, that (i) the Owner Trustee and the Issuer receive an Opinion of Counsel stating that, in the opinion of such counsel, such transfer will not cause the Issuer to be treated as a publicly traded partnership for
federal income tax purposes and (ii) the Certificate may not be acquired by or for the account of or with the assets of a Benefit Plan or any governmental, non-U.S., or church plan or any other employee benefit plan or retirement arrangement
that is subject to a law that is substantially similar to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (Similar Law). By accepting and holding a Certificate (or any interest therein), the holder
thereof shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that it is not, and is not purchasing the Certificate (or any interest therein) on behalf of, a Benefit Plan or any governmental, non-U.S., or church or any other employee benefit plan or
retirement arrangement that is subject to Similar Law. The Owner Trustee shall have no duty to independently determine that the requirement in (ii) above is met and shall incur no liability to any person in the event the holder of the
Certificate does not comply with such restrictions. Subject to the transfer restrictions contained herein and in the Certificate, the Certificateholder may transfer all or any portion of the beneficial interest in the Issuer evidenced by such
Certificate upon surrender thereof to the Owner Trustee accompanied by the documents required by this Section. Such transfer may be made by the registered Certificateholder in person or by his attorney duly authorized in writing upon surrender of
the Certificate to the Owner Trustee accompanied by a written instrument of transfer and with such signature guarantees and evidence of authority of the Persons signing the instrument of transfer as the Owner Trustee may reasonably require. Promptly
upon the receipt of such documents and receipt by the Owner Trustee of the transferors Certificate, the Owner Trustee shall record the name of such transferee as a Certificateholder and its percentage of beneficial interest in the Issuer in
the Certificate register and issue, execute and deliver to such Certificateholder a Certificate evidencing such beneficial interest in the Issuer. In the event a transferor transfers only a portion of its beneficial interest in the Issuer, the Owner
Trustee shall register and issue to such transferor a new Certificate evidencing such transferors new percentage of beneficial interest in the Issuer. Subsequent to a transfer and upon the issuance of the new Certificate or Certificates, the
Owner Trustee shall cancel and destroy the Certificate surrendered to it in connection with such transfer. The Owner Trustee may treat, for all purposes whatsoever, the Person in whose name any Certificate is registered as the sole owner of the
beneficial interest in the Issuer evidenced by such Certificate, and neither the Owner Trustee, nor any agent of the Owner Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary. 
(b) As a condition precedent to any registration of transfer under this Section 3.5, the Owner Trustee may require
the payment of a sum sufficient to cover the payment of any tax or taxes or other governmental charges required to be paid in connection with such transfer.

(VALET 2014-2)


(c) The Owner Trustee shall not be obligated to register any transfer of a
Certificate unless each of the transferor and the transferee have certified to the Owner Trustee that such transfer does not violate any of the transfer restrictions stated herein including, but not limited to clauses (d) and
(e) of this Section 3.5. The Owner Trustee shall not be liable to any Person for registering any transfer based on such certifications. 
(d) No transfer (or purported transfer) of all or any part of a Certificateholders interest (or any economic interest
therein), whether to another Certificateholder or to a person who is not a Certificateholder, shall be effective, and any such transfer (or purported transfer) shall be void ab initio, and no person shall otherwise become a
Certificateholder if, after such transfer (or purported transfer), the Issuer would have more than 95 direct or indirect holders of an interest in the Certificates. For purposes of determining whether the Issuer will have more than 95 direct or
indirect holders of an interest in the Certificates, each Person indirectly owning an interest through a partnership (including any entity treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes), a grantor trust or an S Corporation for U.S.
federal income tax purposes (within the meaning of Section 1361(a)(1) of the Code) (each such entity, a flow-through entity) shall be treated as a Certificateholder unless the Seller determines in its sole and absolute
discretion, after consulting with qualified tax counsel, that less than substantially all of the value of the beneficial owners interest in the flow-through entity is attributable to the flow-through entitys interest (direct or indirect)
in the Issuer.  (e) No transfer shall be permitted if the same is effected through an established securities market or
secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof) within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code or would make the Issuer ineligible for safe harbor treatment under Section 7704 of the Code. 
SECTION 3.6. Lost, Stolen, Mutilated or Destroyed Certificates. If (i) any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the
Owner Trustee or (ii) the Owner Trustee receives evidence to its satisfaction that the Certificate has been destroyed, lost or stolen, and upon proof of ownership satisfactory to the Owner Trustee together with such security or indemnity as may
be requested by the Owner Trustee to save it harmless, the Owner Trustee shall execute and deliver a new Certificate for the same percentage of beneficial interest in the Issuer as the Certificate so mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen, of like
tenor and bearing a different issue number, with such notations, if any, as the Owner Trustee shall determine. Upon the issuance of any new Certificate under this Section 3.6, the Issuer or Owner Trustee may require the payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of the Certificate and any other reasonable expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of the Issuer and the Owner
Trustee) connected therewith. Any duplicate Certificate issued pursuant to this Section 3.6 shall constitute complete and indefeasible evidence of ownership in the Issuer, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate shall be found at any time.

Section 2.3, nor shall such Trustee be obligated to follow any such direction, if given.  SECTION 4.5. Majority
Control. To the extent that there is more than one Certificateholder, any action which may be taken or consent or instructions which may be given by the Certificateholder under this Agreement may be taken by Certificateholders holding in the

terms hereof or of any Transaction Document or is otherwise contrary to law.  (c) Whenever the Owner Trustee is unable to
decide between alternative courses of action permitted or required by the terms of this Agreement or any Transaction Document or is unsure as to the application of any provision of this Agreement or any Transaction Document or any such provision is

ARTICLE IX 
TERMINATION OF TRUST AGREEMENT 
SECTION 9.1. Termination of Trust Agreement. The Issuer shall wind up and dissolve and this Agreement shall terminate (other than
provisions hereof which by their terms survive termination) upon the later of (a) the final distribution by the Owner Trustee of all moneys or other property or proceeds of the Trust Estate in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the
Sale and Servicing Agreement and Article V and (b) the discharge of the Indenture in accordance with Article IV of the Indenture. The bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, death or incapacity of the Certificateholder shall not
(x) operate to terminate this Agreement or the Issuer nor (y) entitle the Certificateholders legal representatives or heirs to claim an accounting or to take any action or proceeding in any court for a partition or winding up of all
or any part of the Issuer or Trust Estate nor (z) otherwise affect the rights, obligations and liabilities of the parties hereto. 
SECTION 9.2. Dissolution of the Issuer. Upon dissolution of the Issuer, the Owner Trustee shall, at the direction of the Administrator,
wind up the business and affairs of the Issuer as required by Section 3808 of the Statutory Trust Act. Upon the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture, and receipt of a certificate from the Indenture Trustee stating that all Noteholders
have been paid in full and that the Indenture Trustee is aware of no claims remaining against the Issuer in respect of the Indenture and the Notes, the Trustees, in the absence of actual knowledge of any other claim against the Issuer and at the
written direction of the Certificateholder, shall be deemed to have made reasonable provision to pay all claims and obligations (including conditional, contingent or unmatured obligations) for purposes of Section 3808(e) of the Statutory Trust
Act. The Owner Trustee, upon surrender of the outstanding Certificates, shall distribute the remaining Trust Estate (if any) in accordance with Article V hereof and, at the written direction and expense of the Certificateholder, shall cause
the Certificate of Trust to be cancelled by filing a certificate of cancellation with the Delaware Secretary of State in accordance with the provisions of Section 3810 of the Statutory Trust Act, at which time the Issuer shall terminate and
this Agreement (other than Article VIII) shall be of no further force or effect.  SECTION 9.3. Limitations on Termination.

ARTICLE X  SUCCESSOR
OWNER TRUSTEES AND ADDITIONAL  OWNER TRUSTEES 
SECTION 10.1. Eligibility Requirements for the Owner Trustee and Issuer Delaware Trustee. The Owner Trustee shall at all times be a
bank (i) authorized to exercise corporate trust powers, (ii) having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 and (iii) subject to supervision or examination by Federal or state authorities. If such bank shall publish
reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then for the purpose of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its
combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most

 Amended & Restated Trust Agreement
(VALET 2014-2)



recent report of condition so published. The Issuer Delaware Trustee shall at all times be an institution satisfying the provisions of Section 3807(a) of the Statutory Trust Act. In case at
any time either Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Trustee shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in Section 10.2. 
SECTION 10.2. Resignation or Removal of Either Trustee. Each Trustee may at any time resign and be discharged from the trusts hereby
created by giving written notice thereof to the Seller, the Administrator, the Servicer, the Indenture Trustee and the Certificateholder. Upon receiving such notice of resignation, the Seller and the Administrator, acting jointly, shall promptly
appoint a successor Trustee which satisfies the applicable eligibility requirements set forth in Section 10.1 by written instrument, in duplicate, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the resigning Trustee and one copy to
the successor Trustee. If no successor Trustee shall have been so appointed and have accepted appointment within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor Trustee; provided, however, that such right to appoint or to petition for the appointment of any such successor shall in no event relieve the resigning Trustee from any obligations otherwise imposed on it
under the Transaction Documents until such successor has in fact assumed such appointment.  If at any time a Trustee shall cease to be
eligible in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 10.1 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Seller or the Administrator, or if at any time such Trustee shall be legally unable to act, or shall be
adjudged bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of such Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or control of such Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or
liquidation, then the Seller or the Administrator may remove such Trustee. If the Seller or the Administrator shall remove a Trustee under the authority of the immediately preceding sentence, the Seller and the Administrator, acting jointly, shall
promptly appoint a successor Trustee by written instrument, in duplicate, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the outgoing Trustee so removed and one copy to the successor Trustee and shall pay all fees owed to the outgoing Trustee.
 Any resignation or removal of a Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section shall
not become effective until acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee pursuant to Section 10.3 and payment of all fees and expenses owed to the outgoing Trustee. The Seller shall provide (or shall cause to be provided) notice of
such resignation or removal of the Trustee to each of the Rating Agencies.  SECTION 10.3. Successor Trustee. Any successor Trustee
appointed pursuant to Section 10.2 shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Seller, the Administrator and to its predecessor Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment under this Agreement, and thereupon the resignation or
removal of the predecessor Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor under this Agreement,
with like effect as if originally named as the Trustee. The predecessor Trustee shall upon payment of its fees and expenses deliver to the successor Trustee all documents and statements and monies held by it under this Agreement; and the Seller and
the predecessor Trustee shall execute and deliver such instruments and do such other things as may reasonably be required for fully and certainly vesting and confirming in the successor Trustee all such rights, powers, duties and obligations.

 Amended & Restated Trust Agreement
(VALET 2014-2)


No successor Trustee shall accept appointment as provided in this Section unless at the time of
such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be eligible pursuant to Section 10.1.  Upon acceptance of appointment by a
successor Trustee pursuant to this Section, the Seller shall mail (or shall cause to be mailed) notice of the successor of such Trustee to the Certificateholder, Indenture Trustee, the Noteholders and each of the Rating Agencies. If the Seller shall
fail to mail (or cause to be mailed) such notice within 10 days after acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee, the successor Trustee shall cause such notice to be mailed at the expense of the Seller. Any successor Issuer Delaware Trustee
appointed pursuant to this Section 10.3 shall promptly file an amendment to the Certificate of Trust with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware identifying the name and the principal place of business of such successor Issuer
Delaware Trustee in the State of Delaware.  SECTION 10.4. Merger or Consolidation of a Trustee. Any Person into which a Trustee may
be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Trustee shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust
business of such Trustee, shall, without the execution or filing of any instrument or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, be the successor of such Trustee hereunder;
provided, that such Person shall be eligible pursuant to Section 10.1; and provided, further that such Trustee shall file an amendment to the Certificate of Trust of the Issuer, if required by applicable law, and mail
notice of such merger or consolidation to the Seller and the Administrator.  SECTION 10.5. Appointment of Co-Trustee or Separate
Trustee. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, at any time, for the purpose of meeting any legal requirements of any jurisdiction in which any part of the Trust Estate may at the time be located, the Seller and the Owner
Trustee acting jointly shall have the power and shall execute and deliver all instruments to appoint one or more Persons approved by the Owner Trustee to act as co-trustee, jointly with the Owner Trustee, or separate trustee or separate trustees, of
all or any part of the Trust Estate, and to vest in such Person, in such capacity, such title to the Issuer, or any part thereof, and, subject to the other provisions of this Section, such powers, duties, obligations, rights and trusts as the Seller
and the Owner Trustee may consider necessary or desirable. If the Seller shall not have joined in such appointment within 15 days after the receipt by it of a request so to do, the Owner Trustee alone shall have the power to make such appointment.
No co-trustee or separate trustee under this Agreement shall be required to meet the terms of eligibility as a successor trustee pursuant to Section 10.1 and no notice of the appointment of any co-trustee or separate trustee shall be
required pursuant to Section 10.3.  Each separate trustee and co-trustee shall, to the extent permitted by law, be appointed and
act subject to the following provisions and conditions:  (i) all rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or
imposed upon the Owner Trustee shall be conferred upon and exercised or performed by the 
 









 
19
 
 Amended & Restated Trust Agreement
(VALET 2014-2)



Owner Trustee and such separate trustee or co-trustee jointly (it being understood that such separate trustee or co-trustee is not authorized to act separately without the Owner Trustee joining
in such act), except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act or acts are to be performed, the Owner Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act or acts, in which event such rights, powers,
duties and obligations (including the holding of title to the Issuer or any portion thereof in any such jurisdiction) shall be exercised and performed singly by such separate trustee or co-trustee, but solely at the direction of the Owner Trustee;
 (ii) no trustee under this Agreement shall be personally liable by reason of any act or omission of any other trustee
under this Agreement; and  (iii) the Seller and the Owner Trustee acting jointly may at any time accept the resignation of
or remove any separate trustee or co-trustee.  Any notice, request or other writing given to the Owner Trustee shall be deemed to have
been given to each of the then separate trustees and co-trustees, as effectively as if given to each of them. Every instrument appointing any separate trustee or co-trustee shall refer to this Agreement and the conditions of this Article. Each
separate trustee and co-trustee, upon its acceptance of the trusts conferred, shall be vested with the estates or property specified in its instrument of appointment, either jointly with the Owner Trustee or separately, as may be provided therein,
subject to all the provisions of this Agreement, specifically including every provision of this Agreement relating to the conduct of, affecting the liability of, or affording protection to, the Owner Trustee. Each such instrument shall be filed with
the Owner Trustee and copies thereof given to the Seller and the Administrator.  Any separate trustee or co-trustee may at any time
appoint the Owner Trustee, its agent or attorney-in-fact with full power and authority, to the extent not prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect of this Agreement on its behalf and in its name. If any separate trustee or
co-trustee shall become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all of its estates, properties, rights, remedies and trusts shall vest in and be exercised by the Owner Trustee, to the extent permitted by law, without the appointment of a new or
successor trustee. The Owner Trustee shall have no obligation to determine whether a co-trustee or separate trustee is legally required in any jurisdiction in which any part of the Trust Estate may be located. 
ARTICLE XI 
MISCELLANEOUS  SECTION
11.1. Amendments.  (a) Any term or provision of this Agreement may be amended by the Seller, the Issuer Delaware
Trustee and the Owner Trustee without the consent of the Indenture Trustee, any Noteholder, the Issuer or any other Person subject to the satisfaction of one of the following conditions:

(b) This Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Seller, the Issuer Delaware Trustee and the Owner Trustee, with
the consent of the Holders of Notes evidencing not less than a majority of the aggregate principal balance of the Outstanding Notes, for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this
Agreement or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Noteholders. It will not be necessary to obtain the consent of the Noteholders to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or consent, but it will be sufficient if such consent
approves the substance thereof. The manner of obtaining such consents (and any other consents of Noteholders provided for in this Agreement) and of evidencing the authorization of the execution thereof by Noteholders will be subject to such
reasonable requirements as the Indenture Trustee may prescribe, including the establishment of record dates pursuant to the Note Depository Agreement.

Certificate, as the case may be, to each of the Rating Agencies.  (d) Prior to the execution of any amendment to this
Agreement, the Owner Trustee and the Issuer Delaware Trustee shall be entitled to receive and conclusively rely upon an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such amendment is authorized or permitted by this Agreement and that all

rights, duties or immunities under this Agreement.

or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.  SECTION 11.6. Separate
Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.

      Fitch Rates Volkswagen Auto Loan Enhanced Trust 2014-2
    





October 22, 2014 12:52 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to the 
      notes issued by Volkswagen Auto Loan Enhanced Trust 2014-2 ('VALET 
      2014-2'):
    

      --$199,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$325,000,000 class A-2 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$369,000,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$107,000,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Strong Collateral Quality: The weighted average (WA) Fair Isaac Corp. 
      (FICO) score of 762 is consistent with recently issued VALET 
      transactions and, combined with the strong internal credit tier 
      distribution, indicates a strong borrower. However, the concentration in 
      extended-term loans is higher than for all the previous transactions, 
      except 2013-2, and the concentration in FICO scores below 650 is the 
      highest since 2010-1.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement: VALET 2014-2 incorporates a 
      sequential-pay structure. Initial credit enhancement (CE) is 3.10% of 
      the initial adjusted pool balance, growing to 3.50%. Annual excess 
      spread is expected to be 2.295%. Consistent with expected ratings of 
      'AAAsf', CE is sufficient to cover in excess of 5.0x Fitch's base case 
      loss expectation of 1.25%.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market is 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      the increasing used vehicle supply from off-lease vehicles and trade-ins 
      to pressure ABS recovery rates, leading to moderately higher loss rates. 
      Fitch's analysis accounts for this risk by including periods of weak 
      wholesale vehicle market performance in the derivation of its base case 
      loss expectation.
    

      Strong Portfolio/Securitization Performance: VCI's portfolio and 
      securitization delinquency and loss performance have improved from the 
      peak levels seen in the 2007 and 2008 vintages.
    

      Stable Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Fitch rates the parent VW 
      'A'/Outlook Stable. Fitch believes VCI to be a capable originator, 
      underwriter and servicer, as evidenced by its historical portfolio 
      delinquency and loss experience and securitization performance.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of VCI would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. In turn, it could result in potentially adverse rating actions on 
      the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to 
      all classes of VALET 2014-2 to increased losses over the life of the 
      transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the notes display some 
      sensitivity to increased defaults and losses. In fact, they could lead 
      to potential downgrades of up to one category under Fitch's moderate 
      (1.5x base case loss) scenario. The notes could experience downgrades of 
      up to three rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) 
      scenario.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in 
      Fitch's presale report, available at 'www.fitchratings.com' 
      or by clicking on the link.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representation and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in Volkswagen Auto Loan Enhanced Trust 
      2014-2--Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for 
      the asset class as detailed in Fitch's April 17, 2012 special report, 
      'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in the Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions'.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
