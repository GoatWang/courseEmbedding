    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Hooper Holmes Health Professionals: Quality Makes a Difference



 
Earlier this week I spoke with John Bond, Vice President of Provider Relations here at Hooper Holmes, about our network of Health Professionals. John has 18 years of experience developing healthcare provider networks and maximizing those networks’ quality and efficiency. I asked for his insight on Health Professionals and what makes Hooper Holmes’ network of HPs unique to the industry.
What does a Hooper Holmes Health Professional do?
Health Professionals (HPs) are the face of Hooper Holmes and the face of our customers. They visit sites across the country, in all 50 states, to conduct biometric screenings. During the screening, our HPs draw blood, take measurements, complete paperwork, and give counseling as needed. They are also responsible for ensuring that the specimens and data collected are properly packaged and labeled, and that they are delivered to the lab for testing as soon as possible. Hooper Holmes HPs are required to go to a FedEx or UPS store, not a drop box, so that they can hand the specimens to a person who will ensure their delivery.
What makes our network of HPs unique?
Hooper Holmes’ regional Field Management team partners with Event Management and HP Recruiting to oversee our HPs and ensure that the professionals we have in our network are the best in the industry. We don’t assume that all HPs get equal results; we know that a consistent attention to detail and high quality makes a real difference to participants. That’s why we actively monitor our HPs’ work for accuracy and consistency. When we find HPs who are consistently conducting error-free exams and providing participants with a fantastic screening experience, we make sure they are considered first for screenings. We support our HPs with a team of regional Field Supervisors. The Field Supervisors are all seasoned, active HPs. They have a wealth of experience and can offer our network direct coaching and mentoring on ways to avoid common mistakes and strategies to improve the consistency and quality of their work to become one of our best-in-class HPs.
We also have an industry-leading approach to bring high-quality new recruits into our network. Employees in Field Management, Event Management and HP Recruiting review upcoming screenings on a regular basis. Together, they determine which existing HPs are best suited to ensure the success of each screening. They also identify those areas of the country that require additional HP coverage as we continue to grow our business and increase the volume of screenings we complete each year. Once new HP recruits have been fully vetted and trained, they are now partnered with a seasoned, best-in-class HP to observe an actual screening in a mentoring role before they are ever assigned to a screening as an HP. This partnership and opportunity for additional mentoring allows the new recruit to observe an actual Hooper Holmes screening, ask any questions they might have, and ensure they are completely comfortable and prepared before they go out for their first screening.
Why is it important to have a quality HP?
Our HPs represent not only Hooper Holmes, but also the customers that we provide services for. They are placing their trust in the hands of our HPs, and we must ensure that we hire responsible, trustworthy HPs. It is crucial that each individual is treated with care, and that his or her privacy and identity is protected. The quality of the HP’s work not only reflects on Hooper Holmes and the companies we work with, but it can also affect the type of wellness services an individual is offered.
What errors and outcomes are prevented when screenings are conducted by quality HPs?
When quality HPs conduct screenings, the individuals and groups being screened can trust that they will be given accurate results that will lead them to make the best choices to improve their health. A risk assessment can look drastically different from the reality if an HP writes down incorrect information, such as an incorrect height or weight. A person with significant health risks may be overlooked, or at the opposite end of the spectrum, a healthy person may be needlessly flagged for risks. If an HP reports incorrect data for one person, the rest of the group will inevitably question the accuracy of their results. In essence, quality Health Professionals reinforce the integrity of the wellness programs that companies are trying to get their employees involved in.
What qualifications and certifications are HPs required to have?
Hooper Holmes Health Professionals must have all the required state licensures and pass a criminal background check. In addition, they must have experience drawing blood (at least 100 recent draws). Before being considered, HPs also go through a thorough interview and reference check process. Then once hired, they must complete a training program which includes shadowing a best-in-class HP for one session.
In addition to having the proper qualifications, what qualities and skills do we look for when hiring HPs?
Beyond the aforementioned requirements, we look for several qualities when considering Health Professionals. We look for individuals who are professional in appearance as well as manner. They must have excellent blood draw skills, as well as excellent people skills. How our HPs interact with the people being screened is very important, it reflects on us, the company, and on the wellness program itself. Additionally, we look for HPs who are consistent and reliable, and who have excellent attention to detail.

Spring Wellness Resolutions



No matter what the weather’s like where you live, today is the official start of spring. January may be the time for setting goals and making resolutions, but we’ve always found that by this time of year those resolutions could use some refreshing. Spring is the perfect time for a fresh start, especially for your health and fitness goals. Here are 7 ways to make wellness a priority this spring.

After months of being stuck inside, it’s time to get outdoors! Why not find a new walking trail or path to explore in your area? If you’re not sure where you can go, the American Heart Association has a walking path finder on its website; just enter your zip code and it will suggest paths in your area.
Spring is the perfect time to check out your local farmer’s market. Buy some fresh, local produce that’s in season, and try a new recipe or two to show off your finds. (Here are a few ideas to get you started.)
Were “lose weight” or “eat healthier” among your New Year’s Resolutions? If you’ve lost steam, try setting more specific goals instead and making a plan to follow them. If your goal is to get more fruits and vegetables in your diet (that’s one of mine this year), try making a weekly menu plan that includes healthy fruit or vegetable side dishes. My new favorite is oven-roasted broccoli with garlic, red pepper flakes, and just a little parmesan cheese.
 Prepare for a rainy day by stocking your pantry with healthy staples. Quinoa, tuna packed in water, sun-dried tomatoes, and roasted red peppers are all great options, but choose items that your family will like. On days when you’re exhausted or don’t have time to make a trip to the grocery store, you’ll still have a healthy meal at your fingertips.
Find a friend, family member, or co-worker who is also working towards a health and fitness goal. Encourage each other by making dates to go to the gym or go walking together, and by finding time to talk each week to share successes and challenges.
Try a new outdoor activity. Get some friends together and play a team sport, like volleyball or softball, or find out if there’s a place you can rent a bicycle and go on a ride.
Shake up your lunch routine. It’s easy to get too busy to plan for lunch, then order something unhealthy that you’ll regret later. Instead, take a little time before the start of your work week and do your lunch-prepping. For example, make a large batch of a healthy pasta salad (this one from Health Magazine looks delicious and easy to make), and then put it into individual, easy-to-pack containers. Add a piece of fruit and a square of dark chocolate, and you have a lunch that beats takeout any day of the week.



Move Aside, Corned Beef with Cabbage: 5 Healthy Green Dinners for St. Patrick’s Day



What comes to mind when you think of St. Patrick’s Day food? Most of us think of that infamous Irish dish, corned beef with cabbage. However, with spring’s rapid approach, many of us are looking to ditch heavy, rich meals in favor of something a little lighter. In the spirit of both healthy eating and St. Patrick’s Day, here are 5 green family-friendly meals.

Lemony Chicken and Asparagus Stir Fry (from Skinnytaste). A stir fry is always a quick weeknight option, and this one won’t bust your calorie budget. Serve it with brown rice (mix in some edamame for added nutrition and festivity).
Slow-Cooker Chicken and White Beans with Kale Pesto (from Henry Happened). The slow cooker is a weeknight cook’s best friend, and I love finding healthy slow cooker recipes like this one. This meal requires minimal prep work: cooking the onions and garlic a little to soften them (although I imagine this step could be omitted if necessary) and making the pesto with the help of a food processor.
Pistachio-Crusted Salmon (from Fitness Magazine). Turn St. Patrick’s Day dinner into an elegant affair with this special occasion-worthy entrée. Serve this salmon with roasted baby potatoes and a spinach and orange salad.
Is pizza your go-to meal? This White Pizza with Lemony Greens (from Take a Megabite) combines salad and main dish, all in one slice.
If you’re entertaining a crowd, nothing beats tacos. Try these Fish Tacos with Avocado Sauce and Green Rice (from Rachael Ray). This meal is bursting with color and flavor, which makes it an instant crowd-pleaser. To up the health-factor even more, substitute the sour cream for low fat Greek yogurt in the avocado sauce.

Have a happy, healthy St. Patrick’s Day!

Why Wellness should be Part of the Small Business Equation



Most, if not all, small business owners would say that the health of their employees is important to them. In fact, research shows that 93% of small businesses say that employee health is important to their bottom line, but only 22% offer wellness programs (Vesely, 2013). The percentage for large businesses is much higher.
So why are small businesses lagging behind? Many small businesses claim the reason they do not have a wellness program is a lack of resources and expertise. Others may recognize the benefits of a wellness program, but may not know where to begin.
However, there are a number of reasons why a small business would offer a wellness program to its employees. Among these are to improve productivity, to decrease healthcare costs, to show that the company cares about the welfare of its employees, and to improve company morale. For small businesses in particular, studies show that although financial outcomes are important, it is the humanitarian and employee relations outcomes that may be more influential deciding factors for starting wellness programs (Divine, 2005).
For a small business, beginning an employee wellness program can be daunting. However, by keeping a few ideas in mind, the process can be less intimidating. For a greater impact, be sure to involve company leaders in the wellness program to set an example for employee involvement. In addition, it is helpful for a small business to understand the unique needs of its employees. This can be done through surveys, health risk assessments and on-site screenings. After the company has identified common risks and needs, it can offer programs and incentives tailored specifically to its employees. Company fitness challenges, discount programs, and incentives such as contributions to a health account are all ways for a small business to work towards meeting its wellness goals.

 Hooper Holmes and Provant to Merge 30.8 KB









All-stock, accretive transaction increasing scale and enhancing scope Pro-forma 2016 revenue of $67 millionProvides scale and significant cost saving synergiesFinancing in place to support transaction and working capitalStrength of product offering and diversification of distribution channels accelerates innovation for existing customers and growth Expected to close in 2017 second quarterOLATHE, Kan. and EAST GREENWICH, R.I., March  08, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hooper Holmes Inc. (NYSE:HH) and Provant Health Solutions LLC have agreed to combine 
in an all-stock transaction which will create one of the largest, pure-play health and wellness companies in the United States. On a combined basis, 2016 pro-forma annual revenue of the merged company is approximately $67 million, excluding $3.8 million of pass-through gift card revenue at Provant. This transaction is expected to significantly improve financial performance, expand the merged company's combined national network of local health professionals and advance its well-being solutions technology.





"Scale, growth and synergies will create a compelling financial model and are expected to improve operating cash flow for our merged company. Our channel partners will be supported by an expanded network of local health professionals and direct customers will gain access to an expanded suite of personalized digital services that promote, track and measure healthy behaviors and outcomes," said Henry E. Dubois, Chief Executive Officer of Hooper Holmes. "Combining Hooper's market-leading clinical services with Provant's expertise in member service, personalized well-being and advanced analytics will deepen collaboration with our customers and channel partners," said Heather Provino, Chief Executive Officer and founder of Provant. "Best-in-class, strategic partnerships are 
essential for capitalizing on the massive opportunity our industry is seeing in order to take advantage of the paradigm shift occurring in consumerism. We believe this powerful combination will drive innovation for our clients and accelerate growth." The transaction has compelling strategic and financial benefits for both health and wellness solutions companies. Provant and Hooper represent an exceptionally synergistic merger, bringing together unique specialties that cross business verticals. The merged company will be highly focused on leveraging each company's expertise to maximize growth, broaden market appeal and provide additional value that aligns with the objectives of clients and channel partners. The two companies have no customer overlap and both target growing healthcare market segments. Synergies from leveraging fixed costs and optimizing services and 
processes are expected to significantly reduce the merged company's cost structure, supporting a more efficient organization. The merger is expected to be accretive to adjusted EBITDA in full year 2017. Under the terms of the transaction Hooper Holmes will issue approximately 10.5 million shares of common stock to Provant's owners and the merged company will raise $3.5 million in new equity capital. Century Equity Partners, the majority shareholder of Provant, has committed to $1.75 million of the $3.5 million equity raise and certain existing Hooper shareholders and insiders have committed to an additional $1.6 million, for a total of $3.3 million of the $3.5 million already committed. Financing Financing to support the transaction and provide working capital has been arranged from SWK Holdings, a specialized finance company focused on the healthcare sector, through a $6.5 million, five year term loan at LIBOR plus 12.5%, a reduction of 150 basis points from Hooper's current term facility. Principal repayments start in the first quarter of 2019. The company has also expanded its current asset-based credit facility from $7 million to $10 million with an accordion to $15 million during high-volume months. Both of Hooper's current lenders are participating in this transaction and are providing sufficient working capital to support integration and growth. At close, the merged company is expected to have cash on hand of $2-3 
million and $10-12 million in receivables. Management and Governance Upon closing, Henry Dubois will serve as Chief Executive Officer of the merged company and Heather Provino will serve as Chief Strategy Officer. Further maintaining strength in leadership, Mark Clermont of Provant will serve as President and Steven Balthazor of Hooper Holmes will  serve as Chief Financial Officer. The Board of Directors will consist of seven members, three of which will be current Hooper Holmes directors, three of which will be current Provant directors and one independent director 
who currently chairs Hooper's audit committee. The company will continue to trade under the HH stock symbol. The company will have two major locations in Olathe, Kansas and East Greenwich, Rhode Island. Approvals and Time to Close The company expects to file a Form S-4 within the next ten days. Once the S-4 is effective, shareholder approval of the transaction is anticipated in 30 days. Closing is anticipated in late April or early May 2017. Advisors Cantor Fitzgerald has 
advised Hooper Holmes. Raymond James has advised Provant. Conference Call and Webcast The Company will host a conference call today, Wednesday, March 8, 2017, at 7:30 a.m. CT (8:30 a.m. ET) to discuss the merger.
