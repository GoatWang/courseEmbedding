Investing can be an intimidating task. When you join the Welch Group family, we take on the responsibility of getting to know you and your unique investment needs. We build a portfolio that is focused on establishing the best investment plan to achieve your goals.












The Welch Group Approach to Stewarding Investments
Our approach to Investment Management is anchored by three ideas

Investment Management begins with Retirement Analysis – To get a clear picture of your current financial situation, an understanding of your vision of your ideal retirement, and the diversions you want to take on that path (education planning, home purchases, etc.), we begin with a detailed conversation about you and your desires. Our proprietary retirement analysis gives you a clear picture of how your cash flow needs are met and how your assets will play out over of the course of your life.
A trademarked investment strategy – Our number one goal is that you never run out of money. To that end, we developed our proprietary money management approach, the Growth Strategy with a Safety NetTM.
Fee-Only Financial Planning – 100% of our compensation comes directly from our clients. No sales pitches, no commissions, no products. Our goals are aligned and our recommendations put your best interest first.

About Us











A Firm Foundation
The Welch Group, LLC was founded in 1984 as a way for Stewart H. Welch, III to serve the needs of his Birmingham, Alabama community. As he assisted his clients in ensuring their financial future he saw the need and importance for impartial financial advice from a trusted authority. The Welch Group was one of the first firms in the country to provide fee-only investment management and financial planning services for clients.

















Growing Deep and Wide
The growth that we have seen has been a direct result of our approach – assembling experts with profound understanding of investments, estate planning, insurance, tax planning, wealth protection, and cash management. Our team contains specialists for every aspect of your financial life, so we are able to serve you with expert advice and concierge care.





Welch Group Honors and Recognition
While our greatest honors and awards are the appreciations of our clients and their continued financial success, we have also been recognized for our service by outside parties.

Bloomberg Wealth Manager named The Welch Group, LLC one of the 150 top Wealth Management firms in the country






Clients Have Confidence in Our Approach

Confidentiality – We understand that your finances are one of the most intimate details of your life, so we strive to provide a friendly and confidential environment where your concerns are not shared outside your trusted team.
Impartial Advice – We value the trust you put in us. As fiduciaries, it is our moral and legal obligation to act at all times in your best interest.
Team Approach – Our team relies on their decades of experience and independent and objective perspective to proactively coordinate the intricacies of your financial world, giving you peace of mind. Our breadth of experience is witnessed by our various certifications – Certified Financial Planner (CFP®) certificants, Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA®) charterholders, Accredited Estate Planners® (AEP®), and Certified Public Accountants (CPA) – as well as the range of our advanced degrees in business (MBA), law (JD) and financial planning (MA).
Communication – We understand that proactive dialogue with our clients is the first key to successful outcomes, and conference and collaboration among your other professional advisors is the second. Understanding your life vision and how it changes over time informs us of where you want to go. Bringing everyone together to share their specific expertise allows us to design and implement plans to help you get there. Our continued communication with you keeps you fully informed and confident that we understand your world and are attending to its details and challenges.
Solutions – We focus on our clients’ most important financial concerns and produce practical, cost-efficient solutions. We are able to do this by keeping up-to-date on the complexities of the financial world and understanding their family goals, estate plans, income tax preparations, insurance needs, business interest, investments and day-to-day issues.












Mass Financial Literacy as a Core Value
While we understand our primary responsibility is to our clients, we also see the importance of promoting basic financial literacy and serving the local community.
Our members have enjoyed the privilege of providing a weekly column to the Birmingham News since 1980 (and archived here). They have also been a resource to local, regional and national news organizations, including a recurring segment on FOX 6 Birmingham. Members have published books on personal finance, wealth accumulation, debt reduction, and estate planning.
We utilize opportunities like the Alabama Money Expo and speaking to local community groups to further spread the knowledge of how money can be made, saved, invested, donated, and used.





Set Up An Initial Consultation
What we do is help clients solve problems, get organized and create lasting wealth. We want to get to know you and you to get to know us before we enter into a client relationship.
To that end we offer an initial consultation (often two meetings) without charge. The purpose of the visit(s) is to better understand your concerns and circumstances and how we may best serve you. To set up your initial visit, call Greg Weyandt at 205-879-5001 or fill out the form below and he will contact you.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Time (NYSE:TIME) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.20)Consensus Price Target: $15.20 (4.83% upside)

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
