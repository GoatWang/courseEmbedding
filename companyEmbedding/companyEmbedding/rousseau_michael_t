September 09, 2015 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



ST. PAUL, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--St. Jude Medical, Inc. (NYSE:STJ) today announced that its Board of 
      Directors has implemented a leadership transition plan that capitalizes 
      on the strength of the St. Jude Medical management team. Effective 
      January 1, 2016, Michael T. Rousseau will become President and Chief 
      Executive Officer (CEO) and a member of the St. Jude Medical Board of 
      Directors. Daniel J. Starks, following a distinguished career as St. 
      Jude Medical’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, has 
      decided to retire from his position as President and Chief Executive 
      Officer and has been elected Executive Chairman of the St. Jude Medical 
      Board of Directors.
    


      “St. Jude Medical is moving forward with this leadership succession from 
      a position of strength and, because of this, we believe it’s the right 
      time to make this transition,” Starks said. “Our consistent ability to 
      deliver impactful technologies that improve patient outcomes is what 
      ultimately drives sales and creates shareholder value. The progress we 
      have made with our innovation-based growth program is becoming 
      increasingly visible. We have demonstrated our ability to accelerate 
      sales driven by our key growth driver programs, including CardioMEMS, 
      our atrial fibrillation portfolio and our robust pipeline of 
      neuromodulation products for chronic pain.”
    

      “St. Jude Medical’s mission is to transform the treatment of expensive 
      epidemic diseases where medical device technology can improve patient 
      care and reduce the costs of health care,” continued Starks. “Mike’s 
      vision, expertise and proven track record at St. Jude Medical make him a 
      natural choice for CEO. Today's announcement underscores our deep bench 
      of talent and, together, we will ensure a seamless transition for the 
      benefit of all St. Jude Medical stakeholders.”
    

      John W. Brown, St. Jude Medical Director and Chairperson of the 
      Governance and Nominating Committee, said, “As an organization highly 
      focused on talent development, the selection of Mike to succeed Dan 
      reflects the Board’s thoughtful approach to succession planning. Mike 
      has consistently demonstrated that he is a visionary leader, innovator 
      and strong operator, and the Board believes Mike is the right leader to 
      deliver continued shareholder value. The creation of the Executive 
      Chairman role will help ensure a seamless leadership transition.”
    

      Mr. Rousseau joined St. Jude Medical in 1999 as Senior Vice President, 
      Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) Global Marketing, and later that year, 
      CRM marketing and sales were combined under his leadership. In January 
      2008, he was promoted to Group President and assumed responsibility for 
      the company’s four product divisions. He was named Chief Operating 
      Officer in 2014, overseeing global sales, marketing, technology 
      development, operations, supply chain and quality functions. Mr. 
      Rousseau has helped to drive strategic transformation across virtually 
      every area of the company. He was the architect of St. Jude Medical’s 
      recent, significant integration of four product divisions into 
      centralized global functions with a shared global vision, mission and 
      growth strategy based on accelerating innovation. During this time and 
      under Mr. Rousseau’s leadership, St. Jude Medical has achieved 
      significant cost-savings and operational efficiencies. He led the 
      realignment of global supply chain management, restructured the 
      company’s overseas manufacturing, and established a global quality 
      system to put a global infrastructure in place to prepare the company 
      for future growth. Recognizing the changing customer landscape, he 
      broadened the company’s global customer service operations with a focus 
      to enhance the experience for St. Jude Medical customers worldwide.
    

      “Over the past 16 years, I have had the privilege of working alongside 
      Dan to change the company from being largely dependent on valves and CRM 
      devices to being an industry leader with a diverse disease state 
      management portfolio. With our recent acquisitions and our strong, 
      robust product pipeline, I am focused on remaining steadfast in our 
      commitment to innovation and growth so that we can continue Dan’s legacy 
      of bringing the right solutions at the right time to our customers, 
      while improving patient outcomes and reducing health care costs,” said 
      Rousseau. “This is an exciting time for our industry, and I am highly 
      confident in our ability to continue to deliver technologies that 
      transform patient care in markets around the world. I am honored to 
      assume this leadership role in January and look forward to the 
      opportunity to continue shaping the great legacy of St. Jude Medical.”
    

      Stuart M. Essig, Ph.D., St. Jude Medical Director, Chairperson of the 
      Compensation Committee, and Member of the Governance and Nominating 
      Committee said, “Over the last 16 years, I’ve watched Mike execute his 
      vision at St. Jude Medical, and I am convinced he is the right leader 
      for the company today. The Board is very confident St. Jude Medical has 
      the leadership to drive success for many years to come.”
    

      Mr. Starks became Chairman, President and CEO of St. Jude Medical in May 
      2004. During his 11-year tenure, Mr. Starks led the company’s growth 
      from approximately $1.9 billion in annual revenue in 2003 to more than 
      $5.6 billion in annual revenue in 2014, translating into over 20,000 
      patients worldwide who are helped by a St. Jude Medical device each 
      business day. Mr. Starks has been consistently focused on delivering 
      value to shareholders, having delivered approximately 110 percent return 
      to shareholders through share price appreciation and the institution of 
      an annual dividend beginning in 2011. As Executive Chairman, Mr. Starks 
      will assist in strategic customer, business and key stakeholder 
      relationships globally and act as a strategic advisor to Mr. Rousseau in 
      addition to his governance and oversight responsibilities.
    

      “Dan is an exceptional leader who transformed St. Jude Medical into the 
      strong global company it is today, while delivering consistent growth 
      and significant shareholder value,” added Stuart M. Essig, Ph.D. “We 
      look forward to Dan’s continued leadership in his new capacity as 
      Executive Chairman.”

Michael T. Rousseau has exercised a strong behind-the-scenes role shaping St. Jude Medical Inc. into the rapidly growing health care devicemaker it is today, which helps explain why he’s been tapped to become the CEO come January.
Daniel Starks, who has been CEO for 11 years, announced Wednesday morning that he intends to step down as president and chief executive of the manufacturer of artificial heart valves, pacemakers and devices to treat pain and heart failure. Starks, 61, will remain with the company in a more advisory role as executive chairman of the board of the Little Canada-based company.
“The timing is good,” Starks said in an interview. “If I thought we were in a position where the company was about to undertake any special struggles, I would want to stay on board to help work through those struggles. I think that, to the contrary, we are on a good growth track, and we have multiple visible growth drivers that are just coming to bear.”


Rousseau, 59, began his career at St. Jude in 1999 as a senior vice president over global marketing of the company’s traditional sales powerhouse, heart rhythm devices. Ten years later he was named group president and assumed responsibility over the company’s four divisions: cardiac rhythm management, atrial fibrillation, cardiovascular, and neuromodulation. Last year he became St. Jude’s chief operating officer.
He was the architect of a strategy to centralize global functions of the company’s four divisions, many of which were added through the 17 corporate acquisitions St. Jude has done under Starks’ management.
St. Jude Medical stock dropped 3.7 percent to close at $68.59 on Wednesday. Analysts with Leerink Partners in Boston wrote in a note to investors that drop in stock price seemed “overdone,” and was likely in reaction to the realization that Starks’ departure probably closes the door on a rumored potential takeover of the company by Abbott Laboratories.















        St. Jude Medical
      

                  Michael T. Rousseau was named president and chief executive officer of St. Jude Medical Wednesday and will take the post at the start of the new year.
              






An Abbott spokesman has said it is not pursuing such a deal. On Wednesday, Starks said the Aug. 27 report in the Financial Times reporting the deal speculation was the first time he’d heard the talk: “It was a bolt from the blue,” Starks said.

The note from Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy praised St. Jude Medical’s orderly transition of the CEO, a move that she said was not surprising given that the company seemed to be grooming Rousseau for such a role in the past year.
“Given that Rousseau has been with the company for 16 years, we believe little or nothing will change as it relates to the company’s long-term strategy of continuing to innovate — both via internal and external investments — in high-growth med-tech markets within cardiology and neuromodulation,” Antalffy said in the note. “Rousseau may even bring an increased focus on cost-savings to the table — something on which he was very focused as COO.”
Rousseau is known internally for his work revamping St. Jude Medical’s internal planning, which led company executives on July 22 to announce plans to buy California heart-pump maker Thoratec Corp. for $3.4 billion. Expected to close by the end of this year, the deal will be St. Jude’s largest since the company’s founding in 1976.
LifeScience Alley, the Minnesota med-tech trade group where St. Jude is a member, congratulated Rousseau on the announcement. “We are excited to see the organization and its leadership team build on the legacy of growth and success led by Dan Starks over the past 11 years,” LifeScience Alley CEO Shaye Mandle said in an e-mail.
Starks became a director at St. Jude in 1996 and became chairman, president and CEO in May 2004. During his tenure as the chief executive, the company grew from $1.9 billion in annual revenue in 2003 to more than $5.6 billion in 2014 — a period of time marked by significant changes in how health care is paid for and delivered in the United States and globally.

Those changes include a slowdown in sales growth of heart rhythm devices like pacemakers and implantable defibrillators, which have long been key products for St. Jude. Starks’ bio on the company site credits him with transforming the company from being primarily focused on heart valves and rhythm devices to “an industry leader with a broad product portfolio across diverse disease-management areas.”
St. Jude is assembling what it says will be the industry’s most complete line of devices for heart failure, starting with a minimally invasive monitor wireless heart monitor called CardioMEMS to Thoratec’s implantable pumps, which use a propeller device and an external battery to circulate a person’s blood when the heart can’t do the job on its own.
“Over the past 16 years, I have had the privilege of working alongside Dan to change the company from being largely dependent on valves and CRM devices to being an industry leader with a diverse disease state management portfolio,” Rousseau said in a statement. “This is an exciting time for our industry, and I am highly confident in our ability to continue to deliver technologies that transform patient care in markets around the world.”
Starks continues to hold a large block of St. Jude Medical’s stock — 6.1 million shares under direct ownership, as of July 29, securities filings say. He built up that ownership position after St. Jude acquired cardiovascular device maker Daig Corp., where Starks had been president and a director until the 1996 deal brought him to St. Jude.

Welcome to the St. Jude Medical Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Hosting the call today is Mike Rousseau, President and Chief Executive Officer of St. Jude Medical.
Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements. The company's 10-K for fiscal year 2015 and 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 2, 2016, identify certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made this morning. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. The 10-K and 10-Q, as well as the company's other SEC filings are available through the company or online.
During this call, the company may use non-GAAP financial measures to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. For reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to our GAAP results, please visit the Investor Relations portion of our website, investors.sjm.com. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode.
It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Mr. Mike Rousseau.
Michael T. Rousseau - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you. Welcome to the St. Jude Medical Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Our plan this morning is for Don Zurbay, Chief Financial Officer, to provide a review of our financial results for the second quarter of 2016. And then, I will provide additional comments. Given the proposed merger agreement with Abbott announced on April 28, 2016, we have decided to withdraw our 2016 financial guidance and will not be taking questions following our prepared remarks.
Go ahead, Don.
Donald J. Zurbay - Vice President-Finance & Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Mike. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our second quarter 2016 financial results, as well as a schedule detailing reported and comparable constant currency sales results by business area. This press release is available on the St. Jude Medical website. For participants on today's call, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on a comparable, constant currency basis, which includes Thoratec sales in both comparable years and are adjusted for the impact of currency. Sales for the quarter totaled $1.562 billion, up 2% from the second quarter of last year. Unfavorable foreign currency translations decreased this quarter's sales by approximately $6 million.
During the second quarter, we recognized $67 million or $0.23 per share in net after tax special charges, acquisition-related costs, and amortization expense. For further information regarding these items, please refer to details provided in our press release. Comments during this call referencing second quarter results will be exclusive of these items. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.06 for the second quarter of 2016, compared to adjusted EPS of $1.03 in the second quarter of 2015. We estimate that on a constant currency basis, second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 7%.
Before we discuss our second quarter 2016 sales results by product category, let me provide a few comments about currency exchange rates. As discussed on prior calls, the two most significant currencies influencing St. Jude Medical's operations are the euro and the yen. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the second quarter 2016, we used exchange rates which assumed that each euro would translate into about $1.11 to $1.16, and for the yen each ¥106 to ¥111 would translate into $1. For the second quarter, the actual average exchange rates for the euro and the yen were consistent with these ranges.

I will now walk through second quarter results in our new product categories: heart failure, atrial fibrillation, neuromodulation, cardiovascular, and traditional cardiac rhythm management. For the second quarter, total heart failure sales were $384 million, down 1% from last year's second quarter. Sales results reflect strong global growth in LVAD sales, offset by the impact of U.S. CRM sales weakness in our CRT product segment. Atrial fibrillation or AF product sales for the second quarter totaled $324 million, up 13%. Our worldwide AF business again demonstrated strong growth with the continued adoption of our ablation catheter portfolio and our initial launch of EnSite Precision in European markets.
Total sales of neuromodulation products in the second quarter of 2016 were $140 million, up approximately 20%, as we continue to take share on a global basis with the most comprehensive neuromodulation portfolio in the market. Total traditional CRM sales for the second quarter of 2016 were $395 million, down 7%. Sales results were largely driven by weakness in the U.S., which declined primarily due to MRI product gaps in both our low voltage and ICD product segments. Total sales of cardiovascular products for the second quarter of 2016 were $319 million, up 2%.
Turning to the income statement, the gross profit margin during the second quarter was 69.3%, down 100 basis points from the second quarter of 2015, primarily due to a decline of 90 basis points related to the negative impact of currency. Additionally, there was a 60 basis point decline related to the continued weakness in our higher-margin U.S. CRM business. These negative factors were partially offset by the year-over-year benefit of the repeal of the medical device excise tax, which improved our gross profit margin in the quarter by 60 basis points.
Our second quarter SG&A expenses were 31.2% of net sales, a 130 basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2015. Research and development expenses in the second quarter were 12.3% of net sales. Other expense was $43 million in the second quarter, primarily driven by interest expense on our outstanding debt. And our effective income tax rate for the second quarter was 15.3%.
I will now turn it back to Mike.
Michael T. Rousseau - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Don. I appreciate everyone joining us this morning. As you heard, second quarter results were in line with previously issued guidance. Our momentum continues to build across our business, with numerous product approvals and launches.
In international markets, where we generally have more products available for sale, we grew 7% on a comparable, constant currency basis. The strong performance of our international business gives us confidence that where we have a full portfolio of emerging technologies, including MRI-safe devices, HeartMate 3, EnSite Precision, and our proprietary Burst technology, we can deliver the top tier of growth that we expect.
As an organization, we remain focused on our strategic plan of surrounding disease states and delivering the results we committed to earlier this year. Our results this quarter, particularly in our international business, continue to give us confidence that our strategy will bring us back to top tier growth. Starting with our heart failure portfolio, through our strategic acquisitions and organic growth, we have created the broadest and most innovative heart failure medical device portfolio in the world. Our investment in this space illustrates our commitment to work with governments, hospitals and physicians on solutions for this global, expensive, epidemic disease.
In the second quarter, we launched MultiPoint Pacing or MPP in the U.S., and are executing on our contracting strategy for this breakthrough treatment option for CRT patients who are not responsive to other pacing options. The clinical evidence for MPP is growing, with data showing more improved acute and chronic hemodynamic response, which includes increased injection fraction rates and improved reverse modeling.

We also have evidence demonstrating improved clinical heart failure response rates. MPP adoption increased throughout the quarter. And initial feedback in the U.S. has been positive, with electrophysiologist understanding the need for this technology to help reduce non-responder rates. Non-responder rates account for about one-third of the total population of patients receiving CRT therapy.
We are also excited about recent and upcoming launches in the U.S., Europe, and Japan for our SyncAV CRT software algorithm, which automatically adjusts pacing based on real-time changes in a patient's cardiac condition. This technology provides yet another option for patients who are not responsive to traditional pacing solutions and also helps physicians further improve treatment of patients who have responded positively to traditional CRT. We view this expanded portfolio as establishing a new standard of care in CRT.
Our CardioMEMS Heart Failure System is the cornerstone of our heart failure portfolio, and we are committed to ensuring there is established reimbursement and clear guidelines for this important technology. Recently, the European Society of Cardiology included CardioMEMS in its issued guidelines as directed therapy management and as a monitoring tool for heart failure patients. We view this recognition of the clinical importance of CardioMEMS by a leading medical society as a sign of the growing support for this technology. As previously mentioned, we have also filed for a national coverage determination with CMS and are awaiting formal acceptance of our submission from the agency.
In the LVAD space, we have completed the integration of Thoratec and are pleased with the results and strong adoption of HeartMate 3 by the clinical community. Since the launch of HeartMate 3 last October, feedback from customers continues to reflect the positive clinical outcomes experienced in the CE Mark trial. We continue to capture share in international markets and are pleased with the approximately 50% comparable constant currency growth of our international LVAD business.
In addition to our strong results, the clinical evidence surrounding HeartMate 3 continues to grow. The international society for heart and lung transplant [International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation] held its annual meeting in April, featuring very positive data on both HeartMate 2 and 3, including the HeartMate 3 CE Mark 12-month data and real world experience in the Kazakhstan study. The road map study also showed that 48% of patients at two years improved at least one New York Heart Association class compared to only 13% in the optimal medical management group. Additionally, 30-day mortality within the LVAD group was only 1%, which is equivalent to optimal medical management. Looking ahead, we expect to present the HeartMate 3 U.S. IDE short-term data before the end of this year.
Moving to our global AF business, it grew by 13%, driven by continued success of our ablation catheter business and a limited European launch of our new EnSite Precision cardiac mapping system. Our comprehensive AF product portfolio is a key differentiator for St. Jude Medical. It demonstrates our core strength in surrounding a disease state with the most innovative and complete solution across multiple product segments, such as access, guidance, diagnostics, visualization, recording, mapping, navigation, and advanced ablation.
AF remains one of the most attractive med tech markets, and we believe we are well positioned for future growth with EnSite Precision. We are encouraged by the results to-date of our launch in Europe, with over 3,000 cases already performed and continued positive feedback. Our advanced mapping portfolio grew approximately 20% constant currency in Europe with EnSite Precision, as compared to essentially flat growth in the U.S., where we await approval. We continue to expect U.S. approval and launch of EnSite Precision in the second half of 2016.

I will now turn to our neuromodulation business. We continue to capture share in our neuromodulation business and grow at above market rates, as illustrated by second quarter global constant currency growth of 20%. This is the seventh consecutive quarter in which we have taken share. Since the U.S. launch of our DRG system, we have received positive feedback from our customers, with the field experiencing exceptional outcomes and trialing success during our targeted rollout phase.
DRG is designed for focal pain conditions often characterized by nerve injury, and it can be debilitating to patients. Our early, real world experience confirm our findings in the ACCURATE IDE study, which demonstrated sustained and superior pain relief over tonic stimulation. We view DRG as a market expansion story and part of our larger strategy to surround chronic pain.
Another bright spot in our neuromodulation portfolio is Burst technology. We continue to see strong enthusiasm in international markets and still expect the FDA approval in the second half of 2016. We are also encouraged by the broader adoption of our advanced SCS therapies, and have seen a shift to our non-rechargeable Prodigy platform, which now makes up approximately 50% of our U.S. mix.
Although still early, we are hearing very positive feedback on the launch of our new Infinity Deep Brain Stimulation or DBS System and directional lead in Europe. This system is available in maintenance-free and long-lasting, recharge-free systems. Similar to our SCS systems, the Infinity platform is upgradeable, which provides patients the potential to access new therapy advances as they are approved. The U.S. market makes up more than half of the $500 million global DBS market with only one competitor. We are very excited about our innovation here and remain on track for U.S. approval in the second half of 2016. With the most comprehensive neuromodulation technology, we expect to remain share takers for the foreseeable future.
In our cardiovascular portfolio, we had several important regulatory and sales milestones that support our ability to execute on our innovation strategy, bringing to market new technologies to take share while supporting market growth in our more traditional business segments. We were pleased by the positive outcome of the FDA PFO panel in May. The advisory panel responded favorably to the technology and clinical results, voting that the safety, effectiveness, and benefits of the AMPLATZER PFO Occluder outweigh potential risk.
This device presents an important treatment option for patients with a PFO who have suffered a stroke of unknown cause and live at risk and in fear of suffering additional strokes. The discussion during the meeting and resulting vote is an important step toward approval of the technology in the U.S. We look forward to additional discussions with the FDA in the coming months and expect approval in the second half of this year.
Our Portico sales during the quarter were strong, which supports our belief that we can take share in the TAVR market in Europe. In the U.S., we continue to accelerate enrollment in our IDE study and recently received approval to add global sites. Implanting physicians tell us that our TAVR device is the easiest to use and they are impressed with our device retrievability and low pacemaker rate. Our success during the quarter gives us confidence that our TAVR program will drive growth in the future.
Building on our foundation of leadership in heart valve technology, we launched our next-generation Trifecta with Glide Technology in Europe and the U.S. during the quarter and are executing on our launch plan. We are in the middle of a successful product launch in Europe and expect to see similar results in the U.S. as we expand the rollout. While surgical valves as a segment is declining, we view it as an important part of our comprehensive strategy of surrounding disease states in general and valvular heart disease more specifically.

Our game-changing OCT technology was a bright spot in the quarter, growing nearly 20% on a constant currency basis. These results were driven by our new OPTIS Mobile System with angiographic co-registration and enhanced stent optimization software. OPTIS Mobile offers physicians an efficient way to optimize catheter-based procedures for the treatment of vascular disease by combining diagnostic tools designed to improve patient outcomes into one portable device. The imaging advancements offered with the OPTIS Mobile System allow physicians to clearly visualize complex cardiac anatomy and evaluate how to best proceed during percutaneous coronary interventions, or PCI.
In addition, we have received positive physician feedback on our OPTIS Metallic Stent Optimization Software, which is available in some international markets and delivers tools to further improve stent sizing and placement while providing deployment and placement assessment for drug-eluting and bare-metal stents. Our PCI Optimization business grew approximately 9% constant currency during the quarter, which gives us confidence that we are focused on the right markets with the right technology to generate strong growth for the foreseeable future.
While we continue to see pressure in our more mature cardiovascular businesses, we remain confident that we are focused on outcomes-based technologies in the appropriate growth areas, such as PCI Optimization, TAVR, and percutaneous heart pumps, to help drive growth back to the mid-single digits on an annual basis.
Moving to our traditional CRM business, similar to the past several quarters, our U.S. CRM business was challenged, primarily due to the MRI-safe product gap in both low- and high-voltage devices. We remain confident that this issue is transient and will resolve itself once we receive FDA approval of our MRI-safe pacemakers and ICDs, which we continue to expect in the second half of 2016 and the first half of 2017, respectively.
As we have said in the past, our experience in international markets shows that once we receive approval for these devices, our share returns in short order. The most recent example of this was in Japan, where we received approval early this year for our MRI-safe ICD, which led to Japan ICD growth revenue of over 30% constant currency in the second quarter. It is this experience and our continued ability to gain share in Europe that give us confidence our share will return once we receive approval of MRI-safe devices in the U.S.
In the evolving healthcare landscape, it is more important than ever to be able to work with our customers to contract along the cardiovascular service line. We believe we are unrivalled in the depth and breadth of our AF, heart failure, and CRM portfolio, particularly once we receive MRI-safe labeling. We are already able to offer contracting solutions to our customers with important innovation in markets where we are improved, including MPP, SyncAV, EnSite Precision, LAA closure, Nanostim, ablation catheters, and, once approved, we look forward to including the next-generation, disruptive Confirm, an insertable cardiac monitor technology.
In fact, I think we are better positioned now than ever before to work with the electrophysiologist in every case. We look forward to bringing this technology to the U.S. in the near future to drive growth similar to what we have seen in our international markets.
Before we conclude, I would like to give a brief update on our pending transaction with Abbott. It has been about 80 days since we announced the transaction, and I've spent a lot of time with Miles White, Abbott's Chairman and CEO. I am confident that we will bring together two industry leaders with a shared passion for patients, innovation, and a strong team culture. We have established an integration team with functional area leaders from our respective organizations, working to prepare for a seamless integration after the deal closes, which we currently expect to occur by the end of 2016.

While we are still early in the process, I can share that employees are extremely excited about the opportunity for our combined organization to be even more competitive in the market. Together, we will hold number 1 or number 2 market positions across a broad range of cardiovascular diseases, as well as in diabetes, chronic pain, movement disorders, and vision care.
I thought it would be worth mentioning that since the announcement, I've had many opportunities to hear from our customers, patients, investors, and other external stakeholders that I've been extremely encouraged that the vast majority of people I've spoken with share our enthusiasm for this transaction. The strategic rationale is clear, as is our shared vision to create the world's premier medical device company. I am confident in the power of our combined organization and the significant impact we can have on helping physicians and patients around the world.
Thank you for joining us today. And with that, we will conclude the call and turn it back over to the moderator for replay information.
