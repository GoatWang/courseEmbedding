Modine Promotes Margaret C. Kelsey to Combined Role as Vice President - Corporate Development, General Counsel & Secretary | Business Wire
























































Modine Promotes Margaret C. Kelsey to Combined Role as Vice 
      President - Corporate Development, General Counsel & Secretary






October 08, 2008 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



RACINE, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Modine Manufacturing Company (NYSE: MOD), a diversified global leader in 
      thermal management technology and solutions, today announced the 
      promotion of Margaret C. Kelsey to the newly created position of Vice 
      President - Corporate Development, General Counsel and Secretary , 
      effective November 1, 2008. In this new role, Kelsey retains her 
      leadership of Modine’s corporate strategy and 
      business development activities, while adding the responsibilities of 
      General Counsel and Secretary.
    


      Kelsey succeeds Dean R. Zakos, who announced his retirement in September 
      after 26 years with Modine. Her additional responsibilities include 
      overseeing a wide variety of legal and regulatory matters and serving as 
      liaison to Modine’s Board of Directors and 
      executive management on a range of corporate governance matters.
    

“We are delighted to have someone of Peggy 
      Kelsey’s broad experience and strategic skills 
      in charge of our legal function,” said Thomas 
      A. Burke, Modine President and Chief Executive Officer. “Peggy 
      brings to her new position deep knowledge of corporate law and the legal 
      and financial issues affecting Modine, as well as a thorough grasp of 
      how those issues impact our strategy and business development 
      activities. These qualities are essential to our ability to execute our 
      restructuring program and continue to grow in this challenging 
      environment.”


      In June, Kelsey was named Vice President, Corporate Strategy and 
      Business Development, responsible for analyzing and consolidating global 
      product, brand, market, geographic and customer strategies to ensure 
      that Modine’s financial and human resources 
      are deployed in a manner that best supports the company’s 
      overall strategy and vision. In addition, she is responsible for Modine’s 
      annual and five-year planning processes, as well as business development 
      initiatives such as acquisitions, divestitures and related activities. 
      She will be retaining those responsibilities in her new role.
    

      Kelsey joined Modine in 2001 as Senior Counsel. She was promoted to 
      Senior Counsel and Assistant Secretary in 2002 and to Vice President, 
      Finance, Corporate Treasury and Business Development in 2006. Before 
      joining Modine, she was a partner in the law firm of Quarles & Brady, 
      LLP. She received her bachelor’s degree in 
      history from Mount Mary College, a law degree from Georgetown University 
      and an MBA from the University of Wisconsin – 
      Milwaukee. Kelsey received a “Women of 
      Influence” Award from The Milwaukee 
      Business Journal in 2005. She and her husband have three children 
      and live in Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin.

October 8, 2008

Modine Promotes Margaret C. Kelsey to Combined Role as Vice President - Corporate Development, General Counsel & Secretary
RACINE, Wis., Oct 08, 2008 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Modine Manufacturing Company (NYSE: MOD), a diversified global leader in 
      thermal management technology and solutions, today announced the 
      promotion of Margaret C. Kelsey to the newly created position of Vice 
      President - Corporate Development, General Counsel and Secretary , 
      effective November 1, 2008. In this new role, Kelsey retains her 
      leadership of Modine's corporate strategy and 
      business development activities, while adding the responsibilities of 
      General Counsel and Secretary.
Kelsey succeeds Dean R. Zakos, who announced his retirement in September 
      after 26 years with Modine. Her additional responsibilities include 
      overseeing a wide variety of legal and regulatory matters and serving as 
      liaison to Modine's Board of Directors and 
      executive management on a range of corporate governance matters.

"We are delighted to have someone of Peggy 
      Kelsey's broad experience and strategic skills 
      in charge of our legal function," said Thomas 
      A. Burke, Modine President and Chief Executive Officer. "Peggy 
      brings to her new position deep knowledge of corporate law and the legal 
      and financial issues affecting Modine, as well as a thorough grasp of 
      how those issues impact our strategy and business development 
      activities. These qualities are essential to our ability to execute our 
      restructuring program and continue to grow in this challenging 
      environment."

In June, Kelsey was named Vice President, Corporate Strategy and 
      Business Development, responsible for analyzing and consolidating global 
      product, brand, market, geographic and customer strategies to ensure 
      that Modine's financial and human resources 
      are deployed in a manner that best supports the company's 
      overall strategy and vision. In addition, she is responsible for Modine's 
      annual and five-year planning processes, as well as business development 
      initiatives such as acquisitions, divestitures and related activities. 
      She will be retaining those responsibilities in her new role.

Kelsey joined Modine in 2001 as Senior Counsel. She was promoted to 
      Senior Counsel and Assistant Secretary in 2002 and to Vice President, 
      Finance, Corporate Treasury and Business Development in 2006. Before 
      joining Modine, she was a partner in the law firm of Quarles & Brady, 
      LLP. She received her bachelor's degree in 
      history from Mount Mary College, a law degree from Georgetown University 
      and an MBA from the University of Wisconsin -- 
      Milwaukee. Kelsey received a "Women of 
      Influence" Award from The Milwaukee 
      Business Journal in 2005. She and her husband have three children 
      and live in Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin.

About Modine --

      in thermal management systems and components, bringing highly engineered
