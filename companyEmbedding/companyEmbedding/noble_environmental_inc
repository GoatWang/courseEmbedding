What is ECOR?
 





ECOR FACTORIES PROVIDE
A Turn-Key to Engage in the Circular Economy For Global, SME, Government & Waste Management OrganizationsThe circular economy is disrupting the way we produce and consume products, yet major brands are still losing out on $11.4B/year in recycling revenues. ECOR provides the only enterprise-grade solution to immediately access substantial recycling revenues from fiber waste and engage in all phases of this new economy.
Global brands have begun integrating ECOR into their supply chain as an advanced alternative to wood, particleboard, foam and cardboard for many applications including: green building materials, interior design, cabinetry, furniture, fixtures, home goods, packaging, printed graphics and signs. We look forward to working with these partners to convert their own waste into the ECOR they use.
 


The current ECOR manufacturing facility converts 1,250 tons/year and there are 3 large facilities planned for the BeNeLux region, which will collectively convert a total of 37,500 tons/year. The environmental impact of these 4 facilities will save ~629,000 trees and ~112,500 cubic yards of landfill space per year.

FIBER WASTE

THE VISION FOR ECOR 
ECOR exist to EMPOWER PEOPLE and HEAL THE PLANET, by changing the way products are PRODUCED, CONSUMED, and DISCARDED.
The vision is simply to enable mores types of waste to be recycled; offer advanced conversion solutions that increase the value of recycled materials; provide material solutions for products to be designed from 100% recycled waste that are also 100% recyclable; and to unlock new opportunities for cost savings and revenue generation through all stages of the supply chain and product life cycle.
Imagine if major coffee chains could recycle coffee grounds and commercial waste and convert it into materials used to build out new stores, furniture and packaging.
Or if big box retailers could recycle all of their retail store paper and cardboard waste and convert it into home décor, furniture products, retail shelving and displays.
Or if apparel companies could recycle old clothing and/or lint from manufacturing and convert into material used for retail furniture, product displays and even hangers.
ECOR makes these "great ideas" not only possible - but economical and profitable.

 Noble Environmental Unveils its New ECOR® ThinkTable™ Product Line 
         










    










 






 











 









Noble Environmental Unveils its New ECOR® ThinkTable™ Product Line

		  Sustainable Innovative Product to Foster Creativity in Workspace Environments
		

Jun 21, 2012, 13:00 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Noble Environmental Technologies Corporation 











 
















































 

 




















 


SAN DIEGO, June 21, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Noble Environmental Technologies Corporation (NET), a leading sustainable materials inventor, developer and manufacturer, will be unveiling a new product line called the ThinkTable™ Series at Dwell On Design in Los Angeles, CA. The exhibition will be held at the Los Angeles Convention Center from June 22-24th and will showcase new top interior and architectural designers, new advanced building industry products, and the most innovative ideas in design from around the world. 
The ECOR® ThinkTable™ was designed with the innovator in mind. It works as a horizontal meeting table that can easily flip vertically into a whiteboard. The larger ThinkTables can easily be adjusted from normal table height up to comfortable standing height for "stand up" working as a table and dry-erase board. ThinkTable™ sizes vary from 3' X 3' to 4' X 8'.
The table incorporates the company's patent-pending technology, ECOR® as a revolutionary, sustainable alternative to traditional wood and other composites. ECOR® works as the strong, extremely lightweight core of the ThinkTable™ which is laminated with a white dry-erase surface. The tabletop is secured to telescoping and flip base supports with casters so that moving and storing ThinkTables™ is easy and space efficient. It's a conventional table, it's a dry marker table and then it's a versatile and ergonomic dry marker board all in one.
