The Rapid Rise of Global Quest Ltd (OTCMKTS:GLBB)

By Gene Daniel -  April 24, 2017

Global Quest Ltd (OTCMKTS:GLBB) has been around for a short time, but in this short period has generated investor interest, volume and price appreciation. A look at the recent chart shows GLBB stock moving from .90 cents last week to $2.23 today on big volume, we looked into what they did and found they are a simple company with genuine ideas, and they revolve around sleep disorders and how to treat them naturally.
The company announced the launch of Carepoint Nutrients, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary with the corporate mission of distributing multiple proprietary lines of nutrient supplements. Carepoint Nutrients is set up to serve medical practices, dispensaries and consumers directly.
Global Quest Ltd’s (OTCMKTS:GLBB) unique product lines include several formulas designed to provide effective relief for patients who suffer from inflammation and sleep disorders. These nutrient supplement products are distributed under the Carepoint brand name and patients may purchase them directly from doctors, dispensaries or via the company website. Patients can also choose to sign a subscription agreement for convenient monthly deliveries direct to their homes.

All Carepoint Nutrients products such as the popular Amino-D include proprietary patent pending formulas that utilize amino acids and polyphenols along with cannabinoids from flax seed oil to provide relief from inflammation as well as sleep disorders. No drugs are used in these natural-based formulas. Carepoint Nutrients is currently expanding its product line offerings and additional formulas will be available in the near future.
Board of Directors has recently appointed Larry J. Sherman as the new sole member of the Board of Directors and as Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary and Treasurer of the company. In the last five years, Mr. Sherman has been serving as CEO of Creditpoint Financial, Budteller and CarePoint Financial. Creditpoint Financial, which Mr. Sherman founded in 2017, provides loans to patients and legal clients. In 2016, Mr. Sherman founded Budteller, a company that provides financial solutions and compliance services to the MMJ industry.
In 2006, Mr. Sherman founded CarePoint Financial, which purchases personal injury and worker’s compensation receivables from healthcare providers at a discounted rate. Carepoint Financial has purchased or facilitated the purchase of over $2 billion dollars in face value assets and has deployed almost $300 million with a current line of credit over $250 million.
Global Quest, Ltd. through its wholly owned subsidiary, Carepoint Nutrients, LLC, supplies proprietary patent pending formulas that utilize amino acids and polyphenols along with cannabinoids for relief from pain and inflammation as well as sleep disorders. But the stock moved because they are in the cannabis sector and they treat sleep disorders with a hot sector product, which is why you have the rapid volume and price appreciation in the shares.  This is one to watch for us as the company offers a natural solution to a common disorder that was treated with alcohol and synthetic drugs – which is the vaulting platform for many hot cannabis sectors. Shares are new to traders and portfolio managers and arrived on scene last week.
Not much information is available which is why it is important to do your due diligence on movers like Global Quest, Ltd. (OTCMKTS:GLBB) who have made the initial 100% move higher for 2017, and today alone they are 45% higher on 3x volume. Based on other trades we see in cannabis this may be an early move as many of the stocks in the sector have moved tenfold.
We also find that real life remedies for normal disorders like sleep deprivation, glaucoma, inflammation and other problems translate to investors seeking lower priced stocks.
It seems the investment world is looking for pure plays in inexpensive stocks that are affordable to smaller investors. There is a movement into stocks that solve problems that use artificial drugs from fat pharmaceutical companies, which can be solved by a cannabinoid solution. These stocks have been on the rise since October 2016 and when they show their heads by moving higher in large moves it is worth taking notice. For continuing coverage on shares of $GLBB stock, as well as our other hot stock picks, sign up for our free newsletter today and get our next hot stock pick!

The company will not receive any proceeds from this offering.


Regarding our competitive position in the industry, we are a new entry into this
marketplace and we are not well known. We will compete with numerous providers
of online or Internet accessible applications and services companies, many of
which have far greater financial and other resources than we do.

Many of these companies have established histories and relationships in
providing online applications or systems that enable them to attract talent,
marketing support, and financing.  Moreover, proven track records are of
paramount consideration in selecting vendors.  

While our directors and officers have significant business experience, we, as a
company, have no proven track record in the online services industry.  We can
provide no assurance that we will be able to successfully market our products or
compete within this industry.


Company Description
Global Quest Ltd. is a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Nevada
on January 16, 2015, whose principal executive offices are located in Seoul
