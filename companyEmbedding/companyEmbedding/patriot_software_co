Pros
Free live setup assistance. Excellent online guide to state employer setup. Good framework for records and tasks. Integrated basic accounting. Free email, phone, and chat support.


Cons
Lacks online setup wizard. Weak dashboard. Can't pay contractors (1099 software costs extra). No payroll total after processing. No mobile apps.


Bottom Line
Patriot Software Full Service Payroll does an exceptional job of supporting its customers, but it lacks some important features, and its interface lags behind those of the best services.







Small businesses that choose to manage their own payroll typically need a lot of support, especially during setup. Patriot Software Full Service Payroll challenges even such competitors such as Editors' Choice Gusto when it comes to providing help to its customers. And its no-frills user interface handles creating employee records, defining deductions and contributions, and processing a payroll run. At $25 per month for the first employee and $4 per month for additional employees, Full Service Payroll's cost can add up, however. This would be fine if it stood above its competition in ways other than support, but it doesn't.

Prep Work Patriot Software's exceptional customer service options, which include free chat, email, and phone support, are immediately apparent. Like some of its competitors, Patriot's payroll service makes its experts available to complete this onerous task for you if you prefer. It's possible to set up employees on your own, but I would recommend that you let the company help you if you've never done a payroll, for two reasons: First, the software doesn't include a setup wizard to walk you through doing it yourself; you'll have to figure out which navigation links to visit in order to complete the groundwork for your payroll runs.
Second, payroll is the most complex part of small business accounting, and it requires absolute precision and timeliness. You not only have to get employee compensation exactly right, but you'll also be making payments to benefits providers and other agencies. If your employees have multiple deductions, that's a lot of coordinating to do. I'd definitely recommend letting Patriot help you get it set up right.

Note that in addition to its Full Service Payroll service, Patriot also offers Basic Payroll for $10 for the first employee, with additional costs for more employees. If you opt to go this route, however, you'll need to file your own payroll taxes, which may be more work than the savings is worth. Note that even if you pay the higher fee, the "Full Service" in this service's name doesn't apply to paying contractors, as 1099 software costs extra. This is a significant omission. 
Navigation Tools The website for Full Service Payroll is laid out like those of many of its competitors. A vertical pane on the left contains your primary navigation links. When you've clicked on one, the center of the screen displays the tools needed to complete that task. Click on the Payroll bar at the top of the menu or the Dashboard link in the horizontal toolbar at the top, and your dashboard (home page) opens. This is divided into two vertical panes. One contains links to recent payroll runs, tax collections, and tax deposits. The other displays links to things you might want to do (finish a payroll, add an employee, and so on) as well as to popular help articles. SurePayroll and other competitiors populate their dashboards with more data and links, however. Because you'll spend so much time in the dashboard, this mediocre dashboard is a weakness of Patriot Software's payroll service.
The left navigation pane divides its task and data links into Employees, Payroll Tasks, Time & Attendance Tasks, Human Resource Tasks, Reports, Settings, and Training. You click on the plus or minus signs to the right of these labels to expand or collapse the sub-items.
Once you've clicked on a link, the working screens themselves are intuitive; they use standard online data-entry conventions. Basically, you fill in blanks or click links or select from drop-down lists. Sometimes there are directional arrows marked Next Step to guide you, as on the Pay Employees screen. Again, this is the way most online payroll sites work. But others, most notably Gusto, are more graphically interesting and aesthetically pleasing. Gusto has managed to tuck away much of the site's functionality so that the overall look is spare but comprehensive, which makes it easier to use.

Setting Up Settings When you're getting started, you mostly work with the Settings menu. The first sub-menu, Payroll Settings, contains links to the screens on which you build the framework for your payroll operations. Patriot Software is quite flexible when it comes to letting you create items for both the hours employees can work (holiday, regular, and double-time) and the types of pay they can receive (bonus, commission, and expense reimbursement). These will, of course, appear as options when you start processing paychecks.
If you offer your employees benefits like health insurance and retirement plans, you can set these up so that they can be assigned to employees when you create their records. Information about both company-level deductions and company-paid contributions is entered the same way, though their data fields are slightly different.
To create a deduction for your 401(k), for example, you select the type from a drop-down list, write a description to be displayed on reports and paychecks, and enter the default dollar amount to be subtracted from paychecks. This can either be a percentage or a flat dollar amount (if it's different for each employee, you leave it blank). You can also enter any limits required and specify the correct W-2 box (if needed) and the active/inactive status.
More Settings Next up are company tax settings and state unemployment rates. Patriot Software has assembled an excellent page with links to state-specific information that you can consult if you don't have those numbers. It also tells you how to apply for a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN) and meet any state registration requirements. And it provides links to forms that new employees must complete and that you must file. You also have to supply bank account information for payroll withdrawals, fill out an authorization form, and enter your paycheck printing or direct deposit settings.
You're not finished yet. If you want your employees to be able to log into password-protected portals on which they can view paystubs and other personal payroll information, you have to create user names and temporary passwords for each staff member and send invitations to the employees.
This is why Patriot Software and competitors like SurePayroll offer to help new users through the setup process. It's complicated, and it all has to be completed before you can run your first payroll (though I was allowed to complete a payroll without adding tax or bank account information). The site warns you if you try to start processing a payroll without completing all of the steps, but it would be really helpful if there were some kind of wizard or checklist that laid out all of the steps required, such as the excellent one that Intuit Enhanced Payroll offers.

Personal Information Once your company payroll settings are completed, you can create a record for each employee. This is a simple process but a time-intensive one. You fill in blank fields for information that hasn't been introduced yet (name, address, SSN, hire date, and so on) and select from lists of the options you just created (such as pay type and frequency). When you've supplied all of the data requested, you can access individual records from one screen by clicking on tabs that open different sections of the record (pay information, paycheck history, deductions, and contributions).
This is an effective way to make all of these details available. No one does it much better, really, though some of the sites make more economical use of screen space and emphasize the screens' looks as well as their content. Gusto manages to display employee records on one page with a lot of links. So either you scroll a lot or you click a lot.
Time for Payday Setup is by far the most challenging element of processing payroll. You'll probably need to go back into these screens occasionally to make changes, but Patriot Software makes that process simple with its Add and Edit and Delete buttons.
You click on the Run a New Payroll entry in the left navigation pane to get ready for payday. To define your pay-period start and end dates and your pay date, you click on the calendars next to the blank data fields at the top of the screen that appears. A list of your hourly employees is displayed below those boxes. Each line contains boxes for standard pay types (regular, overtime), as well as the individual's hourly rate. You just enter the number of hours in the correct boxes and click on the drop-down arrow in the box under Additional Hours and Money, if you need to enter hours for things such as vacation time and bonuses. The same goes for your salaried staff, except you don't enter hours, of course.
When you click on the Next Step arrow, you'll see a list of employees with their gross pay and net pay in summary. View Details takes you to each employee's paystub, which is easy to understand. The middle section of the screen, showing totals for deductions, contributions, and taxes, is not as clear.
Your total tax debit appears clearly at both the top and bottom of the page, but you have to hunt for the net pay number on both the summary and detail view. What payroll managers want—and what other sites like Gusto provide—is one clearly visible total, the amount that will come out of the bank account on the specified date, before you approve payroll. Your only options here are to approve or cancel the payroll or return to the first step.
After you've approved a payroll, the screen that appears has no numbers on it, just links to new screens that contain basically the same data you've already seen. At the bottom of the final linked page, you see totals for payroll taxes and for compensation, but, again, no total. That's a problem.
The Sum Total Patriot Software Full Service Payroll includes many preformatted reports—more than Gusto, in fact—but I wish some were consolidated and others were formatted in a more standard fashion. Still, the compiled information is there. As for mobile access, there are no dedicated apps, though the company says it is working on optimizing the site for eventual remote access.
The site does have one attribute that's unique in this group: It can be integrated with Patriot Software's basic, cash-basis accounting application (for $12.50 per month), which includes bill paying, invoicing, and contractor payments. If you have a very simple business, I'd recommend taking advantage of the free trials available. But if you want the best user experience combined with the overall best set of commonly used payroll features, Gusto is the smart choice today.

Liquid Web Hosting

07.24.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent

Amazon S3
07.24.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: Amazon S3 is the industry-standard answer for storing business data, especially for enterprise operations. But because Amazon designed S3 as an IT-oriented "bucket," it doesn't come with a user-friendly storage sync and backup application, instead providing only IT-centric tools and APIs. It's cost-effective, efficient, and secure, but plan to bring your own desktop software. 






InMotion Web Hosting
07.24.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent

Microsoft Azure
07.21.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent

Bottom Line: Organizations standardized on Windows Server are no-brainer candidates for Microsoft Azure once they begin moving infrastructure to the cloud. However, Azure is also friendly to other operating platforms, especially Linux, and has a growing arsenal of ancillary services, too. 






Campaign Monitor
07.21.2017


Editors' Rating: good

Bottom Line: Campaign Monitor may lack live support and third-party integrations, but it offers a simple way to connect with your audience through email marketing, including auto-responders and a new suite of analytics. 






Zenefits Z2

07.21.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: Zenefits Z2 is best suited for small to midsized businesses (SMBs) in need of solid human resources platform. By delivering the basic framework and regularly adding new integration partners, Zenefits Z2 can provide a fairly long lived solution even for fast-growing companies.

FreshBooks
05.17.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: The new version of FreshBooks is a polished, intuitive website that supports invoices and estimates, expenses, projects, and time-tracking. It lacks some important features from the previous edition, however. 






Wave

05.17.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: Free double-entry accounting service Wave keeps getting better. Its appealing design and powerful features make it our top bookkeeping choice for freelancers, sole proprietors, contractors, and very small businesses. 






GoDaddy Bookkeeping
05.17.2017


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: GoDaddy Bookkeeping's direct integration with Amazon, eBay, and Etsy make it a terrific tool for entrepreneurs who sell at those sites, but its overall bookkeeping depth and flexibility can't match Wave's or Kashoo's. 






Less Accounting
05.17.2017


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: Less Accounting gives small businesses basic double-entry bookkeeping tools, including those for income and expense management, invoicing, and reports. But it's expensive for what it offers. 






Intuit QuickBooks Self-Employed
05.17.2017


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: Accounting service QuickBooks Self-Employed helps users track income and expenses, and estimate quarterly taxes. Though it lacks some standard accounting tools, it might be all many freelancers need. 
















Gusto

Bottom Line: Gusto offers a solid set of payroll features, an unusually well-designed user interface, and impressive innovation and automation, all at a good price.

03.09.2017

Bottom Line: TurboTax's top-tier Self-Employed service is expensive, but it's the best. Plain-spoken help resources, thorough exploration of tax forms and schedules, and an unparalleled user experience make it our Editors' Choice for tax-prep software. 






H&R Block Premium 2017 (Tax Year 2016)
03.09.2017

TaxAct Express 2017 (Tax Year 2016)
03.07.2017


Editors' Rating: fair



 

at 




Bottom Line: Free mobile tax preparation TaxAct Express offers too little help, doesn't offer versions for every state, and was glitchy in testing; disappointing, given that TaxAct wins an Editors' Choice for premium tax services.

MSRP 
$25.00











Pros
Free live setup assistance. Excellent online guide to state employer setup. Good framework for records and tasks. Integrated basic accounting. Free email, phone, and chat support.


Cons
Lacks online setup wizard. Weak dashboard. Can't pay contractors (1099 software costs extra). No payroll total after processing. No mobile apps.


Bottom Line
Patriot Software Full Service Payroll does an exceptional job of supporting its customers, but it lacks some important features, and its interface lags behind those of the best services.







Small businesses that choose to manage their own payroll typically need a lot of support, especially during setup. Patriot Software Full Service Payroll challenges even such competitors such as Editors' Choice Gusto when it comes to providing help to its customers. And its no-frills user interface handles creating employee records, defining deductions and contributions, and processing a payroll run. At $25 per month for the first employee and $4 per month for additional employees, Full Service Payroll's cost can add up, however. This would be fine if it stood above its competition in ways other than support, but it doesn't.

Prep Work Patriot Software's exceptional customer service options, which include free chat, email, and phone support, are immediately apparent. Like some of its competitors, Patriot's payroll service makes its experts available to complete this onerous task for you if you prefer. It's possible to set up employees on your own, but I would recommend that you let the company help you if you've never done a payroll, for two reasons: First, the software doesn't include a setup wizard to walk you through doing it yourself; you'll have to figure out which navigation links to visit in order to complete the groundwork for your payroll runs.
Second, payroll is the most complex part of small business accounting, and it requires absolute precision and timeliness. You not only have to get employee compensation exactly right, but you'll also be making payments to benefits providers and other agencies. If your employees have multiple deductions, that's a lot of coordinating to do. I'd definitely recommend letting Patriot help you get it set up right.

Note that in addition to its Full Service Payroll service, Patriot also offers Basic Payroll for $10 for the first employee, with additional costs for more employees. If you opt to go this route, however, you'll need to file your own payroll taxes, which may be more work than the savings is worth. Note that even if you pay the higher fee, the "Full Service" in this service's name doesn't apply to paying contractors, as 1099 software costs extra. This is a significant omission. 
Navigation Tools The website for Full Service Payroll is laid out like those of many of its competitors. A vertical pane on the left contains your primary navigation links. When you've clicked on one, the center of the screen displays the tools needed to complete that task. Click on the Payroll bar at the top of the menu or the Dashboard link in the horizontal toolbar at the top, and your dashboard (home page) opens. This is divided into two vertical panes. One contains links to recent payroll runs, tax collections, and tax deposits. The other displays links to things you might want to do (finish a payroll, add an employee, and so on) as well as to popular help articles. SurePayroll and other competitiors populate their dashboards with more data and links, however. Because you'll spend so much time in the dashboard, this mediocre dashboard is a weakness of Patriot Software's payroll service.
The left navigation pane divides its task and data links into Employees, Payroll Tasks, Time & Attendance Tasks, Human Resource Tasks, Reports, Settings, and Training. You click on the plus or minus signs to the right of these labels to expand or collapse the sub-items.
Once you've clicked on a link, the working screens themselves are intuitive; they use standard online data-entry conventions. Basically, you fill in blanks or click links or select from drop-down lists. Sometimes there are directional arrows marked Next Step to guide you, as on the Pay Employees screen. Again, this is the way most online payroll sites work. But others, most notably Gusto, are more graphically interesting and aesthetically pleasing. Gusto has managed to tuck away much of the site's functionality so that the overall look is spare but comprehensive, which makes it easier to use.

Setting Up Settings When you're getting started, you mostly work with the Settings menu. The first sub-menu, Payroll Settings, contains links to the screens on which you build the framework for your payroll operations. Patriot Software is quite flexible when it comes to letting you create items for both the hours employees can work (holiday, regular, and double-time) and the types of pay they can receive (bonus, commission, and expense reimbursement). These will, of course, appear as options when you start processing paychecks.
If you offer your employees benefits like health insurance and retirement plans, you can set these up so that they can be assigned to employees when you create their records. Information about both company-level deductions and company-paid contributions is entered the same way, though their data fields are slightly different.
To create a deduction for your 401(k), for example, you select the type from a drop-down list, write a description to be displayed on reports and paychecks, and enter the default dollar amount to be subtracted from paychecks. This can either be a percentage or a flat dollar amount (if it's different for each employee, you leave it blank). You can also enter any limits required and specify the correct W-2 box (if needed) and the active/inactive status.
More Settings Next up are company tax settings and state unemployment rates. Patriot Software has assembled an excellent page with links to state-specific information that you can consult if you don't have those numbers. It also tells you how to apply for a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN) and meet any state registration requirements. And it provides links to forms that new employees must complete and that you must file. You also have to supply bank account information for payroll withdrawals, fill out an authorization form, and enter your paycheck printing or direct deposit settings.
You're not finished yet. If you want your employees to be able to log into password-protected portals on which they can view paystubs and other personal payroll information, you have to create user names and temporary passwords for each staff member and send invitations to the employees.
This is why Patriot Software and competitors like SurePayroll offer to help new users through the setup process. It's complicated, and it all has to be completed before you can run your first payroll (though I was allowed to complete a payroll without adding tax or bank account information). The site warns you if you try to start processing a payroll without completing all of the steps, but it would be really helpful if there were some kind of wizard or checklist that laid out all of the steps required, such as the excellent one that Intuit Enhanced Payroll offers.

Personal Information Once your company payroll settings are completed, you can create a record for each employee. This is a simple process but a time-intensive one. You fill in blank fields for information that hasn't been introduced yet (name, address, SSN, hire date, and so on) and select from lists of the options you just created (such as pay type and frequency). When you've supplied all of the data requested, you can access individual records from one screen by clicking on tabs that open different sections of the record (pay information, paycheck history, deductions, and contributions).
This is an effective way to make all of these details available. No one does it much better, really, though some of the sites make more economical use of screen space and emphasize the screens' looks as well as their content. Gusto manages to display employee records on one page with a lot of links. So either you scroll a lot or you click a lot.
Time for Payday Setup is by far the most challenging element of processing payroll. You'll probably need to go back into these screens occasionally to make changes, but Patriot Software makes that process simple with its Add and Edit and Delete buttons.
You click on the Run a New Payroll entry in the left navigation pane to get ready for payday. To define your pay-period start and end dates and your pay date, you click on the calendars next to the blank data fields at the top of the screen that appears. A list of your hourly employees is displayed below those boxes. Each line contains boxes for standard pay types (regular, overtime), as well as the individual's hourly rate. You just enter the number of hours in the correct boxes and click on the drop-down arrow in the box under Additional Hours and Money, if you need to enter hours for things such as vacation time and bonuses. The same goes for your salaried staff, except you don't enter hours, of course.
When you click on the Next Step arrow, you'll see a list of employees with their gross pay and net pay in summary. View Details takes you to each employee's paystub, which is easy to understand. The middle section of the screen, showing totals for deductions, contributions, and taxes, is not as clear.
Your total tax debit appears clearly at both the top and bottom of the page, but you have to hunt for the net pay number on both the summary and detail view. What payroll managers want—and what other sites like Gusto provide—is one clearly visible total, the amount that will come out of the bank account on the specified date, before you approve payroll. Your only options here are to approve or cancel the payroll or return to the first step.
After you've approved a payroll, the screen that appears has no numbers on it, just links to new screens that contain basically the same data you've already seen. At the bottom of the final linked page, you see totals for payroll taxes and for compensation, but, again, no total. That's a problem.
The Sum Total Patriot Software Full Service Payroll includes many preformatted reports—more than Gusto, in fact—but I wish some were consolidated and others were formatted in a more standard fashion. Still, the compiled information is there. As for mobile access, there are no dedicated apps, though the company says it is working on optimizing the site for eventual remote access.
The site does have one attribute that's unique in this group: It can be integrated with Patriot Software's basic, cash-basis accounting application (for $12.50 per month), which includes bill paying, invoicing, and contractor payments. If you have a very simple business, I'd recommend taking advantage of the free trials available. But if you want the best user experience combined with the overall best set of commonly used payroll features, Gusto is the smart choice today.

By Kathy Yakal



Kathy Yakal has been annoying computer magazine editors since 1983, when she got her first technology writing job because she tagged along with her ex-husband on a job interview. She started freelancing and specializing in financial applications when PCs became financial tools for consumers and small businesses (after a stint at a high-end accounting software company). She’s written for numerous publications over the years, and about the only one that’s survived her besides PC Magazine (where she started writing in 1993) is Barron’s. When she...

About Patriot Software

January 13, 2017

treehouseadmin

We provide fast, simple, and affordable accounting and payroll software. After a rough start-up experience, we know first hand what small businesses need in order to breakthrough and achieve success. So we created a software service to help you keep the two things you don’t have enough of… time and money.
Our Story
We started in the basement of a factory with no heat, no air-conditioning, and floors that would flood. Instead of customers, we had rats, birds, snakes, and flies. Blankets became our office walls. We ran out of money, maxed out our credit cards, and borrowed from relatives.
(the original, 7-minute, unedited, 1988 video)
Everything and everybody fought us at every turn. But failure and bankruptcy were not an option. It was 4 years before we saw anything that resembled a real paycheck.
Why did we do it? Because we were crazy entrepreneurs chasing our dream. That’s why.
But, it’s not about us. It’s about you. You’re running your business because you’re half crazy too, and you have goals to succeed. With enough time and money, your success will become reality. But that’s the problem, there’s never enough of either. This is why we created Patriot Software… to help you keep your time and money.
Our Mission
Our mission is to make accounting and payroll fast, simple, and affordable for American small businesses.
Our Promise
We promise to give you exceptional value.
Our Products
We offer online accounting and payroll services that offer your small business a no-nonsense approach for:

Payroll Software Reviews From Real Users
Average User Rating:  (4.9 / 5)
 
Message from our President/Founder
I’m Mike Kappel, the guy in the videos. As was mentioned, I’m a serial entrepreneur, and I started all of the Patriot companies. Each of my companies are near-and-dear to my heart, but Patriot Software is my one company that I feel will have the greatest positive impact on the smallest of small businesses across the USA.
I’ve been in the small business owner’s shoes. It’s rough. There isn’t time to do anything extra, especially handling non-income producing tasks like accounting and payroll. I can do accounting, but it’s not a personal strength or passion of mine. As for doing payroll? Well, let’s just say that I’d rather spend my time building my business.
But both accounting and payroll must be done correctly, and most business owners don’t have anyone they can pass these tasks off to. This is why I assembled a team of experts and software developers to build the best accounting software and best payroll software in the USA. My team knows that they need to make our software so easy that even I can use it. They know that I’m not an accounting or payroll geek. They know I’m a small business owner who wants to spend as little time as possible on anything accounting or payroll related.
So that’s the short story. I hope you like our software and our team. I think you will, and I think you’ll get a lot of value for your buck. And, isn’t that how it should be?
Mike Kappel

Patriot Software's Story
We got our start in the basement of a of a cold, wet factory. Our first customers were rats, spiders, and snakes! We used blankets for office walls, took phone calls under desks when the factory was noisy, and on top of desks when the floors flooded. We were almost always broke, and to keep our dream alive, we maxed out our credit cards and borrowed from relatives. Needless to say, It was a rough start!
Why did we do it? Because we were crazy entrepreneurs chasing our dream, that’s why!
We know what entrepreneurs are up against. That’s why we created Patriot Software: to help today’s entrepreneurs keep more of their time and money so they can realize their own small business dreams.

Patriot Payroll and Accounting Reviews


"I don't know who is running this Patriot Software ship but I sure would like to shake hands with the captain! Quick and accurate customer service that walks the mile to help you get your payroll rolling. Their guidance has never let me down and it was so easy to set up employees for payroll and taxes. I tried 2 other online payrolls and found this one by far the most affordable and user friendly. This is one fine ship you can sail easy into the sunset with."

Brigget LeClair, BBC Broadcasting Inc.




"I love you guys. I’ve used the ‘Big Guys’ and I really do prefer your software."

Anecia Sewer, Love City Car Ferries, Inc.




"In small business, we are told you get what you pay for. That is a lie. I am getting way more than I could have dreamed. I am absolutely amazed. The software is easily half the cost of any other option out there. It is absolutely unreal. Your service has continually blown me away. I wish everything in life was as easy to get started and get help with."

Antonio Gonclaves, On Point Reps




"I highly recommend Patriot Software to any business! Starting up was very easy with knowledgeable people at Patriot. Anytime I ever called in with questions, support was so helpful and very friendly. Definitely a 5-star plus!"

Jennifer Miller, Dave Miller Trucking




"Patriot Software was a godsend. The software price point is right where we need it. The software has all the tools we need for a small business instead of hiring an outside company to take care of our administrative purposes. The software package was easy to learn and teach to our new employees. Our employees can login and access their own present/past paychecks. If needed, I have the option to override anything I see fit. I have already recommended Patriot Software. I cannot say enough good things about it!"

Lyman Schimming, L & B Embroidery, Inc.

It’s easy to just say “trust us.” But we’re serious about earning your confidence. Here are some of the measures we have taken to secure your small business accounting and payroll data.
We Are Tested
The remittance of payroll tax deposits on behalf of our Full-Service Payroll clients is tested and verified annually by an independent certified public accounting firm. In addition to the annual testing, this firm visits our company unannounced twice per calendar year to randomly test our payroll tax deposit procedures.
We Are Audited Annually
Our financial statements are audited annually by an independent certified public accounting firm, in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS). The firm tests our internal accounting records and performs other procedures in order to express an opinion about whether our financial statements are fairly presented.
We Hire the Right People for the Job
We make every effort to assure that we hire employees of high integrity and good moral character. As part of our hiring process, we conduct reference checks, background checks, drug screenings, and skill/aptitude testing. Our vigilance pays off with a staff of good, dependable people you can trust with your business data.
We Protect You by Bonding Our Employees
We bond our employees covering claims up to $100,000 for any fraudulent or negligent acts (i.e., protection for the unlikely event that one of our employees commits such an act).
We Make Sure Your Data is Secure
At Patriot Software, we take the physical and electronic security of your data very seriously. Here’s how, technically speaking:

Our servers are housed in a fully secure SAS 70 Type II-compliant facility that is manned round-the-clock, 365 days a year.
Connection to your data comes via multiple lines to the Internet. A constant power supply is guaranteed through the use of battery backups and a diesel generator system with thousands of gallons of diesel fuel.
Since heat’s a real killer for computer hardware, correct temperature is maintained by multiple-ton HVAC units.
Our web servers are protected by redundant firewalls using secure socket layer (SSL) encryption (just like banks and credit card company websites use). Any Patriot information you access is protected by triple-digit-bit encryption during transmission. Our data servers (where your info is saved) are a layer or two ‘off’ the Internet, so no one can directly access the data servers unless they’re physically standing in front of them.
When we say “fully secure” data center, we mean it. The entire data center is protected by video camera coverage. Server access is fully locked down, and only specified Patriot employees are permitted to work with the certified engineers on-site. If we do need to change our hardware, we’re escorted. No one enters (or leaves) the data center without being buzzed through security. Basically, no one gets in or out without encountering multiple levels of security, and when they’re on the premises, they’re monitored at all times.

How to Price a ProductBy Amanda Cameron on March 17, 2016 

Product pricing can make or break your small business. If you set prices higher than what customers will spend, you lose sales. But if you set prices too low, you don’t earn at your highest potential. Price points need to meet somewhere in the middle to generate the most revenue. Do you know how to price a product for your small business?
There is no simple formula for getting prices right. However, you can use different strategies to find prices that satisfy you and your customers’ needs.
Research your market
Conducting a market analysis on your customers and competition can help you find out what your customers are willing to pay.
Customers
Understanding your customers is essential to product pricing.   Conduct interviews, surveys, or focus groups to find out your target customers’ needs. You can also look at industry-specific statistics. Look for trends in the places that your target customers spend money and how much they spend.
Competition
Be aware of how other companies in your industry price products. You don’t need to set your prices lower than your competitors. Racing to set the cheapest prices could push your revenue below your bottom line. Instead, market your products as valuable and worth their costs.
How to price a product
Use your market analysis to decide what your customers are willing to pay. You will also want to consider the costs of running your business. Look at your gross margin to decide your bottom line for pricing. For how to price a product, try one or more of the following strategies.
Price segmentation
Price segmentation is not a one-size-fits-all product pricing method. Instead, you address the needs of smaller, more specific groups within your market. Separate the groups by the amount customers will pay for your products. Offer discounts to the groups that tend to pay less.
Offering different prices for the same product allows you to cover more ground in your market. You include low-spending customers without lowering all your prices.
For example, a coffee shop next to a college might have market groups that show the lower paying customers are students. The owner offers a student discount deal on coffee and bagels. The discount allows the coffee shop to serve students without lowering all the prices.
Tiered pricing
With tiered pricing, you give all customers different price options for the same product. Each option includes more features than the one beneath it. This method addresses customers with different levels of needs and budgets.
For an example of pricing your products at different levels, you might include: basic, upgraded, and superior. The majority of customers are in the middle spending range. But, the expensive option is available for those willing to spend more for extra features.
The expensive option is not just for reaching the occasional high spender. It also exists to motivate the majority mid-range spending customers. Average spenders are more willing to buy a mid-priced item when it is placed next to a more expensive option. The mid-priced item looks like a valuable product and a deal.
Bundle packages
When you bundle, you sell packages for less than the total of each individual product’s price. Bundling can get customers to buy more products than they initially intended.
For example, if you own a furniture store, you could bundle a couch and a chair. The package deal would be less expensive than if you charged the couch and chair separately. If a customer only wanted a couch, the bundled price might persuade them to buy more to take advantage of the deal.
This product pricing method helps you sell larger amounts of inventory while only incurring one-time marketing costs. If you need to get rid of old inventory quickly, you may want to create some bundle deals.
Most significant digit pricing
For this method of how to price a product, you lower prices slightly to make the most significant digit smaller. This works because many customers pay more attention to the most significant digit. This digit is the one furthest to the left on a price.
Think of selling an item for $19.95 instead of $20. Most people will focus on the furthest left digits, meaning the one and the two, respectively. One is smaller than two, so $19.95 seems cheaper. Though there’s only a five cent difference, $19.95 might seem less expensive to some customers.
Do you need a simple way to track your business’s transactions? Our easy-to-use, small business accounting software is made for small business owners like you. Try it for free today.

This is a low cost effective software product for small businesses, particularly a seasonal business who doesn't want to pay for an annual program.




Pros
Being a seasonal business, I like that I can inactive the software for the months with no payroll and reactivate it at year end for W-2s. We're only charged for the months that payroll is run.




Cons
The Workers Comp report doesn't include all the information required by our state so I have to use their form & fill in all the data when I should only have to print the report from the software.

Bottom line - this company is built for small businesses. I would recommend them to anyone - and I do !! 




Pros
Patriot Payroll is easy to use. I subscribe to the basic service. I love how they save me time by calculating my payroll checks and taxes. All I have to do is write the checks! Tax time is so easy - just run a tax report and the numbers are all there. As a small business, I appreciate how Patriot Payroll saves me money each month. Their fee is affordable and you get a lot for your money too. Customer service is friendly, helpful and quick to respond.

Pros
Easy, easy, easy. No bologna!  Switched from Paychex to Quick Books and finally to Patriot.  Switching is so complicated and Patriot was always there and made it all so very easy.  The price left me skeptical that it could be a decent product, but it was just what we were looking for.  I have total control of when and how I pay my employees, but without all the calculations and without having to do anything after like pay taxes etc, its all taken care of!




Cons
none, the most difficult thing was aligning the checks to print properly, but their support staff was awesome and it wasn't actually too bad.

I highly recommend this product. They are WAY cheaper than any other payroll company that I looked into, and the services Patriot Software offers versus other payroll companies was the exact same, if not better. 




Pros
I love that answering questions during the set up process was easy. I also loved that the first month was free so you could try out their software risk free. Every time I called them (and it was a lot because I had no idea what I was doing) they were very knowledgeable which made me feel like I could trust them. They never got impatient with me or made me feel bad because I had so many questions. Each representative patiently sat with me on the phone to walk me through anything I needed, for sometimes 20 to 30 minutes at a time. 




Cons
I wish they had a 24 customer service because I had more free time to set things up after everyone goes to bed at night. But that's such a slight thing, I wouldn't really count that as much of a con.

We made the switch from a very large payroll processor and couldn't be happier. Our previous vendor had obvious quotas for their sales people, and we were left half set up, floundering, and feeling used right off the bat. Once the sales rep had us hooked, we were left with a revolving door of account managers and regular re-negotiating of our pricing. We stayed for a couple of years because of all the time we put into trying to make it work, but in the end we just ended up fed up and resentful. Then we heard Patriot's ad on SiriusXM. We looked into them, studied their set up, then made the jump. And we haven't looked back since. From the very beginning, the difference in Patriot's customer service was amazing. No high-pressure tactics. No trying to sell us more than we needed/wanted. Just helpful and friendly. And that's just the icing on the cake. Their product is substantial; they offer features in their base package that our previous vendor wanted to charge extra for. I can't speak highly enough of the value of what Patriot is offering. Switching to them has saved us a significant amount on our payroll processing fees, not to mention our sanity. 




Pros
The interface is super simple -- payroll is done in just a few clicks. The value is amazing. And customer service goes above and beyond.




Cons
Reporting is a little simplistic. We haven't been through a full quarter yet though, so the reports may turn out to be more substantial with more data.

This is the right product for me - single-member LLC. 




Pros
Easy to use, and the customer service, via the phone, on-line chat, or email is superb (and proactive).  The price is also excellent.




Cons
Would have liked for it to integrate directly into Quickbooks - but I understand they have developed this feature.

Easily customizable to what we needed in our business.   I like the fact that we can add our own deduction categories.

I would really like to see their support available 24 hours a day but I understand we do not pay very much for this so it is still a great value.

The software is pretty easy to navigate especially for me being a first time user for a payroll software.  




Cons
Not being able to enter different pay rates for one employee - had to go in and create a different money type in order to get around this so I did not have to physically change the pay rate each time. We have employees who go to various facilities and get paid different amounts according to the facility.

Free direct deposit.   Auto generated payroll tax filings.   Overview of what is needed to maintain a payroll in my state.




Pros
I've been over the moon excited about the customer service.  I called them when I initially set up and they were very helpful. And I've called them twice regarding the direct deposit (which by the way is free!).  They have been, knowledgeable, patient and super accommodating.  I just got off the phone with them and the representative was so excellent that I just had to take a second to write a review.




Cons
It would be even nicer if the minimal fees would also allow employees to login and submit their time on their own via the employee portal.  But that is a tiny bit more money.

Good product and features for the price paid.




Pros
Good platform.  Easy to add companies and employees.  Running payrolls is pretty simple.  Check printing is easy to use.




Cons
Natpay and setting up Direct Deposit is a pain.  A lot of hoops to jump through and definitely not as user friendly and seamless as using intuit.  Also, if you are an accountant they do not have a branded platform so your client will know they are using Patriot so it doesn't work for contracted payroll.

Pros
We are a small company and just hired our first two employees. I did payroll the first week using the charts and figures from the State and IRS, and I spent three solid days working on only that! It is crazy how the government thinks a small business can afford to do their own payroll task and stay up to date on all changes, what a stressful time it was! 




Cons
The wait on the phone for customer service, I've hang up a couple of times from waiting to just have the phone call answered.

Accounting, ease of use, much cheaper than what we are paying now,  and no hidden fees.  The service is absolutely amazing.  




Pros
I loved that everything was so easy to set up and so easy to start using.  They asked me to send them reports of a few different things and got everything all set up for me.  It was so easy and they were so helpful!




Cons
That there is no gps on their time system .  We would utilize a gps with time clock in and out maybe on an app of some sort.  Also if I could give my sales and other associates access to invoicing without having to have my login and password for full access to everything.

Cost more than anything...but I also understand payroll a little bit better now too, so that's a good thing.




Pros
I love the price.   I am now getting used to the software and the ease of use is improving.  I suppose if one already understood payroll, this software would be a breeze.  Thank goodness for the online chat support!  They are always a big help.




Cons
 I am brand new at being an employer that uses payroll, so I personally experienced some difficulty using/understanding the software.  Now that I'm getting used to all of this, it's getting much easier.

Ease of use and peace of mind.




Pros
This software is so easy to use. I was hesitant to switch from our payroll company, but now all the guesswork is taken out. For a much smaller fee, I get the exact same service and features. Plus, free direct deposit!




Cons
Set up is very in depth so it can be time consuming and overwhelming to a new business owner who may be unfamiliar with tax info. However, the customer service is tops and patiently answers any questions to help along the way.

What Is the FrontRunners Quadrant?
A Graphic of the Top-Performing HR Software Products
FrontRunners quadrants highlight the top software products for North American small businesses. All products in the quadrant are top performers. Small businesses can use FrontRunners to make more informed decisions about what software is right for them.
To create this quadrant, we evaluated over 560 human resource information system (HRIS) products. Those with the top scores for their capability and value made the quadrant.
Scores are based largely on reviews from real software users, along with other product performance details (e.g., what features they offer, how many customers they have).
Is One Quadrant Better Than the Others?
Nope, Products in Any Quadrant May Fit Your Needs
Every product in this quadrant offers a balance of capability (how much the products can do) and value (whether they’re worth their price/cost) that makes them stand out in the race for small business software success.
FrontRunners has four sub-quadrants:

Upper Right = Leaders: Leaders are all-around strong products. They offer a wide range of functionality to a wide range of customers. These products are considered highly valuable by customers.
 
Upper Left = Masters: Masters may focus more heavily on certain key features or market segments than Leaders do. If you need a more specialized set of functionality without bells and whistles, then a product in the Masters quadrant might be right for you.
 
Lower Right = Pacesetters: Pacesetters may offer a strong set of features, but are not rated as highly on value. For example, a Pacesetter might offer greater functionality, but cost more.
 
Lower Left = Contenders: Contenders may focus on a more specialized set of capabilities that are priced at a higher point. This makes them ideal for companies willing to pay more for specific features that meet their unique needs.

Depending on the specific needs of a software buyer, a product in any of these sub-quadrants could be a good fit.
Why? To even be considered for this FrontRunners, a product had to meet a minimum user rating score of 3.0 for both capability and value. This means that all products that qualify as FrontRunners are top-performing products in their market. They appear in the quadrant in relation to how their peers performed.
For some buyers, a specific FrontRunners sub-quadrant might be best. For example, buyers wanting a core system with a strong focus on personnel tracking and workforce management capabilities might consider software in the Contenders sub-quadrant, while those looking for a more comprehensive platform with features like performance management and applicant tracking might look in the Leaders sub-quadrant.
You can download the full FrontRunners for HRIS Management report. It contains individual scorecards for each product on the Frontrunners quadrant.
How Are FrontRunners Products Selected?
Products Are Scored Based on User Reviews and Other Data
You can find the full FrontRunners methodology here, but the gist is that products are scored in two areas, Capability and Value.
To be considered at all, products must have at least 20 reviews and meet minimum user rating scores. They also have to offer a core set of functionality—for example, to be considered for FrontRunners, HRIS products must offer personnel tracking, benefits administration and reporting capabilities.
From there, user reviews and other product performance details, such as the product's customer base and the features it offers, dictate the Capability and Value scores. Capability is plotted on the x-axis, and Value is plotted on the y-axis.

One Last Thing—How Do I Reference FrontRunners?
Just Follow Our External Usage Guidelines
Check out the FrontRunners External Usage Guidelines when referencing FrontRunners content. Except in digital media with character limitations, the following disclaimer MUST appear with any/all FrontRunners reference(s) and graphic use:
FrontRunners scores and graphics are derived from individual end-user reviews based on their own experiences, vendor-supplied information and publicly available product information; they do not represent the views of Gartner or its affiliates.







Runners Up
Providers listed as Runners Up were considered for inclusion in the quadrant, but were
                                ultimately not included for one or more reasons: they did not have enough reviews; they did
                                not meet the reviews score minimum; they did not meet the ultimate Value and Capability minimum
                                scores; or they did not meet our functionality requirements for the market.

Human resources software is designed to help organizations manage every aspect of their HR operations, including:

Sourcing
Recruiting
Applicant tracking
Personnel tracking
Onboarding
Time and attendance
Payroll
Performance reviews
Learning management

We created this guide to help you determine which HR applications are best for your organization. Here’s what we’ll cover:
What Is Human Resources Software?Overview of HR ApplicationsCommon Features of HR SoftwareWhat Type of Buyer Are You?Market Trends to UnderstandRecent Events You Should Know About

What Is Human Resources Software?
Human resources (HR) software solutions make managing a large or growing workforce more efficient. Vendors and buyers alike often refer to this category of software as human resources information systems (HRIS), human resources management systems (HRMS) or human capital management (HCM) software (though if you want to get specific, each of those categories has its own nuances).
What all HR solutions have in common is their ability to streamline the traditional HR functions of benefits administration, personnel tracking and payroll. But in addition to increasing your productivity by automating many of these administrative processes, HR software can also support you on a strategic level, by helping you to recruit, develop and manage your company’s most valuable resource: its people.

Overview of HR Applications 
Industry watchers break down the field of HR software into three main categories: Core HR, Workforce Management and Strategic HR—also called Talent Management or Talent Administration software.

Core HR encompasses the three traditional human resources management functions: benefits administration, personnel tracking and payroll. Every company will require these functions once it has reached a critical mass of employees. You need core HR functionality when, for instance, manually running payroll and managing employees with spreadsheets becomes too burdensome a task.
Workforce management, or Workforce administration as it is also called, comprises the range of software solutions intended to effectively schedule and track your workforce. These solutions are ideal for organizations whose employees work in shifts, and include applications to track time and attendance, monitor compliance with labor laws and usually include payroll functionality, or integrate well with other payroll software. It's important to note that there are industry-specific systems that offer attendance functionality outside of human resources software. Specifically, school administration software provides education organizations a means of tracking student attendance. This can include providing online portals for parents and teachers to monitor attendance online.
Strategic HR involves growing your company by attracting and developing the best people, as well as better managing your workforce overall. Strategic HR applications generally provide some combination of applicant tracking and recruiting, learning management as well as performance review functionality. This type of software streamlines these strategic processes to ensure that a company is using its staff as efficiently as possible, and also that employees are continuing to grow and develop—increasing employee satisfaction and retention rates.
Of course, core HR, workforce management and strategic HR functions often overlap. While there are best-of-breed solutions for individual functions in each category, there are also integrated suites boasting across-the-board functionality.

Common Features of HR Software
Core HR



Benefits administration
Manages employee benefits such as paid time off, medical/dental/life insurance policies and 401k participation. Example vendors: OmnipriseHRM, Epicor HR, Triton HR.


Personnel tracking
Centralizes employee data, such as SSN, contact information, past employment and demographic information. Example vendors: Sage HRMS, Ascentis, Lawson HR.


Payroll
Tracks employee salaries, bonuses, 401k contributions, health and other deductions; calculates withholding for taxes; and cuts paychecks. Most solutions provide integration for direct deposit as well. Example vendors: Halogen, Vista HRMS, Tribe HR.



Workforce Management



Time & attendance
Helps staff track employee attendance and absences, and enables employees to clock in and out. Many solutions also track PTO and sick days. Rules-based engines provide alerts when employees miss or perform established amounts of work. Example vendors: TimeForge Labor Management, LaborVIEW, Kronos.


Employee scheduling
Provides functionality for scheduling employee shifts and attendance to ensure compliance with staffing needs. Systems can schedule employees across departments, locations and projects, and provide alerts to employees when schedules change and when staffing levels are inadequate. Example vendors: Ascentis, Sage HRMS, UltiPro.



Strategic HR



Applicant tracking systems (ATS)
Provides a centralized database that lets recruiters store applicant information and employment applications throughout the application process. Features include candidate tracking, applicant status monitoring and direct integration with other HR applications. In addition, many vendors include on-boarding features, like the ability to perform background checks. Example vendors: iCIMS, MarketRate, NuViewHR.


Employee evaluation
Also known as performance review software, these applications offer a centralized system where supervisors can conduct and track reviews with employees. Features performance measuring, tracking and goal management. Example vendors: Empower by ECI, Cornerstone CSB, People-Trak.


Learning & development
Establishes a centralized hub to monitor new employee training and the ongoing skills development of existing employees. Features include content authoring and management, curriculum and certification path definition, testing and reporting. Example vendors: Prosperity LMS, Halogen Talent Management Suite, SmartTeam.




What Type of Buyer Are You?
Given the wide variety of popular HR software available, the task of choosing one solution is daunting. To help you narrow the field, below we present four common buyer goals. One or more of these goals might align with your needs.
Streamline HR administrative tasks. If you’re a small to medium-sized company with no HR software, or you are using a few standalone solutions that you want to consolidate, you should consider an integrated HR suite. This will automate your more basic HR functions with a single system. Representative vendors: Sage HRMS, SAP - HR, Vista HRMS.  Boost efficiency when recruiting and hiring candidates. If you need to scale your workforce quickly, a best-of-breed recruiting and applicant tracking solution might be your best option. Many of these solutions can automatically post jobs to job boards and social media outlets, in addition to simplifying candidate tracking and on-boarding of new employees. With searchable databases of candidates and robust reporting capabilities, you can make the most of your current candidate pool, while expanding your talent base. Representative vendors: SuccessFactors, COMPAS, GoHire.  Manage a large pool of employees working in shifts. If you are faced with the task of staffing a workday with multiple shifts to assign and time-off requests to approve—such as the shift-work found at hospitals, grocery stores or restaurants—and need better tools to track your workforce, you need to build up the workforce administration pillar of your HRIS. Many solutions either feature a built-in payroll system to help when running massive payrolls, or integrate effectively with your current payroll software to ensure all hours worked by employees are compensated. Representative vendors: LaborView, TimeAttend, TimeForce.  Develop your workforce. You want to ensure that your best employees are recognized and rewarded so they stay with your company and continue to do great work. The broad category of talent management solutions help you do that, with everything from performance appraisal solutions, to systems for gathering peer feedback, to employee training tools. Benefits include increased retention rates, higher morale and greater employee productivity. Representative vendors: Halogen Talent Management Suite, Kenexa2x, NuView HR.

Market Trends to Understand
As you evaluate a human resources management system, it is helpful to understand a few current trends in this industry.
Consolidation of cloud-based HR software start-up vendors. Recently, there has been a trend in the HR software world toward consolidating as many applications as possible under one vendor. As such, companies have focused on developing integrated suites that allow HR departments to track an employee’s entire life cycle within an organization.
To that end, many best-of-breed providers have been acquired by larger vendors looking to extend the breadth of their integrated suite solutions. For instance, in 2012, SAP acquired SuccessFactors; Oracle bought Taleo (one of SuccessFactors’ competitors) and Salesforce.com completed its integration of Rypple, a social performance platform.
For buyers, this offers the opportunity to benefit from larger corporate resources, but it can also lead to disruptions as acquired companies are integrated and product offerings are rationalized. In anticipation, buyers should lock in rates and service/maintenance terms in their contract as this can save them a headache down the line.
Adoption of software as a service. HR software vendors have widely embraced the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), or “Web-based,” deployment method. SaaS applications are easily implemented and updated, and can be accessed by HR staff and employees from almost any device with an Internet connection. Although most SaaS applications allow for some level of customization, it is important to realize that customization options to support your company’s unique needs can be somewhat limited.

Vendors such as TimeForce allow employees to request time-off through their Web-based system
Consumerization of HR software technology. A major shift in the development of enterprise software has been the emergence of consumer markets as a primary source of technology innovation—a trend called consumerization. From social media as a recruiting tool to mobile apps for managing HR on the go, consumer technologies are changing the way HR technology is being used. Vendors are beefing up collaborative capabilities in their systems and developing more intuitive user interfaces. When selecting the human resources system that’s best for you, third-party reviews of product features are a great way to distinguish which vendors will deliver.
 Vendors such as Bullhorn feature mobile accessibility

Building Brand Recognition With Your Team | Patriot Software




















































































Small Business











Building Brand Recognition With Your TeamBy Amanda Cameron on June 26, 2017 in Employee Management, Marketing 


Promoting a small business can be tough (and expensive). How do you get customers to fall in love with your products and services without breaking the bank? Use a brand recognition strategy to boost business with word-of-mouth marketing.
What is your brand?
Sometimes, small business owners struggle to understand what a brand is. But, the concept can be summed up simply. Your brand is your promise to your customers and employees. It defines what they can expect from your business. And, it shows how your products and services are different from competitors’.
A strong brand is a powerful force when it comes to growing your business. It makes it easier for you to connect with vendors, customers, and employees. These individuals are key to increasing net profit. When people connect with your message, they want to do business with you.
A good brand uses consistent messaging through all business communications. From the sign on your building to engaging customers on social media, everything that your business expresses must align with the same message.
Brand recognition reflects how well consumers can identify your business and its values. Your brand needs to be easily recognizable and unique from your competitors. The better brand recognition your business receives, the more sales you make.

What is a brand ambassador?
A brand ambassador is someone who endorses your business. An ambassador helps market a company and openly shows their support. Many celebrities promote products and services from large corporations to build brand awareness.
As a small business owner, chances are you can’t get an A-list movie star to tell the world how great your company is. But, since you target a local market, you don’t need to. Your employees can act as brand ambassadors for your business.
An employee brand ambassador acts as an advocate for your business. They must care about the company and its offerings. When employees believe in your brand, customers notice. Your business will gain support from your target market because of your team’s advocacy.
Employee brand ambassador program
Unfortunately, you can’t train employees to be brand ambassadors. Being a brand ambassador requires passion that comes from connecting with the business.
But, you can set up an employee brand ambassador program to help turn workers into advocates. Try the following tips to build brand recognition with your team.
Lead your workforce
If you want your employees to be brand ambassadors, you need to be an active leader. The way you manage your employees has a huge impact on their loyalty to your business. Get involved with your workforce and day-to-day operations.
Build a community around your brand that starts within your business. Lead by example and convey your company’s message in your actions. When employees complete tasks in a way that reflects your brand, show them gratitude.
Educate your employees
Your employees will not appreciate your brand if they do not understand it. Meet with your team and talk about your business’s values. Tell them your startup story and relate your message back to customers.
To be brand ambassadors, employees need to know your business’s target market. Take the time to teach employees about your customers. Express how it’s important for employees to understand customers and their needs.
Take a transparent approach to showing employees your brand. Employees can see past generic phrasing and phony enthusiasm. You won’t have to force passion on your employees. It should come naturally as they connect with your brand.
Get employees involved
For brand recognition with your team, encourage employee engagement. Creating a fun and interesting workplace turns employees into brand ambassadors. Set up engagement strategies to make work more than just a nine to five.
Employee engagement is all about creating an environment that makes workers happy and productive. Give employees everything they need to do the job and create a plan for onboarding new employees. Make employees feel that they each have an important role in the business’s success.
Track success
Measuring your team’s progress helps reinforce brand recognition. Together, your team can create goals based on your business’s values and message.
Set quantifiable goals that your employees can work towards. For example, you might want to increase visibility, generate more leads, or gain a larger social following. Use marketing metrics to track success, review the results, and make improvements.

Comments:  Pro: Very easy to use and simple. Reports are accurate and easy to read.
Cons: Not really any... It would be nice if there was an easier way to handle employee purchases that are deducted from their pay. You can add money to a persons pay (like reimbursements for employee paid expenses) easily, but you can't   deduct money without editing deductions before running payroll, then you have to remember to go back and change the deductions amount before the next payroll or you'll deduct the sames amount again...

Comments:  I decided to pay my nanny over the table and was looking for a very basic payroll service that would calculate everything for me while also being affordable. Patriot definitely fit the bill. It's super reasonably priced, easy to use, and has the all the features I was looking for. Their customer service is extremely helpful and responsive when setting everything up. Bonus that they have free direct deposit. The only drawback so far is they don't support multiple pay rates for one employee/payroll (in a nanny situation this is common - 1 child vs 2 child rates); however, there was a pretty simple workaround and this feature is apparently going to be released soon. A+

Comments:  We switched over to this software in the middle of the year.  While, I chose to set everything up myself, customer service was there right to help with every single step.  Any time I've had a question they've been able to answer either right away or find out for me as soon as possible.  
Our only "cons" would be that our paychecks need to be laid out a little differently than they allow and also, a plus would be to have an automatic vacation time addition.  Each payroll I have to manually enter in hours for my employees.  It would be nice to just have that added in for me, like I can in Quickbooks.  
Overall, it's insanely easy and for all of the services, it is way cheaper than Quickbooks.  We are so glad we made the switch!

                on August 26, 2015

Comments:  I'm glad I found Patriot Software.   
I own a small business and was using a local CPA for my payroll, which occurs every other week.   Many checks were cut for employees on  Friday payday using estimates for their taxes and net.  It was always a concern on Monday or Tuesday each week when I'd send in employee hours to my CPA that I'd have them by Friday morning so I could cut checks for my staff.
After six or eight months worrying about how to pay my staff, I decided I'd just use Abra HR and Payroll as I did for years when I was the only employee on my payroll.   I contacted an Abra reseller to upgrade my license and couldn't believe how expensive it would be.   That brought me to Patriot.
For a few bucks each month, I can run my payroll from anywhere I can get on the internet.  Its easy to use and available night and day.   Like any software it has a few little quirks, but none that make me want to stop using it.   Overall, its excellent, accessible, and easy enough to use once you figure out how you want things to work.
I've told my CPA about it, and now he is recommending Patriot to many of his small business clients with good feedback as well.
Good job, Patriot, and thank you.

Comments:  "Patriot Software is meeting my business needs, and offers everything a person could want in a Payroll Software Company.  In fact, several other Payroll Companies have contacted me wanting to offer me their services.  In asking them what they have to offer me, what's included in their services and at what cost, nothing comes close to the value I receive with Patriot; your competition just doesn't cut it!  In addition, the Customer Service is the most consistently reliable, most courteous and helpful on the internet that I've ever done business with.  Your Customer Service is always Classy!  You helped set up my account at no charge. Every Time I have called with a question a friendly, patient and knowledgeable person guided me to the solution. Thanks much for being there for me.

Comments:  I was using spreadsheets for my payroll and time sheets but entering them in patriot-software has been a lot simpler.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the payroll history link disappeared before I was able to enter my complete history and I needed to get paycheck stubs to an employee for past payroll.  Other than that, I am looking forward to the ease of my employees clocking in and out online instead of me having to remember what days they called out or was late to work.  And patriot software is processing taxes, thank goodness.

Hi Tamara,
Thanks for taking the time to review us! A support rep will be contacting you about the payroll history link.  The link removal is to safeguard you from entering in prior payrolls in an open tax period.
You will love our time and attendance software. It is so easy to track employee hours and send them to payroll with a click of a button. 
We look forward to serving you!

Example vendors are ADP and Triton HR.Medium-sized companies – These buyers look for more than basic payroll functionality. They want additional features like recruitment, attendance tracking, scheduling, workforce management, etc. and therefore look to invest in a comprehensive HR management solution. Example vendors are Vista HRMS, NuViewHR, Kronos, ADP, and Ascentis.Large enterprises – These companies typically invest in an enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution that includes payroll management.

Example vendors are Lawson HR, Ominprise HRM, Sage, and Epicor HR.What are Examples of Payroll Management Software?Xero: An online accounting app for businesses from all scales and industries, but also individual accountants and bookkeepers.

They range all the way from basic tool suites to ultra costly and accurate programs. The list of features can also be categorization criteria, as certain programs do nothing but generate audit reports, while others are more robust and they allow users to track tax code changes and to forecast them, and even do some custom branding. The basic division criterion is deployment, depending on which you can choose between:On-premise payroll management systems. These are covered with a single license, and are hosted on the client’s local server. They qualify as the most expensive ones, due the fact that they require complex setup and occasionally some hardware installation.Software-as-a-service (SaaS) payroll management systems. These are usually paid per month, and are hosted on the vendor’s server. The business owner is not responsible for installation, updating, and maintenance.Cloud-hosted payroll management systems. Most of these offer free basic plans, and qualify as the most affordable ones due to their universal access and the fact that the client doesn’t need to update them or to pay for maintenance.Key Features of Payroll Management SoftwareThe following features are essential for payroll software:Compensation. What you’d generally expect from a payroll manager is to process and distribute paychecks, but the scale of these programs is much broader. One of their key features is compensation, which means they can do business salary management and keep track of leave/bonus systems and track salary transfer.Benefits. Payroll management systems are enabled to track performance, and to reward it. Sick leaves, absences, and overtime can be calculated easily, meaning that no employee will be discriminated in any way. Later on, the system administers salaries and tax deductions, and calculates the benefits.Employee records. Payroll management systems allow to summarize and update employee information in individual records, available to each department to make the most of your human resource. Together with personal data, these records contain history of employment, and can be customized to add information you think is relevant.Time-off tracking. Once again, payroll management systems track the sick leaves, vacation accrual, and other absences of your employees, and calculate their salaries considering this information. Automating time-off management and approval ensures there will be no mistakes when balancing the changes with your payroll system.Tax filings. The systems can help you prepare detailed tax filings, allowing you to schedule, pay, balance, and file payroll taxes all on the same platform. To make matters even better, advanced payroll management systems store this information in a comprehensive, easy-to-browse database.Reports. What is really critical to every payroll management system is reporting, where you should expect your system to perform Direct deposit reports, Online payment reports, Annual reports, etc. For the purpose, the toll is supposed to contain a robust suite of analytic tools, in particular tables, graphs, and charts.Benefits of Payroll Management SoftwarePayroll software offers plenty of benefits such as saving time and money, and eliminating compliance risks.Saving time – You can save plenty of time and in turn money by purchasing a good quality payroll software. These applications are intuitively designed, which means your HR employees can easily learn to operate them. A manufacturing company found that it was able to drastically reduce the time needed for payroll management by using ADP’s solution. It used to spend two days to perform the payroll tasks manually, but the application cut down the time to just half a morning.Reducing risk and increasing accuracy – Payroll software is a boon for companies looking to comply with tax requirements and filing tax reports. Manual payroll processing can lead to human errors which can significantly affect a company. In fact, companies face the risk of penalties if they do not comply properly with tax regulations. Payroll management solutions can complete tax reports and filings for your company, and even remind you about their due dates. Plus, they also perform the daunting task of tracking changes in tax code.Generating detailed reports – Payroll software can help you track data over time and easily generate insightful reports for auditors, accountants, and internal decision makers. Examples of such reports include employee participation in 401k plans, annual tax remittances, and summaries of quarterly expenses.

Building Brand Awareness vs. Marketing - Patriot Small Business


























































































Small Business











Building Brand Awareness vs. MarketingBy Mike Kappel on May 5, 2016 in Entrepreneur, Marketing, Startup 


Marketing can be incredibly expensive. In fact, for many startups, after initial investment and any payroll obligations, marketing campaigns can easily be the most expensive part of your business. If you’re a rookie entrepreneur (heck, even if you’re a veteran entrepreneur), you may feel enticed to blast news and advertisements about your new company and its products through every marketing channel you can, across every demographic available. And, when someone asks you why you’re advertising so broadly — citing concepts like marketing segmentation, customer profiles, and Cost of Conversion (CoC) — you might be inclined to respond with, “It’s okay; we’re building brand awareness.”
If this is you, I’m sorry to tell you but the term “building awareness” wasn’t meant to be the catch-all justification of wasteful marketing spending. A brand awareness strategy has just as many tactical elements as any marketing segmentation strategy.  
Don’t “Spray and Pray” 
There are so many ways to get out news about your new business these days that, instead of picking the best fit for your product or service, choosing “all of the above” can sure makes things easier.  Unfortunately, it can also really make things expensive!
If you’re trying to convert potential customers into actual customers using the fewest marketing dollars possible, then you should be focusing on building a profile of who your customer is, where they shop, what motivates them, what marketing channels reach them, and when they consume media you can advertise in. Don’t be afraid to conduct a market analysis, even an informal one, to gain more insight. The more of these questions you can answer, the more precise you can be with your advertising, and the fewer advertising mediums where you’ll need to purchase ad space. Sure, expenses of a business include marketing and advertising, but why spray marketing money all over creation when you can spend it to reach your best potential customers. You might also consider the Chamber of Commerce membership benefits for small business. Locally targeted marketing opportunities and resources are a great way to increase your reach without breaking the bank.
When Building Brand Awareness Makes Cents
During my time as a CEO, I’ve been told that the number of “touches” or interactions required for a potential customer to even consider incorporating your product into their life is somewhere between 7 and 20. Now whether that number was the product of legitimate research on consumers, or a marketer selling “touches,” is hard to say. But what’s easy to see is that it takes a lot of advertising to reach those touch numbers.
Awareness building is a natural byproduct of many advertising campaigns, but it can also be something you strategically leverage. An example of this is advertising before your prime selling season comes up. For example, here at Patriot Software, we know that December and January are our prime selling months for our accounting and payroll software, because many small business owners are thinking about year-end closing procedures in accounting and better methods for how to do payroll with minimum cost.
However, if we started running our ads during that time frame alone, many small business owners might be unsure about who we are since they would have never heard of us before. By advertising in advance, we ensure that we’re a familiar name when they enter that point in the year when they’re thinking about switching to, or trying out, a product like ours. It’s the old “hey, I know them, I should try that” technique. Consultants and agencies know to that you need to properly position yourself before launching any campaigns for building your business.
Simply put, when you build brand awareness before a more segmented and focused marketing campaign, you can increase that campaign’s efficacy. Create a business budget with these awareness concepts in mind.
Don’t Forget About PR 
One of the best ways to get nearly free advertising — advertising which is both an effective form of awareness-building and conversion — is to invest in public relations efforts. Sadly, many entrepreneurs go about public relations all wrong.
Members of the media are tasked with presenting new and noteworthy developments to their, or their employer’s, readership. Every entrepreneur thinks their new startup is newsworthy. And of course it’s interesting—it’s your business! However, entrepreneurs looking for publicity are biased. Heck, even if you’re not, you’ll sound like you are to a reporter who has heard a zillion pitches just like yours.
Not every reporter is going to find your business as fascinating and cutting edge as you do, so spamming them to take notice and validate your arrival is a serious misstep as it not only relegates your requests to a trash can but it relegates you to a block list. Online payroll is not exactly a product full of mystery and intrigue, so my team and I know how important it is to frame and pitch the product correctly.
To have success in the PR game, think about the reporter you’re pitching, what they cover, and who their readership is. When you pitch, don’t tell them the things you find unique and interesting things about your company; tell them what is interesting and relevant in relation to the topics they cover. Support your claims with numbers and examples and, if possible, supply multiple angles that make your news more engaging. The more interesting and appealing you can make your company to a reporter’s readership, the more relevant your company will be to that reporter.
If your first pitch gets no response, that’s not a reason to stop pitching. Members of the media wake up to boxes stuffed with pitches like yours every day. Your pitch may be excellent, but, the sheer volume of demand, especially for more prominent members of the media means there will be more rejects and silence than success. Even so, stay persistent!  PR is advertising, building your brand, and an endorsement all rolled into one. And for the price—typically free—it’s worth it.
