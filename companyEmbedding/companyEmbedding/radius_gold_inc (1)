Leveraging Experience
Discovering Value





Radius is a well-financed exploration company. For the past several years the focus has been gold exploration in Central America. The Company has had success in the region, discovering several new gold deposits. While these discoveries have kept the Company financed, management continues to review projects available for acquisition. This should make for an exciting year for Radius!

The Company is led by Simon Ridgway, a successful entrepreneur, explorationist and financier. A recent decision to expand the geographical and commodity focus of the Company should allow for more opportunity to leverage its corporate assets: Experience and a Strong Treasury.

News Releases March 10, 2015Radius Gold Acquires Option on Margarita Silver Property, Mexico, and Production Royalty on Phosphate Project, Peru
 Vancouver, Canada - Radius Gold Inc. (TSX-V: RDU) is pleased to report on recent activities and corporate developments.

Option to Acquire Margarita Silver Property, Mexico

The Company has acquired an option to earn a 100% interest in the Margarita Silver Project (the "Margarita Property") in the State of Chihuahua, Mexico.

The Margarita Property consists of two mining exploration licenses comprising a total of 125 hectares and located approximately 115 km NW of the historic silver mining city of Parral, Chihuahua, in the Mexican Silver Belt, one of the most productive silver camps in the world.

Property Geology

Mineralization on the Margarita Property is hosted in a series of parallel, steeply-dipping, northwest-trending veins, the most important of which, the El Tren-Margarita vein, outcrops prominently as an oxidized ochre-coloured banded quartz-limonite vein.  It is exposed over a strike length of 1.7 km within the property boundaries, and is known to strike over 4 km onto adjacent ground. 

The El Tren-Margarita vein is a classic banded epithermal quartz vein with an apparent thickness of between 1 and 5 metres.  Recent project due diligence work by Radius geologists included chip channel sampling across a five metre in situ exposure of the vein.  The sampling assayed a length-weighted average of 640 ppm Ag over 5.0 m , as follows:




Sample #
Length (m)
Ag (ppm)

564


rmag025
1.0

rmag026

rmag027

There is evidence on the Margarita Property of near-continuous artisanal-scale surface and near-surface mining along the entire strike length of the vein, but there is no physical or recorded evidence of diamond drilling or other signs of modern exploration works.  The Company considers the exploration potential for a vein-hosted high grade silver deposit to be excellent. 

District geology and mineralization

The Margarita Property is located in the boundary region of the Sierra Madre Occidental volcanic province and the Mesozoic Chihuahua sedimentary basin.  District geology is dominated by a thick sequence of Cenozoic felsic volcanic rocks divided into two units: the Lower and Upper Volcanic Groups.   The Margarita Property lies towards the northern end of a prolific belt of silver deposits, which includes Fresnillo's San Julian mine, Silver Standard's Pitarilla project, Fresnillo's Fresnillo mine, and many others.

The Margarita Property concessions are surrounded on all sides by the Los Gatos concession package of Sunshine Silver Mines.  The Los Gatos Property consists of a large land package, and includes a series of generally northwest trending veins similar to El Tren-Margarita.  Los Gatos hosts a project-wide indicated resource of 5.5 Mt at 186 ppm Ag for a total of 32.9 Moz and an inferred resource of 14.3 Mt at 116 ppm Ag for a total of 53.2 Moz Ag.

Cautionary Language:  The Los Gatos resource is quoted from: "(NI) 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Resources of the Los Gatos Project, Chihuahua, Mexico. Tetra Tech Inc. December 21st, 2012." Radius's Qualified Person has not verified the information regarding the Los Gatos resource.  The information on the Los Gatos resource is given to provide the geological context for the Margarita Project, and it is not necessarily indicative of similar mineralization on the Margarita Project.

Option Terms

The Company has the option to acquire a 100% interest in the Margarita Project by making cash payments to the property owners, two private Mexico corporations, totalling US$3,000,000 over a period of five years following issuance of a drill permit for the Project.  Option payments in the first year total US$50,000.  If the option is exercised by the Company, the property owners will be entitled to a 0.5% NSR royalty.  The Company may re-purchase the royalty at any time for US$500,000.

QA/QC

Due diligence samples from the Margarita Project consist of rock chip and continuous chip-channel samples.  Sampling was performed by Radius geologists, and samples delivered to ALS Chemex's laboratory in Chihuahua, Mexico.  Samples were crushed and pulverised at ALS's Mexican facility, with pulp aliquots forwarded to ALS's Vancouver BC facility for analysis.  Multi-element analyses were performed using ALS Chemex analytical packages Au-AA24, ME-ICP41, Ag-OG46, Cu-OG46, and Zn-OG46.  Two certified reference materials from Geostats Pty. (GBM909-12, GBM997-1) were introduced into the sample stream to monitor laboratory performance.

Royalty on Bayovar 12 Phosphate Project, Peru

The Company has agreed to purchase from Focus Ventures Ltd. ("Focus") (TSXV: FCV) a production royalty,  equivalent to a 2% NSR, on Focus's 70% interest in future phosphate production from the Bayovar 12 project.  The purchase price for the royalty is US$1.0 million.  Focus will have the right for 12 months to buy back one-half of the royalty for US$1.0 million.  Should Radius decide at any time in the future to sell the royalty, Focus will retain a first right of refusal.

Radius and Focus have two common directors, and the transaction is subject to TSX Venture Exchange approval.

Corporate Update

The Company also announces that Ralph Rushton has stepped down from the Board of Directors of Radius in order to direct his efforts as Vice-President, Corporate Development for Focus Ventures.  Management of Radius wishes to express its appreciation for Ralph's significant contributions to the Company over the past 10 years.

As well, the Company confirms that it is calling an annual and special meeting of its shareholders to be held on April 23, 2015 in order to request approval of, among other things, the Company's proposed change of business to an Investment Issuer.  Completion of the change of business is subject to approval by a majority of the shareholders present at the meeting and to final approval of the TSX Venture Exchange, and there can be no assurance that it will be completed as proposed, or at all.

Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

Reports Positive Exploration Drill Results at the Trebol Project, Nicaragua. Highlights Include Hole TR-11-047 Containing 13.08 Grams per Tonne Gold Over 7 MetresMarketwireMay 17, 2011ReblogShareTweetShareVANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwire - 05/17/11) - B2Gold Corp. (TSX:BTO - News)(OTCQX: BGLPF) ("B2Gold" or the "Company") and Radius Gold Inc. (TSX-V:RDU - News) ("Radius Gold"), are pleased to announce positive assay results from the initial 2011 exploration drilling program at the Trebol Project in Nicaragua. B2Gold has the right to earn a 60% interest from joint venture partner Radius Gold.The over 3,000 metre diamond drilling program has been focused on three zones of low sulfidation gold occurrences in altered volcanic rocks covering a strike length of over five kilometres ("km"). These results confirm the Trebol Property's potential to host, at or near surface, shallow dipping gold mineralization that could potentially be mined with very low strip ratios.Mineralization throughout the Trebol area is characterized by shallow to moderately dipping tabular shaped vein and hydrothermal breccia zones within andesite. Outcropping horizons of the siliceous material have yielded impressive gold values in the trenching (see B2Gold press release dated November 15, 2010) and the drilling has shown that many of these zones extend up to 100 metres down dip and show continuity over distances of several hundreds of metres of strike length. Due to the shallow dips associated with the gold mineralization, most of mineralization is near surface and mostly oxidized.The three zones, drilled to date are Cerro Domingo, the Paola Zone, and the Trebol North Zone. Drill holes contain up to 13.08 grams per tonne ("g/t") gold over 7.00 metres in hole TR-11-047. Drilling by Radius Gold in 2008 first located the Cerro Domingo Zone and this has been confirmed and expanded in the recent drilling. The 2011 drilling campaign cut mineralization in the Cerro Domingo, Paola and Trebol North Zones with drill holes containing up to 1.96 g/t gold over 28.55 metres in hole TR-11-014 in the Cerro Domingo Zone, up to 8.86 g/t gold over 7.75 metres in hole TR-11-028 in the Paola Zone and up to 13.08 g/t gold over 7.00 metres in hole TR-11-047 in the Trebol North Zone.

The mineralization remains open to the north and south and in the covered areas between the three zones. In addition, the Company's geologists continue to discover more low sulfidation epithermal gold, outcrop and float occurrences within the concession that contain plus 1.00 g/t gold assays in grab and chip samples over 11.5 km of the 22 km total strike length of the trend. In addition, a parallel zone has been located three km east of Cerro Domingo where preliminary grab sampling of similar siliceous material has yielded values up to 3.00 g/t gold.Exploration is ongoing at Trebol and will continue as B2Gold geologists compile the recent drill data and plan the next round of trenching and drilling.Samples for Trebol are submitted with blanks and industry certified standards inserted in the field and prior to reception at Inspectorate's prep lab in Managua. Pulps are then analyzed at Inspectorate's labs in Reno, Nevada. Check assays are currently being selected now that the drilling program has been completed and will be sent to ALS labs in Vancouver, Canada. Except where noted, all results stated in this announcement have passed B2Gold's quality assurance and quality control ("QA/QC") protocols.The exploration programs for the Company are reviewed and the results approved by Tom Garagan, B2Gold's Qualified Person under National Instrument 43-101.ON BEHALF OF B2GOLD CORP.Tom Garagan, Senior Vice President of ExplorationON BEHALF OF RADIUS GOLD INC.Simon Ridgway, President and Chief Executive OfficerFor more information on B2Gold please visit the Company web site at www.b2gold.com.For more information on Radius Gold please visit the Radius Gold's web site at www.radiusgold.com.The securities described herein have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.Some of the statements contained in this release are forward-looking statements, such as estimates and statements that describe the Company's future plans, objectives or goals, including words to the effect that the Company or management expects a stated condition or result to occur.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

               Bitcoin continues to rise Saturday after miners back a software upgrade in a move that appears to avert a potential split of the digital currency into multiple versions.
