Carriage Services - The Stable Growth Stock You Need - Carriage Services Inc (NYSE:CSV) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Carriage Services - The Stable Growth Stock You NeedJul. 2.17 | About: Carriage Services (CSV) Integer Investments Long/short equity, value, special situations, growth at reasonable priceInteger InvestmentsSummaryCarriage Services provides death-care products and services in the United States.The company’s Q1 2017 results have demonstrated strong growth, with sales growing by 7.6% compared to Q1 2016.Here we discuss the robust qualitative factors that are driving Carriage Services' growth, before providing a valuation on the business.This post was written by Hamish Kumar, Integer Investments analyst. Investment Thesis Carriage Services' (NYSE:CSV) recent earnings release emphasizes the company’s strong qualitative factors and earnings power. With a strong industry outlook for death-care goods and services, we believe that the company warrants a "hold" recommendation. 

 What Does It Do? Carriage Services is a provider of death-care products and services in the United States. The company operates through both funeral home and cemetery segments. The funeral home segment includes but is not limited to offering burial, cremation, consultation, and transportation services. The cemetery segment provides products and services such as the right to interment in cemetery sites. Additionally, Carriage Services offers death-care related merchandise, including urns, burial caskets and cremation memorialization products. As of December 31, 2016, the company operated 170 funeral homes in 28 states, and 32 cemeteries in 11 states. Recent Performance Carriage Services' Q1 2017 earnings were reported on April 26th. The company has had another strong quarter, with revenue increasing 7.6% and operating income increasing 36.1% compared to prior year results. This was driven by a combination of comparable funeral segment revenue growth and corporate expense savings. Funeral service revenues were primarily driven through acquisitions, whereas corporate expenses saving gains were attributed to unusually high comparable costs in 2016. A summary of the results is presented below:
 

 Competitive Advantage Carriage Services has two competitive advantages. 1) Although Carriage Services doesn’t have a particularly large market share (estimated 1-2%), the majority of death-care providers are locally owned and independent. The company is therefore larger than the majority of competitors. This larger size has meant that CSV has considerably driven overhead costs down through economies of scale. This has resulted in greater cash flows and the ability to further grow through acquisitions. 2) Carriage Services has the ability to provide a full-service package (merchandise, funeral services and burial/cremation) for customers. This means that the business can take care of all of the planning required for a funeral service to run smoothly. This is particularly appealing to customers, as it reduces both the stress and time involved in preparations. Although certain other competitors provide similar offerings, competition is location based. CSV may therefore be the only provider of this offering in certain regions. Industry And Business Drivers As stated in CSV’s annual report, although there are several public companies that own funeral service locations and cemeteries, the majority of death-care businesses in North America are locally-owned, independent operations. Given the sensitive nature of the business, relationships fostered at the local level build trust in the community and are a key driver of market share. While new entrants may enter any given market, the time and resources required to develop local heritage and tradition serve as important barriers to entry. The position of a single funeral service location or cemetery in any community is a function of the name, reputation, and location of that funeral service location or cemetery, although competitive pricing, professional service and attention, and well-maintained locations are also important.
 During 2016, the number of deaths in the United States increased by approximately 1.3% following a 1.9% and a 1.1% increase in 2015 and 2014, respectively. We expect this rapid growth to continue going forward (expected growth of 1.6% to 2020), causing the industry to be well positioned for medium- and long-term profitable growth. The large baby boomer populations, which in 2017 are aged 53 to 71, are already impacting the industry today. This is primarily through demand for pre-need cemetery and funeral sales (pre-need: deferred revenue on services and merchandise). However, as this population category continues to age, we will also see a growth in at need sales. It is worth noting that currently 19% of total funeral segment revenue is derived through pre-need sales. For the cemetery segment however, this represents 45% of total segment revenue. Specifically in regards to Carriage Services, the business adopts a decentralized operating model, enabling the business to further attract entrepreneurial talent in its industry. The company’s focus is to partner with the best of the remaining independent funeral home and cemetery owners in major strategic markets around the country, particularly where the potential for future revenue growth is the highest. Long-Term Growth Strategies Carriage Services has grown at a steady rate over the last several years. However, is this growth purely driven by the industry? In accordance with management, the company has several key growth initiatives. These initiatives are explained below: - Acquisitions: The company remains acquisition focused within both the funeral and cemetery segments. Within the funeral segment, acquisitions would provide the potential for scale in areas with the highest return customer categories and market traits. With rising demand for cemeteries and cemetery services expected in the coming years due to demographic changes, making acquisitions in this segment now could prove to be lucrative for the business in the future.
 Carriage Services has a flexible capital structure, with no near-term debt maturity issues. Although the debt-to-equity of 1.22 seems high, this is quite characteristic of the industry, considering its stable cash flows and low correlation to the performance of the wider economy. We therefore believe that CSV can continue to take advantage of the low interest rate environment to fund acquisition related growth. Where necessary, the company has also acquired through retained earnings and additional equity issues. - Pre-need Trust: Due to the business’s $159 million backlog of pre-need receipts, Carriage Services has invested a large sum of this money in investment trusts. CSV maintains a low risk investment structure, with relatively liquid assets in its portfolio. This is demonstrated by the fact that the trust currently only invests in debt instruments. The business also enjoys favorable terms with third-party insurance providers. Independent operators cannot easily duplicate these arrangements with third parties. This gives the business an edge in funding future growth and profitability over time. - Decentralized Operating Model: As alluded to above, the business adopts a decentralized operating model. This enables the company to attract entrepreneurial talent to further grow the business. Incentive plans are also tailored to this goal, where managing partners receive a particularly large bonus every five years if their division generates a CAGR of 2% or more over the same period. 

 Risks In fairness, there aren’t many significant risks associated to Carriage Services. The company has a strong balance sheet with no near-term debt due. The industry also isn’t strongly correlated to macroeconomic factors. The biggest issue for CSV however is the fact that the industry itself determines the revenue and profitability for the business. With industry demand currently increasing due to the growing age of the baby boomer population, what will happen in the future? Can growth be sustainable beyond the baby boomer generation?

We used an EV/EBITDA metric to value the business. We used EV to strip out any capital structure differences. We also used an EBITDA metric to nullify any D&A differences between companies. Carriage Services is slightly undervalued based on our multiples analysis. The company is trading at a price 6.92% lower than comparable companies based on the EV/EBITDA comparable. CSV is also trading at a P/E multiple 15.67% lower than its comparable companies. Is this justified however? Below is a chart demonstrating the performance of comparable companies over the last year (TTM). Our analysis shows that CSV has generated slightly less growth than its comparable companies. Although this is not by a significant amount, we believe that this warrants a slight undervaluation based on the comparables analysis. We therefore believe that the market has fairly valued the business.

This is primarily due to the aging baby boomer population. We also believe that the company is fairly valued at its current share price of $26.96. As always, thank you for reading.

Carriage's Story




Your browser does not support Video format file.
Our Five Guiding Principles


Carriage Services continuously seeks to achieve our Mission Statement of “Being the Best,” and build a high performance company that is built to last.  Co-founded in 1991 in Houston, Texas by Mel Payne, Mel has since led Carriage as our only Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. Since day one, we have also been guided by our Mission Statement and our Five Guiding Principles:

Honesty, integrity and quality in all that we do.
Hard work, pride of accomplishment and shared success through employee ownership.
Belief in the power of people through individual initiative and teamwork.
Outstanding service and profitability go hand-in-hand.
Growth of the company is driven by decentralization and partnership.

Our vision, our mission and our guiding principles for Carriage are not negotiable, and never will be. Over time, we have adopted new ideas and frameworks to help us continuously improve while eliminating other practices and concepts that may have kept us from full alignment to our vision and continuous improvement.




These have included some of the following:

From our founding in 1991 to 2003, we operated on budgets, which we abandoned in 2004 in favor of our Standards Operating Model. This decision allowed for us to more closely re-align our operating practices with our Five Guiding Principles (especially our beliefs in shared success, employee ownership, the power of people, decentralization and partnership). Without budgets, we have been free to focus on leadership, people, and culture.
Shortly thereafter, we adopted concepts from Jim Collins’ book “Good to Great” and customized them into our culture and practices (i.e. First Who, Then What; Right People in Right Seats, Flywheel Effect).
In 2006, Carriage Services adopted Jack Welch’s 4E Leadership Model to identify the required skills necessary for a high performance company.
In 2012, we embarked upon a “New Beginning” and launched our “Good to Great” Journey with the idea of achieving continuous and dynamic high performance over time.
Also in 2012, we revised our Strategic Acquisition Model to more appropriately align our practices to our vision of partnering with the best remaining independents in strategic markets.
In 2015, Carriage Services is better than it ever has been before in our twenty-four year history. However, we plan on and expect to continuously and dynamically improve over time in our mission of “Being the Best.”







The culture of our entire company is one of entrepreneurship, high performance leadership, ownership, and partnership both in principle and in practice at every level.
Starting with the foundation that is our Mission Statement and our Guiding Principles, we believe that in constantly practicing our unique culture and executing well our three operating models (Standards, 4E Leadership and Strategic Acquisition Model) will lead to sustained high performance and a company that is built to last.

            Carriage Services Operating Model
          




            Execution of our Standards Operating Model, 4E Leadership Model and Strategic Acquisition Model in unison is the key to our attaining high and sustainable performance.
          
















Standards Operating Model
4E Leadership Model
Strategic Acquisition Model



The Standards Operating Model




Our “Being the Best” standards focus on market share, people and the operating and financial metrics that drive long-term performance. To date, the Standards Operating Model has driven significant changes in our organization, leadership and operating practices.
Most importantly, the Standards Operating Model allows us to determine the sustainable revenue growth and earning power of our portfolio of funeral home and cemetery businesses.
Our Standards are designed to drive longer-term performance by growing market share and creating new heritage and producing consistent, modest revenue growth and a sustainable, increasing level of earnings and cash flow.
Our Standards are not designed to produce maximum short-term earnings because Carriage does not believe such performance is sustainable without ultimately stressing the business, which often leads to declining market share, revenues and earnings.
The Standards Operating Model eliminated the use of financial budgets (budget control model) which freed up enormous amounts of time to work on growing each local business and improving the quality and skills of the staff. Standards Achievement is the measure by which we judge the success of each business.

Standards Council:
The Standards Operating Model was originally developed by a group of former owner partners and top managers (the Standards Council). The Standards Council studied and evaluated the key drivers of development of success at Carriage’s best business over a five-year period. Their work led to the development of Standards Operating Model and the related incentives compensation plan.
At the end of each year the Standards Council members for each of our three Regions meet, review and approve the Standards Achievement and related incentive compensation awards for each business.
Incentives Align With Standards:
Each Managing Partner participates in a variable annual Being the Best  bonus plan whereby they earn a percentage of their business’ calendar year earnings based upon the actual standards achieved for that year and has the opportunity to share in the earnings of the business as long as the performance exceeds our minimum standard of 50% of the Total Standards Achievement for that calendar year.
Each Managing Partner also participates in a long-term (5 year) Good to Great variable bonus plan whereby they earn a bonus payment equaling the average Being the Best annual incentive bonus over five years times a multiple of twice the compounded annual growth rate of the Net Revenue when they have achieved revenue growth by a minimum of 2% over 5 years.


The 4E Leadership Model

The Standards Operating Model requires strong leadership to grow an entrepreneurial, high-value, personal service and sales business at sustainable Field EBITDA Margins.
Our 4E Leadership Model is based upon principles established by Jack Welch during his tenure as CEO at General Electric, and is based upon 4E qualities essential to succeed in a high performance culture: Energy to get the job done; the ability to Energize others; the Edge necessary to make difficult decisions; and the ability to Execute and produce results.
To achieve a high level of Standards in a business year after year, we must have “A Players” in charge who have the 4E leadership skills  to grow the business by hiring, training and developing highly motivated and productive teams that produce results.






Strategic Acquisition Model




We believe a primary driver of higher revenue and profits in the future will be the execution of our Strategic Acquisition Model using strategic ranking criteria to assess acquisition and divestiture candidates. As we execute this strategy over the next ten years, we will affiliate with many of the best remaining independents in demographically attractive, strategic markets.
We are disciplined in qualifying acquisition candidates since we are looking for high performance partners over time. We believe we can execute our acquisition strategy without proportionate incremental investment in our consolidation platform infrastructure or additional fixed regional and corporate overhead.
Consequently, the sustained earning power of our portfolio as defined by our Consolidated EBITDA Margin should incrementally increase over time as we execute the Strategic Acquisition Model.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
