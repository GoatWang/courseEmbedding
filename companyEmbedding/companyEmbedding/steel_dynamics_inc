FORT WAYNE, Ind., July 5, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ/GS: STLD) today announced the expansion of its Structural and Rail Division located in Columbia City, Indiana.  The $75 million expansion will utilize excess melting and casting capability and further diversify its product portfolio and market sector exposure.








This project provides for the annual production of 240,000 tons of reinforcing bar in various sizes with product sales including coiled, custom cut-to-length and smooth bars in sizes from #3 to #8 reinforcing bars.  The size offerings represent approximately 70% of 2016 total domestic reinforcing bar consumption.  Upon completion, the expansion is expected to add approximately 33 local jobs.  
"We are excited to announce this growth initiative," said Mark D. Millett, President and Chief Executive Officer.  "This investment will further expand our Structural and Rail Division's product offerings and capability in a very capital efficient manner.  Additionally, we will be the largest independent rebar supplier in the region, not competing with our new customer base, which we believe will be received positively.  We believe our intended business model could provide meaningful time and yield-loss savings for the customer, while also providing working capital benefits.  This project complements the recently announced addition of 200,000 tons of reinforcing bar capacity at our Roanoke Bar Division, which is expected to begin operating at the end of 2017."
The project entails the addition of a rolling mill, supported by certain other equipment and infrastructure requirements.  Subject to the anticipated receipt of necessary permits, which the company expects to be forthcoming in short order, and the receipt of state and local government support, the project is scheduled to be completed during the fourth quarter 2018.
About Steel Dynamics, Inc.
Steel Dynamics, Inc. is one of the largest domestic steel producers and metals recyclers in the United States based on estimated annual steelmaking and metals recycling capability, with facilities located throughout the United States, and in Mexico.  Steel Dynamics produces steel products, including hot roll, cold roll, and coated sheet steel, structural steel beams and shapes, rail, engineered special-bar-quality steel, cold finished steel, merchant bar products, specialty steel sections and steel joists and deck.  In addition, the company produces liquid pig iron and processes and sells ferrous and nonferrous scrap.  
Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains some predictive statements about future events, including statements related to conditions in the steel and metallic scrap markets, Steel Dynamics' revenues, costs of purchased materials, future profitability and earnings, and the operation of new or existing facilities. These statements, which we generally precede or accompany by such typical conditional words as "anticipate," "intend," "believe," "estimate," "plan," "seek," "project" or "expect," or by the words "may," "will," or "should," are intended to be made as "forward-looking," subject to many risks and uncertainties, within the safe harbor protections of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements speak only as of this date and are based upon information and assumptions, which we consider reasonable as of this date, concerning our businesses and the environments in which they operate. Such predictive statements are not guarantees of future performance, and we undertake no duty to update or revise any such statements. Some factors that could cause such forward-looking statements to turn out differently than anticipated include: (1) the effects of uncertain economic conditions; (2) cyclical and changing industrial demand; (3) changes in conditions in any of the steel or scrap-consuming sectors of the economy which affect demand for our products, including the strength of the non-residential and residential construction, automotive, appliance, pipe and tube, and other steel-consuming industries; (4) fluctuations in the cost of key raw materials (including steel scrap, iron units, and energy costs) and our ability to pass-on any cost increases; (5) the impact of domestic and foreign import price competition; (6) unanticipated difficulties in integrating or starting up new or acquired businesses; (7) risks and uncertainties involving product and/or technology development; and (8) occurrences of unexpected plant outages or equipment failures.
More specifically, we refer you to Steel Dynamics' more detailed explanation of these and other factors and risks that may cause such predictive statements to turn out differently, as set forth in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K under the headings Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors, in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or in other reports which we from time to time file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These are available publicly on the SEC website, www.sec.gov, and on the Steel Dynamics website, www.steeldynamics.com: Investors: SEC Filings.

Products Overview



Hot-rolled steel sheet is the primary form of steel produced by the Flat Roll Group's Butler and Columbus divisions. Our capabilities range from formable low-carbon grades to ultra-high-strength steels, with certification available to various ASTM, SAE, JIS, and API standards.
We're able to produce the lightest-gauge hot-rolled steel in North America while maintaining the most precise gauge control available in the industry. As a result, our unprocessed hot-rolled bands and our processed hot-rolled steel sheet are used in a variety of demanding applications by manufacturers in the agricultural-machinery, automotive, appliance, construction, heavy equipment, lawn and garden, pipe and tube, racking, and truck-trailer industries.
Although we have the capacity to produce more than 6 million tons of hot-rolled steel sheet each year, a significant portion of this material is finished in our cold-mill complexes before being shipped to our customers.
Our growing product portfolio includes:
    • Hot-rolled bands
    • Floor plate
    • Pickled hot-rolled steel sheet
    • Cold-rolled steel sheet
    • Hot-rolled galvanized steel sheet
    • Cold-rolled galvanized steel sheet
    • GALVALUME® steel sheet
    • Painted steel sheet

STLD is set to expand its Structural and Rail Division in Columbia City, Indiana. The $75 million expansion project will use its excess melting and casting capability and diversify the company’s product portfolio and market sector exposure.The project involves addition of a rolling mill, supported by other specific infrastructure and equipment requirements. It has the annual capacity to produce about 240,000 tons of reinforcing bars in various sizes, including customized cut-to-length smooth and coiled bars in sizes varying from #3 to #8 reinforcing bars. The size offerings correspond to roughly 70% of total domestic consumption of reinforcing bar in 2016.According to Steel Dynamics, this investment will expand its capabilities in the Structural and Rail Division efficiently and position it as the largest independent rebar supplier in the region, without competing with new customer base. Further, the intended business model has the potential to provide customers with working capital gains along with saving yield and time-losses.  The project complements the newly added 200,000 tons of reinforcing bar capacity at the company’s Roanoke Bar Division, which is expected to initiate operations by the end of this year. Steel Dynamics expects the project to add about 33 jobs in the local market.Steel Dynamics also confirmed that the project is scheduled to be completed during the fourth quarter 2018, subject to receipt of necessary permits and support of local and state government.Steel Dynamics’ shares have rallied 6.1% in the last three months, outperforming the Zacks categorized Steel-Producers industry’s decline of 2.3%.View photos The company, last month, provided its earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2017. Steel Dynamics expects its earnings for the second quarter to be in the band of 60 cents to 64 cents per share.The company expects profitability from its steel operations to fall on a sequential comparison basis in the second quarter on lower shipments and higher average scrap costs. Steel Dynamics said that demand from automotive and construction sectors remained strong while the energy sector continued to strengthen, during the quarter.Moreover, the profitability of metals recycling platform is anticipated to remain steady on sequential basis owing to higher average sales price offsetting lower shipments.During the second quarter, the company faced some issues related to the start-up of its new Galvalume and paint line at the Columbus Flat Roll Division. This resulted in increased costs and lesser value-added shipments, which the company expects to reduce its pre-tax earnings by $15 million in the second quarter.Steel Dynamics, Inc.

Current operations[edit]
With a production capacity of 11 million tons, Steel Dynamics is the 4th largest producer of carbon steel products in the United States. SDI is among the most profitable American steel companies in terms of profit margins and operating profit per ton.[2]
History[edit]
Steel Dynamics was founded in 1993 by three former executives of Nucor with $370 million in funding. It began production at its $275 million Butler, Indiana, flat roll mill in 1996 and reported its first annual profit in 1997. The company offered many incentive programs for employees to cut cost and improve standards and outperformed most other steel manufactures during the economic downturn at the turn of the century.[3]
In 2007, Steel Dynamics acquired The Techs, three hot-dip galvanizing plants in Pittsburgh that coat flat-rolled steel,[4] and OmniSource Corporation.[5]
In 2014, Steel Dynamics acquired Severstal Columbus for $1.625 billion. The acquisition increased the company's production capacity to 11 million tons.[6]
In Popular Culture[edit]
In 2012 Richard Sarver, an employee of Steel Dynamics' Roanoke Bar Division, wrote Taking the Heat - A Steelworker's Story, a 271-page memoir based on his 32 years of service at the Roanoke Electric Steel Corporation, which was acquired by Steel Dynamics in 2006.
Controversies[edit]
Price-fixing allegations[edit]
Along with other steel producers, the company was a defendant in a price-fixing lawsuit.[7] The case was settled and Steel Dynamics agreed to pay $4.6 million.[8]

Current operations[edit]
With a production capacity of 11 million tons, Steel Dynamics is the 4th largest producer of carbon steel products in the United States. SDI is among the most profitable American steel companies in terms of profit margins and operating profit per ton.[2]
History[edit]
Steel Dynamics was founded in 1993 by three former executives of Nucor with $370 million in funding. It began production at its $275 million Butler, Indiana, flat roll mill in 1996 and reported its first annual profit in 1997. The company offered many incentive programs for employees to cut cost and improve standards and outperformed most other steel manufactures during the economic downturn at the turn of the century.[3]
In 2007, Steel Dynamics acquired The Techs, three hot-dip galvanizing plants in Pittsburgh that coat flat-rolled steel,[4] and OmniSource Corporation.[5]
In 2014, Steel Dynamics acquired Severstal Columbus for $1.625 billion. The acquisition increased the company's production capacity to 11 million tons.[6]
In Popular Culture[edit]
In 2012 Richard Sarver, an employee of Steel Dynamics' Roanoke Bar Division, wrote Taking the Heat - A Steelworker's Story, a 271-page memoir based on his 32 years of service at the Roanoke Electric Steel Corporation, which was acquired by Steel Dynamics in 2006.
Controversies[edit]
Price-fixing allegations[edit]
Along with other steel producers, the company was a defendant in a price-fixing lawsuit.[7] The case was settled and Steel Dynamics agreed to pay $4.6 million.[8]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
