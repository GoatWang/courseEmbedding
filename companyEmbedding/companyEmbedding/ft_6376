                    This is a quiet community located north of Tampa, but has easy access to all the big city has to offer, now that the new Suncoast parkway (toll road) is completed. This town provides affordable housing , good schools and city services, easy access  to beaches, great dining and entertainment venues. Located approximately 25 miles north of downtown Tampa, many who work in the city commute daily with no problem, but find Springhill to offer some relief from the hustle and bustle of the big city.
