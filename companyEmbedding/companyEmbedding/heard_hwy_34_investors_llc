Description




Sperry Van Ness is very proud to present this exclusive offering of the Polaris Hospital Company(Polaris) Opportunity.  Polaris intends to develop/acquire 6 new rehabilitation/psychiatric hospitals in various locations around the US over the next 24 months to add to their current operations.  Polaris is seeking capital investors and offering attractive returns.  Rehabilitation care and psychiatric care have growing demands for services, and therefore new facilities.  Acute care hospitals are absorbing and converting their rehab/psych beds due to increased demand for acute care beds.  In the next 20 years the number of individuals over the age of 65 will increase by 50% and the number over 85 will nearly triple.  With this elderly population growth, strokes and fractured hips are occuring at increasing rates, and many individuals with these events require inpatient rehabilitation services.  The need is real.  The opportunity is unique.
This offering encompasses multiple projects in multiple locations.  The first project to be released is located in Newnan, GA and has as it's primary service areas Coweta, Carroll, Heard, Troup, and Meriwether Counties.  Secondary Service areas include Pike, Spalding, Upson, Lamar, and Butts Counties.






Highlights

Incredible Growth Niche within Medical Office
Attractive Margins (25-30% EBITDA)
Significant Barriers for Entry by Competition
Increased Demand for Acute Care Beds Drives Demand

Description




This tract is perfect for the weekend getaway, or for a permanent residence. There is a home already on the property. It was built in 1940 and is 1170 sq. ft. It has a nice creek flowing through the property providing a great water source for wildlife. There is a nice stand of pines, along with mature acorn producing hardwoods providing great food and bedding for deer and turkeys. This tract has not been hunted, and would be a great scenario for a next level hunting tract. The seller also has a lot in Alabama that is next to this tract with a small mobile home park. It could also be purchased for rental income. Call Bill Today
