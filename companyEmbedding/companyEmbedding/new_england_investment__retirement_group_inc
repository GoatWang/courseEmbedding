Investments
Investing in the financial markets can help you reach your future dreams of retirement, education or world travel. Whether you already know a lot about the market or you want someone to help you make sense of investing, an Ameriprise financial advisor can help.




IRAs & retirement plans
 Roth and Traditional IRAs offer tax advantages for retirement savings. Find out if it makes sense to consolidate by rolling over the assets in a 401(k) or 403(b) account to an IRA.* Retirement Plan Solutions for businesses can offer tax-deductible contributions and tax-deferred growth opportunities. Through strategic alliances with industry-leading retirement plan providers, Ameriprise advisors are able to provide an array of 401(k) products to meet a wide range of needs.
*Before requesting a rollover or transfer, talk to your financial and tax advisor to be sure that you are considering all the relevant issues.


Mutual funds
Diversify your investments with professionally managed mutual funds. Choose from over 3,500 available mutual funds for efficient and cost-effective money management.


Stocks & exchange traded products (ETPs)
Stocks and ETPs can play a role in a long-term, diversified investment strategy. An Ameriprise financial advisor can help you build a portfolio that works for your immediate needs and your future dreams.


Bonds and individual fixed income securities

Real estate and alternative investments
Ameriprise Financial offers a wide variety of alternative investments that may help you diversify your portfolio.


Managed accounts
A managed account provides access to investment professionals that select and monitor investments based on your investing goals and needs. Choose active involvement in regular account activities or delegate it entirely to investment professionals.


Structured products
Structured products are bundled investments often designed to provide principal protection with market exposure, though some only offer a partial buffer against market performance or no protection at all.


Certificates & rates
A solid investment for your cash reserve needs. Certificates offer guaranteed rates and principal, no account fees with flexible investment options.


Unit investment trusts (UITs)
UITs are professionally-selected securities in a passively managed portfolio that offer access to a variety of investing styles, sectors and asset classes.


Options
Options are complex and sophisticated investments that give the holder the right or the obligation to buy or sell securities at a predetermined price within a set period of time.


Syndicate Offerings

Traditional and Roth IRAs | Ameriprise Financial



Skip to main content
























Traditional and Roth IRAs, rollovers and conversions


Key Points

Traditional and Roth IRAs offer tax advantages and a wide choice of investment options.
Ameriprise Financial offers a special beneficiary restriction for IRAs to control how assets are distributed.
You can consider, by reviewing the potential benefits and risks, a rollover from a 401(k) plan to an IRA. Consult with your advisor to discuss your individual situation.
An individual retirement account (IRA) can supplement your workplace retirement plan and provide an easy way to save for a confident retirement.







Contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA may generate either tax-deferred or tax-free growth on the money you contribute. These earnings are then reinvested into your account and may generate even more earnings.
Traditional and Roth IRAs
There are two primary types of IRAs – Traditional and Roth. Each offers tax advantages and a wide variety of investment choices.
You can choose one or both depending on your tax situation and income, but all IRAs together are subject to the combined contribution limit.

Traditional IRAs are generally funded with pretax contributions and are taxed as ordinary income when withdrawing funds in retirement.
Roth IRAs are always funded with after-tax contributions and are tax free when you withdraw the money in retirement. You must satisfy rules on qualified distributions for the withdrawals to be considered tax-free.

You can make contributions throughout the year or in a lump sum by the contribution deadline (usually the tax return due date — not including extensions — in the following year). Yearly contribution limits are subject to change.
Workplace retirement plan rollovers
If you've changed jobs or recently retired, you may have multiple retirement plans with different providers. A rollover from an old workplace retirement plan to an Ameriprise® IRA may provide you with a more complete picture of your savings for retirement.
Some Ameriprise IRAs also have a unique feature that allows clients to restrict some beneficiaries from using the funds too quickly.
A workplace retirement plan rollover:

Provides greater control over the investment of your retirement assets
Allows a greater range of investment options than most employer retirement plans
May provide more distribution flexibility than an employer plan
Is not subject to a mandatory 20% withholding when rolled directly to an IRA
Provides flexible beneficiary and estate planning options
Maintains tax-deferred status of the account
Sometimes you can even rollover funds while you are still working

However, there are also some scenarios where it may make sense to leave assets in an employer plan. Some advantages to leaving assets in an employer qualified plan may include:

Special tax treatment for a lump sum distribution of appreciated employer stock
No 10% penalty for pre 59½ withdrawals if you leave your employer in the year you turn 55 or later*

	*For certain public safety workers in governmental plans, participants who stop working in the year they turn age 50 or can avoid the 10% penalty and 457(b) plans don’t have a 10% penalty at any age.
	 
Protection of assets from creditors; assets in ERISA qualified plans are protected under federal law while IRA asset protection outside of bankruptcy depends on state law
Access to competitively priced investments





Rollover assets to an IRA while still employed
By using this little known option, you may be able to transfer assets from your workplace 401(k) into a personal IRA while you’re still employed. Ask your advisor to help you explore the pros and cons of an in-service IRA rollover strategy.
Roth IRA conversions
You may want to consider converting a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA.
A Roth IRA offers a number of benefits that are not available with a traditional IRA or other pre-tax retirement plans, including:

Tax-free potential growth
Tax-free withdrawals
No lifetime required minimum withdrawals

A conversion of a pre-tax retirement plan to a Roth IRA is generally taxable in the year of the conversion so it is important to weigh the costs and benefits of a Roth IRA conversion. Consult your tax advisor to determine if a Roth conversion is right for you.
Take the next step
Contact an Ameriprise financial advisor today to learn more about your IRA, rollover and conversion options.

Access to a wide variety of fund families
An Ameriprise financial advisor can help you build a portfolio that's right for you, selecting from more than 3,500 funds from nearly 300 fund companies.

Clients should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of a mutual fund carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other important information about the funds and should be read carefully before investing.

Traditional and Roth IRAs | Ameriprise Financial



Skip to main content
























Traditional and Roth IRAs, rollovers and conversions


Key Points

Traditional and Roth IRAs offer tax advantages and a wide choice of investment options.
Ameriprise Financial offers a special beneficiary restriction for IRAs to control how assets are distributed.
You can consider, by reviewing the potential benefits and risks, a rollover from a 401(k) plan to an IRA. Consult with your advisor to discuss your individual situation.
An individual retirement account (IRA) can supplement your workplace retirement plan and provide an easy way to save for a confident retirement.







Contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA may generate either tax-deferred or tax-free growth on the money you contribute. These earnings are then reinvested into your account and may generate even more earnings.
Traditional and Roth IRAs
There are two primary types of IRAs – Traditional and Roth. Each offers tax advantages and a wide variety of investment choices.
You can choose one or both depending on your tax situation and income, but all IRAs together are subject to the combined contribution limit.

Traditional IRAs are generally funded with pretax contributions and are taxed as ordinary income when withdrawing funds in retirement.
Roth IRAs are always funded with after-tax contributions and are tax free when you withdraw the money in retirement. You must satisfy rules on qualified distributions for the withdrawals to be considered tax-free.

You can make contributions throughout the year or in a lump sum by the contribution deadline (usually the tax return due date — not including extensions — in the following year). Yearly contribution limits are subject to change.
Workplace retirement plan rollovers
If you've changed jobs or recently retired, you may have multiple retirement plans with different providers. A rollover from an old workplace retirement plan to an Ameriprise® IRA may provide you with a more complete picture of your savings for retirement.
Some Ameriprise IRAs also have a unique feature that allows clients to restrict some beneficiaries from using the funds too quickly.
A workplace retirement plan rollover:

Provides greater control over the investment of your retirement assets
Allows a greater range of investment options than most employer retirement plans
May provide more distribution flexibility than an employer plan
Is not subject to a mandatory 20% withholding when rolled directly to an IRA
Provides flexible beneficiary and estate planning options
Maintains tax-deferred status of the account
Sometimes you can even rollover funds while you are still working

However, there are also some scenarios where it may make sense to leave assets in an employer plan. Some advantages to leaving assets in an employer qualified plan may include:

Special tax treatment for a lump sum distribution of appreciated employer stock
No 10% penalty for pre 59½ withdrawals if you leave your employer in the year you turn 55 or later*

	*For certain public safety workers in governmental plans, participants who stop working in the year they turn age 50 or can avoid the 10% penalty and 457(b) plans don’t have a 10% penalty at any age.
	 
Protection of assets from creditors; assets in ERISA qualified plans are protected under federal law while IRA asset protection outside of bankruptcy depends on state law
Access to competitively priced investments





Rollover assets to an IRA while still employed
By using this little known option, you may be able to transfer assets from your workplace 401(k) into a personal IRA while you’re still employed. Ask your advisor to help you explore the pros and cons of an in-service IRA rollover strategy.
Roth IRA conversions
You may want to consider converting a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA.
A Roth IRA offers a number of benefits that are not available with a traditional IRA or other pre-tax retirement plans, including:

Tax-free potential growth
Tax-free withdrawals
No lifetime required minimum withdrawals

A conversion of a pre-tax retirement plan to a Roth IRA is generally taxable in the year of the conversion so it is important to weigh the costs and benefits of a Roth IRA conversion. Consult your tax advisor to determine if a Roth conversion is right for you.
Take the next step
Contact an Ameriprise financial advisor today to learn more about your IRA, rollover and conversion options.

Mutual funds


Key Points

Mutual funds offer the advantage of professional management
Investors in mutual funds may benefit from diversification
Ameriprise Financial offers access to more than 3,500 funds from nearly 300 fund companies







A mutual fund is a company that pools money from many investors and invests the money in stocks, bonds, short-term money market instruments, other securities or assets or a combination of these investments.
Because professional managers provide ongoing supervision of mutual fund holdings, mutual funds can be a quick and efficient means of managing money.
In addition, mutual funds may provide diversification, an important element of a well-rounded investment portfolio.
Access to a wide variety of fund families
An Ameriprise financial advisor can help you build a portfolio that's right for you, selecting from more than 3,500 funds from nearly 300 fund companies.
If you would like to see if a particular mutual fund is available at Ameriprise, search for it by name or ticker using the Mutual Fund Screener tool. You can use the tool to view a complete list of mutual funds and fund families available at Ameriprise.

Clients should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of a mutual fund carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other important information about the funds and should be read carefully before investing. For a free prospectus, which contains this and other important information about each fund, call Ameriprise Financial at 1.800.297.7378.

Save a little more today, 


	  

	  for the things you’ll love forever.

	  
Think about the things you love to do the most. Would you ever want to give them up? That’s the tough financial choice a lot of us could face when we retire. But if we start saving a little more today – even 1% more of our annual income – we could keep doing all the things we love.
It’s all part of Prudential’s goal to help everyone reach their own goals for retirement. We can help with everything from mutual funds to annuities to life insurance. And you can check out our tools for helpful insights on Social Security, ideal places to retire, and more.
Want to see how we can help you? Great – let’s keep going.

How did we calculate this?
 To calculate how many years it might take to spend your guessed amount 
              in retirement, we used your age, years until retirement, and inflation rate 
              of 3%, and average spending data from the 2012 Expenditure Survey.

Based on national spending averages,
$1,500,000 will likely be spent by the age of 76.

 Come up a little short? Guessing how much money you might
            need 
            to save for retirement that could last 30 or 40 years
            is pretty hard. 
            A good place to start: Think about how

For example the FRA for those born in 1955 is 66 and 2 months, for those born in 1956 is 66 and 4months, and so on. Source: http://www.socialsecurity.gov/planners/retire/agereduction.html

Life insurance helps give your family peace of mind if you should die prematurely. But now, it can also help provide more financial security during your retirement, if an unexpected illness happens. A financial professional can show you how.

Delay
Social Security


Consider whether beginning Social Security before your Full Retirement Age (FRA)   is your best option. For some, delaying benefits until at age 66 instead of taking them at 62 could result in 25% higher payments. A guarantee income solution can provide added cash flow while you wait.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
