LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) – A close associate of Jefferson County Board of Education Chairman David Jones Jr. was one of four people who vetted and interviewed candidates for a high-level Jefferson County Public Schools job last year -- despite a state law that prohibits school board members from playing any role in the hiring of district personnel. Tess McNair, who runs the Jones family's $72 million philanthropic foundation, played a significant role last year in the district's hiring of Director of Strategy Jonathan Lowe, according to emails obtained by WDRB News under the Kentucky Open Records Act. McNair, who has at times acted as a self-described representative of Jones to JCPS staff members, helped narrow the field of candidates for the position, formulated questions, interviewed finalists and consulted with Superintendent Donna Hargens about whom to pick, emails show. A state law – part of the sweeping Kentucky Education Reform Act of 1990 – says school board members can be removed from office for “attempt(ing) to influence the hiring of any school employee” other than the superintendent and the board's attorney. Jones, a prominent businessman who was first elected to school board in 2012, acknowledged in an interview that he works “very closely” with McNair but flatly denied having any “involvement or information” in the hiring of the director of strategy. No one told him who had applied for the position or which candidates were interviewed, Jones said. He added that he has “no connection” to Lowe – the person who ultimately got the job. “My sole interest in that context was in seeing that the position was filled,” Jones said. McNair did not respond to numerous requests via phone and email by WDRB News for an interview.  Hargens said Friday she isn't concerned about McNair's connection to Jones and the role she played in the hiring. “Tess McNair is a community member leader who assisted with the process,” Hargens said. "It doesn't concern me at all because I know the process was fair." But Richard Beliles, state chairman of Common Cause Kentucky, a non-profit organization that works to promote open and honest state and local government, said the situation could at least create an “appearance problem.” Beliles requested to be informed of the circumstances without being given the names of the individuals involved. “It sounds to me as though this person didn't break the law by sitting in himself, (but) one could assume, or venture to say, he did it vicariously by having a member of his foundation do it,” Beliles said. "Regardless of the personalities involved, it doesn't appear right." Without commenting on the issue involving Jones, Kentucky School Boards Association spokesman Brad Hughes said it's important for school board members to be aware that, by law, they are “very restricted in the area of personnel” and to err on the side of caution. “Just because there is a business relationship between a board member and someone who is serving in some advisory capacity doesn't mean that there is influence going on,” he said. “But allegations can be made, concerns can be raised. If (a board member) were to ask us, we would say, stay away.”Jones: McNair 'in no sense' his representativeMcNair is executive director of the C. E. and S. Foundation, which provides about $3 million annually in grants to dozens of nonprofit organizations around Louisville. Jones' father, Humana Inc. co-founder David A. Jones, is the foundation's president. McNair joined the foundation in 2010 following seven years at Humana, where she was in strategic and communications roles before becoming special advisor to the chairman of the board during the end of David Jones Jr.'s tenure as chairman, according to McNair's LinkedIn profile. A Vanderbilt University graduate, she has also worked for Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina and the Hospital Corporation of America. David Jones Jr. is the C. E. and S. Foundation's treasurer and one of its three officers, according to its 2013 tax return. Jones said his role in the foundation is limited to overseeing its investments and grants. While acknowledging he has “influence” in the small family organization, he said it's his father who, as president, has the final say on whom the organization employs. McNair is “in no sense my proxy or representative,” Jones said.  But when Jones held a JCPS “community conversation” on Sept. 9, emails show that McNair helped coordinate it. She informed JCPS staff that the event would be at Atherton High School, outlined a rough agenda and asked which JCPS staff members would attend, “so that David will know who he can draw upon for greater detail that evening.” Four days prior, on Sept. 5, McNair sent an email to Helene Kramer, who had just been named the district's chief communications officer, to introduce herself and say, “I work closely with David Jones Jr. on all things related to his engagement with education.”  And when McNair first offered to lend JCPS a hand in picking the director of strategy, she made it clear to Hargens that her interest was prompted by a conversation with Jones. In a July 15, 2013 email, McNair wrote to Hargens: “David and I were speaking last week about the opening you have for a director of strategy. The description you've developed is certainly my professional sweet spot. If there is anything I can do to be helpful to you as you consider the nuances of the role, the ideal candidate and the relationship you'll build with the person you hire so that you will work in close partnership together, please let me know. As well, if you need an external member for your interview team of candidates for your pipeline, let me know. I'm happy to help.” Asked if he suggested that McNair get involved in the hiring process, Jones said:  “I don't think I did."  “But Tess' position as executive director of the C.E. and S. Foundation is one that has her deeply involved in working with most of the education organizations in the city," Jones said. "It's a typical thing for her to be asked to provide technical assistance."Jones said it's "not appropriate to say that Tess is my representative in my work as a member of the school board."When WDRB News asked Jones why McNair uses his name in her emails to district officials, he said he didn't understand the issue."Tess and I are partners in a lot of education work," he said. "We work very closely together. But I am missing the issue here." Records show that Hargens made McNair part of the four-person committee that waded through candidate resumes and interviewed finalists for the position over the following year. Lowe was named the district's director of strategy in September 2014. He declined to comment for this story.According to the district's job description, the director of strategy is the superintendent's “representative and ambassador to external constituencies as directed.” Lowe is making $114,927 this school year.Besides Hargens and McNair, the interview committee consisted of JCPS ombudsman Mindy Eaves and Tony Peyton, who at the time was director of policy for Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer. Peyton now works for the C.E. and S. Foundation and did not return a phone call for comment.  Hargens said it's common for outside community members with relevant professional backgrounds to serve on district hiring committees. She cited an organizational review of JCPS in 2011 that found problems with the district's hiring processes. “Administrators themselves said they didn't feel like we had an effective process that was fair and equitable,” Hargens said. Now, “every time I do an interview process, I use an outside community member that brings credibility and expertise.”Law designed to prevent nepotism, micromanagement Before the 1990 education reform act, Kentucky had no prohibition on school board members exerting influence on district hiring, leading to problems with nepotism and micromanagement, Hughes said.  “There were a number of districts where the family members of board members were hired,” Hughes said. “So they put in language that prohibited board members from having any role in any other personnel except the superintendent and board attorney.” WDRB News consulted several attorneys who work with school boards across Kentucky, but none were willing to offer an opinion about a situation involving Jones. Hughes said it's “a very good question” whether, in general, a school board member could be involved in hiring decisions through a proxy – one that apparently has not been raised before. “We've never heard of an allegation – that doesn't mean it hasn't happened, it just hasn't been brought to our attention,” he said, adding “it may not be illegal, but it could be unethical.” Jones said McNair's involvement in the hiring process represents nothing but her fulfilling part of her responsibility at the C. E. and S. Foundation to be “deeply involved” in improving local education. “There is a big community of people who are working from many different angles to improve the whole pipeline of education,” he said. “I'm one of those people. Tess McNair is one of those people." Reporter Antoinette Konz can be reached at 502-585-0838 or @tkonz on Twitter.Copyright 2015 WDRB News. All rights reserved.

David is one of the leading venture capitalists in mid-America and a well-respected voice in healthcare business and innovation. He founded Chrysalis in 1993, after realizing that the absence of resident venture capital managers in Mid-America represented an opportunity to find and partner with promising growth companies in the region. He currently focuses primarily on healthcare investing and chairs the management company and funds’ investment committees.
At Chrysalis, David has worked over the years with some of the most exciting growth companies in the Midwest and South, including Appriss (sold to Bain Capital), Advanced Academics (sold to Devry), Tritel (merged with Telecorp and sold to AT&T Wireless), Regent Communications (sold to Jacor Communications which was sold to Clear Channel Communications), ActaMed (merged with Healtheon and then with WebMD), Tech Republic (sold to Gartner Group) and High Speed Access Corp (IPO and later sold to Charter Communications).
In addition, David has served on the Board of Directors of Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) since 1993, serving as Vice Chairman from 1996 to 2005 and as Chairman from 2005 to 2010.
David brings a strong and well-rounded background in business, law and banking to his work at Chrysalis Ventures. Prior to Chrysalis, David’s law practice included both domestic and international work, the latter with the U.S. Department of State Legal Adviser’s (general counsel’s) office in Washington (1988-1992). Before law school, he worked as a commercial banker for Bank of Boston in Hong Kong, New York and Boston.
David has a BA from Yale University and a JD from Yale University Law School.
David is active in civic and charitable affairs on both national and local levels. Recognizing the critical role education plays in catalyzing American innovation and competitiveness, as well as its potential to improve public health, David recently served as a member of the Jefferson County Board of Education for four years and also served as chairman for two years in 2015-2016. He is a member of the board of Business Leaders for Education and the invitation-only Healthcare Executive Network, which collectively examines the strategies necessary to create and sustain a world-class healthcare delivery system.
In addition, David is a director of the Humana Foundation, Inc. and is active on the grants committee of a private foundation.  David lectures frequently in Chrysalis’ region on topics related to venture capital and the changing healthcare industry.

Lessons Learned on the School Board

			Posted on December 18, 2016 by David 


JCPS aspires to be the nation’s best urban school district, where every student graduates prepared for life.
Empty words, or serious intent?  My term on the school board has taught me some lessons I’d like to share.
Lesson 1:  Yes, we can!  JCPS knows how to educate today’s struggling kids.  Although only half of JCPS students now leave school ready for today’s competitive world, we know how to improve our schools. In 2015 the school board unanimously adopted a strategy to do so.
At its core the strategy is simple:  Put more trained adults with the kids who need them, and personalize learning to the individual student. That’s it:  Bring more counselors, psychologists, social workers, and teachers into JCPS schools, and empower our teachers to move beyond the drudgery of test prep and maintaining discipline to lead exciting learning.
Lesson 2:  JCPS can pay for needed change without big new taxes, or state or federal help.  Adding more adults to our classrooms will cost money — lots of it.  Unhappily, Louisville can expect little new support from Frankfort, where attention is focused on saving the state’s gasping retirement systems.  And who knows what, if anything, will come from Washington?
Happily, JCPS has the resources in its current budget to add hundreds of new adults to its classroom workforce – if it will change how it spends its money.  Outside studies and audits have for years found that JCPS spends way too much outside of its classrooms.  Unlike her predecessors, Superintendent Hargens, with the support of the board under my leadership, commissioned a detailed study of JCPS compensation (the first since 1979) which identified $60 million per year in non-teacher compensation that exceeds local and peer-district benchmarks.  This painstaking work turned the easy generalities of auditors and critics into a 1000-page report that identifies overspending by line-item and job-category, with an action plan to move money saved into education—without layoffs and with continued raises to keep teacher pay competitive!
Putting $60 million behind its strategy would let JCPS hire 1,000 additional teachers, counselors, psychologists and social workers, in addition to the roughly 7,000 now in these roles.  Or hire a smaller number of professionals and make an enormous investment in training.  No wonder Brent McKim, President of the teachers’ union, tweeted in April that “The good news in the salary review is there is $60 million in admin overhead that can and should be reduced/shifted to support students.”
Lesson 3:  These changes will require political courage—which I fear won’t exist.  Sadly, Mr. McKim’s tweet was the only support he gave to restructuring JCPS in support of classroom teachers.  Within days of the salary study’s release, his teachers union had frightened teachers into marching with other JCPS unions to protest its findings.  Within weeks a campaign to oust the Superintendent was underway.  And when the teachers’ union interviewed candidates for school board this fall, they reserved their support for candidates who pledged to replace the Superintendent.
Union candidates won all three board seats in November.  When the new board convenes in January, five of the seven members will have expressed solidarity with and owe their election to the teachers’ union.
With JCPS employee surrogates in charge of the board, there is no chance that the needed restructuring of non-teacher salaries will occur – and no chance that meaningful new resources will go into JCPS classrooms, where they are desperately needed.
Lesson 4:  If Louisville won’t solve JCPS’ problems, Frankfort will try.  The new reality in Frankfort means that JCPS’ archaic structure will face big challenges. Most consequential for JCPS would be passage of a right-to-work law, which could liberate JCPS students and principals from union rules that put the least experienced teachers in schools with the neediest students and create the highest teacher turnover for students who most need stability in their adult relationships. Charter school legislation also seems certain to pass and is stirring lots of emotion, though only a small percentage of JCPS students would attend a charter.
As the new Republican supermajority in Frankfort focuses on education, the new board’s failure to move the $60 million into our classrooms may invite even stronger intervention.
One final lesson:  Good governance is about results, which requires making tough and sometimes unpopular decisions.  Almost everyone in education cares deeply about children and believes teaching is our society’s most important job. Caring is important – but for the governing board of a big district, care is shown by making hard choices that get results. By budgeting for positive change, not just talking about it. By prioritizing the needs of today’s students over the wants of adults who benefit from this antiquated system—even when those adults engineered or funded board members’ election.
I’m proud of my work with Superintendent Hargens to define a funded pathway to educate all our children.  I urge Louisvillians to insist that our elected officials in Frankfort as well as Louisville see that JCPS improve, as I know it can.






Board Report of David A. Jones, Jr.

			Posted on December 13, 2016 by David 


It’s been an honor to serve on and chair this board.  All of us agree that nothing’s more important than educating Louisville’s children, and I’ve learned from and value my relationships with each of you.  It’s also been a privilege to serve the students and families who are JCPS’ customers, and the 16,000 employees who serve them.  And to work with some great executives, tremendous analysts and unsung heroes in this administration.
One of the realities of chairing a board is that you rarely get to speak in your own voice.  Like other members you have only one vote, but you have the added duty to seek and enunciate consensus or compromise among your colleagues, and to voice the majority view even when it is not your own.
So for the past two years I’ve rarely spoken just for myself.  Since my term as chair is ending, now I will.
We’ve made some progress in the past four years.  Importantly, we allowed the Superintendent to be honest about the appalling reality that less than half of JCPS students attain proficiency during their time in our schools.  We helped her create a strategy to dramatically change this reality by personalizing education to the needs of the individual child.
Even more important, we empowered her to create a plan to fund this strategy, without relying on empty dreams of new state or federal money, or immoral imaginings that our teachers can get better results without more resources and training.
Dr. Hargens’ funding plan responded to the many outside audits that criticized the District for spending too much money on administration, and provided detail on where this money sits in our budget.
This plan is right here.  This is the salary study, the first since 1979, that identifies $60 million that could be moved into our classrooms – with no layoffs, no firings, and with teachers continuing to get step increases and annual raises so their pay stays competitive.  Let me repeat:  No layoffs, and teachers continue to get raises and step increases.
With $60 million JCPS could hire 1000 new professionals:  certified teachers, nurses, social workers, counselors, psychologists.  Or 500 new professionals and a fabulous investment in training.  We could radically change the student-teacher ratio in the schools where kids need it the most, and provide the other professionals who would enable teachers to teach instead of play social worker, or provider of school supplies, or disciplinarian.
There is $60 Million in the book.  It is all here:  A line by line listing of where we find the money in the existing budget. No new money from Frankfort. No charity from Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates.  No extraordinary tax increase.  This is about current JCPS money, which the board has the power to spend on the kids who need it.
All that is needed is the will to restructure our ancient compensation system for the benefit of Louisville’s kids.  This won’t be easy, because it will require moving money to support kids who need it rather than looking out for the wants of adults who band together for the biggest piece of the pie they can grab.
The adults have their voice, through their unions.  Our struggling kids, on the other hand, have much less political clout.  Their only hope is that this board will act to restructure the school system so that it serves them far better than it does today.
You have been handed the knowledge to direct funding to its rightful and most urgently needed place:  The classroom.  The work has been done; it’s in this book.
The voters said they want change.  I wish you the courage and discipline to deliver the success all JCPS students deserve.






What I’ve Been Reading About Education:  The Prize

			Posted on June 2, 2016 by David 


Since I posted the first of series of book reviews on this blog a few weeks ago, Insider Louisville published my review of  Dale Russakoff’s “The Prize: Who’s in Charge of America’s Schools?” (2015), my best, most thought-provoking read of 2015.  I hope you’ll leave comments with your own recommendations of books, articles, podcasts, or other resources that may help inform our dialogue around education in Louisville. You can leave your comments here on my blog or join the conversation on my Facebook page and through Twitter.






What I’ve Been Reading About Education

			Posted on May 16, 2016 by David 



Over the past year or so I’ve found time to read some thoughtful, provocative books about education amidst the daily flood of news and real-time journalism. Several of these influenced my thinking about Louisville’s public schools, and I strongly recommend them to anyone interested in improving education here or elsewhere in the United States.  In addition, two shorter pieces plus one podcast stand out as vital in thinking about Louisville schools’ situation. And more thought-provoking books and stories are being published all the time, so perhaps I’ll update this if useful.
In the coming weeks I’ll be publishing these reviews here on my blog. Feel free to leave comments with your own recommendations of books, articles, podcasts, or anything else that may help inform our dialogue around education in Louisville. You can leave your comments here on my blog or join the conversation on my Facebook and Twitter pages.
Let’s get started.



What I Learned from The Smartest Kids in the World
This week in my What I’ve Been Reading About Education series I review The Smartest Kids in the World, and How They Got That Way, by Amanda Ripley.
Ripley, who now writes for Time Magazine and The Atlantic, says she’d never intended to write about education but got captivated by its “real mystery.” She describes this mystery as intensely frustrating: “Why [are] some kids learning so much—and others so very little?” She then takes the reader on a world tour that gives a powerful answer.
Ripley focused her research on three countries that have achieved extraordinary results over the past several decades from their public schools systems, but are otherwise very different: Finland, South Korea and Poland. Her descriptions of these countries’ journeys are inspiring, and persuade the reader, in a way that raw test data cannot, that U.S. public education has indeed fallen behind.
She adds life to policy descriptions and data by reporting on the experiences of American exchange students in each country, and the U.S. high schools each came from. This makes for interesting reading, sometimes funny and sometimes sad as her “field agents” – the American kids – encounter new ways of doing things and sometimes deep loneliness.
Ultimately, she finds that educators in top-performing countries face challenges quite similar to those in the American context: “politics, bureaucracy, antiquated union contracts and parental blind spots—the surprisingly universal plagues of all education systems everywhere.” What sets apart the nations that have done best in education over the past decades, she finds, is at once softer and harder: citizen commitment to rigor in education.
All major shifts . . . require a feeling that spreads among people like a whispered oath, kitchen table by kitchen table, until enough of them agree that something must be done. . . . All children must learn rigorous higher-order thinking to thrive in the modern world. The only way to do that is by creating a serious intellectual culture in schools, one that kids can sense is real and true.
Her hopeful conclusion is that as more data “spills out” from places where students are achieving, and “students themselves find ways to tell the world how much more they could do,” American students will receive the respect of a rigorous education. As Kentucky’s legislature takes up our new Governor’s call to modify education standards that only recently were finally raised to respect our students’ ability to learn at the level of those in the world’s top ranks, Ripley’s finding is much on my mind.
(Longer reviews appeared here in the Washington Post and New York Times.)







Finding and Funding Improvement

			Posted on May 11, 2016 by David 


At last night’s meeting of the Jefferson County Board of Education I commented on recent concerns within the JCPS community and among broader Louisville stakeholders about possible changes affecting student discipline rules and employee salaries.  Here’s the text of my remarks:
Two weeks ago, members of the Jefferson County Board of Education met in work sessions to discuss the Code of Conduct and the recent Salary Study.  The weeks since then have been difficult for our JCPS community, and I want to say a few words about the board’s perspective as our meeting begins tonight.
My fellow board members and I are distressed that our work sessions have left so many teachers feeling disrespected and undervalued, because nothing could be further from the truth.

We treasure our teachers and their commitment to the students in our district;
We understand how hard they work and that the conditions in schools are often challenging;
We know that a great teacher is worth his or her weight in gold – and while we can’t pay that we intend to maintain a competitive salary structure;
We know that our system of discipline must be improved.
And we are committed to investing in great teachers and safe and well-resourced classrooms because success – for every student – is our highest priority.

We hear the unhappiness with how JCPS has communicated on these topics.
But we took up these topics for important reasons.  And it’s no good pretending that the work will be easy, or taking refuge in calling each other names or blaming our problems on bad communication.
Every member of this board ran for office, and was elected, because we believe our schools must improve.

We are not content with the academic results, which suggest that only half our kids are graduating ready for their future;
We are not content with school climate or discipline, with teachers telling us regularly of eroding standards of student behavior, even as suspension rates rise;
We are not content with the one-size-fits-all environments imposed by standardized testing, even as we value the insights this gives us into gaps within and between our schools;
We are not content with the equity delivered by our schools, with neighborhood, family income, race and other factors correlating so highly with student learning.

The board spent the bulk of 2015 consulting deeply with the community, with national experts, with the teachers’ association, and with other internal stakeholders on how to improve.  These consultations are reflected in our strategy, Vision 2020, which calls for significant change so that JCPS delivers:

Deeper and more personalized learning, beyond what’s measured in today’s bubble tests;
Successful investment in building the capacity of our teachers and principals so they can teach and lead today’s youth;
Staffing our schools and coordinating other services that overcome the social factors that impede so many of our students – including more psychological and behavioral supports in schools;
And more.

Having asked our District leaders to drive change, the board expects them to propose it.  If we’re not content with student behavior, we must be open to hearing and debating new ideas about how to change — that’s what was going on in the Code of Conduct work session.  Having demanded changes that we know cost money, we must be open to proposals about where to find it.  That’s what the Salary Study work session was about.
The elected board together has asked the Superintendent to take on hard issues.  We know it will be messy; after all, there’s no national blueprint for how to succeed in big city public education, no other large urban district whose success we can simply copy.  We wish all the people up here spoke with the tongues of angels, but we, like the District’s executive leadership, are busy people who don’t always find the right words, and sometimes clang like noisy gongs.
So the board respects the concerns of our teachers and regrets the disruption. But we are united behind Vision 2020, which we believe represents the community’s call for improvement in its schools.  And we expect continued focus and tenacity in finding and funding improvement.
One final point. This hard work is made harder when professionals who help shape public opinion don’t share their knowledge of the issues at hand.  I’ve said before how grateful the board is for the small number of media outlets that fund full time paid professional reporters to cover education in Louisville.  I’m still grateful for that.
But just as I praise good reporting when it shines needed light on hidden issues, I want to express my disappointment with the quality of reporting over the last two weeks.  The reporters who sit through every board meeting and work session have a deeper understanding of the board’s work than our teachers and citizens can have. They know, for example, that the board sets its own agenda – a subject on which we’ve spoken ad nauseum this year — and that interim reports and recommendations from community committees don’t lead automatically to board action.  They know JCPS is party to union contracts, and that thoughts about salary are subject to negotiation, not board fiat.
In short, they know there’s a difference between the sausage factory of work sessions and formal recommendations to the board.  And yet both reporting and silences over the past two weeks have frightened our teachers and enraged our community by creating the impression that action was imminent to cut salaries and weaken standards for behavior and discipline. This was never the case, and I ask our colleagues in the Fourth Estate to think not just of likes and followers and retweets, but of the community they serve.






Budgeting for Excellence With Equity

			Posted on January 25, 2016 by David 


It’s that time of year again:  JCPS is starting to put together its budget.  As always, this is a complicated, technical undertaking, involving predictions about how strong the local economy will be (which affects how much local tax revenue will come in) and how many students will enroll (which affects how much state money the District will receive), as well as guesswork about what our friends in Frankfort and Washington might choose to spend.
This is also the time of year when the first steps toward spending commitments are made and the District determines spending levels for schools. Later stages of the budget process will consider spending on central services, human resources, facilities and all other JCPS activities; the process starts with school level spending because that’s what Kentucky law and the practicalities of the calendar require.
What’s unusual this year is that the early, technical stage of budgeting has attracted a lot of attention and discussion, both among JCPS principals and central administrators, and in the broader public.  I think this is a really good thing; let me explain.
 
Improving the Budget Process
For years, JCPS budgeting and spending have been shrouded in mystery and nearly impenetrable.  Multiple outside audits have criticized the District for a lack of clarity in how spending was tied to claimed objectives, and criticized the school board for not understanding the budgets it approved.  The District has taken those recommendations to heart and changed its process to allow for more transparency and input – all good things.
The District created a “Citizen Transparency” website (accessible here) that lets any citizen view, at any time, budgeted and actual spending at both the school and District level, with the ability to drill into contracts and even individual employee’s salaries.  The board established a working group that included community experts to help map out the budgeting process and shine light on how money decisions are made, and hired a new Chief Business Officer to drive alignment between spending and goals.
We’re starting to see the fruits of these efforts. For the first time since I’ve been on the board, I’ll have the opportunity to vote at the beginning of the process on spending choices that I understand, after several clear presentations from JCPS’ finance team and healthy input from colleagues and the public.  For the first time I have a clear understanding at this stage of budgeting of which costs are truly fixed (by law or contract), and which are discretionary in the sense that they might be shifted to different priorities.
This very real progress has resulted in passionate debate about where and how JCPS spends its money at the school level:  Should all schools have the same student:teacher ratios?  How much flexibility should reside with site-based councils versus central decision-makers?  Are there teachers in non-classroom positions, or extra administrators, whose time would be better spent elsewhere?
These are hard, important questions.  Healthy organizations engage in this sort of debate at budget time with intensity and zeal, so that the clash of defending the status quo and proposing change yields better results than either centralized diktat or decentralized inertia.   I’m seeing more intensity this year, and I believe that is healthy.   (The only unhealthy piece has been some confusion and misinformation about whether spending is being “cut,” which it emphatically is not – spending on teachers will rise under all contemplated budget scenarios.)
Later this year the budget process will consider other areas of spending – central services, human resources, facilities – with the focus on aligning every dollar of spending to the District’s improvement strategy via “zero base” review, so it’s important that the District strengthen this healthy capacity to make tough budget decisions.
 
So What?
Those still awake after these comments on the inside baseball of budgeting are surely asking, “So what? Why should we care, and why on earth should we be pleased that the budget has created more commotion this year?”
We should care because developing a budget is the first step in executing the District’s strategy for reaching the more-than-half of its students who today are not getting a good enough education.  This strategy, just adopted in December and framed in the words “Vision 2020:  Excellence With Equity,” calls for doing things differently in order to get different results.
This strategy (which I wrote about here) calls for moving beyond standardized academic testing to evaluate and teach students; for adding resources in children’s early years so that all read on grade level by the end of third grade; for personalizing education, especially to overcome the impact of social factors like poverty that challenge so many students; and more.  I believe, with all my fellow board members, that this strategy can change many lives for the better and change the trajectory of our school system as a whole.
But strategies come to life only if real people, with real salaries, are tasked with action.  And this means the strategic initiatives require money.
JCPS can get money in two ways:  It can bring in new money or reinvest money it’s been spending elsewhere.  Ideally we’d do both – but no one I know expects Frankfort or Washington to step in to fund Louisville’s priorities in the near term.  Nor are board members’ inboxes filled at tax time with pleas to raise taxes to improve our schools.
If we want Vision 2020 to be more than pretty words on paper, Louisville must take the lead on Louisville’s needs.  We have to evolve and move our money to solve our problems.  Our students and our city’s future depends on JCPS’ improvement.






Public Engagement Matters

			Posted on February 15, 2015 by David 


WDRB reported today (http://bit.ly/1BeQcae) that my colleague Tess McNair participated in an advisory committee that helped Superintendent Hargens hire a JCPS executive, and that this is improper. Here are my thoughts.
I value aggressive reporting about all our public institutions.  Sunshine is the best disinfectant, and citizens owe a debt of gratitude to the reporters who dig into facts and work to connect the dots.  In addition, I support the legal provisions and legislative intent regarding anti-nepotism and non-interference with management duties as it relates to school board members.
That said, I see nothing improper here.  If my colleagues on the board, at the Kentucky School Boards Association or others have different views or concerns, I welcome them. If there’s an actual error here, I will correct it. But here are the facts:
Superintendent Hargens has regularly sought input and guidance from qualified community leaders to help her interview and hire strong executives. She brought non-JCPS employees into the interview process in response to a scathing third-party review of Central Office staffing that found JCPS administrative leadership to be insular and inbred and noted that “employment processes are widely perceived as discriminatory in favor of friends or relatives.” http://bit.ly/17DfjqJ, pp. 10-12.
Tess advised Dr. Hargens in this context, and the process resulted in the appointment of an executive with whom I have no work history or any other relationship.  Although Tess informed me that she had volunteered to help, and Dr. Hargens told me that Tess was on the advisory committee, I had no information about or involvement with the applicants or the selection process.
I thank Tess for her tireless work in support of JCPS, JCTC, Simmons College, Business Leaders for Education, 55,000 Degrees, and all the other Louisville education institutions with which she’s engaged.  She’s a pro, I’m blessed to have her as a colleague, and in my view Louisville is fortunate she’s taken on the mission we share:  Improving education outcomes in Louisville.
My deepest concern here is that a story that depicts a highly qualified member of Louisville’s education improvement community as a minion and “proxy,” and implies that civic engagement is somehow shameful, will cause other talented community leaders to think twice about working with the ancient structure that is JCPS.  That would be a shame.
Just as sunlight is the best disinfectant, outside pressure is essential for JCPS to improve.  Keep pushing!






Setting the Course to Become America’s Best Urban Public School District

			Posted on January 13, 2015 by David 


I am honored that my colleagues elected me Chair of the Jefferson County Board of Education last night, and look forward to continuing the board’s work on behalf of enhancing student learning.  Here’s the rough text of remarks I delivered at last night’s board meeting:
I want to thank my fellow board members for their trust and support. As I take on this role, I am keenly aware that as a School Board we have a major responsibility to the public.  Simply put, the governance this body provides, the expectations we set, and the priorities we pursue set the tone for the system as a whole and create the conditions under which our superintendent, principals, and teachers can ensure that all students learn.
Our newly constituted board finds itself at a real inflection point.  The District in some ways is hitting its stride, with annual gains in student achievement moving us from Kentucky’s 6th percentile in 2010 to the 51st percentile last year.  These increases in academic success are historic, and very unusual nationally for big urban districts.  We also inherit from our predecessor board a strong, positive relationship of partnership and candor with Dr. Hargens, our Superintendent.  I thank our colleague Diane Porter and our former colleagues for these crucial elements of strength on which this board can build.
Yet every member of this board sought election because we know we must do better.  We know that even with improvement spelled out in state accountability tests, less than half our students are proficient in reading and math.  We know that at each board meeting we sit in front of this reminder that JCPS is “Shaping the Future.”  And we know that, as the Superintendent was told by a community leader when she arrived, “as JCPS goes, so goes Louisville” –if our students don’t thrive, our community cannot prosper in the years ahead.
The Superintendent and board have driven progress to date by executing a strategy called “Vision 2015.”  During our new member orientation sessions following the November election, Dr. Hargens made two things very clear: First, we are in the midst of the “execution phase” of Vision 2015, where performance on the strategy’s basic elements should drive further improvement.  And second, “doing what we’ve done to get us here won’t get us where we want to go from here.”  That is, new strategies and tactics are needed to achieve our vision of every student graduating prepared for life, or to get us to our broad goal of becoming the best urban district in America.  Dr. Hargens has called on the board to work with her, starting immediately, in building a new “Vision 2020.”
From conversation with each of you, I know that the sense of the board is that we are up for this, and we intend not only to ask for the District to change as necessary to bring students to higher levels of learning, but to change our own practices as needed.
In accepting the position as Chair, I commit to you, my colleagues, that I have heard, loud and clear, the sense of the board that we must improve the way we do our business so that we can do well in all three of the essential elements of governing a big organization through change:  monitoring operational improvement, driving strategic vision and goal-setting, and assuring compliance.  In conversation, I have learned that all of us are determined to do more than sit in headquarters and monitor compliance.  We know we need to find time to question and learn so that we are adequately prepared for the decisions that lie ahead, and to create the accountability that will empower the change agents in our schools and management team who reach our students.
So here are three structural changes I will work to see us implement to ensure the board’s time is aligned with what we are seeking from the District:
First, we will change the location of our meetings to bring us into the schools at least once per month — starting with our next meeting, which I propose take place at Valley High School on January 26.  This change of venue has several goals:  To enliven and broaden the board’s contact with the community, to highlight the strengths and challenges of our schools, and to create shared experiences in the schools that will strengthen board understanding and decision-making.
Second, we will form ourselves into project-based teams to work with the Superintendent and senior leadership to dive deeper into key issues and help us create deeper board understanding around critical strategic drivers.  In JCPS parlance, think of these as board “professional learning communities.”  Initial teams are:

Finance:  What data does the board require to be effective at setting and intelligently monitoring progress toward reallocating dollars to the programmatic and instructional practices that accord with our goal?
Technology Utilization: What new competencies must the District build to serve 21st Century stakeholders, and how can the board set goals and measure progress as these competencies are built?  Possible examples include how the board can ensure that the District is moving effectively and rapidly, in this digital age, to modernize customer service and to empower constituents with clear information and e-commerce capabilities that make choosing schools and scheduling services more accessible to all our families.
Policy and pedagogy:  With our policy manual largely up to Kentucky standards, what new policy issues must the District confront, and how can the board ensure that we adopt the best framework for today’s learners?   For example, do we need to be looking beyond test scores to assess deeper learning, and if so, how? Is JCPS teacher training up to the task of helping teachers grapple with new technologies and social realities invest in modernizing professional development?

The third change relates to the quality of our work together as board and management. The board learned last February from an audit of board time that, compared to high performing school boards, we spend too much time on “management inquiry” and not enough on “goal monitoring.”  This board is determined to change that – but we need support from our colleagues in management.  To help us avoid deep dives into micromanagement, we must ask you to enhance both the quality and the candor of your presentations.  We need your reporting to focus on clear analysis of progress toward JCPS’ goals.  Don’t just share data with us:  tell us what it means and what you recommend we should do about it.  Know that we will have read your submissions ahead of time, through our wonderful board portal, so don’t read your slides to us:  share additional insights, or just summarize and invite questions.
In closing, I am confident that JCPS has a great year ahead.  I thank each of my colleagues for your service on this board and your confidence in me as chair, and I express the board’s excitement about working with the wonderful leadership and people of JCPS as we move forward to execute on the basics; to fix or eliminate what’s not working or no longer relevant; and to celebrate, learn from and proliferate what’s working well!






WFPL Misses the Point About School Board

			Posted on November 2, 2014 by David 


I applaud WFPL for its coverage of education in Louisville, and I’m grateful that on Friday the station attempted to explain to voters what they elect school board members to do.  (“When You Vote For a School Board, What Are You Voting For?“) 
That said, I have rarely read a better example of getting the details right but missing the point.
Of course board members do the things WFPL describes:  follow rules and procedures, hire the superintendent, approve contracts, educate themselves about the issues, and listen to constituents and share their concerns.
Left out, though, is the fundamental duty of board members under Kentucky’s Constitution to serve as “trustees” for the voters in “provid[ing] for an efficient system of common schools.”  Like board members for private non-profit or for-profit corporations, but unlike legislators or Metro Council members, school board members are fiduciaries, bound to use their best judgment to see that the District delivers on its duty to provide education efficiently and effectively.
This means that board members’ duty extends beyond “checking the box” of complying with regulations, beyond learning about policy, beyond the satisfaction, fun and frustration of talking with parents and teachers, and beyond the passive task of listening to management reports. 
Where an organization is not delivering on its duty to the voters — as JCPS, despite encouraging progress, still is not — board members must focus on the barriers to delivery, and require that management lead whatever change is necessary.
With less than half of JCPS students qualifying as “proficient” in the most recent state evaluation, sharpening the District’s focus is clearly the board’s next task.
 






JCPS Financial Transparency Improving

			Posted on October 14, 2014 by David 


The usually dry and technical business of overseeing school budgets generated some controversy over the last several months:

On May 21, Kentucky’s State Auditor reported that JCPS spent less in the classroom than comparable public school districts, maintained a “bloated” administrative structure, and was governed by a board that neither understood District finances nor demanded information to help it do so.
One week later, two school board members (including me) voted against adoption of a proposed JCPS budget on the grounds that management’s presentation, due to a lack of standard financial analysis like trend data or tying shifts in spending within large categories to the board’s strategic plan, did not adequately facilitate a critical evaluation of the proposed budget.

In the five months since the State Auditor’s report, JCPS has taken several noteworthy steps toward improvement from that low point.

On June 23, Superintendent Hargens proposed, and the board approved, a set of responses to the deficiencies reported by the State Auditor.  Most responses called for change in procedures or quality of administrative work, and all identified both a deadline and the executive(s) responsible for delivering.
On August 25, the board considered the tax rate for the coming year.   Unlike a year earlier, JCPS management presented a clear case for the amount of revenue needed to fund plans for the coming year. The Superintendent and her CFO made clear that an improving economy coupled with additional state appropriations were producing new revenue (to the tune of 3.5%-or $34mm–above the prior year) at current tax rates, and recommended that no rate increase was needed.  The board unanimously approved this recommendation.
In early September, Dr. Hargens announced a “citizen transparency” website that will enable anyone to dig through JCPS financial data, including both spending in each school and the actual salary of every JCPS employee by name and title.  JCPS’ original announcement projected the tool to go live by the end of September and, although software implementation issues seem to have delayed the start-date it’s my expectation that this tool will bring many new eyes and analytical skills to considering how our education dollars are spent.
Finally, on September 22, Dr. Hargens and her team presented the 2014-15 budget to the school board in a new format that included, for the first time, trend analysis for major categories of spending, and a narrative that tied spending decisions to District strategy. I joined the rest of the board in unanimously adopting this budget.

It’s clear to me that JCPS has made important changes both to improve the transparency of its finances and to sharpen how the analytical skills of its executives are applied to finding and deploying funding for our schools.  The work of Superintendent Hargens and CFO Cordelia Hardin, along with other leaders, has given me new insight into several important facts and trends about our school system.
For instance, management’s clearer presentation of financial facts shows that spending in schools has grown significantly (5.5% per year since 2010!), and faster than overhead spending (shown to have grown at 4.4% per year).  Using management’s numbers from this year’s budget presentation (CFO’s PowerPoint of 9/22/14), the following graph shows spending growth over the past five years, plus the just-adopted budget.

This helpful analysis shows an astounding increase – $220 million! — in annual spending on “schools and support” between 2010 and 2015, whereas spending on “business office and overhead” increased by $15 million.  Dr. Hargens’ freeze on central office hiring and movement of several hundred teachers from central positions back into the schools as “Goal Clarity Coaches” likely explains the relative slowdown in overhead spending.
However (and appropriately), new and important questions have also crystallized thanks to this welcome increase in transparency:
First, the categorization of only 7.5% of JCPS expenses as “business offices” or “overhead” conflicts sharply with the State Auditor’s finding that only 53% of JCPS spending was on “instruction.”  It is obvious that financial officers at different levels — State Auditor’s office and local school district — disagree sharply on how to categorize expenses.  The onus is on JCPS to explain itself in the face of the Auditor’s aggressively different interpretation if citizens and board members are to have confidence in the seemingly positive story told in the graph above.
Second, the fact that spending from the General Fund has grown at 5.4% per year since 2010 fairly begs for questioning of the frequent contention that our schools are “underfunded.” At the same time, inclusion of rapidly rising payments under state pension and health benefit plans in the “schools and support” category may mask how Frankfort’s past mismanagement of retirement obligations siphons funds today from the District.  The role of state pension and health benefit payments is a subject I need to learn more about due to its potentially monumental impact on future budgets.
Third, it is now clear that District management considers the end goal of its financing activity to be equitable allocation of funds to school councils, i.e. the “School-Based Decision Making” councils called SBDMs.  This is highlighted in the organization of the new Budget Booklet, which directed primary attention to “Allocations to School Councils” and to “School-Added” categories.
I found this narrative quite striking, since virtually none of the board’s work involves reviewing the efficacy or efficiency of these councils, or the Principals they select, in achieving the District’s mission.  The lack of such oversight is highlighted by the fact that, despite the great effort and history which lies behind the board’s attempt to fund individual school councils adequately and equitably, student outcomes still vary widely both between and within schools.  The State Auditor’s attention to teachers’ spending of personal funds on school supplies called attention to school-level decisions to spend District supply allocations on other things (or not at all), and others have pointed out that some school councils choose not to spend District funds allocated for textbooks, to “trade out” teacher positions for teaching assistant positions, or to take other steps that are at odds with District strategy.
As a school board member, I have found the allocation of authority between central office and school councils confusing and a frequent source of blame-shifting.  Our new budget narrative invites attention to this issue.  What data does JCPS have on the effectiveness of school-level leadership, and what tools do we deploy where this leadership is not getting the job done?  How should the elected board hold management accountable when decision-making authority is disbursed, and sometimes opaque, under state law and practice?
In sum, I believe JCPS has made important progress since the State Auditor’s constructive report, and as a board member I acknowledge the difficult and creative work that has gone into rethinking how to tell the complex financial story of this big organization.  All involved agree that steps to date are only the beginning, and that further improvement is both possible and required.  My hope and expectation is that ever better analysis will sharpen the focus on how to direct spending to best serve our kids.

            COMMENTEMAILMOREDinner conversations have gotten more lively around Mary Gwen Wheeler and David Jones Jr.'s dining room table since Jones decided a couple years ago to run for the Jefferson County Board of Education.Debates on teacher quality, school choice, funding or parental involvement have increasingly been served up along with the main course, with the two education advocates at times heatedly discussing best practices, policies and ways forward.Wheeler draws on her perspective as a member of the Kentucky Board of Education and as executive director of 55,000 Degrees when offering her take. Jones is influenced by his business background and his work on the county's school board."We chew it over and argue," Wheeler said.While the two may at times be coming from different viewpoints, the couple have long shared a passion for education and a belief that a high-quality public education is fundamental to improving the community. Their drive has put the two at the center of education conversations in Louisville and Kentucky."They are out on the bow of the ship shaping institutional direction," said Rowan Claypool, program director for Teach Kentucky and longtime friends with Wheeler and Jones.55,000 Degrees: encouraging news, but work left to doHe said their interest and involvement in education has been an "evolution" over the course of their careers and as they've worked to help their community. "They've been led to one of the biggest issues in the community: education attainment," Claypool said.Sharon Darling, president and founder of the National Center for Families Learning, said the perspectives the couple brings to education are in part what makes them so valuable, with Jones' experience in business and governance and Wheeler's knowledge of management, nonprofits and social justice. Darling also knows Jones and Wheeler well; Wheeler worked at NCFL for about a decade after she and Jones moved to Louisville in the early 1990s."They're a power couple that uses their power in the right way," Darling said.Both Jones and Wheeler eschew the idea of being an education power couple; they say the term can get twisted or bring up unpleasant connotations, and they say they've been interested in education since they were young.Yet there's no denying the two play important roles in shaping education policy in Louisville and the state.Jones last month was elected chairman of the Jefferson County Board of Education, which wrangles a $1.3 billion budget — the second-largest budget in the state, behind only the state itself. Wheeler, who is also on the statewide advocacy group Prichard Committee for Academic Excellence, has seen her 55,000 Degrees initiative bring increased scrutiny to the number of college-educated workers in Louisville.When they metWheeler and Jones met freshman year at Yale in English class, but didn't start dating until senior year.Both took teaching fellowships abroad after college — Jones taught in Hunan Province in China while Wheeler taught in Hong Kong.Both say the experiences teaching abroad profoundly impacted them and shaped their views on education. Wheeler saw firsthand how education "can be an equalizer for those born into circumstances with a lot of barriers."Jones, who showed up in China shortly after the Cultural Revolution, during which schools across the country were shut down and many students were dispatched to rural areas, saw how a "yes-we-can attitude" helped rebuild the education system following a "paroxysm of craziness.""There were pockmarks in the buildings from bullets. ... There was no glass in the windows, no heat or air conditioning," Jones said. Yet, he said, students came to learn. "Louisville hasn't had anything that bad," he said.Goldsmith Elementary names Jeremy Renner as principalAfter the fellowships and some time traveling around Southeast Asia, the two came back to the States. After short stints working, both decided to go back to Yale so Wheeler could get a master's degree in management and Jones could go to law school.The early daysThey got married in 1986. They had their first child in 1989, while in Washington, D.C., where they had moved so Jones could work in the State Department's general counsel office and Wheeler could consult with USAID and work with International Executive Service Corp. Their second child came two years later.Buy Photo (Photo: Matt Herp, Special to the C-J)Jones had grown up in Louisville, where his father, David Jones Sr., had founded and built Humana Inc.Jones said he'd always loved Louisville, so after he and Wheeler consulted, they decided to move there in 1992."There's no chance we would have moved to Louisville if there was not strong public education," Jones said. Wheeler added that, at that time, Kentucky was being seen as a leader in education reform, with the recent passage of the Kentucky Education Reform Act.Jones did a short stint at a local law firm before opening Chrysalis Ventures, a venture capital company. He has served on Humana's board of directors since 1993, serving at various points as vice-chair and chairman.Wheeler became ever-more involved in education and family issues. She served as education adviser, among other duties, under then-Louisville Mayor Jerry Abramson from 2003 to 2010. In June 2010, Gov. Steve Beshear appointed her to the Kentucky Board of Education.Jones said he'd continued teaching in a number of different capacities through the years, whether that was teaching Sunday school or university classes. And he'd been involved in education initiatives, including being on the executive committee of the Business-Higher Education Forum.Taking the challengeHe said he'd gotten disillusioned with progress in education, especially after seeing how, despite investments like the Every 1 Reads initiative, JCPS was ranked in the 6th percentile in the state. But during a conference, Jones heard Houston Mayor Annice Parker talk about how "nobody with any throw weight gets involved in education."That galvanized Jones to run for school board, winning the District 2 seat and taking over from Steve Imhoff, who did not seek re-election.Stu Silberman, executive director of the Prichard Committee, said Jones has already made an impact on the board. He noted that, on his very first meeting as board chair, Jones got the board to start hosting some of its meetings at schools instead of district headquarters."He's going to speak up when he believes it's important to do that as the right thing for kids," Silberman said. "So is Mary Gwen. ... These are two folks who are dedicating their lives to improving Kentucky."Wheeler said what she and Jones have learned is that "you can't separate an interest in education outcomes from a desire to improve the community." She said that's something cities and businesses must understand: "What used to be 'location, location, location' for businesses is now 'education, education, education.'"Meyzeek students' app idea wins national honorJones said the successes help motivate him. He said one of the Chinese students he once taught is now a respected doctor; Jones said he called that student for advice when he had a friend diagnosed with cancer recently."We believe we can have an impact. We believe the education structure can really improve," Jones said.Claypool said everything Jones and Wheeler have experienced, from their work to raising their own children, has contributed to their passion for education."Now there's a very challenging task of how to apply all that in a way that will move the needle," he said.Reporter Allison Ross can be reached at (502) 582-4241.
