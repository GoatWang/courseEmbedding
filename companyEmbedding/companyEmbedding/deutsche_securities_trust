In connection with the acquisition of Zurich Scudder by Deutsche Bank AG,       
Deutsche Bank AG will be consolidating its investment operations. In this       
regard, shareholders of the Fund recently approved a new subadvisory agreement

be moved among Deutsche advisory affiliates and, in the future, the Fund's      
advisor will seek approval from the Fund's Board to implement this subadvisory  
relationship with DeAMIS. During the interim period prior to the implementation

become employees of DeAMIS, and act as consultants to the Fund's advisor, under

The Fund's Main Investment Strategy                                             

Effective July 1, 2002, the following changes are being made to the section     
entitled "The Fund's Main Investment Strategy" for each fund noted below.       

For Scudder Capital Growth Fund only, the following replaces the third sentence 
of the first paragraph:                                                         

Although the fund can invest in companies of any size, it generally focuses on  
established companies that are similar in size to the companies in the S&P 500  
Index (as of 12/31/01, the S&P 500 Index had a median market capitalization of  
$8.20 billion).                                                                 

For Scudder Growth Fund only, the following replaces the second paragraph:      

The fund normally invests at least 65% of total assets in common stocks of large
U.S. companies that are similar in size to the companies in the Russell 1000    
Growth Index (as of 12/31/01, the Russell 1000 Growth Index had a median market 
capitalization of $3.58 billion).                                               

For Scudder Large Company Growth Fund only, the following replaces the first    
paragraph:                                                                      

The fund seeks long-term growth of capital by investing, under normal           
circumstances, at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings
for investment purposes, in large U.S. companies that are similar in size to the
companies in the Russell 1000 Growth Index (as of 12/31/01, the Russell 1000    
Growth Index had a median market capitalization of $3.58 billion).              

For Scudder Managed Municipal Bonds only, the following replaces the first two  
sentences of the first paragraph:                                               

The fund seeks to provide income exempt from regular federal income tax while   
actively seeking to reduce downside risk as compared with other tax-free income 
funds. It does this by investing at least 80% of net assets, plus the amount of 
any borrowings for investment purposes, in securities of municipalities across  
the United States and in other securities whose income is free from regular     
federal income tax.                                                             

For Scudder Medium-Term Tax-Free Fund only,                                     

The following replaces the second sentence of the first paragraph:              

Under normal circumstances, the fund invests at least 80% of net assets, plus   
the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in securities of          
municipalities across the United States and in other securities whose income is 
free from regular federal income tax and alternative minimum tax (AMT).         

The following replaces the first sentence of the fourth paragraph:              

Although the managers may adjust the fund's dollar-weighted average maturity    
(the maturity of the fund's portfolio), they will normally keep it between three
and ten years and generally intend to keep it between five and ten years.       

For Scudder S&P 500 Stock Fund only, the following replaces the second          
paragraph:                                                                      

The fund seeks to match, as closely as possible before expenses, the performance
of the S&P 500 Index, which emphasizes stocks of large U.S. companies. It does  
this by investing, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of total assets,    
plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in common stocks and 
securities included in the S&P 500 Index.                                       

For Scudder Small Company Stock Fund only, the following replaces the first     
three sentences of the first paragraph:                                         

The fund seeks to provide long-term capital growth while actively seeking to    
reduce downside risk as compared with other small company stock funds. It does  
this by investing, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of net assets, plus 
the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in common stocks of small 
U.S. companies with potential for above-average long-term capital growth. These 
companies are similar in size to the companies in the Russell 2000 Index (as of 
12/31/01, the Russell 2000 Index had a median market capitalization of $414     
million).                                                                       

For Scudder Small Company Value Fund only, the following replaces the first     
paragraph:                                                                      

The fund seeks long-term growth of capital by investing, under normal           
circumstances, at least 90% of total assets, plus the amount of any borrowings  
for investment purposes, in undervalued common stocks of small U.S. companies.  
These are companies that are similar in size to those in the Russell 2000 Value 
Index (as of 12/31/01, the Russell 2000 Value Index had a median market         
capitalization of $411 million).                                                

For Scudder Tax-Free Money Fund only, the following replaces the second sentence
of the first paragraph:                                                         

The fund invests at least 80% of net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings  
for investment purposes, in high quality short-term municipal securities, the   
income from which is free from regular federal income tax and from alternative  
minimum tax (AMT).                                                              

For Scudder U.S. Treasury Money Fund only, the following replaces the first two 
sentences of the first paragraph:                                               

The fund seeks current income consistent with safety, liquidity, and stability  
of capital. It does this by investing, under normal circumstances, at least 80% 
of total assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in  
short-term U.S. Treasury securities or in repurchase agreements backed by these 
securities.                                                                     

For Scudder 21st Century Growth Fund only, the following replaces the second    
sentence of the first paragraph:                                                

The fund typically invests at least 80% of total assets in common stocks of     
companies that are similar in size to the companies in the Russell 2000 Growth  
Index (as of 12/31/01, the Russell 2000 Growth Index had a median market        
capitalization of $429 billion).

Through online, messaging, integration and client care solutions, the client access product suite aims to deliver quality, reliable services that provide market leading user experience and enable our transaction banking clients to meet their business goals
