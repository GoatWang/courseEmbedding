Risk/Return Summary

WHAT IS THE FUND'S INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE?

The Fund is a money market fund that seeks to maintain a stable net asset value (NAV) of $1.00 per Share. The Fund's investment
objective is stability of principal and current income consistent with stability of principal. While there is no assurance that
the Fund will achieve its investment objective, it endeavors to do so by following the strategies and policies described in
this prospectus.

WHAT ARE THE FUND'S MAIN INVESTMENT STRATEGIES?

The Fund invests primarily in a portfolio of short-term U.S. Treasury and government agency securities. These investments include
repurchase agreements collateralized fully by U.S. Treasury and government agency securities. The dollar-weighted average maturity
of the Fund's portfolio will be 90 days or less.
<R>

The Fund intends to invest in the securities of U.S. government-sponsored entities (GSEs), including GSE securities that are not
backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, such as those issued by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation,
the Federal National Mortgage Association, and the Federal Home Loan Bank System. These entities are, however, supported through
federal subsidies, loans, or other benefits. The Fund may also invest in GSE securities that are supported by the full faith and
credit of the U.S. government, such as those issued by the Government National Mortgage Association. Finally, the Fund may invest
in a few GSE securities that have no explicit financial support, but which are regarded as having implied support because the
federal government sponsors their activities. Such securities include those issued by the Farm Credit System and the
Financing Corporation.
</R>

WHAT ARE THE MAIN RISKS OF INVESTING IN THE FUND?
<R>

All mutual funds take investment risks. Therefore, even though the Fund is a money market fund that seeks to maintain a stable
NAV, it is possible to lose money by investing in the Fund. 
</R>
<R>

The Shares offered by this prospectus are not deposits or obligations of any bank, are not endorsed or guaranteed by any bank and
are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, or
any other government agency.

This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund's Investment Shares and Retirement Shares with the cost of investing in other mutual funds.

The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund's Investment Shares and Retirement Shares for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your Shares at the end of those periods.

Although your actual costs and returns may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

What are the Fund's Investment Strategies?

The Fund invests primarily in a portfolio of U.S. Treasury and government agency securities maturing in 397 days or less. These investments include repurchase agreements collateralized fully by U.S. Treasury and government agency securities. The dollar-weighted average maturity of the Fund's portfolio will be 90 days or less.

T
he Fund's investment adviser (Adviser) targets a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity range based upon its interest rate outlook. The Adviser formulates its interest rate outlook by analyzing a variety of factors, such as:


current U.S. economic activity and the economic outlook;


current short-term interest rates;


the Federal Reserve Board's policies regarding short-term interest rates; and


the potential effects of foreign economic activity on U.S. short-term interest rate
s.



The Adviser generally shortens the portfolio's dollar-weighted average maturity when it expects interest rates to rise and extends the maturity when it expects interest rates to fall. The Adviser selects securities used to shorten or extend the portfolio's dollar-weighted average maturity by comparing the returns currently offered by different investments to their historical and expected returns.

What are the Principal Securities in Which the Fund Invests?
<R>

 FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES
</R>
<R>

 Fixed-income securities pay interest, dividends, or distributions at a specified rate. The rate may be a fixed percentage of the principal or adjusted periodically. In addition, the issuer of a  fixed-income security must repay the principal amount of the security, normally within a specified time. The following describes the principal types of  fixed-income securities in which the Fund may invest :
</R>

U.S. Treasury Securities

U.S. Treasury securities are direct obligations of the federal government of the United States.

Agency Securities

Agency securities are issued or guaranteed by a federal agency or other government sponsored entity (GSE) acting under federal authority. Some GSE securities are supported by the full faith and credit of the United States. These include the Government National Mortgage Association, Small Business Administration, Farm Credit System Financial Assistance Corporation, Farmer's Home Administration, Federal Financing Bank, General Services Administration, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Export-Import Bank, Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Bonds.
<R>

Other GSE securities receive support through federal subsidies, loans, or other benefits. For example, the U.S. Treasury is authorized to purchase specified amounts of securities issued by (or otherwise make funds available to) the Federal Home Loan Bank System, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Federal National Mortgage Association, Student Loan Marketing Association, and Tennessee Valley Authority in support of such obligations.
</R>
<R>

A few  GSE securities have no explicit financial support, but are regarded as having implied support because the federal government sponsors their activities. These include the Farm Credit System, Financing Corporation, and Resolution Funding Corporation.
</R>
<R>

Investors regard agency securities as having low credit risks, but not as low as Treasury securities.  
</R>
<R>

 The Fund treats mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by a GSE as if issued or guaranteed by a federal agency. 
</R>
<R>

Although such a guarantee protects against credit risks, it does not reduce market and prepayment risks.
</R>

Repurchase Agreements

Repurchase agreements are transactions in which a Fund buys a security from a dealer or bank and agrees to sell the security back at a mutually agreed-upon time and price. The repurchase price exceeds the sale price, reflecting the Fund's return on the transaction. This return is unrelated to the interest rate on the underlying security. The Fund will enter into repurchase agreements only with banks and other recognized financial institutions, such as securities dealers, deemed creditworthy by the Adviser. Repurchase agreements are subject to credit risks.

What are the Specific Risks of Investing in the Fund?

INTEREST RATE RISK
<R>

Prices of  fixed-income securities rise and fall in response to changes in the interest rate paid by similar securities. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed-income securities fall. However, market factors, such as the demand for particular  fixed-income securities, may cause the price of certain  fixed-income securities to fall while the prices of other securities rise or remain unchanged.
</R>
<R>

Interest rate changes have a greater effect on the price of  fixed-income securities with longer maturities. Money market funds try to minimize this risk by purchasing short-term securities.
</R>

CREDIT RISK

Credit risk includes the possibility that a party to a transaction involving the Fund will fail to meet its obligations. This could cause the Fund to lose the benefit of the transaction or prevent the Fund from selling or buying other securities to implement its investment strategy.

What Do Shares Cost?
<R>

You can purchase, redeem, or exchange Shares any day the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is open. The Fund attempts to stabilize the NAV of its Shares at $1.00 by valuing the portfolio securities using the amortized cost method. The Fund cannot guarantee that its NAV will always remain at $1.00 per Share. The Fund does not charge a front-end sales charge. 
</R>
<R>

 When the Fund receives your transaction request in proper form (as described in this prospectus), it is processed at the next determined NAV. NAV is determined at noon and 1:00 p.m. (Eastern time) and as of the end of regular trading (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) each day the NYSE is open.
</R>
<R>

 THE EDWARD JONES CFO ACCOUNTS
</R>
<R>

This program provides a convenient method for investment by linking your Fund account and the Edward D. Jones & Co. Brokerage Account. As a  Complete Financial Organization (CFO) account subscriber, you will have a free credit balance in the Brokerage Account and will automatically have this sum invested in your Fund account on a daily basis. CFO Accounts also permit daily, automatic redemption of Fund Shares to satisfy debit balances in your Brokerage Accounts.
</R>

How is the Fund Sold?

The Fund offers two Share classes: Investment Shares and Retirement Shares, each representing interests in a single portfolio of securities.
<R>

The Fund's Distributor, Federated Securities Corp., markets the Shares described in this prospectus exclusively through Edward Jones to  its customers. The Fund is sold largely as a "sweep" investment for otherwise uninvested cash in customers' brokerage accounts.
</R>
<R>

The Distributor  is a subsidiary of Federated Investors, Inc. (Federated).
</R>

How to Purchase Shares

You may purchase Shares by check or wire. Fund Shares purchased before 2:00 p.m. (Eastern time) earn dividends that day. Payment should be made in U.S. dollars and drawn on a U.S. bank.
<R>

When payment is made by check, the order is considered received after the check is converted into federal funds by Edward  Jones & Co. This is normally within three business days of receiving the check. If your check does not clear, your purchase will be canceled and you could be liable for any losses or fees the Fund incurs. Checks originally payable to someone other than you or Edward  Jones & Co. (third-party checks) are not accepted.
</R>

When payment is made by wire with federal funds, the order is considered received within two business days. The Fund reserves the right to reject any request to purchase Shares.

an electronic transfer to your account at a financial institution that is an ACH member; or


wire payment to your account at a domestic commercial bank that is a Federal Rese
rve System member.



Redemption in Kind

LIMITATIONS ON REDEMPTION PROCEEDS

</R>
<R>

You will receive periodic statements reporting all account activity, including dividends and capital gains paid. If you purchase Shares by wire, you begin earning dividends on the third business day after receipt of the wired funds by Edward Jones. If you purchase Shares by check, you begin earning dividends on the fourth business day after Edward Jones receives your check. In either case, you earn dividends through the day your redemption request is received.
</R>

DIVIDENDS AND CAPITAL GAINS

The Fund declares any dividends daily and pays them monthly to shareholders. If you purchase Shares by wire, you begin earning dividends on the third business day after receipt of the wired funds by Edward Jones. If you purchase Shares by check, you begin earning dividends on the fourth business day after Edward Jones receives your check. In either case, you earn dividends through the day your redemption request is received.

The Fund does not expect to realize any capital gains or losses. If capital gains or losses were to occur, they could result in an increase or decrease in dividends. The Fund pays any capital gains at least annually. Your dividends and capital gains distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional Shares without a sales charge, unless you elect cash payments.

ACCOUNTS WITH LOW BALANCES
<R>

Due to the high cost of maintaining accounts with low balances, you must maintain a $2,500 average monthly account balance in any month in Investment Shares. Otherwise, Edward  Jones  will charge you a $3.00 fee for that month.  Some CFO  accounts may not be  subject to the average monthly account balance  requirement. Retirement Share accounts may be subject to the policy in the future.
</R>

TAX INFORMATION
<R>

Edward  Jones  sends an annual statement of your account activity to assist you  in completing your federal, state, and local tax returns. Fund distributions of dividends and capital gains are taxable to you whether paid in cash or reinvested in the Fund. Dividends are taxable as ordinary income; capital gains are taxable at different rates depending upon the length of time the Fund holds its assets.
</R>

Fund distributions are expected to be primarily dividends. Redemptions and exchanges are taxable sales. Please consult your tax adviser regarding your federal, state and local tax liability.
<R>

FREQUENT TRADING POLICIES
</R>
<R>

Given the short-term nature of the Fund's investments, the Fund does not anticipate that in the normal case frequent or short-term trading into and out of the Fund will have significant adverse consequences for the Fund and its shareholders. For this reason and because the Fund is intended to be used as a liquid short-term investment, the Fund's Board has not adopted policies or procedures to discourage frequent or short-term trading of the Fund's Shares. However, the Fund may limit or terminate the availability of purchases or exchanges to a shareholder and may bar the shareholder from purchasing shares of other Federated funds if the Fund's management or Adviser determines from the amount, frequency, or pattern of purchases and redemptions or exchanges that the shareholder is engaged in excessive trading that is or could be detrimental to the Fund and other shareholders.
</R>
<R>

PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS INFORMATION
</R>
<R>

Complete listings of the Fund's portfolio holdings as of the end of its second and fourth fiscal quarters are contained in the Fund's Annual and Semi-Annual Reports to shareholders, which are filed with the SEC on Form N-CSR. Complete listings of the Fund's portfolio holdings as of the end of its first and third fiscal quarters are contained in the Reports on Form N-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These reports are filed with the SEC within 60 days after the end of the fiscal quarter and may be accessed from the EDGAR Database on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.
</R>

Who Manages the Fund?
<R>

The Board of Trustees (the "Board") governs the Fund. The Board selects and oversees the Adviser, Passport Research, Ltd. The Adviser manages the Fund's assets, including buying and selling portfolio securities. The Adviser is a limited partnership whose general partner is Federated Investment Management Company, a subsidiary of Federated, with a 50.5% interest. 
</R>
<R>

Federated Advisory Services Company (FASC)  an affiliate of the Adviser,  provides certain support services to the Adviser. The  fee for these services  is paid by the Adviser and not by the Fund.  The address of the Adviser and FASC is Federated Investors Tower, 1001 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15222-3779.
</R>
<R>

The Adviser and other subsidiaries of Federated advise approximately  133 equity, fixed-income, and money market mutual funds  as well as a variety  of customized separately managed accounts, which totaled approximately $ 179 billion in assets as of December 31,  2004. Federated was established in 1955 and is one of the largest  investment managers in the United States with approximately 1, 385 employees.  Federated provides investment products to more than 5, 700 investment  representatives and institutions.
</R>
<R>

 The limited partner of the Adviser is Edward D. Jones & Co., L.P., with a 49.5% interest. The partners in the Adviser allocate the expenses and revenues of the partnership according to a mutually agreed-upon formula. Last year, the general partner received approximately 30% of the Adviser's revenues, while Edward Jones received approximately 70%. This allocation may vary depending upon total assets in the Fund or other factors. Edward Jones also provides shareholder services, administrative services, transfer agent services, and marketing services to the Fund and the 548,814 accounts (Investment Class) and 1,646,005 accounts (Retirement Class) that its clients maintain in the Fund. During the Fund's last fiscal year, Edward Jones received approximately $72.5 million in total (approximately 78.5% of total Fund expenses) for its services. Edward Jones would have received $65.53 in total fees and payments with respect to a shareholder maintaining an investment of $10,000 in Investment Shares or
$98.73 with respect to a shareholder maintaining an investment of $10,000 in Retirement Shares during that year.
</R>
<R>

ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS TO EDWARD JONES
</R>
<R>

The Distributor may make payments out of its own resources (including items of material value) to Edward Jones to support the sale of Shares or provide services to the Fund or other Funds distributed by the Distributor and their respective shareholders. The amounts of these payments could be significant, and may create an incentive for Edward Jones or its employees or associated persons to recommend or sell Shares of the Fund to you. In some cases, such payments may be made by or funded from the resources of companies affiliated with the Distributor. Such payments are not reflected in the fees and expenses listed in the fee table section of the Fund's prospectus because they are not paid by the Fund.
</R>

ADVISORY FEES

The Adviser receives an annual investment advisory fee based on the Fund's average daily net assets as shown in the chart below.

Legal Proceedings
</R>
<R>

FEDERATED
</R>
<R>

Like many other mutual fund companies, in September 2003, Federated Investors, Inc., the parent company of the Federated funds' advisers and distributor (collectively, "Federated"), received detailed requests for information on shareholder trading activities in the Federated funds (Funds) from the SEC, the New York State Attorney General, and the National Association of Securities Dealers. Since that time, Federated has received additional inquiries from regulatory authorities on these and related matters, and more such inquiries may be received in the future.
</R>
<R>

As a result of these inquiries, Federated and the Funds have conducted an internal investigation of the matters raised, which revealed instances in which a few investors were granted exceptions to Federated's internal procedures for limiting frequent transactions and that one of these investors made an additional investment in another Federated fund. The investigation has also identified inadequate procedures which permitted a limited number of investors (including several employees) to engage in undetected frequent trading activities and/or the placement and acceptance of orders to purchase shares of fluctuating net asset value funds after the funds' closing times. Federated has issued a series of press releases describing these matters in greater detail and emphasizing that it is committed to compensating the Funds for any detrimental impact these transactions may have had on them. In that regard, on February 3, 2004, Federated and the independent directors of the Funds announced the establishment
by Federated of a restoration fund that is intended to cover any such detrimental impact. The press releases and related communications are available in the "About Us" section of Federated's website at FederatedInvestors.com, and any future press releases on this subject will also be posted there.
</R>
<R>

Shortly after Federated's first public announcement concerning the foregoing matters, and notwithstanding Federated's commitment to taking remedial actions, Federated and various Funds were named as defendants in several class action lawsuits now pending in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland seeking damages of unspecified amounts. The lawsuits were purportedly filed on behalf of people who purchased, owned and/or redeemed shares of Federated-sponsored mutual funds during specified periods beginning November 1, 1998. The suits are generally similar in alleging that Federated engaged in illegal and improper trading practices including market timing and late trading in concert with certain institutional traders, which allegedly caused financial injury to the mutual fund shareholders.
</R>
<R>

Federated and various Funds have also been named as defendants in several additional lawsuits, the majority of which are now pending in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, alleging, among other things, excessive advisory and Rule 12b-1 fees, and seeking damages of unspecified amounts.
</R>
<R>

The Board of the Funds has retained the law firm of Dickstein Shapiro Morin & Oshinsky LLP to represent the Funds in these lawsuits. Federated and the Funds, and their respective counsel, are reviewing the allegations and will respond appropriately. Additional lawsuits based upon similar allegations may be filed in the future. The potential impact of these recent lawsuits and future potential similar suits is uncertain. Although we do not believe that these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the Funds, there can be no assurance that these suits, the ongoing adverse publicity and/or other developments resulting from the regulatory investigations will not result in increased Fund redemptions, reduced sales of Fund shares, or other adverse consequences for the Funds.
</R>
<R>

EDWARD JONES & CO.
</R>
<R>

In the normal course of business, Edward Jones is named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions, and other litigation. Certain of these legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. Edward Jones is involved, from time to time, in investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, fines, or penalties. Recently, the number of legal actions and investigations has increased with a focus on mutual fund issues among many firms in the financial services industry, including Edward Jones.
</R>
<R>

On December 20, 2004, the California Attorney General filed: People of the State of California vs. Edward D. Jones & Co., L.P. in the Superior Court for Sacramento, California. The California Attorney General alleges that Edward Jones violated Sections 25401 and 2516(a) of the California Corporations Code by failing to adequately disclose to California resident customers purchasing mutual fund shares, Edward Jones' revenue sharing arrangements. The Complaint seeks unspecified damages, attorney's fees, injunctive relief and a civil monetary penalty of $25,000 for each alleged violation of the Corporations Code. Edward Jones removed the case to federal court and filed a motion to dismiss. The California Attorney General has filed a motion to have the case remanded back to state court. No hearing has yet occurred on any of the pending motions.

HOW IS THE FUND ORGANIZED?

<R>




The Fund is a diversified open-end, management investment company that was
established under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on January 9, 1980.
The Board of Trustees (the Board) has established two classes of shares of the Fund,
known as Investment Shares and Retirement Shares (Shares). This SAI relates to both
classes of Shares.  The Fund's investment adviser is Passport Research, Ltd.
(Adviser).  The Adviser is a limited partnership, jointly owned by Edward Jones and a
subsidiary of Federated Investors, Inc.
<R>



SECURITIES IN WHICH THE FUND INVESTS

In pursuing its investment strategy, the Fund may invest in the following securities
for any purpose that is consistent with its investment objective:

  The Fund is permitted to invest in any high quality money market instrument. As a
matter of investment policy, however, the Fund presently limits its investments to
the U.S. government securities and government agency securities described in the
prospectus and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities.
The purpose of this policy is to minimize any credit risk associated with the Fund's
investments. This policy may be changed at the discretion of the Board.



SECURITIES DESCRIPTIONS AND TECHNIQUES

FIXED INCOME SECURITIES
Fixed income securities pay interest, dividends or distributions at a specified rate.
The rate may be a fixed percentage of the principal or adjusted periodically. In
addition, the issuer of a fixed income security must repay the principal amount of
the security, normally within a specified time. Fixed income securities provide more
regular income than equity securities. However, the returns on fixed income
securities are limited and normally do not increase with the issuer's earnings. This
limits the potential appreciation of fixed income securities as compared to equity
securities.
  A security's yield measures the annual income earned on a security as a percentage
of its price. A security's yield will increase or decrease depending upon whether it
costs less (a discount) or more (a premium) than the principal amount. If the issuer
may redeem the security before its scheduled maturity, the price and yield on a
discount or premium security may change based upon the probability of an early
redemption. Securities with higher risks generally have higher yields.

  In addition to the U.S. government securities and government agency securities
described in the prospectus, and subject to its present policy described above, the
following describes types of fixed income securities in which the Fund may invest:


Corporate Debt Securities
Corporate debt securities are fixed income securities issued by businesses. Notes,
bonds, debentures and commercial paper are the most prevalent types of corporate debt
securities. The Fund may also purchase interests in bank loans to companies. The
credit risks of corporate debt securities vary widely among issuers.


Commercial Paper
Commercial paper is an issuer's obligation with a maturity of less than nine months.
Companies typically issue commercial paper to pay for current expenditures. Most
issuers constantly reissue their commercial paper and use the proceeds (or bank
loans) to repay maturing paper. If the issuer cannot continue to obtain liquidity in
this fashion, its commercial paper may default. The short maturity of commercial
paper reduces both the market and credit risks as compared to other debt securities
of the same issuer.

Demand Instruments
Demand instruments are corporate debt securities that the issuer must repay upon
demand. Other demand instruments require a third party, such as a dealer or bank, to
repurchase the security for its face value upon demand. The Fund treats demand
instruments as short-term securities, even though their stated maturity may extend
beyond one year.

Bank Instruments
Bank instruments are unsecured interest bearing deposits with banks. Bank instruments
include, but are not limited to, bank accounts, time deposits, certificates of
deposit and banker's acceptances. Yankee instruments are denominated in U.S. dollars
and issued by U.S. branches of foreign banks. Eurodollar instruments are denominated
in U.S. dollars and issued by non-U.S. branches of U.S. or foreign banks.
For purposes of applying the Fund's concentration limitation, bank instruments also
include fixed income securities credit enhanced by a bank.

Asset Backed Securities
Asset backed securities are payable from pools of obligations other than mortgages.
Most asset backed securities involve consumer or commercial debts with maturities of
less than ten years. However, almost any type of fixed income assets (including other
fixed income securities) may be used to create an asset backed security. Asset backed
securities may take the form of commercial paper, notes or pass-through certificates.
Asset backed securities have prepayment risks.

Zero Coupon Securities
Zero coupon securities do not pay interest or principal until final maturity, unlike
debt securities that provide periodic payments of interest (referred to as a coupon
payment). Investors buy zero coupon securities at a price below the amount payable at
maturity. The difference between the purchase price and the amount paid at maturity
represents interest on the zero coupon security. Investors must wait until maturity
to receive interest and principal, which increases the interest rate and credit risk
of a zero coupon security.

Municipal Securities
Municipal securities are issued by states, counties, cities and other political
subdivisions and authorities.

Mortgage Backed Securities
Mortgage backed securities represent interests in pools of mortgages. The mortgages
that comprise a pool normally have similar interest rates, maturities and other
terms. Mortgages may have fixed or adjustable interest rates. Interests in pools of
adjustable rate mortgages are known as ARMs.

Callable Securities
Certain fixed income securities in which the Fund invests are callable at the option
of the issuer. Callable securities are subject to call risks.

Insurance Contracts
Insurance contracts include guaranteed investment contracts, funding agreements and
annuities. The Fund treats these contracts as fixed income securities.

Credit Enhancement
The Fund may invest in securities that have credit enhancement. Credit enhancement
consists of an arrangement in which a company agrees to pay amounts due on a fixed
income security if the issuer defaults. In some cases the company providing credit
enhancement makes all payments directly to the security holders and receives
reimbursement from the issuer. Normally, the credit enhancer has greater financial
resources and liquidity than the issuer. For this reason, the Adviser usually
evaluates the credit risk of a fixed income security based solely upon its credit
enhancement.
  Common types of credit enhancement include guarantees, letters of credit, bond
insurance and surety bonds. Credit enhancement also includes arrangements where
securities or other liquid assets secure payment of a fixed income security. If a
default occurs, these assets may be sold and the proceeds paid to security's holders.
Either form of credit enhancement reduces credit risks by providing another source of
payment for a fixed income security.


FOREIGN SECURITIES
Foreign securities are securities of issuers based outside the United States. The
Fund considers an issuer to be based outside the United States if:
o     it is organized under the laws of, or has a principal office located in another
   country;

o     the principal trading market for its securities is in another country; or

o     it (or its subsidiaries) derived in its most current fiscal year at least 50%
   of its total assets, capitalization, gross revenue or profit from goods produced,
   services performed, or sales made in another country.

Along with the risks normally associated with domestic securities of the same type,
foreign securities are subject to risks of foreign investing.  The foreign securities
in which the Fund invests are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.


SPECIAL TRANSACTIONS
<R>



Inter-Fund Borrowing and Lending Arrangements
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has granted an exemption that permits
the Fund and all other funds advised by subsidiaries of Federated Investors, Inc.
(Federated funds) to lend and borrow money for certain temporary purposes directly to
and from other Federated funds.  Participation in this inter-fund lending program is
voluntary for both borrowing and lending Federated funds, and an inter-fund loan is
only made if it benefits each participating Federated fund.  Federated Investors,
Inc. (Federated) administers the program according to procedures approved by the
Fund's Board, and the Board monitors the operation of the program.  Any inter-fund
loan must comply with certain conditions set out in the exemption, which are designed
to assure fairness and protect all participating Federated funds.

For example, inter-fund lending is permitted only (a) to meet shareholder redemption
requests, and (b) to meet commitments arising from "failed" trades.  All inter-fund
loans must be repaid in seven days or less.  The Fund's participation in this program
must be consistent with its investment policies and limitations, and must meet
certain percentage tests.  Inter-fund loans may be made only when the rate of
interest to be charged is more attractive to the lending Federated fund than
market-competitive rates on overnight repurchase agreements (Repo Rate) and more
attractive to the borrowing Federated fund than the rate of interest that would be
charged by an unaffiliated bank for short-term borrowings (Bank Loan Rate), as
determined by the Board.  The interest rate imposed on inter-fund loans is the
average of the Repo Rate and the Bank Loan Rate.

</R>




Repurchase Agreements
Repurchase agreements are transactions in which the Fund buys a security from a
dealer or bank and agrees to sell the security back at a mutually agreed-upon time
and price. The repurchase price exceeds the sale price, reflecting the Fund's return
on the transaction. This return is unrelated to the interest rate on the underlying
security. The Fund will enter into repurchase agreements only with banks and other
recognized financial institutions, such as securities dealers, deemed creditworthy by
the Adviser.
  The Fund's custodian or subcustodian will take possession of the securities subject
to repurchase agreements. The Adviser or subcustodian will monitor the value of the
underlying security each day to ensure that the value of the security always equals
or exceeds the repurchase price.
  Repurchase agreements are subject to credit risks.

Reverse Repurchase Agreements
Reverse repurchase agreements are repurchase agreements in which the Fund is the
seller (rather than the buyer) of the securities, and agrees to repurchase them at an
agreed-upon time and price. A reverse repurchase agreement may be viewed as a type of
borrowing by the Fund. Reverse repurchase agreements are subject to credit risks. In
addition, reverse repurchase agreements create leverage risks because the Fund must
repurchase the underlying security at a higher price, regardless of the market value
of the security at the time of repurchase.

Delayed Delivery Transactions
Delayed delivery transactions, including when-issued transactions, are arrangements
in which the Fund buys securities for a set price, with payment and delivery of the
securities scheduled for a future time. During the period between purchase and
settlement, no payment is made by the Fund to the issuer and no interest accrues to
the Fund. The Fund records the transaction when it agrees to buy the securities and
reflects their value in determining the price of its shares. Settlement dates may be
a month or more after entering into these transactions so that the market values of
the securities bought may vary from the purchase prices. Therefore, delayed delivery
transactions create interest rate risks for the Fund. Delayed delivery transactions
also involve credit risks in the event of a counterparty default. The Fund does not
intend to engage in delayed delivery transactions to an extent that would cause the
segregation of more than 20% of the total value of its assets.

Asset Coverage
In order to secure its obligations in connection with special transactions, the Fund
will either own the underlying assets or set aside readily marketable securities with
a value that equals or exceeds the Fund's obligations. Unless the Fund has other
readily marketable assets to set aside, it cannot trade assets used to secure such
obligations without terminating a special transaction. This may cause the Fund to
miss favorable trading opportunities or to realize losses on special transactions.

INVESTING IN SECURITIES OF OTHER INVESTMENT COMPANIES
<R>



The Fund may invest its assets in securities of other investment companies, including
the securities of affiliated money market funds, as an efficient means of carrying
out its investment policies and managing its uninvested cash. These other investment
companies are managed independently of the Fund and incur additional expenses.
Therefore, any such investment by the Fund may be subject to duplicate expenses.
However, the Adviser believes that the benefits and efficiencies of this approach
should outweigh the additional expenses.
</R>



INVESTMENT RATINGS
A nationally recognized rating service's two highest rating categories are determined
without regard for sub-categories and gradations. For example, securities rated A-1+,
A-1 or A-2 by Standard & Poor's (S&P), Prime-1 or Prime-2 by Moody's
Investors Service (Moody's), or F-1+, F-1 or F-2 by Fitch Ratings (Fitch) are all
considered rated in one of the  two highest short-term rating categories. The Fund
will follow applicable  regulations in determining whether a security rated by more
than one rating service can be treated as being in one of the two highest short-term
rating categories; currently, such securities must be rated by two rating services in
one of their two highest rating categories. See "Regulatory  Compliance."

INVESTMENT RISKS
There are many factors which may affect an investment in the Fund. The Fund's
principal risks are described in its prospectus. Additional risk factors are outlined
below.




Credit Risks
Credit risk is the possibility that an issuer will default on a security by failing
to pay interest or principal when due. If an issuer defaults, the Fund will lose
money.
  Many fixed income securities receive credit ratings from services such as S&P
and Moody's. These NRSROs assign ratings to securities by assessing the likelihood of
issuer default. Lower credit ratings correspond to higher perceived credit risk.
Credit ratings do not provide assurance against default or other loss of money. If a
security has not received a rating, the Fund must rely entirely upon the Adviser's
credit assessment.
  Fixed income securities generally compensate for greater credit risk by paying
interest at a higher rate. The difference between the yield of a security and the
yield of a U.S. Treasury security with a comparable maturity (the spread) measures
the additional interest paid for risk. Spreads may increase generally in response to
adverse economic or market conditions. A security's spread may also increase if the
security's rating is lowered, or the security is perceived to have an increased
credit risk. An increase in the spread will cause the price of the security to
decline.

Leverage Risks
Leverage risk is created when an investment exposes the Fund to a level of risk that
exceeds the amount invested. Changes in the value of such an investment magnify the
Fund's risk of loss and potential for gain.

Risks of Foreign Investing
Foreign securities pose additional risks because foreign economic or political
conditions may be less favorable than those of the U.S. Securities in foreign markets
may also be subject to taxation policies that reduce returns for U.S. investors.

Prepayment Risks
Unlike traditional fixed income securities, which pay a fixed rate of interest until
maturity (when the entire principal amount is due), payments on mortgage backed
securities and asset backed securities include both interest and a partial payment of
principal. Partial payment of principal may be comprised of scheduled principal
payments as well as unscheduled payments from voluntary prepayment, refinancing or
foreclosure of the underlying loans. If the Fund receives unscheduled prepayments, it
may have to reinvest the proceeds in other fixed income securities with lower
interest rates, higher credit risks or other less favorable characteristics.

Call Risks
If a fixed income security is called, the Fund may have to reinvest the proceeds in
other fixed income securities with lower interest rates, higher credit risks, or
other less favorable characteristics.


FUNDAMENTAL INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES
The investment objective of the Fund is stability of principal and current income
consistent with stability of principal.
  Money market instruments include, but are not limited to, U.S. Treasury Bills, all
other marketable obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its
agencies or instrumentalities ("U.S. government obligations"), instruments of banks
and savings and loans which are members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(FDIC) (such as certificates of deposit, demand and time deposits, savings shares and
bankers' acceptances; these instruments are not necessarily guaranteed by the FDIC),
repurchase agreements (an instrument where the seller agrees to repurchase the
instrument at the time of sale at a mutually agreed upon time and price), and prime
commercial paper including variable amount demand master notes.
  The Fund will not invest in instruments issued by banks or savings and loans
unless: (a) at the time of investment they have capital, surplus and undivided
profits in excess of $100,000,000 (as of the date of their most recently published
financial statements); or (b) the principal amount of the instrument is insured in
full by the FDIC. To the extent the Fund purchases Eurodollar certificates of deposit
issued by foreign branches of domestic U.S. banks, consideration will be given to
their domestic marketability, the lower reserve requirements normally mandated for
overseas banking operations and the possible impact of interruptions in the flow of
international currency transactions.
  Commercial paper investments will be limited to commercial paper rated A-1 or A-2
by S&P, Prime -1 or Prime -2 by Moody's or F-1 or F-2 by Fitch. In the case where
commercial paper has received different ratings from different services, such
commercial paper is an acceptable investment so long as at least one rating was a
high quality rating and provided the Board or its designee determines that such
investment presents minimal credit risks.
  The Fund may purchase money market instruments, including bank instruments and
commercial paper, which are not rated but are determined by the Board or its designee
to be of comparable quality to the other bank or corporate obligations in which the
Fund may invest.
  The Fund may also purchase U.S. Government obligations on a when-issued or delayed
delivery basis. Although the money market instruments purchased by the Fund represent
unconditional promises to repay the entire investment proceeds at maturity, this in
itself does not suggest that the shares of the Fund are themselves guaranteed. The
investment policies outlined above permit investment in a wide variety of money
market instruments and it is anticipated that investment emphasis will shift within
available categories of instruments depending on the current condition of the money
market.
  The Fund may attempt to increase yield by trading portfolio securities to take
advantage of short-term market variations.
  The investment objective and policies may not be changed by the Fund's Board
without shareholder approval.

INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS



Diversification of Investments
With respect to securities comprising 75% of the value of its total assets, the Fund
will not purchase securities of any one issuer (other than cash, cash items,
securities issued or guaranteed by the government of the United States or its
agencies or instrumentalities and repurchase agreements collateralized by such
U.S. government securities, and securities of other investment companies) if as a
result more than 5% of the value of its total assets would be invested in the
securities of that issuer, or it would own more than 10% of the outstanding voting
securities of that issuer.

Selling Short and Buying on Margin
The Fund will not purchase any money market instruments on margin or sell any money
market instruments short but it may obtain such short-term credits as may be
necessary for clearance of purchases and sales of money market instruments.

Borrowing Money
The Fund will not borrow money except as a temporary measure for extraordinary or
emergency purposes and then only in amounts not in excess of 5% of the value of its
total assets. In addition, the Fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements and
otherwise borrow up to one-third of the value of its total assets, including the
amount borrowed, in order to meet redemption requests without immediately selling
portfolio instruments. This latter practice is not for investment leverage but solely
to facilitate management of the portfolio by enabling the Fund to meet redemption
requests when the liquidation of portfolio instruments would be inconvenient or
disadvantageous.
  Interest paid on borrowed funds will not be available for investment. The Fund will
liquidate any such borrowings as soon as possible. However, during the period any
reverse repurchase agreements are outstanding, but only to the extent necessary to
assure completion of the reverse repurchase agreements, the Fund will restrict the
purchase of portfolio instruments to money market instruments maturing on or before
the expiration date of the reverse repurchase agreements.

Pledging Assets
The Fund will not mortgage, pledge or hypothecate any assets except to secure
permitted borrowings. In those cases, it may mortgage, pledge or hypothecate assets
having a market value not exceeding the lesser of the dollar amounts borrowed or 10%
of the value of total assets at the time of the borrowing.

Underwriting
The Fund will not underwrite any issue of securities, except as it may be deemed to
be an underwriter under the Securities Act of 1933 in connection with the sale
of restricted securities which the Fund may purchase pursuant to its investment
objective, policies and limitations.

Lending Cash or Securities
The Fund will not lend any of its assets (except that it may purchase or hold money
market instruments, to include repurchase agreements and variable amount demand
master notes, permitted by the investment objective and policies).



Issuing Senior Securities
The Fund will not issue senior securities, except as permitted by the investment
objective and policies and investment limitations of the Fund.

Concentration of Investments
The Fund will not purchase money market instruments if, as a result of such purchase,
more than 25% of the value of its total assets would be invested in any one industry.
  However, investing in bank instruments such as time and demand deposits and
certificates of deposit, U.S. government obligations, or instruments secured by these
money market instruments, such as repurchase agreements, shall not be
considered investments in any one industry.



Investing in Commodities or Real Estate
The Fund will not invest in commodities, commodity contracts or real estate, except
that it may purchase money market instruments issued by companies which invest in or
sponsor interests therein.

The above limitations cannot be changed unless authorized by the Board and by the
"vote of a majority of its outstanding voting securities," as defined by the
Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act). The following limitations, however, may be
changed by the Board without shareholder approval. Shareholders will be notified
before any material change in these limitations becomes effective.


Acquiring Securities
The Fund will not acquire the voting securities of any issuer. It will not invest in
securities of a company for the purpose of exercising control or management.

Investing in Restricted Securities
The Fund may invest in restricted securities. Restricted securities are any
securities that are subject to restrictions on resale under federal securities law.
The Fund may invest without limitation in restricted securities which are determined
to be liquid under criteria established by the Board. To the extent that restricted
securities are not determined to be liquid the Fund will limit their purchase,
together with other illiquid securities, to not more than 10% of its net assets.
  For purposes of the diversification limitation, the Fund considers certificates of
deposit and demand and time deposits issued by a U.S. branch of a domestic bank or
savings association having capital, surplus and undivided profits in excess of
$100,000,000 at the time of investment to be "cash items."
  Except with respect to borrowing money, if a percentage limitation is adhered to at
the time of investment, a later increase or decrease in percentage resulting from any
change in value or net assets will not result in a violation of such limitation.



REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
The Fund may follow non-fundamental operational policies that are more restrictive
than its fundamental investment limitations, as set forth in the prospectus and this
SAI, in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including the
provisions of and regulations under the 1940 Act. In particular, the Fund will comply
with the various requirements of Rule 2a-7 (the "Rule"), which regulates money market
mutual funds. The Fund will determine the effective maturity of its investments
according to the Rule. The Fund may change these operational policies to reflect
changes in the laws and regulations without the approval of its shareholders.


DETERMINING MARKET VALUE OF SECURITIES
The Board has decided that the best method for determining the value of portfolio
instruments is amortized cost. Under this method, portfolio instruments are valued at
the acquisition cost as adjusted for amortization of premium or accumulation of
discount rather than at current market value. Accordingly, neither the amount of
daily income nor the net asset value (NAV) is affected by any unrealized appreciation
or depreciation of the portfolio. In periods of declining interest rates, the
indicated daily yield on Shares of the Fund computed by dividing the annualized daily
income on the Fund's portfolio by the NAV computed as above may tend to be higher
than a similar computation made by using a method of valuation based upon market
prices and estimates. In periods of rising interest rates, the opposite may be true.

The Fund's use of the amortized cost method of valuing portfolio instruments depends
on its compliance with certain conditions in the Rule. Under the Rule, the Board must
establish procedures reasonably designed to stabilize the NAV per Share, as computed
for purposes of distribution and redemption, at $1.00 per Share, taking into account
current market conditions and the Fund's investment objective. The procedures include
monitoring the relationship between the amortized cost value per Share and the NAV
per Share based upon available indications of market value. The Board will decide
what, if any, steps should be taken if there is a difference of more than 0.5 of 1%
between the two values. The Board will take any steps it considers appropriate (such
as redemption in kind or shortening the average portfolio maturity) to minimize any
material dilution or other unfair results arising from differences between the two
methods of determining NAV.

TRADING IN FOREIGN SECURITIES

<R>




Trading in foreign securities may be completed at times which vary from the closing
of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). In computing its NAV, the Fund values foreign
securities at the latest closing price on the exchange on which they are traded
immediately prior to the closing of the NYSE. Certain foreign currency exchange rates
may also be determined at the latest rate prior to the closing of the NYSE. Foreign
securities quoted in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at current
rates. Occasionally, events that affect these values and exchange rates may occur
between the times at which they are determined and the closing of the NYSE. If such
events materially affect the value of portfolio securities, these securities may be
valued at their fair value as determined in good faith by the Fund's Board, although
the actual calculation may be done by others.

</R>





WHAT DO SHARES COST?

<R>





The NAV for each class of Shares may differ due to the variance in daily net income
realized by each class. Such variance will reflect only accrued net income to which
the shareholders of a particular class are entitled.

</R>





HOW IS THE FUND SOLD?
<R>



Under the Distributor's Contract with the Fund, the Distributor (Federated Securities
Corp.) offers Shares on a continuous, best-efforts basis exclusively through Edward
Jones & Co. ("Edward Jones") to its customers.  The Fund is sold largely as a
"sweep" investment for otherwise uninvested cash in customers' brokerage accounts.
Edward Jones takes the primary responsibility for marketing Shares to its customers.
The expense of this marketing effort is provided from Edward Jones's own resources,
including its partnership share of the Adviser's revenues and the fees it receives
for administrative services performed for the Fund.

</R>






ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS TO EDWARD JONES
The Distributor may pay out of its own resources amounts (including items of material
value) to Edward Jones In some cases, such payments may be made by, or funded from
the resources of, companies affiliated with the Distributor.  While NASD regulations
limit the sales charges that you may bear, there are no limits with regard to the
amounts that the Distributor may pay out of its own resources.  In addition to the
payments which are generally described herein and in the prospectus, Edward Jones
also may receive Service Fees.

You can ask your Edward Jones representative or consult the Edward Jones website
(www.edwardjones.com) for information about any payments Edward Jones receives from
the Distributor or the Federated funds and any services provided.

From time to time, the Distributor, at its expense, may provide additional
compensation to Edward Jones.  Such compensation may include financial assistance to
Edward Jones that enables the Distributor to participate in or present at conferences
or seminars, sales or training programs for invited employees, client and investor
events and other Edward Jones-sponsored events.

The Distributor also may hold or sponsor, at its expense, sales events, conferences
and programs for employees or associated persons of Edward Jones and may pay the
travel and lodging expenses of attendees.  The Distributor also may provide, at its
expense, meals and entertainment in conjunction with meetings with Edward Jones.
Other compensation may be offered to the extent not prohibited by applicable laws,
regulations or the rules of any self-regulatory agency, such as the NASD.


REDEMPTION IN KIND

Although the Fund intends to pay Share redemptions in cash, it reserves the right, as
described below, to pay the redemption price in whole or in part by a distribution of
the Fund's portfolio securities.
Because the Fund has elected to be governed by Rule 18f-1 under the 1940 Act, the
Fund is obligated to pay Share redemptions to any one shareholder in cash only up to
the lesser of $250,000 or 1% of the net assets represented by such Share class during
any 90-day period.

Any Share redemption payment greater than this amount will also be in cash unless the
Fund's Board determines that payment should be in kind. In such a case, the Fund will
pay all or a portion of the remainder of the redemption in portfolio securities,
valued in the same way as the Fund determines its NAV. The portfolio securities will
be selected in a manner that the Fund's Board deems fair and equitable and, to the
extent available, such securities will be readily marketable.

Redemption in kind is not as liquid as a cash redemption. If redemption is made in
kind, shareholders receiving the portfolio securities and selling them before their
maturity could receive less than the redemption value of the securities and could
incur certain transaction costs.




MASSACHUSETTS PARTNERSHIP LAW

Under certain circumstances, shareholders may be held personally liable as partners
under Massachusetts law for obligations of the Trust. To protect its shareholders,
the Trust has filed legal documents with Massachusetts that expressly disclaim the
liability of its shareholders for acts or obligations of the Trust.

In the unlikely event a shareholder is held personally liable for the Trust's
obligations, the Trust is required by the Declaration of Trust to use its property to
protect or compensate the shareholder. On request, the Trust will defend any claim
made and pay any judgment against a shareholder for any act or obligation of the
Trust. Therefore, financial loss resulting from liability as a shareholder will occur
only if the Trust itself cannot meet its obligations to indemnify shareholders and
pay judgments against them.




ACCOUNT AND SHARE INFORMATION

<R>





VOTING RIGHTS
Each Share of the Fund gives the shareholder one vote in Trustee elections and other
matters submitted to shareholders for vote.

All Shares of the Fund have equal voting rights, except that in matters affecting
only a particular class, only Shares of that class are entitled to vote.

Trustees may be removed by the Board or by shareholders at a special meeting. A
special meeting of shareholders will be called by the Board upon the written request
of shareholders who own at least 10% of the Trust's outstanding Shares of all series
entitled to vote.

As of April 1, 2005, there were no shareholders who owned of record, beneficially, or
both, 5% or more of outstanding Shares.

</R>






TAX INFORMATION


FEDERAL INCOME TAX
The Fund intends to meet requirements of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code
(Code) applicable to regulated investment companies. If these requirements are not
met, it will not receive special tax treatment and will be subject to federal
corporate income tax.


FOREIGN INVESTMENTS
If the Fund purchases foreign securities, their investment income may be subject to
foreign withholding or other taxes that could reduce the return on these securities.
Tax treaties between the United States and foreign countries, however, may reduce or
eliminate the amount of foreign taxes to which the Fund would be subject. The
effective rate of foreign tax cannot be predicted since the amount of Fund assets to
be invested within various countries is uncertain. However, the Fund intends to
operate so as to qualify for treaty-reduced tax rates when applicable.


WHO MANAGES AND PROVIDES SERVICES TO THE FUND?

<R>





BOARD OF TRUSTEES

The limited partner is Edward D. Jones & Co., L.P., with a 49.5% interest. The
partners in the Adviser allocate the expenses and revenues of the partnership
according to a mutually agreed-upon formula.  Last year, the general partner received
approximately 30% of the Adviser's revenues, while Edward Jones received
approximately 70%.  This allocation may vary depending upon total assets in the Fund
or other factors.  Edward Jones also provides shareholder services, administrative
services, transfer agent services, and marketing services to the Fund and the 548,814
accounts (Investment Shares) and 1,646,005 accounts (Retirement Shares) that its
clients maintain in the Fund.  During the Fund's last fiscal year, Edward Jones
received approximately $72.5 million in total (approximately 78.5% of total Fund
expenses) for its services. Edward Jones would have received $65.53 in total fees and
payments with respect to a shareholder maintaining an investment of $10,000 in
Investment Shares or $98.73 with respect to a shareholder maintaining an investment
of $10,000 in Retirement Shares during that year.

As required by the 1940 Act, the Fund's Board has reviewed the Fund's investment
advisory contract. The Board's decision to approve the contract reflects the exercise
of its business judgment on whether to continue the existing arrangements.  During
its review of the contract, the Board considers many factors, among the most material
of which are: the Fund's investment objectives and long term performance; the
Adviser's management philosophy, personnel and processes; the preferences and
expectations of Fund shareholders and their relative sophistication; the continuing
state of competition in the mutual fund industry; comparable fees in the mutual fund
industry; the range and quality of services provided to the Fund and its shareholders
by the Federated organization in addition to investment advisory services; and the
Fund's relationship to the Federated funds.

In assessing the Adviser's performance of its obligations, the Board also considers
whether there has occurred a circumstance or event that would constitute a reason for
it to not renew an advisory contract.  In this regard, the Board is mindful of the
potential disruptions of the Fund's operations and various risks, uncertainties and
other effects that could occur as a result of a decision to terminate or not renew an
advisory contract.  In particular, the Board recognizes that most shareholders have
invested in the Fund on the strength of the Adviser's industry standing and
reputation and in the expectation that the Adviser will have a continuing role in
providing advisory services to the Fund.

The Board also considers the compensation and benefits received by the Adviser.  This
includes fees received for services provided to the Fund by other entities in the
Federated organization and research services received by the Adviser from brokers
that execute fund trades, as well as advisory fees.  In this regard, the Board is
aware that various courts have interpreted provisions of the 1940 Act and have
indicated in their decisions that the following factors may be relevant to an
Adviser's compensation:  the nature and quality of the services provided by the
Adviser, including the performance of the Fund; the Adviser's cost of providing the
services; the extent to which the Adviser may realize "economies of scale" as the
Fund grows larger; any indirect benefits that may accrue to the Adviser and its
affiliates as a result of the Adviser's relationship with the Fund; performance and
expenses of comparable funds; and the extent to which the independent Board members
are fully informed about all facts bearing on the Adviser's service and fee.  The
Fund's Board is aware of these factors and takes them into account in its review of
the Fund's advisory contract.

The Board considers and weighs these circumstances in light of its substantial
accumulated experience in governing the Fund and working with Federated on matters
relating to the Federated funds, and is assisted in its deliberations by the advice
of independent legal counsel.  In this regard, the Board requests and receives a
significant amount of information about the Fund and the Federated organization.
Federated provides much of this information at each regular meeting of the Board, and
furnishes additional reports in connection with the particular meeting at which the
Board's formal review of the advisory contracts occurs.  In between regularly
scheduled meetings, the Board may receive information on particular matters as the
need arises.  Thus, the Board's evaluation of an advisory contract is informed by
reports covering such matters as: the Adviser's investment philosophy, personnel, and
processes; the Fund's short- and long-term performance (in absolute terms as well as
in relationship to its particular investment program and certain competitor or "peer
group" funds), and comments on the reasons for performance; the Fund's expenses
(including the advisory fee itself and the overall expense structure of the Fund,
both in absolute terms and relative to similar and/or competing funds, with due
regard for contractual or voluntary expense limitations); the use and allocation of
brokerage commissions derived from trading the Fund's portfolio securities; the
nature and extent of the advisory and other services provided to the Fund by the
Adviser and its affiliates; compliance and audit reports concerning the Federated
funds and the Federated companies that service them; and relevant developments in the
mutual fund industry and how the Federated funds and/or Federated are responding to
them.

The Board also receives financial information about Federated, including reports on
the compensation and benefits Federated derives from its relationships with the
Federated funds.  These reports cover not only the fees under the advisory contracts,
but also fees received by Federated's subsidiaries for providing other services to
the Federated funds under separate contracts (e.g., for serving as the Federated
funds' administrator).  The reports also discuss any indirect benefit Federated may
derive from its receipt of research services from brokers who execute Federated fund
trades.

The Board bases its decision to approve an advisory contract on the totality of the
circumstances and relevant factors, and with a view to past and future long-term
considerations.  Not all of the factors and considerations identified above are
relevant to every Federated fund, nor does the Board consider any one of them to be
determinative.  Because the totality of circumstances includes considering the
relationship of each Federated fund, the Board does not approach consideration of
every Federated fund's advisory contract as if that were the only Federated fund.


Services Agreement

CODE OF ETHICS RESTRICTIONS ON PERSONAL TRADING

As required by SEC rules, the Fund, its Adviser, and its Distributor have adopted
codes of ethics.  These codes govern securities trading activities of investment
personnel, Fund Trustees, and certain other employees.  Although they do permit these
people to trade in securities, including those that the Fund could buy, as well as
Shares of the Fund, they also contain significant safeguards designed to protect the
Fund and its shareholders from abuses in this area, such as requirements to obtain
prior approval for, and to report, particular transactions.

</R>








VOTING PROXIES ON FUND PORTFOLIO SECURITIES
The Board has delegated to the Adviser authority to vote proxies on the securities
held in the Fund's portfolio.  The Board has also approved the Adviser's policies and
procedures for voting the proxies, which are described below.


Proxy Voting Policies
The Adviser's general policy is to cast proxy votes in favor of proposals that the
Adviser anticipates will enhance the long-term value of the securities being voted.
Generally, this will mean voting for proposals that the Adviser believes will:
improve the management of a company; increase the rights or preferences of the voted
securities; and/or increase the chance that a premium offer would be made for the
company or for the voted securities.

The following examples illustrate how these general policies may apply to proposals
submitted by a company's board of directors.  However, whether the Adviser supports
or opposes a proposal will always depend on the specific circumstances described in
the proxy statement and other available information.

On matters of corporate governance, generally the Adviser will vote for proposals to:
require independent tabulation of proxies and/or confidential voting by shareholders;
reorganize in another jurisdiction (unless it would reduce the rights or preferences
of the securities being voted); and repeal a shareholder rights plan (also known as a
"poison pill").  The Adviser will generally vote against the adoption of such a plan
(unless the plan is designed to facilitate, rather than prevent, unsolicited offers
for the company).

On matters of capital structure, generally the Adviser will vote: against proposals
to authorize or issue shares that are senior in priority or voting rights to the
securities being voted; for proposals to grant preemptive rights to the securities
being voted; and against proposals to eliminate such preemptive rights.

On matters relating to management compensation, generally the Adviser will vote: for
stock incentive plans that align the recipients' interests with the interests of
shareholders without creating undue dilution; and against proposals that would permit
the amendment or replacement of outstanding stock incentives with new stock
incentives having more favorable terms.

On matters relating to corporate transactions, the Adviser will vote proxies relating
to proposed mergers, capital reorganizations, and similar transactions in accordance
with the general policy, based upon its analysis of the proposed transaction.  The
Adviser will vote proxies in contested elections of directors in accordance with the
general policy, based upon its analysis of the opposing slates and their respective
proposed business strategies.  Some transactions may also involve proposed changes to
the company's corporate governance, capital structure or management compensation.
The Adviser will vote on such changes based on its evaluation of the proposed
transaction or contested election.  In these circumstances, the Adviser may vote in a
manner contrary to the general practice for similar proposals made outside the
context of such a proposed transaction or change in the board.  For example, if the
Adviser decides to vote against a proposed transaction, it may vote for anti-takeover
measures reasonably designed to prevent the transaction, even though the Adviser
typically votes against such measures in other contexts.

The Adviser generally votes against proposals submitted by shareholders without the
favorable recommendation of a company's board.  The Adviser believes that a company's
board should manage its business and policies, and that shareholders who seek
specific changes should strive to convince the board of their merits or seek direct
representation on the board.

In addition, the Adviser will not vote if it determines that the consequences or
costs outweigh the potential benefit of voting.  For example, if a foreign market
requires shareholders casting proxies to retain the voted shares until the meeting
date (thereby rendering the shares "illiquid" for some period of time), the Adviser
will not vote proxies for such shares.


Proxy Voting Procedures
The Adviser has established a Proxy Voting Committee (Proxy Committee), to exercise
all voting discretion granted to the Adviser by the Board in accordance with the
proxy voting policies.  The Adviser has hired Investor Responsibility Research Center
(IRRC) to obtain, vote, and record proxies in accordance with the Proxy Committee's
directions.  The Proxy Committee directs IRRC by means of Proxy Voting Guidelines,
and IRRC may vote any proxy as directed in the Proxy Voting Guidelines without
further direction from the Proxy Committee (and may make any determinations required
to implement the Proxy Voting Guidelines).  However, if the Proxy Voting Guidelines
require case-by-case direction for a proposal, IRRC will provide the Proxy Committee
with all information that it has obtained regarding the proposal and the Proxy
Committee will provide specific direction to IRRC.  The Adviser's proxy voting
procedures generally permit the Proxy Committee to amend the Proxy Voting Guidelines,
or override the directions provided in such Guidelines, whenever necessary to comply
with the proxy voting policies.


Conflicts of Interest
The Adviser has adopted procedures to address situations where a matter on which a
proxy is sought may present a potential conflict between the interests of the Fund
(and its shareholders) and those of the Adviser or Distributor.  This may occur where
a significant business relationship exists between the Adviser (or its affiliates)
and a company involved with a proxy vote.  A company that is a proponent, opponent,
or the subject of a proxy vote, and which to the knowledge of the Proxy Committee has
this type of significant business relationship, is referred to as an "Interested
Company."

The Adviser has implemented the following procedures in order to avoid concerns that
the conflicting interests of the Adviser have influenced proxy votes.  Any employee
of the Adviser who is contacted by an Interested Company regarding proxies to be
voted by the Adviser must refer the Interested Company to a member of the Proxy
Committee, and must inform the Interested Company that the Proxy Committee has
exclusive authority to determine how the Adviser will vote.  Any Proxy Committee
member contacted by an Interested Company must report it to the full Proxy Committee
and provide a written summary of the communication.  Under no circumstances will the
Proxy Committee or any member of the Proxy Committee make a commitment to an
Interested Company regarding the voting of proxies or disclose to an Interested
Company how the Proxy Committee has directed such proxies to be voted.  If the Proxy
Voting Guidelines already provide specific direction on the proposal in question, the
Proxy Committee shall not alter or amend such directions.  If the Proxy Voting
Guidelines require the Proxy Committee to provide further direction, the Proxy
Committee shall do so in accordance with the proxy voting policies, without regard
for the interests of the Adviser with respect to the Interested Company.  If the
Proxy Committee provides any direction as to the voting of proxies relating to a
proposal affecting an Interested Company, it must disclose to the Fund's Board
information regarding: the significant business relationship; any material
communication with the Interested Company; the matter(s) voted on; and how, and why,
the Adviser voted as it did.

If the Fund holds shares of another investment company for which the Adviser (or an
affiliate) acts as an investment adviser, the Proxy Committee will vote the Fund's
proxies in the same proportion as the votes cast by shareholders who are not clients
of the Adviser at any shareholders' meeting called by such investment company, unless
otherwise directed by the Board.


PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS INFORMATION
<R>



Complete listings of the Fund's portfolio holdings as of the end of its second and
fourth fiscal quarters are contained in the Fund's Annual and Semiannual Reports to
shareholders, which are filed with the SEC on Form N-CSR.  Complete listings of the
Fund's portfolio holdings as of the end of its first and third fiscal quarters are
contained in the Reports on Form N-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.  These reports are filed with the SEC within 60 days after the end of the
fiscal quarter and may be accessed from the EDGAR Database on the SEC's website at
www.sec.gov.

The disclosure policy of the Fund and the Adviser prohibits the disclosure of
portfolio holdings information to any investor or intermediary before the same
information is made available to other investors.  Employees of the Adviser or its
affiliates who have access to nonpublic information concerning the Fund's portfolio
holdings are prohibited from trading securities on the basis of this information.
Such persons must report all personal securities trades and obtain pre-clearance for
all personal securities trades other than mutual fund shares.

Firms that provide administrative, custody, financial, accounting, legal or other
services to the Fund may receive nonpublic information about Fund portfolio holdings
for purposes relating to their services. The Fund may also provide portfolio holdings
information to publications that rate, rank or otherwise categorize investment
companies.  Traders or portfolio managers may provide "interest" lists to facilitate
portfolio trading if the list reflects only that subset of the portfolio for which
the trader or portfolio manager is seeking market interest.  A list of service
providers, publications and other third parties who may receive nonpublic portfolio
holdings information appears in the Appendix to this SAI.

The furnishing of nonpublic portfolio holdings information to any third party (other
than authorized governmental or regulatory personnel) requires the prior approval of
the President of the Adviser and of the Chief Compliance Officer of the Fund.  The
President of the Adviser and the Chief Compliance Officer will approve the furnishing
of nonpublic portfolio holdings information to a third party only if they consider
the furnishing of such information to be in the best interests of the Fund and its
shareholders.  In that regard, and to address possible conflicts between the
interests of Fund shareholders and those of the Adviser and its affiliates, the
following procedures apply.  No consideration may be received by the Fund, the
Adviser, any affiliate of the Adviser or any of their employees in connection with
the disclosure of portfolio holdings information.  Before information is furnished,
the third party must sign a written agreement that it will safeguard the
confidentiality of the information, will use it only for the purposes for which it is
furnished and will not use it in connection with the trading of any security.
Persons approved to receive nonpublic portfolio holdings information will receive it
as often as necessary for the purpose for which it is provided.  Such information may
be furnished as frequently as daily and often with no time lag between the date of
the information and the date it is furnished.  The Board receives and reviews
annually a list of the persons who receive nonpublic portfolio holdings information
and the purposes for which it is furnished.

</R>




BROKERAGE TRANSACTIONS
When selecting brokers and dealers to handle the purchase and sale of portfolio
instruments, the Adviser looks for prompt execution of the order at a favorable
price. The Adviser will generally use those who are recognized dealers in specific
portfolio instruments, except when a better price and execution of the order can be
obtained elsewhere.  The Adviser makes decisions on portfolio transactions and
selects brokers and dealers subject to review by the Fund's Board.

Investment decisions for the Fund are made independently from those of other accounts
managed by the Adviser. When the Fund and one or more of those accounts invests in,
or disposes of, the same security, available investments or opportunities for sales
will be allocated among the Fund and the account(s) in a manner believed by the
Adviser to be equitable. While the coordination and ability to participate in volume
transactions may benefit the Fund, it is possible that this procedure could adversely
impact the price paid or received and/or the position obtained or disposed of by the
Fund.


ADMINISTRATOR
<R>



Federated Administrative Services (FAS), a subsidiary of Federated, provides
administrative personnel and services (including certain legal and financial
reporting services) necessary to operate the Fund. FAS provides these at the
following annual rate of the average aggregate daily net assets of all Federated

                                                  Average Aggregate Daily
     Maximum Administrative Fee              Net Assets of the Federated Funds
             0.150 of 1%                          on the first $5 billion
             0.125 of 1%                           on the next $5 billion
             0.100 of 1%                          on the next $10 billion
             0.075 of 1%                         on assets over $20 billion
The administrative fee received during any fiscal year shall be at least $150,000 per
portfolio and $40,000 per each additional class of Shares. FAS may voluntarily waive
a portion of its fee and may reimburse the Fund for expenses.

HOW DOES THE FUND MEASURE PERFORMANCE?

The Fund may advertise Share performance by using the SEC's standard methods for
calculating performance applicable to all mutual funds. The SEC also permits this
standard performance information to be accompanied by non-standard performance
information.

The performance of Shares depends upon such variables as: portfolio quality; average
portfolio maturity; type and value of portfolio securities; changes in interest
rates; changes or differences in the Fund's or any class of Shares' expenses; and
various other factors.

Share performance fluctuates on a daily basis largely because net earnings and/or the
value of portfolio holdings fluctuate daily. Both net earnings and offering price per
Share are factors in the computation of yield and total return.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




TOTAL RETURN
Total return represents the change (expressed as a percentage) in the value of Shares
over a specific period of time, and includes the investment of income and capital
gains distributions.

The average annual total return for Shares is the average compounded rate of return
for a given period that would equate a $10,000 initial investment to the ending
redeemable value of that investment. The ending redeemable value is computed by
multiplying the number of Shares owned at the end of the period by the NAV per Share
at the end of the period. The number of Shares owned at the end of the period is
based on the number of Shares purchased at the beginning of the period with $10,000,
less any applicable sales charge, adjusted over the period by any additional Shares,
assuming the annual reinvestment of all dividends and distributions.

<R>




YIELD AND EFFECTIVE YIELD
The yield of Shares is based upon the seven days ending on the day of the
calculation, called the "base period." This yield is calculated by: determining the
net change in the value of a hypothetical account with a balance of one Share at the
beginning of the base period, with the net change excluding capital changes but
including the value of any additional Shares purchased with dividends earned from the
original one Share and all dividends declared on the original and any purchased
Shares; dividing the net change in the account's value by the value of the account at
the beginning of the base period to determine the base period return; and multiplying
the base period return by 365/7. The effective yield is calculated by compounding the
unannualized base-period return by: adding one to the base-period return, raising the
sum to the 365/7th power; and subtracting one from the result.

To the extent investment representatives and broker/dealers charge fees in connection
with services provided in conjunction with an investment in Shares, the Share
performance is lower for shareholders paying those fees.

</R>




PERFORMANCE COMPARISONS
Advertising and sales literature may include:

o     references to ratings, rankings, and financial publications and/or performance
  comparisons of Shares to certain indices;

o     charts, graphs and illustrations using the Fund's returns, or returns in
  general, that demonstrate investment concepts such as tax-deferred compounding,
  dollar-cost averaging and systematic investment;

o     discussions of economic, financial and political developments and their impact
  on the securities market, including the portfolio manager's views on how such
  developments could impact the Fund; and

I Have an Account at Edward Jones. How Much Will It Cost to Sell My Mutual Funds?Written by James Hirby and Fact Checked by The Law Dictionary Staff  


Edward Jones is known as a conservative investment house that works with clients looking to invest for the long haul. The company offers a wide range of financial products and services. It's especially well-known for its managed mutual funds and money-market accounts. Unlike discount brokerages like E-Trade and Scottrade, Edward Jones prides itself on providing its clients with access to a range of financial experts. Folks who invest with Edward Jones are usually assigned to a locally-based financial professional who's capable of answering virtually any questions about the investment process.



Unlike some investment brokers, Edward Jones offers only "front-load" mutual fund products. Each of these funds slightly elevates its cost basis by adding a "load" fee to its purchase price. The company's investment brokers are salaried and receive no commissions on the sale of these funds. This tends to encourage a conservative investment style that emphasizes foresight and diversification over hot-button investment vehicles that may carry significant risks.
However, these front-load fees can be significant. Whereas other investment houses charge back-end commissions of .5 percent on each fund or equity sold, Edward Jones's mutual funds carry load fees of between 1 and 2 percent. This is expensive compared to other managed-investment brokers. Budget-conscious investors should shop the company's peer institutions before choosing to entrust Edward Jones with significant amounts of capital.
Although Edward Jones prides itself on providing personalized service and custom-tailored investment advice, its client-retention and customer-satisfaction rates are mediocre. Relative to its peer institutions, the company experiences a high rate of client "churn" from year to year. 
Many past clients have expressed dissatisfaction with its high load fees and lack of product choice. Others have complained that its financial professionals dole out cookie-cutter advice that fails to take into account the needs of each individual client. In addition, its mutual funds rarely outperform the broader stock market. This problem isn't limited to Edward Jones. Many independent finance analysts insist that managed retirement portfolios are more costly and less efficient than self-directed investments.
Investors who ultimately choose to invest with Edward Jones will be able to sell any of the firm's mutual funds or other investment products at "current market value." Since Edward Jones charges no back-end fees or commissions, its clients receive the full sale amount for each completed transaction. There may be some exceptions to this rule: "Special" funds focused on foreign markets may carry extra transaction fees.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
