Loan Look-Up Tool





To understand the options available for getting help with your mortgage – including the federal Home Affordable Refinance Program® (HARP) – it's important for you to know who owns your loan.
Using the secured look-up tool below, you can quickly find out if Freddie Mac owns your loan. Please enter your information carefully – a spelling error or other small mistake could cause an inaccurate result. Abbreviations, typos, or including the "Street Type" in the "Street Name" field can also lead to inaccurate results.

Why do we ask for Social Security?



Social Security Number


Why do we ask for your Social Security Number

Freddie Mac takes protecting your privacy seriously. We ask for your Social Security Number (SSN) to help us confirm that the requested information is being given to the mortgage holder or to someone authorized by the mortgage holder to receive the information.
We ask for your SSN because it allows us to quickly and accurately determine if your mortgage is held by Freddie Mac and to deliver an answer to you immediately. Providing a SSN increases the speed and accuracy of the look-up response.
We take measures to protect the SSN that you deliver to us (see below).

How do we handle your SSN after you enter it?

The SSN you enter within this form is only used to answer your specific look-up request. We do not save the number you enter or distribute it to a third party for any other purpose.
All information you enter in this form is transmitted from your web browser to our site via an encrypted communication channel. Please review our privacy policy for more details.

Do you have to provide your SSN number?

No. If you wish, you may submit an email request that does not require your SSN. Our customer service representatives will respond as quickly as they can, but given current demand it may take several days. Please be patient.




Verification By checking this box and clicking on the button below to submit this information, I confirm I am the owner of this property or have the consent of the owner to lookup this information.

Document Custody

Important Updates
November 9, 2016 – Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide (Guide) Bulletin 2016-12 announced revised Freddie Mac/Fannie Mae ARM Notes and Riders and Freddie Mac ARM Notes and Riders that impose a Lifetime Floor equal to the ARM's Margin effective for ARMs with a Note Date on or after October 1, 2016.
As stated in Guide Bulletin 2016-12, there are no new verification elements for Document Custodians to certify ARMs with Lifetime Floors except regarding ARMs originated using Fannie Mae ARM Notes and ARM Riders amended to add a Lifetime Floor.

Take advantage of our competitive rates on loans and lines of credit with low closing costs, secured by commercial property valued up to $5 million.  No application fee and no appraisal fee Low 1% origination fee, maximum $5,000 due at closing Fixed-rate and Prime-based loans with a variety of terms  Feel confident that you are getting the most competitive offer. We’ll match or beat a competing offer (rate and fee combination) when a competitor’s formal written approval is provided to us — or pay you $200.


  Questions? Ready to apply? Call 1-877-322-4648, Monday – Friday, 6:00 am – 6:00 pm, Pacific Time.   Financing from $50,000 to $750,000 for purchase and refinance loans in first lien position; $50,000 to $500,000 for lines of credit, equity loans, and refinance loans in second lien position. Maximum $500,000 for cash-out. All financing is subject to credit approval.  Low closing costs and competitive rates are based upon analysis of application, appraisal and origination fees, and interest rates, for competing U.S. lenders as compiled by an independent third-party research firm on a quarterly basis, beginning April 2016.  You will need to pay a deposit of up to $1,000 when accepting the terms of any loan or line of credit. The deposit is nonrefundable, unless the loan closes; in that case, the unused portion of the deposit (if any) will be returned or credited after closing in the same form as your original deposit. If environmental insurance is required, you will be responsible for this one-time fee of $1,866. You will also be responsible for the cost of any mortgage or deed of trust filing fee imposed by a state or other taxing authority. In states that require attorney closings, you will be responsible for title-related costs and attorney title work that exceeds $375. For purchase loans, you will be responsible for title and escrow fees. In addition, for purchase loans you will need to provide proof of funds for any required down payment. All financing is subject to credit approval.  Prepayment or early closure fees may apply. Contact your banker for details.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Item 1112(b) of Regulation AB.

Item 1114(b)(2) and Item 1115(b) of Regulation AB
No entity or group of affiliated entities provides any external credit enhancement, uses any derivative instruments or other support for the certificates within this transaction.
 

Item 1117 of Regulation AB.
Disclosure from U.S. Bank National Association (�U.S. Bank�), as Certificate Administrator and Trustee:
 

Since 2014 various plaintiffs or groups of plaintiffs, primarily investors, have filed claims against U.S. Bank National Association (�U.S. Bank�), in its capacity as trustee or successor trustee (as the case may be) under certain residential mortgage backed securities ("RMBS") trusts.��The plaintiffs or plaintiff groups have filed substantially similar complaints against other RMBS trustees, including Deutsche Bank, Citibank, HSBC, Bank of New York Mellon and Wells Fargo.��The complaints against U.S. Bank allege the trustee caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors, mortgage loan sellers and servicers for these RMBS trusts and assert causes of action based upon the trustee's purported failure to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of representations and warranties concerning loan quality.��The complaints also assert that the trustee failed to notify
securityholders of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers and that the trustee purportedly failed to abide by a heightened standard of care following alleged events of default. 
 

Currently U.S. Bank is a defendant in multiple actions alleging individual or class action claims against the trustee with respect to multiple trusts as described above with the most substantial case being:��BlackRock Balanced Capital Portfolio et al v. U.S. Bank National Association, No. 605204/2015 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.) (class action alleging claims with respect to approximately 794 trusts) and its companion case BlackRock Core Bond Portfolio et al v. U.S Bank National Association, No. 14-cv-9401 (S.D.N.Y.).��Some of the trusts implicated in the aforementioned Blackrock cases, as well as other trusts, are involved in actions brought by separate groups of plaintiffs related to no more than 100 trusts per case.
 

There can be no assurances as to the outcome of the litigation, or the possible impact of the litigation on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. However, U.S. Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of losses to investors and that it has meritorious defenses, and it intends to contest the plaintiffs� claims vigorously.

      Fitch to Rate Citigroup Comm'l Mortgage Trust 2014-GC19 Commercial 
      Mortgage P-T Ctfs; Presale Issued
    





February 25, 2014 05:20 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on Citigroup Commercial 
      Mortgage Trust 2014-GC19 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$49,387,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$125,716,000 
      class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$215,000,000 class A-3

      class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$21,596,000b class E 'BBsf'; 
      Outlook Stable;--$11,434,000b class F 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      a Notional amount and interest-only.b Privately placed pursuant to 
      Rule 144A.c The class A-S, class B and class C certificates may be 
      exchanged for class PEZ certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be 
      exchanged for the class A-S, class B and class C certificates.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Feb. 24, 2014. Fitch does not expect to rate the $49,545,707 class G 
      or the $60,979,707 interest-only class X-D.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 78 loans secured by 128 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.016 
      billion as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by Citigroup Global Markets Realty Corp., Goldman Sachs Mortgage 
      Company, MC-Five Mile Commercial Mortgage Finance LLC, Cantor Commercial 
      Real Estate Lending, L.P., The Bancorp Bank, Rialto Mortgage Finance, 
      LLC, and RAIT Funding, LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 72.9% of the properties by balance and 
      cash flow analysis and asset summary reviews on 80.5% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Fitch Leverage: The pool's Fitch debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
      and loan to value (LTV) are 1.13x and 106.4%, respectively, worse than 
      the 2013 and 2012 averages of 1.29x and 101.6%, and 1.24x and 97.2%, 
      respectively.
    

      Strong Above Average Property Quality: Fitch assigned property quality 
      grades of 'A-' or better to two of the 10 largest loans in the pool, 
      which represent 15% of the balance of properties inspected by Fitch. 
      Furthermore, property quality grades of 'B+' or better were assigned to 
      50% of the balance of properties inspected by Fitch.
    

      Property Type Diversity: The pool is more diverse by property type than 
      recent transactions, with the largest property type in the pool being 
      retail properties at 26.8%, followed by multifamily at 20.9%, office at 
      18.1%, mixed use at 17.7% and independent living at 10.0% of the pool. 
      No other property type comprises more than 4.9% of the pool.
    

      Limited Amortization: The pool is scheduled to amortize by 13.1% of the 
      initial pool balance prior to maturity. The pool's concentration of 
      partial interest loans (38.7%), which includes five of the 10 largest 
      loans, is higher than the 2013 average (34.0%). However, the pool's 
      concentration of full-term interest-only loans (12.2%), including two of 
      the 10 largest loans, is lower than the 2013 average (17.1%).
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 3.41% below most 
      recent net operating income (NOI; for properties that the most recent 
      NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing during this 
      period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could 
      result in higher defaults and loss severity on defaulted loans, and 
      could result in potential rating actions on the certificates. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to CGCMT 2013-GC19 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays slightly 
      above-average sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in 
      which NCF declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. In a more severe 
      scenario, in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a 
      downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result.
    

      The presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional 
      stresses and sensitivities in the Rating Sensitivity and Rating Stresses 
      sections of the presale.
    

      The master servicer will be Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., rated 'CMS1-' by 
      Fitch. The special servicer will be Midland Loan Services a Division of 
      PNC Bank, National Association, rated 'CSS1' by Fitch.

DBRS Confirms Ratings of Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2014-GC19, Stable Trends


February 23, 2017







DBRS Limited (DBRS) has today confirmed the ratings of the Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2014-GC19 issued by Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2014-GC19 as follows: 

-- Class A-1 at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-2 at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-3 at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-4 at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-AB at AAA (sf)
-- Class X-A at AAA (sf)
-- Class X-B at AAA (sf)
-- Class X-C at AAA (sf)
-- Class X-D at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-S at AAA (sf)
-- Class B at AA (high) (sf)
-- Class PEZ at AA (low) (sf)
-- Class C at AA (low) (sf) 
-- Class D at BBB (sf)
-- Class E at BB (high) (sf)
-- Class F at BB (low) (sf)

All trends are Stable. DBRS does not rate the first loss piece, Class G. 

The rating confirmations reflect the overall stable performance exhibited by the transaction since issuance in 2014. The collateral consists of 76 fixed-rate loans secured by 125 commercial properties. As of the February 2017 remittance, the pool had an aggregate balance of approximately $978.0 million, representing a collateral reduction of 3.7%, following the full repayment of two loans, LV III Portfolio (Prospectus ID#34) and Gateway Apartments (Prospectus ID#67), in addition to scheduled loan amortization. Three loans (1.9% of the pool) are secured by collateral that has been fully defeased. 

The pool is primarily concentrated by three property types, as 12 loans (31.7% of the pool) are secured by office properties, 30 loans (21.5% of the pool) are secured by retail properties and 22 loans (21% of the pool) are secured by multifamily properties. By geographical location, the pool is relatively diverse, as the largest concentration by state is in Arizona, which harbors five loans (13.0% of the pool), followed by New York with five loans (11.2% of the pool), Texas with 13 loans (11.0% of the pool) and California with nine loans (8.5% of the pool). Four loans (12.7% of the pool) are structured with full interest-only (IO) terms, while an additional five loans (9.5% of the pool) have partial IO periods remaining, ranging from two months to 25 months. 

Excluding defeasance, 52 loans (77.5% of the pool) reported partial-year 2016 (most being Q3 2016) net cash flow (NCF) figures, while 70 loans (94.9% of the pool) reported YE2015 NCF figures. According to the YE2015 NCF figures, the transaction had a weighted-average (WA) amortizing debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and WA debt yield of 1.64 times (x) and 10.5%, respectively, compared with the DBRS issuance figures of 1.43x and 8.9%, respectively. 

Based on the partial year 2016 cash flows, the Top 15 loans (57.0% of the pool) reported a WA amortizing DSCR of 1.68x, compared with the DBRS issuance figure of 1.47x, reflective of a WA NCF growth of 16.6%. There are three loans (11.6% of the pool) in the Top 15 exhibiting NCF declines compared with the DBRS UW figures, with declines ranging from -8.4% to -17.5%. These three loans include 1500 Spring Garden (Prospectus ID#3, 7.1% of the pool), 350 North Clark (Prospectus ID#10, 2.6% of the pool) and Mid-City Plaza (Prospectus ID#13, 1.9% of the pool). In general, these trends are not indicative of sustainable performance declines for those loans and DBRS will monitor all three for developments through the full year-end reporting. 

As of the February 2017 remittance, there are no loans in special servicing and 12 loans (11.5% of the pool) on the servicer�s watchlist. Six of the watchlisted loans (8.0% of the pool) were flagged for deferred maintenance, while the other six loans (3.5% of the pool) were flagged as a result of either increased vacancy and/or near-term tenant rollover. Based on the most recent cash flow reporting (ranging from YE2015 through partial-year 2016 financials), these 12 loans reported a WA DSCR of 1.56x, compared to the DBRS UW figure of 1.42x, reflective of a WA amortizing NCF growth of 7.9%. 

The ratings assigned to Classes D, E and F materially deviate from the higher ratings implied by the Large Pool Multi-borrower Parameters. DBRS considers this to be a methodology deviation when there is a rating differential of three or more notches between the assigned rating and the rating implied by the Large Pool Multi-borrower Parameters; in this case, the sustainability of loan performance trends were not demonstrated and, as such, was reflected in the ratings.

DBRS has provided updated loan-level commentary and analysis for larger and/or pivotal watchlisted and specially serviced loans, as well as for the largest 15 loans in the pool, in the DBRS CMBS IReports platform. To view these and future loan-level updates provided as part of DBRS�s ongoing surveillance for this transaction, please log in to DBRS CMBS IReports at www.ireports.dbrs.com.

Loan Look-Up Tool





To understand the options available for getting help with your mortgage – including the federal Home Affordable Refinance Program® (HARP) – it's important for you to know who owns your loan.
Using the secured look-up tool below, you can quickly find out if Freddie Mac owns your loan. Please enter your information carefully – a spelling error or other small mistake could cause an inaccurate result. Abbreviations, typos, or including the "Street Type" in the "Street Name" field can also lead to inaccurate results.

Why do we ask for Social Security?



Social Security Number


Why do we ask for your Social Security Number

Freddie Mac takes protecting your privacy seriously. We ask for your Social Security Number (SSN) to help us confirm that the requested information is being given to the mortgage holder or to someone authorized by the mortgage holder to receive the information.
We ask for your SSN because it allows us to quickly and accurately determine if your mortgage is held by Freddie Mac and to deliver an answer to you immediately. Providing a SSN increases the speed and accuracy of the look-up response.
We take measures to protect the SSN that you deliver to us (see below).

How do we handle your SSN after you enter it?

The SSN you enter within this form is only used to answer your specific look-up request. We do not save the number you enter or distribute it to a third party for any other purpose.
All information you enter in this form is transmitted from your web browser to our site via an encrypted communication channel. Please review our privacy policy for more details.

Do you have to provide your SSN number?

No. If you wish, you may submit an email request that does not require your SSN. Our customer service representatives will respond as quickly as they can, but given current demand it may take several days. Please be patient.




Verification By checking this box and clicking on the button below to submit this information, I confirm I am the owner of this property or have the consent of the owner to lookup this information.

No application fee and no appraisal fee Low 1% origination fee, maximum $5,000 due at closing Fixed-rate and Prime-based loans with a variety of terms  Feel confident that you are getting the most competitive offer. We’ll match or beat a competing offer (rate and fee combination) when a competitor’s formal written approval is provided to us — or pay you $200.

You will need to pay a deposit of up to $1,000 when accepting the terms of any loan or line of credit. The deposit is nonrefundable, unless the loan closes; in that case, the unused portion of the deposit (if any) will be returned or credited after closing in the same form as your original deposit. If environmental insurance is required, you will be responsible for this one-time fee of $1,866. You will also be responsible for the cost of any mortgage or deed of trust filing fee imposed by a state or other taxing authority.

  Terms and Conditions Apply. SOFI RESERVES THE RIGHT TO MODIFY OR DISCONTINUE PRODUCTS AND BENEFITS AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE. To qualify, a borrower must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident in an eligible state and meet SoFi's underwriting requirements. Not all borrowers receive the lowest rate. To qualify for the lowest rate, you must have a responsible financial history and meet other conditions. If approved, your actual rate will be within the range of rates listed above and will depend on a variety of factors, including term of loan, a responsible financial history, years of experience, income and other factors. Rates and Terms are subject to change at anytime without notice and are subject to state restrictions. SoFi refinance loans are private loans and do not have the same repayment options that the federal loan program offers such as Income Based Repayment or Income Contingent Repayment or PAYE. Licensed by the Department of Business Oversight under the California Finance Lender Law License No. 6054612. SoFi loans are originated by SoFi Lending Corp., NMLS # 1121636.

  ✝ To check the rates and terms you qualify for, SoFi conducts a soft credit pull that will not affect your credit score.

  1 At the end of 84 months the interest rate and monthly payment for the 7/1 ARM adjusts. At adjustment the new mortgage rate will be the average of the Interbank offered rates for one-year, U.S. dollar-denominated deposits in the London market (LIBOR) as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a margin of 2.25% subject to annual and lifetime adjustment caps.


  2 At the end of 60 months the interest rate and monthly payment for the 5/1 ARM adjusts. At adjustment the new mortgage rate will be the average of the Interbank offered rates for one-year, U.S. dollar-denominated deposits in the London market (LIBOR) as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a margin of 2.25% subject to annual and lifetime adjustment caps.


  3 SoFi’s interest-only loan is a 30-year, 5/1 ARM loan. During the first 10 interest-only years, the minimum monthly payment required is the interest on the loan. Paying the minimum payment during the interest-only period will not reduce the principal loan balance. At the end of the 10 interest-only years, the minimum payment required will increase, even if the interest rate does not change, to include both interest and principal payments.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
