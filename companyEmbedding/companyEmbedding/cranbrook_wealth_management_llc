Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

Bluebird Prepaid Card


                                            Bluebird is okay, but the issue I have is not many establishments accept American Express. I went to a gas station and swiped at the pump and received an error. So I went inside and they told me that they do not accept the card and I was on "E". It's a good thing...show more

                                            They cancelled my secured credit card without informing me.  Did not refund the money from secured card without me calling,. Guess they thought I might forget.  Will be closing all accounts with them today.  Worst customer service of any bank I've dealt with

Over the course of the last few years, my premiums kept going up. $20 here, $30 there - well, this last time it went up over $200 with the new renewal.

PenFed Credit Union


                                            HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! They do not work with you at all to satisfy the customer. Other credit unions help you ESPECIALLY if you have great credit. This CU doesn't tell you everything so verify everything with two other reps. Total Nightmare!

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Time (NYSE:TIME) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.20)Consensus Price Target: $15.20 (4.11% upside)

Richard E. Balamucki, ChFC 



Founder and President

Richard Balamucki is the founder of Cranbrook Wealth Management, LLC. He was a pioneer in comprehensive financial planning in the 1980’s and in the adoption of fee-based asset management in the 1990’s. Mr. Balamucki’s client-first approach, acute attention to detail, and the comprehensive nature of his planning services often placed him at odds with the executives of these insurance companies and broker dealers as they were much more focused on a transactional approach and the manufacture and distribution of commissioned “financial products.” Accordingly, Mr. Balamucki made the brave decision to start his own independent firm in 2004 where he and his associates could better control client costs, eliminate many conflicts of interest, operate independently, and offer comprehensive planning services over a variety of complex disciplines.
Mr. Balamucki earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Michigan State University. He currently resides in Chapel Hill, NC and splits his time between there and Metro Detroit. This allows Mr. Balamucki to work with business owners, executives, retirees, and independently wealthy families all over the country. Mr. Balamucki has extensive experience in asset management and complex estate and business succession planning. He is a big sports fan, tennis player, and is committed to health and fitness. Mr. Balamucki believes that the next frontier in wealth management will focus on the development of even deeper client relationships in order to help them achieve financial security along with more personal and familial goals.
