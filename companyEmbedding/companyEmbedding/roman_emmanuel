LONDON — The bond giant Pimco has hired Emmanuel Roman, the chief executive of the British hedge fund manager Man Group, as its new top executive, as the California-based fund looks to turn around its fortunes.The announcement comes nearly two years after William H. Gross, Pimco’s co-founder — who is known as the “bond king” — was forced out and joined its rival, Janus Capital Group.The hiring of Mr. Roman, a former Goldman Sachs banker who joined Man in 2010, comes at a pivotal time for Pimco, which is owned by the German insurer Allianz.Pacific Investment Management Company, or Pimco, has seen hundreds of billions of dollars in client assets walk out the door since Mr. Gross’s departure, and it is facing a lawsuit by Mr. Gross accusing the company of wrongful termination and seeking $200 million in damages.

Pimco has called the lawsuit “legally groundless” and is seeking its dismissal.“Manny’s deep understanding of global markets, unique skills in investment management and appreciation of Pimco’s macro-based investment process make him the ideal executive to position the firm for long-term success,” Daniel J. Ivascyn, Pimco’s chief investment officer, said in a news release on Tuesday. Continue reading the main story

Mr. Roman will join Pimco on Nov. 1, replacing Douglas Hodge as chief executive, and will be based at the company’s headquarters in Newport Beach. Mr. Roman, 52, joined Man in 2010 after it acquired GLG Partners, where he was co-chief executive. He has nearly 30 years of experience in the investment industry, including 18 years at Goldman Sachs.Mr. Hodge will move into a new role as managing director and senior adviser, Pimco said.At Pimco, Mr. Roman will find a company that has struggled to regain its stride — and client trust — since the departures of Mr. Gross and Mohamed A. El-Erian, the company’s former chief executive.Mr. El-Erian, who had long been seen as Mr. Gross’s heir apparent and had served as Pimco’s most prominent spokesman, abruptly left the company in January 2014. Mr. Gross was forced out about nine months later.Client withdrawals at Pimco have weighed on the operating profit of Allianz’s asset management arm in recent years, and they have caused some investors to call for the insurer to take a more direct role in managing Pimco.

Allianz said that in the first quarter of 2016, those outflows at Pimco slowed, but continued to weigh on its overall client assets in its asset management arm. Allianz had 9 billion euros, or about $9.9 billion, in net outflows in the three-month period, driven by clients pulling funds from Pimco, the company said. That was compared with €62 billion in outflows in the first quarter of 2015.In June, Pimco notified employees that it was cutting 68 jobs, or about 3 percent of its work force, and closing some funds as part of a cost-cutting effort.Man Group, based in London, is one of the world’s largest publicly traded hedge fund managers, and it has seen its business stabilize under the leadership of Mr. Roman, who took the chief executive’s role in 2013.The company began as a barrel maker along the Thames River in London in 1783 and evolved into an investment manager. It has offices in 16 countries and had $78.6 billion in assets under management as of the end of March.

Under Mr. Roman, Man has made a variety of acquisitions as it looks to expand the geographic base of institutional investors and increase the scope of its operations in the American market.Since 2013, it has reached deals to buy Pine Grove Asset Management, a hedge fund manager with offices in New York and Summit, N.J.; Numeric Holdings, an investment manager based in Boston; Silvermine Capital Management, a leveraged loan manager based in Connecticut; and a portfolio of funds with about $1.2 billion in assets from Merrill Lynch Alternative Investments, a unit of Bank of America.In the first quarter, Man had inflows of $500 million in new client money, a positive sign for Mr. Roman’s turnaround efforts. That was compared with outflows of $1.3 billion in the same quarter a year earlier.Luke Ellis, Man’s president, will succeed Mr. Roman as chief executive on Sept. 1, the company said on Wednesday. Mr. Ellis has been with Man since 2010.

PIMCO’s current CEO Douglas Hodge to assume role of Managing Director and Senior Advisor

“Manny Roman’s deep understanding of global markets, unique skills in investment management and appreciation of PIMCO’s macro-based investment process make him the ideal executive to position the firm for long-term success.”
– Daniel Ivascyn, PIMCO’s Group Chief Investment Officer
NEWPORT BEACH, California (July 19, 2016) - PIMCO, a leading global investment management firm, announces that the firm’s Managing Directors have appointed Emmanuel (Manny) Roman as PIMCO’s next Chief Executive Officer. PIMCO’s current CEO Douglas Hodge will assume a new role as Managing Director and Senior Advisor when Mr. Roman joins PIMCO November 1st.
The announcement of Mr. Roman as PIMCO’s CEO is the culmination of a process undertaken by the firm to hire a senior executive who would add leadership and strategic insights combined with a deep appreciation of PIMCO’s diversified global businesses, investment process and focus on superior investment performance and client-service. Mr. Roman’s appointment has the full support of the firm’s leadership including Mr. Hodge, PIMCO’s President Jay Jacobs, the firm’s Executive Committee and its Managing Directors.
Mr. Roman has nearly 30 years of experience in the investment industry, with expertise in fixed income and proven executive leadership, most recently as CEO of Man Group PLC, one of the world’s largest publicly-traded alternative asset managers and leader in liquid, high-alpha investment strategies. Mr. Roman worked for more than 18 years at Goldman Sachs, where he was Co-Head of Worldwide Global Securities and Co-Head of the European Services Division. He became Co-Chief Executive Officer at GLG Partners, Inc. in 2005 and Chief Operating Officer of Man Group in 2010 following the firm’s acquisition of GLG. He was named Man Group’s CEO in 2013. He will help drive PIMCO’s continued evolution as a provider of investment solutions built on the firm’s active management expertise in areas such as core bonds, non-traditional strategies, private credit, distressed debt, equities and real estate, among others. Mr. Roman will be based in PIMCO’s headquarters in Newport Beach, California.
“Manny’s deep understanding of global markets, unique skills in investment management and appreciation of PIMCO’s macro-based investment process make him the ideal executive to position the firm for long-term success,” said Daniel Ivascyn, Managing Director and PIMCO’s Group Chief Investment Officer. “Manny’s skills and experience include all of the attributes that are key to delivering value to PIMCO’s clients - investment acumen, intellectual capacity and thought leadership, broad industry experience, executive leadership and an excellent fit with PIMCO’s cultural values.”
Mr. Roman said: “It is an honor to be chosen as CEO of PIMCO, a firm which embodies the finest principles of asset management – innovative investment strategies, excellent client service and a deep bench of global talent – which have consistently delivered value to clients over the long-term. I look forward to working with the firm’s talented team to continue to build on PIMCO’s success in what is a rapidly changing industry.”
In his new role as Senior Advisor, Mr. Hodge will work with Mr. Roman to ensure a smooth transition of executive responsibilities providing continuity for PIMCO’s clients, employees and parent company Allianz SE.
Mr. Ivascyn said: “Doug has made a significant contribution to PIMCO with his leadership and professionalism. We are pleased he will remain with PIMCO to provide counsel to the firm and the Managing Directors, leverage his global relationships with our clients and ensure continuity throughout the transition of executive leadership to Manny.”
Mr. Hodge said: “PIMCO has become the global leader in active management of fixed income by seeking to provide investors with innovative solutions as the global markets change. As the asset management industry continues to evolve, Manny will bring new perspectives to PIMCO’s leadership team and add his unique talents to our already successful firm and I look forward to working with him.”
