A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.




	The information in this Item 7.01 of this current report on Form 8-K and Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section, or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in any such filing.






	 























	ITEM 8.01






	OTHER EVENTS









	On June 5, 2017, the Company announced additional clinical results from its Phase 2 open-label, dose-escalating clinical study of RT002 injectable to treat moderate-to-severe isolated cervical dystonia in adults. The key results are as follows:




	 













	•






	Duration:


	 The study researchers analyzed efficacy results in two dose groups: Dose Group A (N=21), individuals who received 100 to 240 units of RT002 injectable, and Dose Group B (N=16), receiving 300 to 450 units. Median duration of effect, defined as the number of weeks with subjects maintaining at least 20% of the treatment benefit achieved at Week 4 (target Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) score), was greater than 24 weeks for both dose groups, consistent with duration of effect previously reported in each of the trial’s three pre-specified patient cohorts.





















	•






	TWSTRS-Total and Subscale Scores:


	 RT002 injectable showed a clinically significant mean reduction of the TWSTRS-Total score from baseline at Week 4 - the primary efficacy endpoint - in both Group A (37%) and Group B (39%), with the majority of this benefit maintained through Week 24. In addition, clinically meaningful reductions in TWSTRS-Severity, Disability and Pain subscales were consistent and observed at all time points through Week 24.





















	•






	Response Rates and Patient-Rated Quality of Life:


	 A high rate of response was observed in the study, with 94% of subjects at Week 6 experiencing a reduction of at least 20% from baseline in TWSTRS-Total Score, and 68% of subjects at week 24 observed to maintain this treatment benefit at Week 24. In addition, a mean reduction of 37% from baseline in the Cervical Dystonia Impact Profile (CDIP-58) score was observed at Week 6 for all subjects, with the majority of this clinically meaningful benefit maintained through Week 24.





















	•






	Safety:


	 As previously reported, RT002 injectable appeared to be generally safe and well-tolerated through Week 24 in all dose groups evaluated. There were no serious adverse events and no dose-dependent increase in adverse events. The treatment-related adverse events were generally transient and mild to moderate, with one case of neck pain reported as severe.

	 International Congress of Parkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorders -











	NEWARK, Calif., June 5, 2017


	 - Revance Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: RVNC), a biotechnology company developing botulinum toxin products for use in treating aesthetic and therapeutic conditions, today announced additional clinical results from its U.S. Phase 2 open-label, dose-escalating clinical study of DaxibotulinumtoxinA Injectable (RT002) to treat moderate-to-severe isolated cervical dystonia, a movement disorder of the neck, in adults. A late-breaking poster including these data was displayed today and will be presented on Wednesday, June 7, 2017, at 1:15 pm PT in Vancouver, Canada, by study investigator Cynthia L. Comella, MD, Professor in the Department of Neurological Sciences at Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.









	These results are in addition to findings reported on May 18, 2017, which showed RT002 injectable to be generally safe and well-tolerated. The previously reported findings also demonstrated duration of effect of at least 24 weeks and that RT002 injectable delivered clinically significant improvement in signs and symptoms of cervical dystonia as determined by reduction of the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS)-Total score from baseline.









	KEY NEW 24-WEEK FINDINGS


















	•






	DURATION OF EFFECT




	AT LEAST 24 WEEKS BY DOSE GROUP:


	  The study researchers analyzed efficacy results in two dose groups: Dose Group A (N=21), individuals who received 100 to 240 units of RT002 injectable, and Dose Group B (N=16), receiving 300 to 450 units. Median duration of effect, defined as the number of weeks subjects maintained at least 20% of the treatment benefit achieved at Week 4 (Target TWSTRS Score), was greater than 24 weeks for both dose groups, consistent with the


	>


	 24-week duration of effect previously reported in each of the trial’s three pre-specified patient cohorts.





















	•






	TWSTRS-TOTAL AND SUBSCALE SCORES:


	  RT002 injectable showed a clinically significant mean reduction of the TWSTRS-Total score from baseline at Week 4 - the primary efficacy endpoint - in both Group A (37%) and Group B (39%), with the majority of this benefit maintained through Week 24. In addition, clinically meaningful reductions in TWSTRS-Severity, Disability and Pain subscales were consistent and observed at all time points through Week 24.





















	•






	RESPONSE RATES AND PATIENT-RATED QUALITY OF LIFE:


	  A high rate of response was observed in the study, with 94% of subjects at Week 6 experiencing a reduction of at least 20% from baseline in TWSTRS-Total Score, and 68% of subjects at week 24 observed to maintain this treatment benefit at Week 24. In addition, a mean reduction of 37% from baseline in the Cervical Dystonia Impact Profile (CDIP-58) score was observed at Week 6 for all subjects, with the majority of this clinically meaningful benefit maintained through Week 24.





















	•






	SAFETY FINDINGS:


	  As previously reported, RT002 injectable appeared to be generally safe and well-tolerated through Week 24 in all treatment groups evaluated. There were no serious adverse events and no dose-dependent increase in adverse events. The treatment-related adverse events were generally





























	transient and mild to moderate, with one case of neck pain reported as severe (day 10 onset, duration of 2 days).









	“Cervical dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary movements of the head and neck resulting in abnormal twisting postures of the head that is frequently associated with pain. The treatment of choice for cervical dystonia is botulinum toxin injections. Unfortunately, the drawback of this therapy as currently available is that patients must typically be re-treated at approximately 3 month intervals in order to maintain benefit,” said trial investigator Cynthia Comella, MD, Professor of Neurological Sciences, Rush University Medical Center. “The data from the RT002 study indicate that this new formulation of botulinum toxin serotype A may significantly improve symptoms of cervical dystonia and have an impressive duration of benefit of 24 weeks, which is twice as long as the toxins currently available. Overall, I believe RT002 holds tremendous promise to provide cervical dystonia patients a significant and longer-lasting improvement of their symptoms.”









	Additional data at 21st International Congress of Parkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorders




	In addition to the late-breaking poster, a regular session poster with guided tour is scheduled for Thursday, June 8, 2017, at 1:15 pm PT presented by study investigator Atul Patel, MD, MHSA, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Physician at Kansas City Bone & Joint.









	Once the posters are displayed at the congress, the company plans to add a slide presentation of the poster contents to its website under the


	THERAPEUTICS


	 tab in the section entitled


	Presentations and Publications


	.









	Based on these Phase 2 results, the company expects to discuss next steps in this clinical program with the US and EU regulatory agencies later this year.









	Phase 2 Study Design




	Revance’s Phase 2 trial is an open-label, sequential, dose-escalating study to evaluate the safety, preliminary efficacy and duration of effect of a single treatment of DaxibotulinumtoxinA Injectable (RT002) for isolated cervical dystonia. Thirty-seven subjects with moderate-to-severe cervical dystonia were enrolled at multiple sites in the United States. The trial’s first cohort of 12 subjects received a single dose of up to 200 units of RT002 injectable, the second cohort of 12 subjects received between 200 and 300 units, and the third cohort of 13 subjects received from 300 to 450 units.









	The primary efficacy endpoint of the Phase 2 study was an improvement in dystonia symptoms as measured by change (reduction) from baseline in Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS)-Total score at four weeks. TWSTRS is a validated composite scale that covers different features of the cervical dystonia condition. The first part of the scale evaluates severity of the condition based on the physical findings of dystonia, the second part rates the patient’s perceived level of disability, and the third part rates pain associated with the condition. The study protocol also feature a number of secondary efficacy endpoints.









	All subjects were followed for up to a total of 24 weeks after treatment, or until return of symptoms that warrant treatment, at which time subjects could complete the study. Due to the long duration of effect seen in the first cohort, subjects in the second and third cohorts were given the option to continue. Several patients elected to remain in the study and will be followed for up to 36 weeks.









	About Cervical Dystonia




	According to the Dystonia Medical Research Foundation, whose mission is to advance research, promote awareness and education, and support the needs of affected individuals, cervical dystonia is a painful condition in which the neck muscles contract involuntarily, causing abnormal movements and awkward posture of the head and neck. The movements may be sustained (tonic), jerky (clonic), or a combination. Cervical dystonia (also referred to as spasmodic torticollis) may be primary (meaning that it is the only apparent neurological disorder, with or without a family history) or may be brought about by secondary causes (such as physical trauma). It can result in considerable pain and discomfort.































	Treatments for cervical dystonia include oral medications, botulinum toxin injections, surgery, and complementary therapies. Botulinum toxin can help block the communication between the nerve and the muscle and may alleviate abnormal movements and postures. Current botulinum toxin treatments for cervical dystonia have a duration of effect of approximately three months. Cervical dystonia can occur at any age, although most individuals first experience symptoms in middle age. It affects several hundred thousand adults and children in the United States alone. Revance estimates the global market for treating muscle movement disorders with botulinum toxins, including cervical dystonia, was nearly $1 billion in 2015.

Revance Releases First Quarter 2017 Results




      - Completed Enrollment in SAKURA 1 & 2 Phase 3 Pivotal Trials of RT002 
      for Glabellar Lines -
    





May 09, 2017 04:05 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEWARK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Revance Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:RVNC), a biotechnology company 
      developing botulinum toxin products for use in treating aesthetic and 
      therapeutic conditions, today announced results for the first quarter 
      ended March 31, 2017.
    


Recent Highlights and Upcoming Milestones for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for 
      Injection (RT002)



        Completed enrollment for the SAKURA 1 & 2 Phase 3 pivotal trials of 
        RT002 injectable for the treatment of glabellar (frown) lines. The 
        SAKURA program is comprised of the two pivotal trials, plus a 
        long-term safety trial that continues to enroll subjects. Revance 
        plans to report topline results from the SAKURA 1 & 2 pivotal trials 
        in the fourth quarter of 2017.
      

        Presented safety, efficacy and duration-of-effect results from Phase 2 
        trials for RT002 injectable for the treatment of glabellar lines and 
        cervical dystonia at TOXINS 2017, the International Neurotoxin 
        Association Conference.
      

        Presented BELMONT Phase 2 clinical data of RT002 injectable for the 
        treatment of glabellar (frown) lines at the 2017 American Academy of 
        Dermatology Annual Meeting.
      

        Updated Phase 2 program for RT002 injectable in the management of 
        plantar fasciitis by expanding to a multi-center study with protocol 
        updates. The company plans to report topline results in the fourth 
        quarter of 2017.
      

        Expects to report 24-week results from all three cohorts of the Phase 
        2 open-label, sequential, dose-escalating study of RT002 for the 
        treatment of cervical dystonia in the second quarter of 2017.
      


      “Studies conducted to date with RT002 injectable involving both large 
      and small muscles indicate not only a strong safety profile, but also 
      that this next-generation neuromodulator can potentially deliver high 
      response rates, long duration of effect and high patient satisfaction. 
      These clinical results are like no other in the neuromodulator space,” 
      said Dan Browne, President and Chief Executive Officer at Revance. “We 
      expect to report results for our Phase 3 pivotal trials for glabellar 
      lines, the 24-week Phase 2 results for cervical dystonia and topline 
      Phase 2 results for our new indication, plantar fasciitis, all within 
      the next seven months.”
    

Summary Financial Results


Cash and investments as of March 31, 2017 were $188.6 million.
    

Research and development expenses for the three months ended 
      March 31, 2017 were $19.4 million compared to $12.4 million for the same 
      period in 2016. The increase in research and development expenses is 
      primarily due our SAKURA 1 and 2 Phase 3 pivotal trials of RT002 
      injectable.
    

General and administrative expenses for the three months ended 
      March 31, 2017 were $7.8 million compared to $7.5 million for the same 
      period in 2016. The increase in general and administrative expenses is 
      primarily due to increased costs related to personnel, offset by a 
      decrease in marketing expenses.
    

Total operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 
      2017 were $27.2 million compared to $19.8 million for the same period in 
      2016. Stock-based compensation for the three months ended March 31, 2017 
      was $3.2 million. When excluding depreciation and stock-based 
      compensation, total operating expenses for the three months ended March 
      31, 2017 were $23.7 million.
    

Net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $27.2 
      million compared to $19.9 million for the same period in 2016.
    

2017 Financial Outlook


      Revance reaffirmed its financial guidance provided in January 2017. 
      Revance expects cash burn for 2017 to be in the range of $102 to $112 
      million. Revance expects 2017 GAAP operating expense to be in the range 
      of $108 to $119 million, which when excluding depreciation of $1 to $2 
      million and estimated stock-based compensation of $13 to $15 million, 
      results in projected 2017 non-GAAP operating expense of $94 to $102 
      million. With three clinical programs underway, Revance anticipates 2017 
      GAAP research and development expense to be in the range of $75 to $83 
      million, which when excluding depreciation of $1 to $2 million and 
      estimated stock-based compensation of $5 to $6 million, results in 
      projected 2017 non-GAAP research and development expense of $69 to $75 
      million.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures


      Revance has presented certain non-GAAP financial measures in this 
      release. This release and the reconciliation tables included herein 
      include total non-GAAP operating expense and non-GAAP R&D expense, both 
      of which exclude depreciation and stock-based compensation. Revance 
      excludes depreciation costs and stock-based compensation expense because 
      management believes the exclusion of these items is helpful to investors 
      to evaluate Revance's recurring operational performance. Revance 
      management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to monitor and 
      evaluate its operating results and trends on an on-going basis, and 
      internally for operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. The 
      non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to results 
      prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a 
      substitute for or superior to GAAP results.

REVANCE THERAPEUTICS, INC. (NASDAQ:RVNC)Historical Stock Chart
2 Months : From May 2017 to Jul 2017



      - Poster on display today to be presented during late-breaking 
      session on June 7, 2017, at 21st International 
      Congress of Parkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorders -

      Revance Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: RVNC), a biotechnology company 
      developing botulinum toxin products for use in treating aesthetic and 
      therapeutic conditions, today announced additional clinical results from 
      its U.S. Phase 2 open-label, dose-escalating clinical study of 
      DaxibotulinumtoxinA Injectable (RT002) to treat moderate-to-severe 
      isolated cervical dystonia, a movement disorder of the neck, in adults. 
      A late-breaking poster including these data was displayed today and will 
      be presented on Wednesday, June 7, 2017, at 1:15 pm PT in Vancouver, 
      Canada, by study investigator Cynthia L. Comella, MD, Professor in the 
      Department of Neurological Sciences at Rush University Medical Center, 
      Chicago, Illinois.
    

      These results are in addition to findings reported on May 18, 2017, 
      which showed RT002 injectable to be generally safe and well-tolerated. 
      The previously reported findings also demonstrated duration of effect of 
      at least 24 weeks and that RT002 injectable delivered clinically 
      significant improvement in signs and symptoms of cervical dystonia as 
      determined by reduction of the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis 
      Rating Scale (TWSTRS)-Total score from baseline.
    

KEY NEW 24-WEEK FINDINGS


      • DURATION OF EFFECT AT LEAST 24 WEEKS BY DOSE GROUP: The 
      study researchers analyzed efficacy results in two dose groups: Dose 
      Group A (N=21), individuals who received 100 to 240 units of RT002 
      injectable, and Dose Group B (N=16), receiving 300 to 450 units. Median 
      duration of effect, defined as the number of weeks subjects maintained 
      at least 20% of the treatment benefit achieved at Week 4 (Target TWSTRS 
      Score), was greater than 24 weeks for both dose groups, consistent with 
      the ≥ 24-week duration of effect previously reported in each of the 
      trial’s three pre-specified patient cohorts.
    

      • TWSTRS-TOTAL AND SUBSCALE SCORES: RT002 injectable showed a 
      clinically significant mean reduction of the TWSTRS-Total score from 
      baseline at Week 4 – the primary efficacy endpoint – in both Group A 
      (37%) and Group B (39%), with the majority of this benefit maintained 
      through Week 24. In addition, clinically meaningful reductions in 
      TWSTRS-Severity, Disability and Pain subscales were consistent and 
      observed at all time points through Week 24.
    

      • RESPONSE RATES AND PATIENT-RATED QUALITY OF LIFE: A high rate 
      of response was observed in the study, with 94% of subjects at Week 6 
      experiencing a reduction of at least 20% from baseline in TWSTRS-Total 
      Score, and 68% of subjects at week 24 observed to maintain this 
      treatment benefit at Week 24. In addition, a mean reduction of 37% from 
      baseline in the Cervical Dystonia Impact Profile (CDIP-58) score was 
      observed at Week 6 for all subjects, with the majority of this 
      clinically meaningful benefit maintained through Week 24.
    

• SAFETY FINDINGS: As previously reported, RT002 
      injectable appeared to be generally safe and well-tolerated through Week 
      24 in all treatment groups evaluated. There were no serious adverse 
      events and no dose-dependent increase in adverse events. The 
      treatment-related adverse events were generally transient and mild to 
      moderate, with one case of neck pain reported as severe (day 10 onset, 
      duration of 2 days).
    

      “Cervical dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary 
      movements of the head and neck resulting in abnormal twisting postures 
      of the head that is frequently associated with pain. The treatment of 
      choice for cervical dystonia is botulinum toxin injections. 
      Unfortunately, the drawback of this therapy as currently available is 
      that patients must typically be re-treated at approximately 3 month 
      intervals in order to maintain benefit,” said trial investigator Cynthia 
      Comella, MD, Professor of Neurological Sciences, Rush University Medical 
      Center. “The data from the RT002 study indicate that this new 
      formulation of botulinum toxin serotype A may significantly improve 
      symptoms of cervical dystonia and have an impressive duration of benefit 
      of 24 weeks, which is twice as long as the toxins currently available. 
      Overall, I believe RT002 holds tremendous promise to provide cervical 
      dystonia patients a significant and longer-lasting improvement of their 
      symptoms.”
    

Additional data at 21st International Congress of Parkinson’s Disease 
      and Movement Disorders


      In addition to the late-breaking poster, a regular session poster with 
      guided tour is scheduled for Thursday, June 8, 2017, at 1:15 pm PT 
      presented by study investigator Atul Patel, MD, MHSA, Physical Medicine 
      and Rehabilitation Physician at Kansas City Bone & Joint.
    

      Once the posters are displayed at the congress, the company plans to add 
      a slide presentation of the poster contents to its website under the THERAPEUTICS 
      tab in the section entitled Presentations and Publications.
    

      Based on these Phase 2 results, the company expects to discuss next 
      steps in this clinical program with the US and EU regulatory agencies 
      later this year.
    

Phase 2 Study Design


      Revance’s Phase 2 trial is an open-label, sequential, dose-escalating 
      study to evaluate the safety, preliminary efficacy and duration of 
      effect of a single treatment of DaxibotulinumtoxinA Injectable (RT002) 
      for isolated cervical dystonia. Thirty-seven subjects with 
      moderate-to-severe cervical dystonia were enrolled at multiple sites in 
      the United States. The trial’s first cohort of 12 subjects received a 
      single dose of up to 200 units of RT002 injectable, the second cohort of 
      12 subjects received between 200 and 300 units, and the third cohort of 
      13 subjects received from 300 to 450 units.
    

      The primary efficacy endpoint of the Phase 2 study was an improvement in 
      dystonia symptoms as measured by change (reduction) from baseline in 
      Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS)-Total score 
      at four weeks. TWSTRS is a validated composite scale that covers 
      different features of the cervical dystonia condition. The first part of 
      the scale evaluates severity of the condition based on the physical 
      findings of dystonia, the second part rates the patient’s perceived 
      level of disability, and the third part rates pain associated with the 
      condition. The study protocol also feature a number of secondary 
      efficacy endpoints.
    

      All subjects were followed for up to a total of 24 weeks after 
      treatment, or until return of symptoms that warrant treatment, at which 
      time subjects could complete the study. Due to the long duration of 
      effect seen in the first cohort, subjects in the second and third 
      cohorts were given the option to continue. Several patients elected to 
      remain in the study and will be followed for up to 36 weeks.
    

About Cervical Dystonia


      According to the Dystonia Medical Research Foundation, whose mission is 
      to advance research, promote awareness and education, and support the 
      needs of affected individuals, cervical dystonia is a painful condition 
      in which the neck muscles contract involuntarily, causing abnormal 
      movements and awkward posture of the head and neck. The movements may be 
      sustained (tonic), jerky (clonic), or a combination. Cervical dystonia 
      (also referred to as spasmodic torticollis) may be primary (meaning that 
      it is the only apparent neurological disorder, with or without a family 
      history) or may be brought about by secondary causes (such as physical 
      trauma). It can result in considerable pain and discomfort.
    

      Treatments for cervical dystonia include oral medications, botulinum 
      toxin injections, surgery, and complementary therapies. Botulinum toxin 
      can help block the communication between the nerve and the muscle and 
      may alleviate abnormal movements and postures. Current botulinum toxin 
      treatments for cervical dystonia have a duration of effect of 
      approximately three months. Cervical dystonia can occur at any age, 
      although most individuals first experience symptoms in middle age. It 
      affects several hundred thousand adults and children in the United 
      States alone. Revance estimates the global market for treating muscle 
      movement disorders with botulinum toxins, including cervical dystonia, 
      was nearly $1 billion in 2015.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

(RVNC), a biotechnology company developing botulinum toxin products for use in treating aesthetic and therapeutic conditions, today announced results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.Recent Highlights and Upcoming Milestones for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection (RT002) Completed enrollment for the SAKURA 1 & 2 Phase 3 pivotal trials of RT002 injectable for the treatment of glabellar (frown) lines. The SAKURA program is comprised of the two pivotal trials, plus a long-term safety trial that continues to enroll subjects. Revance plans to report topline results from the SAKURA 1 & 2 pivotal trials in the fourth quarter of 2017.  Presented safety, efficacy and duration-of-effect results from Phase 2 trials for RT002 injectable for the treatment of glabellar lines and cervical dystonia at TOXINS 2017, the International Neurotoxin Association Conference.  Presented BELMONT Phase 2 clinical data of RT002 injectable for the treatment of glabellar (frown) lines at the 2017 American Academy of Dermatology Annual Meeting.  Updated Phase 2 program for RT002 injectable in the management of plantar fasciitis by expanding to a multi-center study with protocol updates. The company plans to report topline results in the fourth quarter of 2017.  Expects to report 24-week results from all three cohorts of the Phase 2 open-label, sequential, dose-escalating study of RT002 for the treatment of cervical dystonia in the second quarter of 2017. “Studies conducted to date with RT002 injectable involving both large and small muscles indicate not only a strong safety profile, but also that this next-generation neuromodulator can potentially deliver high response rates, long duration of effect and high patient satisfaction. These clinical results are like no other in the neuromodulator space,” said Dan Browne, President and Chief Executive Officer at Revance. “We expect to report results for our Phase 3 pivotal trials for glabellar lines, the 24-week Phase 2 results for cervical dystonia and topline Phase 2 results for our new indication, plantar fasciitis, all within the next seven months.”Summary Financial ResultsCash and investments as of March 31, 2017 were $188.6 million.Research and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $19.4 million compared to $12.4 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in research and development expenses is primarily due our SAKURA 1 and 2 Phase 3 pivotal trials of RT002 injectable.General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $7.8 million compared to $7.5 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to increased costs related to personnel, offset by a decrease in marketing expenses.Total operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $27.2 million compared to $19.8 million for the same period in 2016. Stock-based compensation for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $3.2 million. When excluding depreciation and stock-based compensation, total operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $23.7 million.Net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $27.2 million compared to $19.9 million for the same period in 2016.2017 Financial OutlookRevance reaffirmed its financial guidance provided in January 2017. Revance expects cash burn for 2017 to be in the range of $102 to $112 million. Revance expects 2017 GAAP operating expense to be in the range of $108 to $119 million, which when excluding depreciation of $1 to $2 million and estimated stock-based compensation of $13 to $15 million, results in projected 2017 non-GAAP operating expense of $94 to $102 million. With three clinical programs underway, Revance anticipates 2017 GAAP research and development expense to be in the range of $75 to $83 million, which when excluding depreciation of $1 to $2 million and estimated stock-based compensation of $5 to $6 million, results in projected 2017 non-GAAP research and development expense of $69 to $75 million.Conference CallIndividuals interested in listening to the conference call today, May 9, at 1:30pm PT/4:30pm ET, may do so by dialing (855) 453-3827 for domestic callers, or (484) 756-4301 for international callers and reference conference ID: 3251601; or from the webcast link in the investor relations section of the Company's website at: http://investors.revance.com/index.cfm.A replay of the call will be available beginning today at 4:30pm PT/7:30pm ET through 4:30pm PT/7:30pm ET on May 10, 2017.
