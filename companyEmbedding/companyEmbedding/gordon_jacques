The CIA Honors a “Trio of Titans” at the 2017 Leadership Awards
Posted: Monday, February 27, 2017












Hyde Park, NY – After raising a record $1 million for student scholarships at
  the 2016 Leadership Awards gala, The Culinary Institute
    of America is setting its sights high for this year’s event. On Wednesday,
  April 19, more than 600 foodservice and hospitality industry leaders, celebrity
  chefs, CIA alumni, and other luminaries from business and
  entertainment will come together at the American Museum of Natural History on
  New York City’s Upper West Side to honor a “Trio of Titans.”During the festivities, Dr.
  Tim Ryan, president of the CIA, will present the Augie Award™ to 
three individuals who, through their prolific life’s work, have
  transformed and elevated the food and hospitality industry—helping it 
garner
  the respect it deserves. Created in tribute to famed French chef 
Auguste Escoffier, the Augie Awards recognize the achievement of 
visionaries, entrepreneurs, and chefs. This years’ honorees embody the 
qualities of leadership,
  strength, determination, and innovation:Shep Gordon: Talent manager for rock stars,
    Hollywood agent, film producer, and New
      York Times bestselling author, Shep Gordon is
    also credited with creating the celebrity chef category. The subject of an
    award-winning Mike Myers documentary film, Supermensch, he penned his own memoir, They
      Call Me Supermensch, in 2016.Jacques Pépin: A former columnist for The New York Times, his articles have appeared in countless food
    magazines. Chef Pépin’s awards include France’s
    highest civilian honor, La Legion d’Honneur; 16 James Beard Foundation Awards, including
    the Life-time Achievement Award; and an Emmy Award for his PBS series with
    Julia Child.Martha Stewart: Emmy Award-winning television host, bestselling author, trusted lifestyle
    expert, and respected business entrepreneur, Martha Stewart’s brand of
    high-quality household and garden products are sold at major retailers
    nationwide. Her latest television show pairs her with rap star, Snoop Dogg.“Martha Stewart, Jacques Pepin, and Shep Gordon all have a commitment to excellence that mirrors the core values of the
  CIA,” says Dr. Ryan. “They are all trailblazers, innovators, and provide
  tremendous inspiration to our students and alumni alike. We are proud to honor
  them.”The evening will begin with a lavish menu of hors d’oeuvre
  prepared by guest chefs, many of whom are CIA alumni, followed by a sit down
  dinner. There will also be an online auction, to open for bidding two weeks
  prior to the gala, to raise additional scholarship funds. More than two dozen
  current CIA students—from the associate and bachelor’s
    programs—will also be on hand to assist the event chefs and add their
  personal thank-you’s to all in attendance.A not-for-profit institution, the CIA is accredited by the
  Middle States Commission on Higher Education, the same organization that
  accredits universities like Princeton and Columbia. More than 90 percent of the
  CIA student body depends on some type of financial aid, and the Leadership
  Awards is its largest annual fundraising program. The college relies on
  alliances with the private and public sectors to achieve its goal of excellence
  and to maintain its reputation as the world’s premier culinary college.Information about tickets and sponsorship opportunities,
  along with more details about the event are available online.
