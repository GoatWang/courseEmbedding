 FORT - Contrarian | CTA Performance



























































Home|
Glossary







Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) provide advice and services related to trading and investment strategies utilizing futures contracts and options on futures contracts on a wide variety of physical goods such as agricultural products, forest products, metals, and energy, plus derivative contracts on financial instruments such as indices, bonds, and currencies. Each CTA is characterized by its respective trading strategy and the markets it trades. CTAs are regulated by the United States federal government through registration with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and membership in the National Futures Association (NFA)†.
The CTA information presented on www.ctaperformance.com was compiled by Equinox Fund Management, LLC, based upon information provided by each respective manager of commodity futures and foreign currency trading programs tracked by Equinox Fund Management and its affiliates. The CTA performance information does not contain opinion or analysis of Equinox Fund Management or any of its affiliates, and the completeness and accuracy of performance information reported to Equinox Fund Management cannot in all cases be independently verified. Please note that the CTA performance may not be reflective of actual fund performance. For the most recent performance figures, please refer to each respective commodity trading advisors website or marketing literature.
Performance information illustrated on this site is "net" of all fees and charges, and includes interest income applicable to the accounts comprising each composite performance summary. Performance results of individual accounts may vary as a result of differing fees, account size, the timing of entry of orders, and other factors. The performance results are not indicative of the results that may be achieved in the future.

Company background
Founded by Drs. Yves Balcer and Sanjiv Kumar in January 1993, where they remain today as principals. FORT became registered as a commodity trading advisor, NFA member and commodity pool operator in October of 1999.
Investment goal
FORT's goal is to generate the highest quality of risk-adjusted returns.   Capital is allocated dynamically over time frames, models and markets (contracts) based on a statistical learning process. This learning process tends to favor winners and losers for an allocation, while shying away from average performers (time frame, models and markets).
Markets traded
Interest rates, currencies, equity indices, energy, precious metals
Strategy
FORT’s goal is to generate the highest quality of risk-adjusted returns for its clients. FORT’s Contrarian strategy is a technical, fully systematic, trend-anticipation strategy that tries to capture performance around trends in a novel way. Traditional trend-following strategies are usually late to enter and late to exit because they must wait for confirmation of a trend to enter or exit their positions. By design, the Contrarian strategy is usually early in entering and exiting trends.
The strategy systematically tries to identify price behaviors that signal turning points in the markets and then takes positions in those markets while the price is still moving in the opposite direction.  In addition to capturing a fundamentally different part of the trend movement from traditional trend-followers, this system design allows the Contrarian strategy to perform better than traditional trend-followers in choppy markets because it also captures performance in shorter-term market movements, or noise, around the trend. The strategy is constructed to be statistically robust which enables it to perform well over the long-term.
Capital is allocated dynamically over time frames, models and markets (contracts) based on a statistical learning process. This learning process tends to favor winners and losers for an allocation, while shying away from average performers (time frame, models and markets). The selection process uses Bayesian statistical techniques, where FORT’s prior is the statistical prediction of the past. Thus, the strategy evolves incrementally each day.

There are substantial risks and potential conflicts of interest associated with managed futures programs. The success of an investment in such a program is dependent upon the ability of a commodity trading advisor (“CTA”) to identify profitable investment opportunities and successfully trade. The identification of attractive trading opportunities is difficult, requires skill, and involves a significant degree of uncertainty. The high degree of leverage often obtainable in futures trading can work against you as well as for you, and can lead to large losses. Returns generated from a CTA’s trading, if any, may not adequately compensate you for the business and financial risks you assume. You can lose all or a substantial amount of your investment. Managed futures accounts may be subject to substantial charges for management and advisory fees. It may be necessary for accounts that are subject to these charges to make substantial trading profits in order to avoid depletion or exhaustion of their assets. CTAs may trade highly illiquid markets, or on foreign markets, and may not be able to close or offset positions immediately upon request. You may have market exposure even after the CTA has a request for closure or liquidation.
PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. THERE IS RISK OF LOSS. YOU CAN LOSE MONEY IN A MANAGED FUTURES PROGRAM.
