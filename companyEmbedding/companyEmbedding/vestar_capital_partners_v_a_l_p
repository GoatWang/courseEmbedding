VCA Antech, Inc., to Acquire MediMedia Animal Health, LLC, Unit of MediMedia USA, Inc.LOS ANGELES & CARLSTADT, NJ, July 11, 2011 (BUSINESS WIRE) – VCA Antech, Inc. (NASDAQ Global Select Market: WOOF), a leading animal healthcare company in the United States, and MediMedia USA, Inc., a leading innovative specialty healthcare communications, publishing and medical education company, today announced the signing of a definitive agreement for VCA Antech to acquire MediMedia Animal Health, LLC from MediMedia for $146 million in cash. Vetstreet, located in Yardley, Pennsylvania, is the nation's largest provider of online communications, professional education and marketing solutions to the veterinary community and is a subsidiary of MediMedia, a portfolio company of Vestar Capital Partners V, L.P. and certain of its affiliates.
The acquisition is conditioned on the expiration or earlier termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended and other customary conditions. Closing is expected between August 2011 and early September 2011.
Bob Antin, Chairman and CEO of VCA Antech, Inc., stated, "We are excited about combining Vetstreet with our existing businesses. We believe that this combination will provide both companies with outstanding growth opportunities. Vetstreet has a history of strong year over year revenue growth including growth of approximately 72% from 2009 to 2010 as well as an estimated growth rate in excess of 50% from 2010 to 2011. Vetstreet's innovative approach to providing valuable services to both veterinarians and pet owners, combined with our considerable presence in both the animal hospital and diagnostic laboratory businesses, will expand the breadth of our product offerings to the veterinary community.
"The long-term synergies provided by combining Vetstreet with our existing businesses are extremely meaningful to each of our three business segments. Vetstreet's online communication tools will help increase client visits to the over 16,000 Antech clients, as well as our own animal hospitals, and strengthen the bond between the pet owner and her veterinarian. Vetstreet's educational services round out the offering to assure that Vetstreet will be the focal point between the pet owner and his or her veterinarian."
Vetstreet currently offers a highly differentiated suite of products and services to the veterinary community, including:

VetInsite Analytics provides data and reports to pharmaceutical and nutritional companies that allow them to track market share at both the local and national level. In addition, Vetstreet executes direct marketing programs in conjunction with the veterinarian to grow product sales and increase traffic to the animal hospital.
Vetstreet will soon launch a veterinarian-supported consumer portal, vetstreet.com, providing education, referral and e-commerce support for the pet owner. Vetstreet's consumer strategy is grounded in promoting the relationship between the pet owner and their veterinarian through direct links to subscribing veterinary practices, including online communication vehicles that serve to strengthen the connection between clients and veterinary hospitals.
Vetstreet Pro, a bundle of communications services for the veterinarian, promotes the connectivity and bond between the practice and the pet owner. Over 4,500 practices located in the US and Canada, with over 20 million active clients, currently use Vetstreet Pro, including practice websites, personalized and secured pet owner portals, automated reminder cards, automated ID cards and practice analytics to increase client visits and drive compliance and persistency in a medically appropriate way.
For over 30 years, Vetlearn and its predecessors have been the leader in providing world-class continuing education to animal health professionals throughout the industry with leading publications such as Compendium, Veterinary Technician and the recently re-launched professional education portal Vetlearn.com. Over 50,000 veterinary professionals have taken part in Vetlearn's continuing education programs.

Mr. Antin continued, "Vetstreet's annual revenues are expected to grow to $55 to $65 million in 2012. The impact on earnings per share is expected to be slightly dilutive (approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per fully diluted share) in the current year and accretive thereafter. I have known and worked with the Vetstreet management team for over 10 years and am excited that the entire team, led by Derrick Kraemer, President, and Jeff Gaidos, Executive Vice President, is expected to continue with Vetstreet following the closing."
Derrick Kraemer, president of Vetstreet, stated, "For years, veterinary professionals and pet owners have valued VCA Antech's dedicated leadership in helping pets reach their full potential through quality practice health care and world-class diagnostic services. Vetstreet is excited to join VCA Antech and to continue to serve the veterinary community with our leading turnkey client communication platform (Vetstreet®) and our industry leading continuing educational portal (Vetlearn.comTM)."
Norm Alpert, Chairman of the MediMedia Management Committee and Managing Director and Co-Founder of Vestar Capital Partners, stated, "We are extremely pleased with this transaction. Vetstreet's president, Derrick Kraemer, and the rest of the Vetstreet team have done a fantastic job growing their business into the industry leader in veterinary practice communication, education and marketing tools, and this transaction with VCA is a validation of this success."
Piper Jaffray & Co. served as the exclusive financial advisor to Vetstreet.

KKR, Vestar and Centerview Enter into Agreement to Acquire Del Monte FoodsSAN FRANCISCO, Nov 25, 2010 (BUSINESS WIRE)
Del Monte Foods Company (NYSE: DLM) and an investor group led by funds affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. ("KKR"), Vestar Capital Partners ("Vestar") and Centerview Partners ("Centerview") - collectively the "Sponsors"- today announced that they have signed a definitive agreement under which the Sponsors will acquire Del Monte for $19.00 per share in cash. 
The transaction, which was unanimously approved by Del Monte's board of directors, is valued at approximately $5.3 billion, including the assumption of approximately $1.3 billion in net debt. This price represents a premium of approximately 40 percent over Del Monte's average closing share price during the past three months prior to November 18, 2010, when market rumors of a transaction began, and is also higher than any price the Company's stock has ever achieved. 
"This transaction delivers substantial shareholder value and is a clear endorsement of Del Monte's strategic success and effective execution. The hard work and dedication of our talented team has helped to transform Del Monte from a $1 billion consumer foods business into a branded pet and consumer products company with more than $3.7 billion in revenues," said Richard G. Wolford, Chairman and CEO of Del Monte Foods. "This transaction will enable our Company to continue to successfully grow, building on the foundation our team has put into place. We are excited about the ability to deliver substantial returns to our shareholders, as well as great prospects for Del Monte employees, customers and consumers." 
Simon Brown, Member of KKR and head of the firm's North American Consumer practice, stated, "Del Monte has a first-rate brand portfolio and excellent reputation for providing high quality and nutritious products to families and their pets. We look forward to working with the Company's talented employees and investing in the business as we continue to execute upon Del Monte's proven strategy for growth. Del Monte is a great company, with an excellent strategy, a talented team and a strong future." 
Brian Ratzan, Managing Director and head of Vestar's Consumer group said, "Del Monte Foods is a terrific company with iconic consumer and pet brands. Storied consumer franchises like Del Monte's - with great brands in growing categories - will continue to thrive through investments in innovation and marketing. Vestar looks forward to working with the Del Monte team and our strategic partners to achieve the Company's next phase of growth." 
"Over the last decade, Rick and the entire Del Monte team have built a unique platform based on powerful brands," said Jim Kilts, Centerview's co-founder and former CEO of Kraft, Nabisco and Gillette. "We are truly excited to partner with Del Monte as the Company continues to build on its rich heritage of delivering high quality products to consumers at attractive prices." 
Del Monte plans to maintain a corporate presence in both the San Francisco Bay Area and Pittsburgh, with its corporate headquarters continuing to be located in San Francisco. 
Barclays Capital Inc. served as financial advisor to Del Monte Foods and provided a fairness opinion in connection with the transaction. Perella Weinberg Partners LP also provided a fairness opinion in connection with the transaction. Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP served as legal advisor to the Company in connection with this transaction. 
Centerview Partners acted as lead financial advisor to the Sponsors in this transaction. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan Securities and Morgan Stanley also advised on this transaction. The Sponsors' lead legal advisor was Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP. 
The Sponsors have secured committed debt financing from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays Capital Inc., JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and KKR Capital Markets LLC. The agreement permits Del Monte to solicit alternative proposals from third parties through January 8, 2011. The Del Monte Foods board of directors, with the assistance of its advisors, will actively solicit acquisition proposals during this period. There can be no assurance this process will result in a higher offer. If there is not a superior offer, the transaction is expected to close by the end of March 2011, subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of shareholder and regulatory approvals. Del Monte does not intend to disclose developments with respect to the solicitation process unless and until the Board has made a decision. 
Del Monte also announced today that it will no longer host a conference call/webcast to discuss its fiscal 2011 second quarter results on Thursday, December 2, 2010.

Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties and the Company cautions readers that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any such forward-looking statement. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in this press release include, among others: uncertainties as to the timing of the acquisition; the possibility that competing offers will be made; the possibility that various closing conditions for the acquisition may not be satisfied or waived, including that a governmental entity may prohibit or refuse to grant approval for the consummation of the acquisition; general economic and business conditions; and other factors. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements included in this press release, which speak only as of the date hereof. The Company does not undertake to update any of these statements in light of new information or future events. 
Additional Information and Where to Find It
In connection with the proposed merger, Del Monte Foods Company will prepare a proxy statement to be filed with the SEC. When completed, a definitive proxy statement and a form of proxy will be mailed to the stockholders of the Company. THE COMPANY'S SECURITY HOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT REGARDING THE PROPOSED MERGER BECAUSE IT WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION. The Company's stockholders will be able to obtain, without charge, a copy of the proxy statement (when available) and other relevant documents filed with the SEC from the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. The Company's stockholders will also be able to obtain, without charge, a copy of the proxy statement and other relevant documents (when available) by directing a request by mail or telephone to Del Monte Foods Company, Attn: Corporate Secretary, P.O. Box 193575, San Francisco, California 94119-3575, telephone: (415) 247-3000, or from the Company's website, www.delmonte.com. 
The Company and its directors and officers may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from the Company's stockholders with respect to the proposed merger. Information about the Company's directors and executive officers and their ownership of the Company's common stock is set forth in the proxy statement for the Company's 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which was filed with the SEC on August 16, 2010. Stockholders may obtain additional information regarding the interests of the Company and its directors and executive officers in the proposed merger, which may be different than those of the Company's stockholders generally, by reading the proxy statement and other relevant documents regarding the proposed merger, when filed with the SEC.

History[edit]
Vestar is a leading private equity firm specializing in management buyouts and growth capital investments. Vestar was founded in 1988 by principals of The First Boston Corporation’s Management Buyout Group.[2] Five of the original founders, including Daniel O'Connell, Norman Alpert, Robert L. Rosner, James P. Kelley, and Arthur Nagle, are still with the firm.
Since the firm's founding in 1988, the Vestar funds have completed 70 investments in companies with a total value of more than $40 billion.
Investment funds[edit]
Since its inception in 1988, Vestar has raised six private equity funds with total investor commitments of approximately more than $9 billion. Of these funds, five have been fully invested and two have been fully liquidated. Vestar is actively evaluating middle-market investment opportunities for its sixth fund, Vestar Capital Partners VI.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
