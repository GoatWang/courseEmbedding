Silverware for Fine Dining
Dress up those lovely tablecloth ;with some beautifully crafted silverware sets. Impress the guests and dine like royalty with an elegantly designed flatware set, boasting a glamorous look and feel. Or, keep it simple and traditional with an array of no-frills utensils that are easy to store and maintain—either style will provide a marvelous dining experience that’s sure to bring a smile (and delicious food) to their faces. Choose complementing textures from a diverse range of options—sleek mirror-like lustrous finishes exudes an eye-catching aura while a smooth satin texture is understated yet timeless. Be sure to choose a set that best fits the style of the kitchen and dining room tabl for maximum effect! For some jobs your standard butter knife just won’t cut it – pun intended. When it gets a little tough to cut through even the tenderest steak, toss those dull knives out, and get a brand new Top Chef stainless steel steak knives set. Our silverware sets come from long standing and trusted brands, such as Oneida and Pfaltzgraff, which have kept American kitchens outfitted with the best quality flatware around.
 
When the meals end, there’s no need to dread cleaning up. Many of our silverware and flatware sets are dishwasher safe, allowing you to focus on more enjoying a calm evening with friends and family. Stainless steel is an especially convenient, being simple to clean and maintain—that means less time cleaning and more time to enjoy all the little things that make life great!

Dinnerware Sets for Entertaining
What better way to present the results of your cooking than nestled on top of a fancy dinnerware set? It’s about time to replace your chipped, faded and aging plates and bowls with shiny new ones! Choose from our broad range of fine place settings, from elegant porcelain sets to classic ceramic and stoneware dinner plates. Colors vary from clean and classic white that makes food stand out to soft pastel shades that can accentuate your tablecloths and table runners. Or, make a bold proclamation with some eye-grabbing dish sets that infuse meals with a contemporary flair. Textures and materials play a role as well—lovely porcelain and china is a beautiful choice, but for something a bit more robust, a set of glazed stoneware can’t be beat.
 
One more thing to remember is to coordinate the dining room table and dining room chairs with the new tableware—it might sound like a lot of work, but that moment when everything is set, the guests are seated and food is finally presented on your immaculately assembled dining tablescape—that one moment will be more than worth it!
 
Dinner Plates for Every Occasion
Bring a double dose of dazzle to your dinner table with gorgeous new dinner plates to compliment your culinary skills. We carry stoneware dinner plates, which are fantastic choices for everyday use thanks to their durability and chip resistance. Stoneware is made with refined clay and fired at higher temperatures than Earthenware. Melamine is also another dinnerware material that is great for everyday use because it’s practically indestructible! It’s highly resistant to breaking and scratch marks from utensils. If you’re the parent of small children, melamine dishes are an excellent investment. Porcelain and china are classic formal dinner plate materials. Their light weight and beautiful designs only add to the decadence of a formal meal. No matter the type of material you choose, you’ll find a budget friendly option at JCPenney.
