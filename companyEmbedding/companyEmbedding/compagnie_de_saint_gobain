History[edit]
1665-1789: Manufacture royale[edit]
Since the middle of the 17th century, luxury products such as silk textiles, lace and mirrors were in high demand. In the 1660s, mirrors had become very popular among the upper classes of society: Italian cabinets, châteaux and ornate side tables and pier-tables were decorated with this expensive and luxurious product. At the time, however, the French were not known for mirror technology; instead, the Republic of Venice was known as the world leader in glass manufacturing, controlling a technical and commercial monopoly of the glass and mirror business.[citation needed] French minister of finance Jean-Baptiste Colbert wanted France to become completely self-sufficient in meeting domestic demand for luxury products, thereby strengthening the national economy.[3]
Colbert established by letters patent the public enterprise Manufacture royale de glaces de miroirs (French pronunciation: ​[manyfaktyʁ ʁwajal də ɡlas də miʁwaʁ], Royal Mirror-Glass Factory) in October 1665.[4] The company was created for a period of twenty years and would be financed in part by the State. The beneficiary and first director was the French financier Nicolas du Noyer, receiver of taxes of Orléans,[5] who was granted a monopoly of making glass and mirror-glass for a period of twenty years. The company had the informal name Compagnie du Noyer.




An Early Saint-Gobain Emblem


To compete with the Italian mirror industry, Colbert commissioned several Venetian glassworkers he had enticed to Paris to work for the company. The first unblemished mirrors were produced in 1666.[6] Soon the mirrors created in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, under the French company, began to rival those of Venice. The French company was capable of producing mirrors that were 40 to 45 inches long (1.0 to 1.1 m), which at the time was considered impressive. Competition between France and the Venetians became so fierce that Venice considered it a crime for any glass artisan to leave and practice their trade elsewhere, especially in foreign territory. Nicolas du Noyer complained in writing that the jealous Venetians were unwilling to impart the secrets of glassmaking to the French workers, and that the Company was hard-pressed to pay its expenses. The distractions of Paris proved distracting to the workers, and supplies of firewood to stoke the furnaces were dearer in the capital than elsewhere. In 1667 the glass-making was transferred to a small glass furnace already working at Tourlaville, near Cherbourg in Normandy, and the premises in Faubourg Saint-Antoine were devoted to glass-grinding and polishing the crude product.
Though the Compagnie du Noyer was reduced at times to importing Venetian glass and finishing it in France, by September 1672 the royal French manufacturer was on a sufficiently sound footing for the importation of glass to be forbidden to any of Louis' subjects, under any conditions.[7] In 1678, the company produced the glass for the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles.
In 1683 the company's financial arrangement with the State was renewed for another two decades. However, in 1688 the rival Compagnie Thévart was created, also financed in part by the state. Compagnie Thévart used a new pouring process that allowed it to make plate glass mirrors measuring at least 60 by 40 inches wide (1.5 by 1.0 m), much bigger than the 40 inches (1.0 m) which the Compagnie du Noyer could create.
The two companies were in competition for seven years, until 1695, when the economy slowed down and their technical and commercial rivalry became counterproductive. Under an order from the French government, the two companies were forced to merge, creating the Compagnie Plastier.
In 1702 Compagnie Plastier declared bankruptcy. A group of Franco-Swiss Protestant bankers rescued the collapsing company, changing the name to Compagnie Dagincourt. At the same time, the company was provided royal patents which allowed it to maintain a legal monopoly in the glass-manufacturing industry up until the French Revolution (1789), despite fierce, sometimes violent, protests from free enterprise partisans.
1789-1910: Industrial Revolution[edit]
In 1789, as a consequence of the French Revolution, the state financial and competitive privileges accorded to Compagnie Dagincourt were abolished. The company now had to depend on the participation and capital of private investors, although it continued to remain partly under the control of the French state.
In the 1820s, Saint-Gobain continued to function as it had under the Ancien Régime, manufacturing high-quality mirrors and glass for the luxury market. However, in 1824, a new glass manufacturer was established in Commentry, France, and in 1837 several Belgian glass manufacturers were also founded. While Saint-Gobain continued to dominate the luxury high-quality mirror and glass markets, its newly created competitors focused their attention on making medium and low-quality products. The manufacture of products of such quality made mirrors and glass affordable for the masses. In response, the company extended its product line to include lower-quality glass and mirrors.
In 1830, just as Louis-Philippe became King of the newly restored French Monarchy, Saint-Gobain was transformed into a Public Limited Company and became independent from the state for the first time.
While mirrors remained their primary business, Saint-Gobain began to diversify their product line to include glass panes for skylights, roofs and room dividers, thick mirrors, semi-thick glass for windows, laminated mirrors and glass and finally embossed mirrors and window panes. Some of the more famous buildings that Saint-Gobain contributed to during that period were the Crystal Palace in London, le Jardin des Plantes, les Grand et Petit Palais and les Halles in Paris, and Milan railway station.
Saint-Gobain merged with another French glass and mirror manufacturer, Saint-Quirin, in the mid-19th century. After the merger, the company was able to gain control of 25% of European glass and mirror production (before, it had only controlled 10–15%). In response to growing international competition, the company began to open up new manufacturing facilities in countries without any domestic manufacturers.[where?]
Saint-Gobain cast the glass blanks of some of the largest optical reflecting telescopes of the early 20th century, including the ground-breaking 60-inch (1.5 m) Hale telescope (online in 1908) and 100 inch (2.5 m) Hooker telescope (online 1917) at Mount Wilson Observatory (USA), and the 72-inch (1.8 m) Plaskett telescope (online in 1918) at Dominion Astrophysical Observatory (Canada).
1910-1950: Post Industrial Revolution[edit]
Saint-Gobain experienced significant success in the early 20th century. In 1918 the company expanded its manufacturing to bottles, jars, tableware and domestic glassware.
In 1920, Saint-Gobain extended its businesses to fibreglass manufacture. Fibreglass was being used to create insulation, industrial textiles and building reinforcements. In 1937 the company founded Isover, a subsidiary fibreglass insulation manufacturer.
During this period, the company developed three new glassmaking techniques and processes; first, a dipping technique used to coat car windows, which prevented glass from shattering in the event of an accident. As a result of that technique, 10% of Saint-Gobain's 1920 sales came from the car industry, and 28% in 1930. Second, a few years later, another technique was developed that allowed glass to be shaped and bent.[clarification needed] Finally, a process was developed to coat glass with aluminum, allowing it to be used as a conductor, and allowed the company to create products such as radiavers (a glass heater).
1950–1970: Pont-à-Mousson merger[edit]
Between 1950 and 1969, Saint-Gobain's sales rose at a rate of 10% per year. Its work force grew from 35,000 in 1950 to 100,000 in 1969. By the end of the 1960s, Saint-Gobain had more than 150 subsidiaries under its control.
Glass and fiberglass sales benefited from the booming construction industry and the rise in mass consumption after the Second World War. Saint-Gobain's yearly glass production went from 3.5 million square metres (38 million square feet) in 1950 to 45 million square metres (480 million square feet) in 1969. In 1950, fiberglass only represented 4% of the company's turnover, but by 1969, this had grown to 20%.
Domestic sales in France accounted for only a fifth of the company's revenue. Spain, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Belgium were also important markets.
In 1968, Boussois-Souchon-Neuvesel (BSN), a French industrial group, made a hostile takeover bid for Saint-Gobain. The company looked for a "white knight" to help fend off the bid. Multinational corporation Suez suggested that Saint-Gobain and Pont-à-Mousson (another French industrial group) should merge, in order to maintain independence from BSN. After the merger, Saint-Gobain-Pont-à-Mousson, later known simply by the name "Saint-Gobain", produced pipes in addition to glass and fiberglass.
1971–1986: Nationalisation[edit]
The next fifteen years were a time of change and reorganization for the newly merged companies. In the 1970s, Western economies were suffering a sharp downturn. Saint-Gobain's financial performance was adversely affected by the economic and petrol crisis.
In 1981 and 1982, ten of France's top-performing companies were nationalized by the socialist Fifth Republic of France. By February 1982, Saint-Gobain was officially controlled by the state. However, the company did not last long as a government-owned corporation; it was re-privatized in 1987.
1986–present: Expansion[edit]
When Saint-Gobain once again became a private enterprise, control of the company quickly changed hands. Jean-Louis Beffa, an engineer and graduate of the École Polytechnique, became the CEO. Beffa invested heavily in research and development and pushed strongly for the company to produce engineered materials, such as abrasives and ceramics.
Under Beffa, the company continued to expand internationally, setting up foreign factories, and acquiring many of its foreign competitors. In 1996 the company bought Poliet (the French building and construction distribution group) and its subsidiaries, such as Point P. and Lapeyre. This expanded Saint-Gobain's product line into construction materials and their distribution.

History[edit]
1665-1789: Manufacture royale[edit]
Since the middle of the 17th century, luxury products such as silk textiles, lace and mirrors were in high demand. In the 1660s, mirrors had become very popular among the upper classes of society: Italian cabinets, châteaux and ornate side tables and pier-tables were decorated with this expensive and luxurious product. At the time, however, the French were not known for mirror technology; instead, the Republic of Venice was known as the world leader in glass manufacturing, controlling a technical and commercial monopoly of the glass and mirror business.[citation needed] French minister of finance Jean-Baptiste Colbert wanted France to become completely self-sufficient in meeting domestic demand for luxury products, thereby strengthening the national economy.[3]
Colbert established by letters patent the public enterprise Manufacture royale de glaces de miroirs (French pronunciation: ​[manyfaktyʁ ʁwajal də ɡlas də miʁwaʁ], Royal Mirror-Glass Factory) in October 1665.[4] The company was created for a period of twenty years and would be financed in part by the State. The beneficiary and first director was the French financier Nicolas du Noyer, receiver of taxes of Orléans,[5] who was granted a monopoly of making glass and mirror-glass for a period of twenty years. The company had the informal name Compagnie du Noyer.




An Early Saint-Gobain Emblem


To compete with the Italian mirror industry, Colbert commissioned several Venetian glassworkers he had enticed to Paris to work for the company. The first unblemished mirrors were produced in 1666.[6] Soon the mirrors created in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, under the French company, began to rival those of Venice. The French company was capable of producing mirrors that were 40 to 45 inches long (1.0 to 1.1 m), which at the time was considered impressive. Competition between France and the Venetians became so fierce that Venice considered it a crime for any glass artisan to leave and practice their trade elsewhere, especially in foreign territory. Nicolas du Noyer complained in writing that the jealous Venetians were unwilling to impart the secrets of glassmaking to the French workers, and that the Company was hard-pressed to pay its expenses. The distractions of Paris proved distracting to the workers, and supplies of firewood to stoke the furnaces were dearer in the capital than elsewhere. In 1667 the glass-making was transferred to a small glass furnace already working at Tourlaville, near Cherbourg in Normandy, and the premises in Faubourg Saint-Antoine were devoted to glass-grinding and polishing the crude product.
Though the Compagnie du Noyer was reduced at times to importing Venetian glass and finishing it in France, by September 1672 the royal French manufacturer was on a sufficiently sound footing for the importation of glass to be forbidden to any of Louis' subjects, under any conditions.[7] In 1678, the company produced the glass for the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles.
In 1683 the company's financial arrangement with the State was renewed for another two decades. However, in 1688 the rival Compagnie Thévart was created, also financed in part by the state. Compagnie Thévart used a new pouring process that allowed it to make plate glass mirrors measuring at least 60 by 40 inches wide (1.5 by 1.0 m), much bigger than the 40 inches (1.0 m) which the Compagnie du Noyer could create.
The two companies were in competition for seven years, until 1695, when the economy slowed down and their technical and commercial rivalry became counterproductive. Under an order from the French government, the two companies were forced to merge, creating the Compagnie Plastier.
In 1702 Compagnie Plastier declared bankruptcy. A group of Franco-Swiss Protestant bankers rescued the collapsing company, changing the name to Compagnie Dagincourt. At the same time, the company was provided royal patents which allowed it to maintain a legal monopoly in the glass-manufacturing industry up until the French Revolution (1789), despite fierce, sometimes violent, protests from free enterprise partisans.
1789-1910: Industrial Revolution[edit]
In 1789, as a consequence of the French Revolution, the state financial and competitive privileges accorded to Compagnie Dagincourt were abolished. The company now had to depend on the participation and capital of private investors, although it continued to remain partly under the control of the French state.
In the 1820s, Saint-Gobain continued to function as it had under the Ancien Régime, manufacturing high-quality mirrors and glass for the luxury market. However, in 1824, a new glass manufacturer was established in Commentry, France, and in 1837 several Belgian glass manufacturers were also founded. While Saint-Gobain continued to dominate the luxury high-quality mirror and glass markets, its newly created competitors focused their attention on making medium and low-quality products. The manufacture of products of such quality made mirrors and glass affordable for the masses. In response, the company extended its product line to include lower-quality glass and mirrors.
In 1830, just as Louis-Philippe became King of the newly restored French Monarchy, Saint-Gobain was transformed into a Public Limited Company and became independent from the state for the first time.
While mirrors remained their primary business, Saint-Gobain began to diversify their product line to include glass panes for skylights, roofs and room dividers, thick mirrors, semi-thick glass for windows, laminated mirrors and glass and finally embossed mirrors and window panes. Some of the more famous buildings that Saint-Gobain contributed to during that period were the Crystal Palace in London, le Jardin des Plantes, les Grand et Petit Palais and les Halles in Paris, and Milan railway station.
Saint-Gobain merged with another French glass and mirror manufacturer, Saint-Quirin, in the mid-19th century. After the merger, the company was able to gain control of 25% of European glass and mirror production (before, it had only controlled 10–15%). In response to growing international competition, the company began to open up new manufacturing facilities in countries without any domestic manufacturers.[where?]
Saint-Gobain cast the glass blanks of some of the largest optical reflecting telescopes of the early 20th century, including the ground-breaking 60-inch (1.5 m) Hale telescope (online in 1908) and 100 inch (2.5 m) Hooker telescope (online 1917) at Mount Wilson Observatory (USA), and the 72-inch (1.8 m) Plaskett telescope (online in 1918) at Dominion Astrophysical Observatory (Canada).
1910-1950: Post Industrial Revolution[edit]
Saint-Gobain experienced significant success in the early 20th century. In 1918 the company expanded its manufacturing to bottles, jars, tableware and domestic glassware.
In 1920, Saint-Gobain extended its businesses to fibreglass manufacture. Fibreglass was being used to create insulation, industrial textiles and building reinforcements. In 1937 the company founded Isover, a subsidiary fibreglass insulation manufacturer.
During this period, the company developed three new glassmaking techniques and processes; first, a dipping technique used to coat car windows, which prevented glass from shattering in the event of an accident. As a result of that technique, 10% of Saint-Gobain's 1920 sales came from the car industry, and 28% in 1930. Second, a few years later, another technique was developed that allowed glass to be shaped and bent.[clarification needed] Finally, a process was developed to coat glass with aluminum, allowing it to be used as a conductor, and allowed the company to create products such as radiavers (a glass heater).
1950–1970: Pont-à-Mousson merger[edit]
Between 1950 and 1969, Saint-Gobain's sales rose at a rate of 10% per year. Its work force grew from 35,000 in 1950 to 100,000 in 1969. By the end of the 1960s, Saint-Gobain had more than 150 subsidiaries under its control.
Glass and fiberglass sales benefited from the booming construction industry and the rise in mass consumption after the Second World War. Saint-Gobain's yearly glass production went from 3.5 million square metres (38 million square feet) in 1950 to 45 million square metres (480 million square feet) in 1969. In 1950, fiberglass only represented 4% of the company's turnover, but by 1969, this had grown to 20%.
Domestic sales in France accounted for only a fifth of the company's revenue. Spain, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Belgium were also important markets.
In 1968, Boussois-Souchon-Neuvesel (BSN), a French industrial group, made a hostile takeover bid for Saint-Gobain. The company looked for a "white knight" to help fend off the bid. Multinational corporation Suez suggested that Saint-Gobain and Pont-à-Mousson (another French industrial group) should merge, in order to maintain independence from BSN. After the merger, Saint-Gobain-Pont-à-Mousson, later known simply by the name "Saint-Gobain", produced pipes in addition to glass and fiberglass.
1971–1986: Nationalisation[edit]
The next fifteen years were a time of change and reorganization for the newly merged companies. In the 1970s, Western economies were suffering a sharp downturn. Saint-Gobain's financial performance was adversely affected by the economic and petrol crisis.
In 1981 and 1982, ten of France's top-performing companies were nationalized by the socialist Fifth Republic of France. By February 1982, Saint-Gobain was officially controlled by the state. However, the company did not last long as a government-owned corporation; it was re-privatized in 1987.
1986–present: Expansion[edit]
When Saint-Gobain once again became a private enterprise, control of the company quickly changed hands. Jean-Louis Beffa, an engineer and graduate of the École Polytechnique, became the CEO. Beffa invested heavily in research and development and pushed strongly for the company to produce engineered materials, such as abrasives and ceramics.
Under Beffa, the company continued to expand internationally, setting up foreign factories, and acquiring many of its foreign competitors. In 1996 the company bought Poliet (the French building and construction distribution group) and its subsidiaries, such as Point P. and Lapeyre. This expanded Saint-Gobain's product line into construction materials and their distribution.

- High Performance Materials : Saint-Gobain SEFPRO Saint-Gobain Abrasives, Saint-Gobain Crystals, Saint-Gobain Norton, Saint-Gobain Quartz and Saint-Gobain Norpro
In 2006, Saint Gobain announced a JV, Avancis, with Shell to produce PV modules based on CIS film technology.[12] After the company had entirely owned Avancis[13] and its two plants in Germany manufacturing thin CIS film modules for some time,[14] it was sold to China National Building Materials Group Corporation (CNBM) in 2014.[15]
Packaging[edit]
The Packaging division produces glassware for the food and beverage industry. The division's 2006 sales revenue was 4.1 billion euros, and it employs 20,000 people worldwide. The Packaging division was renamed as Verallia. In accordance with the announcement of June 8, 2015, Saint-Gobain today sold Verallia to funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management LLC and BPI France, which currently hold 90% and 10%, respectively, of the share capital.[16]
External venturing[edit]
Saint-Gobain also has a division that focuses on connecting entrepreneurs, startups, and innovators to the 50+ bin Saint-Gobain called: NOVA External Venturing. The External Venturing unit has staff in Boston, Paris, and Shanghai interested in connecting with entrepreneurs working in advanced materials, construction products, and environmental sustainability.[17]
Acquisitions and sales[edit]
Saint-Gobain has made a number of recent acquisitions in the past several years. In December 2005, it purchased the British company BPB plc, the world's largest manufacturer of plasterboard, for $6.7 billion USD.[18] In August 2007, the company acquired Maxit Group, doubling the size of its Industrial Mortars business and adding the manufacture of expanded clay aggregates to its business portfolio. In 2012, the company acquired SAGE Electrochromics, an innovative manufacturer of glass that tints on command.[19]
The company has also sold off various assets. Recently the company sold its cosmetic glass manufacturing business, including a plant in Newton County, Georgia, United States.[citation needed]
Saint-Gobain Gyproc Middle-East[edit]
Saint-Gobain Gyproc Middle East began trading as Gyproc in 2005. In April 2010, the company's first plasterboard manufacturing plant opened on a seven hectare site in Abu Dhabi.

Chinese Overcapacity Leads Saint-Gobain to Eliminate Product Lines

Amid growing price pressures in China, Compagnie de Saint-Gobain SA, the French building materials manufacturer, has chosen to exit several product categories, instead of accepting lower margins, said Javier Gimeno, head of the company’s Asia-Pacific business.
Saint-Gobain no longer manufactures glass wool or architectural glass in China, Mr. Gimeno said in an interview with CFO Journal in Shanghai. “It is impossible to make money with these kinds of overcapacities,” he said.
Overcapacity among Chinese manufacturers have resulted in downward price pressures in these product categories, affecting margins.
Saint-Gobain now focuses on product classes it considers healthy, like plastics, automotive window shields and mortars.
“Making money here in China is much harder than in other Asian countries,” Mr. Gimeno said. “It is getting more complicated.” Nevertheless, the move — along with increased productivity has resulted in higher profit margins than in previous years, he said.
“My margins in China are better now than they were five years ago,” Mr. Gimeno said. Still, there is growing competition in the manufacturing sectors the company is now focused on.
Saint-Gobain targets operating profits in excess of 10% and wants its business in China to grow faster than the overall economy.
The Chinese economy grew by 6.7% in 2016, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. The government’s target for 2017 is 6.5%.
Saint-Gobain employs around 10,000 people in China. The firm’s 35 plants generate annual revenues of EUR 1.3 billion ($1.47 billion), Mr. Gimeno said.
Stricter enforcement of environmental regulations by Chinese authorities helps to fend off Chinese competition, he said. “In the past, Chinese firms were not subject to the same kind of standards in relation to environmental protection and to safety at work,” Mr. Gimeno said.
“These regulations cost us [foreign firms like Saint-Gobain] a lot of money”, he said. Now, domestic competitors are held accountable according to the same set of standards, Mr. Gimeno said.
The country’s Premier, Li Keqiang, last week pledged to create equal conditions — a so-called level playing field — for foreign and domestic companies operating in China, a step welcomed by Western executives, including the chief executive of Johnson Controls International PLC, Alex Molinaroli.
“The laws are getting tighter, more aligned with Western standards,” Mr. Gimeno said.
Still, the outlook for Saint-Gobain’s China business is positive, he added.
Restrictions on the overseas export of capital, for example dividends generated in China, are no longer an issue, Mr. Gimeno said. Introduced late last year, the controls initially caused concerns among multinationals. “Capital transfers take a bit longer now, but that’s all”, Mr. Gimeno said.
Foreign firms that want to transfer money outside of China no longer have to ask for approval, and need to notify regulators ahead of the transaction, said Marcus Wassmuth, head of European corporate coverage at UniCredit S.p.A. in Shanghai.
Capital controls limiting the overseas M&A-activity by Chinese firms however still apply, resulting in high-profile deals, including the acquisition of Dick Clark Productions Inc. by Dalian Wanda Group Co., to stall. China’s banking regulator is conducting a sweeping check of the borrowings of big overseas Chinese deal makers, including Dalian Wanda, the Wall Street Journal reported in late June.

 China is all about China..Meantime, ISM will continue to move China production.....year after year, to a more closely allied friend to the US. .It is just a matter of time....

 This company is the 'canary in the coal mine', proving a point that for 20 years has been fairly obvious to everyone except western governments and inept western company managers:There is no level playing field  in China, you will lose your intellectual property, then you'll exit your market.Basically, a cost-free takeover and the elimination of western jobs and businesses.

Planned economics do not do well when massive technological shifts happen. Government controlled Chinese banks allowed the formation of too many companies in certain industries. It not only resulted in massive over capacity, when the sales volumes never materialized as calculated, but dated equipment and technology that now that be replaced to match the emerging facilities and technology elsewhere including the US. The US specialty chemical industry especially in personal healthcare is gearing up to take back its pre-1995 dominance. This has been allowed by development of green chemistries and the emergence of enzyme technology coming from advances in the food industry.  The Chinese did not see these changes in time. Their best hope is getting involved in joint ventures in the US and focus on growth and control of their own marketplace.

Maybe it is the Chinese goal: to acquire necessary know-how and then get Western companies from the Chinese market by damaging their margins.

2013 and Earlier:
The Director of Infrastructure is responsible for supervision of the data center, while the Director of Infrastructure Services oversees a team of IT managers in areas including help desk administration and data storage. There is a team in Human Resources Systems, and IT infrastructure for the nearly 200 manufacturing plants is also under the aegis of the Valley Forge group. 

In the various subsidiaries, developers generate original applications and modify off-the-shelf solutions. The largest subsidiary, CertainTeed Corporation, is also located at Valley Forge. This IT department, numbering approximately 60 staff members, is the largest among the US subsidiaries. Smaller subsidiaries include Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics, Saint-Gobain Containers, Saint-Gobain Abrasives/Norton, and Saint-Gobain Crystals.

Saint-Gobain Corporation does not outsource any infrastructure services to IT service providers, but IBM, Sun Systems, and Microsoft all handle maintenance of their own systems. Saint-Gobain maintains its own data center, under the North American Delegation. Saint-Gobain has a partnership for many areas of technology including wireless services, WAN, and eCommerce.

Saint-Gobain Corporation is expecting slight spending increases in the areas of mobile device security and encryption technologies. IT at Saint-Gobain's North American operations is moving toward a shared services model under the group CIO. The CIO is based at the US headquarters, known as the North American Delegation, which is located in Valley Forge, PA. The French parent company sets IT standards and policy and makes global contracts with companies such as IBM, Sun Systems and Microsoft.

Saint-Gobain Corporation's IT budget is typically finalized in Q4.

Cell: A single small cavity surrounded partially or completely by walls.
Cellular Rubber: Rubber products containing many cells or small hollow receptacles dispersed throughout the mass.
Closed Cell: A cell totally enclosed by its walls and hence not interconnecting with other cells.
Coefficient of Thermal Expansion: Average expansion per degree over a stated temperature range, expressed as a fraction of initial dimension. May be linear or volumetric.
Cold Resistance: Able to withstand the effects of cold or low temperatures without loss of serviceability.
Compound: A term applied to a mixture of polymers and other ingredients to produce a usable rubber material.
Compression Deflections: PSI to compress lab slab a specified percentage of overall height, normally 25%.
Compression Set: The amount by which a rubber specimen fails to return to its original shape after release of compressive load.
Conductive Rubber: A rubber capable of conducting electricity. Most generally applied to rubber products used to conduct static electricity.
Copolymer: A polymer consisting of two different monomers chemically combined.
Cracking: The sharp break or fissure in the surface. Generally due to excessive strain.
Crazing: A surface effect on rubber articles characterized by many minute cracks.
Cross Section: A seal as viewed if cut at right angles to the molding line, showing internal structure.
Dense: Solid rubber product with no voids or cells. Available in various Durometer Hardness.
Durometer: (a) An instrument for measuring the hardness of a rubber; measures the resistance to the penetration of an indenter point into the surface of the rubber; (b) numerical scale of rubber hardness.
Elasticity: The property of an article which tends to return to its original shape after deformation.
Elastomer: Any natural or synthetic material with resilience or memory sufficient to return to its original shape after major of minor distortion.
Elongation: Generally means “ultimate elongation”, or percent increase in original length of a specimen when it breaks.
EPDM: Ethylene-Propylene-Diene-Monomer is well known for its excellent ozone, weathering, and aging resistance. It also has excellent water and steam resistance, maintains its flexibility at low temperatures, features excellent resistance to alkalis, acids, and oxygenated solvents, and is very color stable. It is not recommended for resistance to oil, gasoline, and hydrocarbon solvents. EPDM is found in a wide range of applications and is excellent for use outdoors.
Extrusion: Distortion or flow, under pressure, of a portion of a seal into clearance between mating parts.
Feather Edge: The sharp, thin edge on parts such as wiper seals and cups. (Also called “Knife Edge”).
Flame Resistance: The resistance to burning of material that will not withstand combustion under ordinary conditions.
Friction: Resistance to motion due to contact of surfaces.
Gasket: A device used to retain fluids under pressure, or seal out foreign matter. Normally refers to static seal.
Hardness: Resistance to a disturbing force. Measured by the relative resistance of a material to an indenter point of any one of a number of standard hardness testing instruments. (see durometer).
Heat Aging: A test for degradation of physical properties as a result of exposure to high temperature conditions.
Low Temperature Flexibility: The ability of a rubber product to be flexed, bent or bowed at low temperature without cracking.
Memory: The tendency of a material to return to original shape after deformation.
Modulus: Tensile stress at specific elongation. (Usually 100% elongation for Elastomers).
Modulus of Elasticity: One of several measurements of stiffness or resistance to deformation, not often incorrectly used to indicate specifically static tension modulus.
Mooney Scorch: The measurement of the rate at which a rubber compound will cure set up by means of the Mooney Viscometer test instrument.
Mooney Viscosity: Measurement of the plasticity or viscosity of an uncompounded, or compounded vulcanized, Elastomer seal material by means of the Mooney Shearing Disk Viscometer.
Neoprene: Neoprene has moderate resistance to oils and gasoline. It features good flame resistance, weathers well, and has very good resistance to abrasion, flex cracking, alkalis, and acids. However, expect poor resistance to aromatic and oxygenated solvents and limited flexibility at low temperatures. Neoprene is generally considered an excellent all-purpose material with a solid balance of properties and few limitation.
Neoprene’s service temperature ranges from -10 degrees F to 225 degrees F.
Nitrile: Nitrile has very good oil and gasoline resistance, permeability, and heat and abrasion resistance. Its resistance to alkalis and acids all increase as the nitrile content of the compound increases. Nitrile must be specially compounded for resistance to ozone,, sunlight and natural aging, and has poor resistance to oxygenated solvents. Nitrile is superior to neoprene in oils and solvent resistance, but is not recommended for applications where it is exposed to severe weathering.
Nitrile’s service temperature ranges from -30 degrees F to 375 degrees F.
Non-blooming: The absence of “bloom”.
Oil Resistant: Ability to vulcanize rubber to resist the swelling and deteriorating effects of various types of oils.
Ozone Cracking: The surface cracks, checks or crazing caused by exposure to an atmosphere containing ozone.
Ozone Resistance: Ability to withstand the deteriorating effects of ozone (which generally causes cracking).
Polymer: A material formed by joining together many (poly) individual units (mer) of one or more monomers; synonymous with elastomer.
Porosity: Quality or state of being porous.
Rebound: A measure of the resilience, usually as a percentage of vertical return of a body, which has fallen and bounced.
Resilience: Ability of an Elastomer to return to original size and shape after deforming forces are removed; generally expressed in per cent of the ratio of energy removed, to the energy used in compressing. (Resilient: having that capability).
Rubber: See Elastomer
Rubber, Synthetic: Manufactured of man-made Elastomers.
SBR: Copolymer of Butadiene and Styrene; an all purpose type synthetic, similar to natural rubber. (Butadiene is a gaseous material of petroleum; Styrene, a reaction product of ethylene and benzene)
Scorching: Premature curing or setting up of a raw compound during processing.
Shelf Aging: The change in a material’s properties which occur in storage with time.
Silicone: Silicone features excellent resistance to ozone, sunlight and oxidation, and is very color stable. It also maintains excellent flexibility at low temperatures, has outstanding resistance to high heat, low compression set, and is a very good electrical insulator. However, it is not recommended for applications, which require abrasion resistance, tear and cut growth resistance, and high tensile strength. Nor is it recommended for resistance to oil, gasoline, solvents, alkalis, and acids.
Size, Actual: Actual dimension of the product, including tolerance units.
Skin: A relatively dense layer at the surface of a cellular material.
Specific Gravity: Ratio of the weight of a given substance, to the weight of an equal volume of water, at any specific temperature. Sphericity: the measure of a tolerance of a molded ball, or ground ball, in reference to a perfect sphere; also described as “roundness”.
Stress: Force per unit of original cross section area.
Tear Strength: The force required to rupture a sample of stated geometry.
Tear Resistance: Resistance to growth of a cut or nick when tension is applied to the cut specimen. Commonly expressed as pounds per square inch thickness.
Temperature Range: Maximum and minimum temperature limits in which a seal compound will function in a given application.
Tensile Strength: Force, in pounds per square inch, required to cause the rupture of a specimen of rubber material.
Viscosity: The property of fluids and plastic solids by which they resist an instantaneous change of shape, i.e. resistance to flow.
Void: The absence of material, or an area devoid of materials where not intended.
Weathering: The surface deterioration of a rubber during outdoor exposure.
