About Us





The Simmons Bank Story 

	Our story began 111 years ago in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, when on March 23, 1903, a local physician-turned-bank president, Dr. John Franklin Simmons, along with a handful of paid employees, first opened the doors to what was then called Simmons National Bank. Backed by a group of highly regarded business and community leaders dedicated to promoting economic growth and prosperity for Pine Bluff’s citizens, Simmons had the distinction of being the first commercial bank in the area with a federal charter designating it as a national bank. At the close of business on that first day, deposits totaled $3,338.22—a respectable start for a bank that would one day grow to become Simmons First National Corporation, one of the largest publicly traded financial holding companies based in Arkansas.

	 Through the decades, the bank expanded its products and services, leading the way with industry milestones such as being the first Arkansas bank to offer the first national revolving credit card, BankAmericard® (now Visa®). Today we have more than 175 branch and ATM locations in 96 communities throughout Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, and Tennessee. Our geographic footprint has expanded but our mission remains true to the enduring philosophy of our founders - to place our customers' needs at the forefront of all we do.

	 Although our portfolio of services can compete with those of larger banks, the people of Simmons Bank are deeply committed to providing customers with the warm welcome, friendly service and one-on-one relationship that neighborhood banks are known for. It's the way we would wish to be treated if the roles were reversed. This culture of customer service extends out into the community as well. Our employees are dedicated to supporting, developing and energizing educational, civic and charitable programs in the communities we call home.

	 After 112 years, Simmons Bank is still on the move and committed to helping people and businesses achieve their financial goals. We are proud to serve more customers and communities than ever before—and we are especially proud and honored that you are growing along with us.

                I had a car loan with them that was negotiated through the selling dealer. About a year later I sold the car and wired (ACH) the payoff to Simmons per their instructions. 10 days later I hadn't received title so called asking "what gives". Was told that THEIR POLICY was the title wouldn't be mailed for 10 business days. Now they had my money via wire, so there was no risk, etc. no check to clear. But no, it was "their policy" that they would not mail the title for 10 business days. No exceptions to such a one dimensional policy. Certainly not a customer friendly bank and one I could not recommend.… read more

                They offer a great rate, but their customer service is lacking.

                I opened a checking account at Simmons First National Bank about 7 years ago in Monticello, AR. The first thing I noticed about Simmons was the small, local bank feel as opposed to the feel of a mega bank, which I have also been a customer of. The customer service at Simmons has been wonderful. I truly feel like I am valued as a customer, and any question I have asked has been graciously answered. Simmons offers online banking for customer convenience. Also, I have taken out an auto loan with Simmons, which was a quick and simple process. Unlike most larger banks, Simmons allows customers to take out an auto loan for older cars. During my time banking with Simmons, I have opened up a checking, savings, and money market account. I would highly recommend Simmons to anyone looking for a bank that cares about its customers.… read more

                Although I did not choose Simmons as my bank, I am pleased they have an account type that fit my needs. Simmons bought the bank where I had a senior status checking account that did not charge a fee for a limited number of transactions per month and the eChecking style account at Simmons suits me fine.I am having to deal with there not being a branch within 10 miles and stricter ATM card requirements, but I have only automatic debits for the Simmons account and I rarely carry cash anymore. I would still like to have those options though.… read more

                I have had this card for 8 years now and i love it! my APR is a great rate (7.99%) and they are very communicative! i think that this card is better than average because it is tied to a small bank where customer service is important to them, rather than the big banks that bounce you from one rep to the next. the late fee is only $10 for the few times i have forgotten, and i have never had a problem paying my bill online from my bank account.… read more

                I had an account with Simmons First National Bank for a couple of years when I was younger. I have had accounts with many different banks since then and still have several open accounts with others. Simmons was by far the worst bank I have ever used. They were very unfriendly any time I needed to have them check on something with my account, and their loan officers made you feel very bad about yourself. The bank overall felt like they wanted business accounts and could care less about individuals that didn’t have a lot of money because it wasn’t worth their time. I’d recommend finding a bank that appreciates personal accounts instead of just being treated like a hassle to deal with.… read more

                The Simmons First Platinum is the best credit card I have. It doesn't have points or gimmicks like some of my other cards it's just a credit card. The interest rate is by far the best I've seen in a credit card, at 7 percent it's awesome. Even the cash advance is really low. My second best card is a USAA with a cash advance rate of 25 percent but my Simmons beats that by over half at 12 percent. Altogether I think this is one of the simplest and cheapest credit cards anyone can get. You don't usually see rates like these on cards without a membership fee but Simmons doesn't even have fees.… read more

                We are pleased with this card. The interest rate is among the lowest of all the cards we have currently. To that end, we tend to use this card almost exclusively. On the rare occasion that I have had to call their customer service department, the representatives have ALWAYS been kind, knowledgeable, and very helpful. We had a problem recently where someone had tried to use our card online to book a hotel. Because we had never used this particular card to book a hotel or even a rental car, the transaction was flagged and both my husband and I were contacted about the issue. I was very grateful and relieved. We plan to stay with them for a long time!… read more

                My husband and myself have used our Visa Platinum Rewards Card for many years. It has been the perfect card for us. We do not let our debt pile up; in fact we pay our balance in full each month. However we do utilize the car for most of our purchases (i.e., gas, groceries, clothing, entertainment, etc.). We enjoy accumulating the reward points and using them each year to help with airfare for conventions for my husband or a family vacation for both of us. In addition, we use the points we earn to provide dining cards as gifts to our children. - shirley.… read more

                I have been banking with Simmons First National Bank for over 3 years. They have the best customer service of any bank I have ever done banking with. The tellers are friendly, always smiling, willing to take time with you as needed to answer any and all questions or assist with your banking needs and there are lots of convenient locations. Almost any town I travel to here in Arkansas has a branch nearby so I am never far from a bank when I need one. There has never been a time that I have needed help with something that someone hasn’t been readily available to take time to work with me. I would definitely recommend Simmons Bank to anyone who was looking for a new bank.… read more

                This is a fantastic no frills credit card. I have had this card for a little over two years and have no complaints at all. The interest rate is one of the lowest in the industry if you carry a balance and it is easy to use. There is not a cash back or points program associated with this card, but in return for the low interest rate, I would not really rate that as a negative. I have had to contact the company two times and on both occasions the people in customer service were very helpful and were able to resolve my issues quickly and efficiently. I do think you need a fairly high credit score to obtain this card.… read more

                I have had the Simmons First Visa® Platinum Credit Card for over 3 years now and it has been the best credit card I have ever had. The plus side is my interest rate is less than 6%. I always pay off at the end of the month and have only had to carry a balance a couple of times, but with an interest rate this low, the finance charge was minimal. Another positive to this card is there are no yearly fees attached to it. It is an all around great card with only one negative. The con's are, you do not receive any points or miles for using the card. Granted, it would be nice to receive something back for using this card, but as stated earlier, with a minimal interest rate and no fees, that outweighs the fact that you do not receive anything back. I did notice the interest rate is a little higher now for new card holders, but still far lower than most other credit cards.… read more

How Do Banks Work?
By: John Kiernan, Personal Finance Editor
													The manner in which banks operate might seem like a rather basic topic, but given how complex financial markets have become in recent years, it’s helpful to revisit the fundamental simplicity of the industry.

Having money exactly when you need to it—and earning income on it when you don’t—is a problem as old as money itself. Banks exist to solve that problem, and have served as an intermediary between savers and borrowers since the Italian Renaissance, the Crusades, or even earlier, depending on which historians you consult.

More specifically, banks lend the funds deposited into savings accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs) to other customers, who repay the money with interest over time. Depositors entrust their money to banks for two reasons: 1) banks offer safe-keeping, borne from FDIC insurance; and 2) banks pay interest on deposits, allowing funds to grow over time. Banks, in turn, make money, by charging a higher rate of interest on their loans than what they pay on deposits. Banks can have other sources of revenue as well, including investments, fees on various services, and commissions on the sale of financial products such as mutual funds and insurance.

In addition to serving as a vector for borrowing and lending, banks play a central role in a number of other financial mechanisms. For example, banks process payments between buyers and sellers and they exchange foreign currencies. Banks also carry out governmental monetary policy by increasing or decreasing the amount of money they keep in reserve.
											

How Do I Choose a Bank?
By: Odysseas Papadimitriou, WalletHub CEO
													When it comes to selecting a bank, the options can be overwhelming. In past generations, it was common to choose whichever institution was to your home or office, or to be lured in by special prizes such as a free toaster. These days, you might just as easily do business with a bank that’s located across the country or with an online-only bank that has no branch offices at all. Special offers also are less likely to be small kitchen appliances and more likely to be perks such as free checking, introductory interest rates, or a lump of cash to jumpstart your savings account.

But before you jump on the bank with the biggest name or the flashiest offers, take some time to identify how you’re most likely to use your account and which features are most important to you.

Do you need a brick-and-mortar location? You may find yourself in need of a safe-deposit box. Or if questions arise, you may be the kind of person who is most comfortable with face-to-face communication. If you need access to a real building staffed by live people, prioritize your bank’s location and hours.

Bankers’ hours are notoriously short, and if your workday overlaps them completely, you might want to choose a bank that’s close to your office rather than your home, so that you can slip in at lunchtime. Or you might want to look for a bank with better hours.

Are you a technophile? You may find access to better interest rates and fee structures by opting for an online-only bank or bank account. By the same token, you may be able to minimize fees by opting for paperless statements, keeping tabs on your account balance electronically, and using mobile apps to locate ATMs that are within your network.

These are great opportunities, and you should take advantage of banks that offer them…if you are likely to use them. If your inbox is full of unread email notifications and your phone is loaded with unused apps, it helps to be realistic. Read through the fine print, understand the fees and penalties, and decide whether they work for your lifestyle.

Do you travel abroad extensively? International financial transactions have never been easier or less labor-intensive. And while most banks charge special fees for international debit card transactions and ATM withdrawals, others have been able to pass the savings along to their customers.

If you’re a frequent international traveler, it definitely pays to open one of the various no foreign transaction fee credit cards that are on the market.  Not only will this enable you to avoid the industry-standard 3% international surcharge, but you’ll also save a lot of money on currency conversion since Visa and Mastercard offer much better rates than bank branches or airport kiosks.  You should also look into getting a checking account that charges for neither international debit card use, nor foreign ATM withdrawals.

Is a sense of responsibility to the community important to you when it comes to banking? Since the global financial crisis of 2008, the reputation of many banks has suffered a black eye. But the banking industry is not a monolithic entity. Many consumers who are concerned about issues like local development, fair lending, and executive salaries have turned to small community and cooperative banks as well as credit unions for their banking needs.

These institutions may be less likely to offer all the bells and whistles of their larger cousins, but their mission is to provide the immediate community with the best products and services possible.  They’re worth a look at the very least.
											

What Does It Mean to Be FDIC Insured?
By: John Kiernan, Personal Finance Editor
													If your bank is FDIC insured, any money you put into a deposit account, along with any earned interest, will be returned to you, even if your bank fails. There are limits, of course. Insurance coverage tops out at $250,000 per depositor, per institution—not per account, as some people assume. That means if you have $125,000 in a money market account and another $125,000 in a CD at the same bank, you’ll want to open a new account at a different bank before depositing any more money in order to make everything is insured.

It’s important to note that FDIC insurance covers deposit accounts only, that is, checking, savings, CDs, and money market accounts. Other investment vehicles that banks sometimes provide, such as annuities, life insurance, and mutual funds (including money market funds), are not insured.

Most banks and thrifts (also known as savings and loan institutions), are FDIC insured, but a few are not. By law, those that are must display the FDIC logo prominently on the bank premises and in written materials. If you don’t see the logo, or if you have any doubts, ask about coverage. Credit unions are not covered by the FDIC, but they do have an insurance program of their own, sponsored by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).  As is the case with banks, this provides coverage for up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution.

The FDIC, which stands for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, was founded by the U.S. government in 1933 in response to the widespread bank failures of the Great Depression. FDIC insurance is deemed necessary because bank failures can initiate a devastating domino effect involving consumers, commerce, other banks, and the overall economy. And one of the hard lessons of the 1920s and 1930s was that even healthy banks can fail when skittish customers withdraw all their deposits en masse. Deposit insurance gives depositors the assurance necessary to keep their money in the bank, even in the face of frightening economic and financial news. In that way, it protects not only the consumer, but also the banks and the economy.

Depending on your needs for a checking account, like direct deposit or checks, I suggest letting your credit cool off and open what's called a simple card account. It does require proof of identity, no fees, allows direct deposit, and is a Visa cash, not credit card.Also, I'd suggest talking to a credit union about an account, because their systems run checks - it is not the same as a traditional bank check system.

Wells Fargo, by far. They approved me 2 years ago when I was turned down by several others because of bad credit. I now have a credit score over 720.

I've been in same position and resorted to doing a title loan, but not your usual one. Look into a company called New Deal. They provide title loans assistance but, the % is wal less and since collateral is involved, they'll be more willing. It goes on credit as a loan, and also helps improve your credit score with each on time payment

Walmart had something called bluebird checking and you get a debit card also. There are NO Fees. You cannot get overdrafts like I have at Wells Fargo and Chase when I specifically wrote and told them no on overdrafting. I would deposit the money before opening the next business day but those monster banks were so greedy making it like they did me a favor charging me 34.00 and usually for less than 34.00 over and I had the money in by the next business day. Also Amex Serve charges very little depending on your habits and which plan you select. As another mentioned, credit unions are another good place to call and nowadays are more lax on who can open accounts. Go to the social worker at the hospital and see if he/she can help. They sometimes have extended payment plans, partial forgiveness, low interest, etc. for such things. The billing office probably won't help you so if the are bothering you tell them you are working with the social worker to get it paid. I don't know if you qualify for Medicaid within 3 mo of the illness but health and human resources in your state would be able to help you then. But you would have to have very low income and less than 2,000 in resources not counting your house or car. There are other agencies in your city/county that may also help. One place to call is 211.… read more

...and so there is this checking acc. from Wells Fargo called "Everyday Checking".Here is how it works: You open an account that consists of a Savings Acc. with some minimal starting amount (in my case opening was $100) and a checking acc.with lets say $4600 for total of $4700.This type of Acc. "Everyday Checking", comes with a $10 Monthly Service Fee, which one of the ways that could be waved is to maintain a minimum of $1500.Now as part of this checking/savings acc. is a scam called "Save As You Go". That means that every time you make some electronic transaction (like paying a bill), usually $1, $2, $3 or more dollars, (depending on the amount of the transaction), will be transferred from your checking part of the acc. to the Saving acc.The idea is that YOU are to stupid to manage and save your own money, so Wells Fargo will do it for you by moving a dollar or two of your own money from your checking to your savings.As a result of this scam, you can find yourself in a position where you have, lets say, $400 in your Savings acc., and $1600 in your checking, for a total of $2000.So, lets assume You make a "bill pay" to your Cable Co. of $100, that leaves a balance in your checking acc. of $1500, and your So called "Save As You Go"savings acc., still has the $400 for a total of $1900.Here is the kicker, remember, You checking had $1600, you paid the cable co. $100, you have left $1500, but because Well Fargo moved $1 dollar to your savings, your Savings amount became $401, and your checking $1499.At $1499 in your checking, you are below the $1500 and therefore you are subject to a $10 Monthly Service Fee, even though you still have $401 in your savings.now, I am sure that those very young, smart, highly educated people in the wells fargo boardroom, get a lot of money paid to find ways that will boost the Bank's profits, but ultimately, a "Pig with a Lipstick, is still a pig".It should be obvious by now that my issue is not the $10.I could close my acc. and make sure that these will be the first, the last and the only $10 wells Fargo will ever take from me (very inexpensive insurance policy against wells Fargo ever taking another penny out of me). I still think is a scam, is designed to exploit the poor and I will forward my thoughts and your response to the local news (starting with Michael Turko of the Turko Files Ch. 9 - KUSI News - San Diego, CA), and follow with Huffington Post and let the public decide with their comments whether my point is valid or not.… read more

You've totaly misread the 3 ways to avoid the $10.00 fee. First off, if you DO the savings, that alone automatically waives the $10.00 checking fee. 2nd is if you use your debit card 10x, and Wells Fargo is very upfront, in fact, around 1pm, they post pending transactions that come in that night! So, at 2pm your balance could be -$90.00 and you can cover it before they post that night! NO other bank lets you know what's coming through, as that's money directly out of their pocket! 3rd is to simply have a measly $500.00 in direct deposits for the month, and this includes direct deposits from square and cash.me/scotttampa . Also, they are up front about these too! You have 24-7 access next to each option, it shows how many debit card purchases you have ( I just run 10 $1.00 charges through square) and also shows your total direct deposits, and one month I came up short and guess what! They didn't charge the $10.00... they said "as a valued customer we've noticed you came close this month so we'll waive the $10.00 but please keep an eye on your numbers and make sure one of the options is completed each month.So, You are WAY off base. Also, I created this account on their website in 5 minutes with only a $25.00 initial deposit! Received a debit card and signature card to sign and mail back within 4 days. BEST BANK I'VE EVER BANKED WITH, as they don't HIDE THINGS.Scott McClellanTampa, Florida… read more

He gets put through more security using his account then joe blow off thes street. We had to shop after christmas last year we had all the kids stuff in the cart and had to put it back.

Credit Union of the Rockies used to be a good institution, but it seems they have lost all customer service. I had been with them for 15+years. We had financed a car and our home and had a standing line of credit. We maintained a healthy balance in our accounts and were never late on a payment (actually we always paid our loans off early. Anyway, we were buying a condo as an investment and needed a mortgage for about 25% of the property (we were bringing a 75% down-payment to the table). Credit Unions of the Rockies uses a mortgage broker, we applied and the service we received was appalling: Keith Schnell, theLoan Officer with CU Members Mortgage was very slow to communicate and even though we applied 6 weeks prior to the closing, he was still messing around two days before closing. We ended up taking a short term loan from another source and closing without the loan from the Credit Union of the Rockies. The poor performance of Mr. Schnell and CUR costs us time, an $400 appraisal and put our $5,000 earnest money at risk. I have had almost no follow up from the CUR even though I left messages and send a letter when closing our accounts. I can not recommend Credit Union of the Rockies or Credit Union Members Mortgage.… read more

I recently discontinued my account with this bank for several reasons. I was with TD Bank since them being Commerce Bank. I truly enjoyed the fact that they were open 7 days a week and had longer working hours then other banks. The customer service was excellent and I had no issues with them. A bout 2 years after them becoming TD Bank I started to notice several fees being charged to my account. And even more overdraft fees when I specifically called them and took that option off of my account so that I would never overdraft it. The customer service was horrible. This became such a problem that I ended up having hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees. I am planing on taking this matter to court because of the fact that they are liars and I feel that they do that just to take money from you.… read more

Ally use to be good. But sadly this is no longer the case. They have raised fees. Put $10 cap on ATM fee reimbursement. They also are scandalous in there system. Debits are applied before credits which means if you have low balance and have a bill on auto pay and you put money in your account the same day, the bill is paid first and you are charged an overdraft fee which is now $25 a hit. You get 1 overdraft fee reimbursement for the Lifetime of the account. Not monthly or annually LIFETIME OF THE ACCOUNT. worst of all is there TERRIBLE Customer service which btw is only 24/7 phone or email now. All the things that made Ally great are now gone.

I have been using the Washington Federal bank for maybe three years now,and it seems to me that they are one of those banks that wants to keep your money if you put it in their bank. There was an instance when I was trying to withdraw my money and got to the bank 10 minutes early before they would stop letting people withdraw their money or transfer it. Because of the long lines, I ended up having to wait 12 minutes, and so I was 2 minutes late. The women inside refused to give me money, and i did not have any money for the weekend. I called her supervisor and it was resolved, but it should not have happened in the first place. it was horrible ,and I am not too fond of them anymore. Watch out with this bank, they will try to keep YOUR money.… read more

I have a fixed mortgage of 5.5% with Weber state Credit Union. Back in June, I applied for re-financing with the same lender. I was approved for a rate of 3.25%. Closing was supposed to take place at end of August, but it did not because the bank made an error on some house paperwork that is invalid. They now have to go through the process of removing the error, but I have to continue to pay a higher interest on my mortgage - not to any fault of my own. Robbery in plain daylight! i feel like this at least.… read more

I immediately switched over to Bashas Associates Federal Credit Union after being with Bank of America for five years. I wanted to be with a bank that hand superb customer service and treated customers fairly. I have overall been happy with the services I have received and the 24/7 support I have gotten abroad and domestically. There have been several situations in which my bank account had been compromised and needed assistance with Bashas. Although they weren't as quick to respond as BofA would be, they still worked hard to send me new cards and secure my account without too much of a hassle.

My Bank is Capitol One. It is a great bank and I've been with them for over 5 years. I have had a savings and checking account. They offer certain benefits to the checking account that I truly appreciate such as no International withdrawal fees. The customer service is excellent whenever I've had to call for various reasons. The saving account interest rate is not great like all the other banks but when I initially sign up they had the highest rate I keep hoping it will go back up. I sincerely would recommend the previous ‘ING’ and now Capitol One to anyone needing a good reliable internet bank.… read more

I have been a Wells Fargo customer for over 15 years. Whenever I call or visit Wells Fargo, the customer service is usually very good. The agent is very respectful and appreciative and handles queries as best as s/he can. Recently, I accidentally left my card in the ATM machine at my local branch. When I called the bank about it, they informed me that the ATM will automatically shred the card if I do not take it out of the machine. They went ahead and arranged for a new one to be sent to my address. In the meantime, they told me to visit a local branch, and an agent could issue me a temporary card connected to my account. I visited a branch later that day, and was issued a card within five minutes. I was quite impressed with the efficiency and speed. I had been so annoyed with myself, thinking about how inconvenient my "card-less" existence would be for the next week. In the end, Wells Fargo made this inconvenience as hassle-free as possible, which I did really appreciate.… read more

I have been a member with Cedar Point Federal Credit Union in southern MD for about 20 years. I have never had a bad experience with them. Their staff is friendly and welcoming, they go out of their way to help and give information or answer any questions that you have, and are extremely helpful with any problems that I have had arise. I have my main checking and savings account with them, as well as used them for two different car loans. The loan process was very new and overwhelming to me, but the associate at Cedar Point answered all questions, recommended the best type of loan for me, and set up the loan and payment plan with ease.The employees are very knowledgeable, eager to help, and make you feel welcomed at "at home." They remember names of their clients, and you are always welcomed (usually by name) as soon as you enter.

I have had no problems with TD bank at all so far. I have been using them for 4 years, since I was a freshman at my college. I chose them because they were close to my home and they had a student specialty program so I wouldn't need a specific amount of dollars in my bank account. A td bank atm was even in my college as well, providing extra convenience. I love that they allow you to take their pens. The feel and atmosphere of the bank was nice. They always allow you to get free items such as candy or hand sanitizers. Every experience with them has gone smoothly.

I initially started with them because of the favorable loan options a credit union can provide, and have never been let down. The interest I pay for loans is much lower then any traditional lending institution I've shopped with.

I can’t say enough great things about having USAA as a bank. Their overall fees are very low, and they reimburse you for a certain amount of ATM withdrawl fees each month.

I thought that I would have to co-sign for him,but that was not to be. I have 4 accounts with MFCU,a savings,a Christmas club account,and two checking accounts.

Bank of America has been my bank for many years. Once there was an incident where my account had been comprised ( by someone nameless ). I went into the bank to resolve it. Honestly I was surprised and relieved at how this was handled. One account had to be closed, a new one opened; easy and painless. So many pleasing attributes in my opinion, not to mention ease of use, banking online, bill pay, chat, and the list goes on. The thing I enjoy most about my bank is I'm able to transfer funds easily to family members and vise versa. Oh did I mention some overdraft fees have been refunded as a courtesy. I can go on and go.

I recently opened checking and savings accounts with USAA. I am extremely pleased with them so far. I had been very happy with the same national bank for close to 20 years, but when a couple of problems arose with them, things went south for me very quickly. I chose USAA because I use the company for my auto and homeowner's insurance,All the services (insurance, banking services, etc.) USAA offered are centered around veterans and our specific needs. I've had nothing but positive experiences with their insurance services, and I can honestly also say the same about my experiences to date with their checking and savings products. I pay no monthly fees; the accounts have no minimum balance, and they extend the same excellent service in their banking division as they do for their insurance policies.The only downside is that you either have to be a veteran or related to one to join. If you are eligible, however, I strongly encourage you to join.… read more

And every time,EVERY time,that I questioned something,they always had an answer for me. The customer service is excellent!! The auto rate loans (I have had 4) are also one of the lowest that you will find out here in san diego. I am a father of 6 and all my kids are with NFCU also.

A few years ago I totaled my car just a week after paying it off. I was very upset; especially since it was the other person's fault. They ran a stop sign and hit me right on the driver's side door. The car spun several times and I found myself trapped inside. After the accident I could see the other driver and his friends moving his car to make it look like it was my fault. They then tried to move my car with me inside, instead of trying to help me get out. The entire experience was dreadful and the other driver's insurance company refused to pay because of the way the cars had been set up. USAA, however, believed me when I told them what happened. They got me a rental car that very day and I had money to buy a new car with a couple of days. I also got more than I was expecting. Banking, insurance, and savings with USAA is always a good experience!… read more

My bank Is US Bank. A bit like heirlooms, US Bank has been passed down and always used by my family. Recently, i opened a checking account upon my 18th birthday. When signing up at my branch they put a student indicator on my account saying the $8.95 maintenance fee would be waived. For one reason or another it was for about two months then this month it wasn't refunded. I called customer service and they switched me over to a "Easy Student" account which did cost $2 but is waived by online statements. If you ever have an Issue their customer service is top notch and they try hard to help you. Bonus for some: customer service is based in the US so it's all native speakers from here. That personally doesn't matter to me but for older people or folks with trouble understanding international people it would help. The US Bank android app is wonderful and simple. Really my only qualm with US Bank is that their money sending system online is hard and bad from the app. All together, It would be hard to find a better bank then good ol' US Bank.… read more

I bank with USAA. I have used many other banks and find USAA to be better equipped to serve my needs. I bank only online and enjoy that convenience that they offer. I can transfer money, pay bills, make deposits all from my phone or computer even while I'm on the go. I don't have time to go the physical bank. The representatives are always helpful as well. In addition, they offer many discounts on products and services within and out of the bank. I am certain I will never bank with another institution as they are a one-stop shop.… read more

I bank with First Convenience Bank in Central Texas. They are located in all the local Walmarts which is very nice. Recently, I had a very low balance in my account and accidently used my debit card, over drawing my account since the bank does not decline point of sale purchases to costumers in good standing. This caused several over draft charges that amounted to about $100.00 dollars. I went in to my local branch and explained the situation, the woman I was speaking with removed the charges and resolved the issue on the spot. I was very pleased.… read more

US Bank based in Minnesota,is our bank of choice offering reasonably good customer service as well as good credit products and loan services.Many contacts with customer service on the phone have ended with me well satisfied that my problems or questions were well taken care of.My only negative comments would be in the area of their charges for overdraft coverage,which doesnt really affect me that much, as well as the lack of offices reasonably close to my home.I would grade them out at a B+.… read more

I recently opened a checking account with Citibank. Citibank has a number of locations all over New York City, and I’d heard good things from a friend so I decided this was the way to go. I liked that there is no interest rate, and monthly fees are low. I’ve had good experience with customer service so far as well. I would recommend using this bank if you are near a branch and wanting to go with a reputable large scale operation.… read more

I have used Farmers & Merchants Bank in the past when I lived in a different city and I was overall pleased. I had both a checking and savings account with them, and I found their APR rates and policies and terms to be overall fair. I also found their customer service representatives to be very helpful and efficient.

Yes, you can get a loan with tarnished credit, but you will have to pay a considerably higher interest rate because lenders assume you are a higher risk. You should attempt to rebuild the relationships you have with existing creditors to help improve your credit in the short term. If your accounts have not gone past 90 days in delinquency there is a good chance that by calling and speaking to a customer service rep, or by sending along a 'goodwill' letter and simultaneously making your accounts current your lenders may report your accounts as never late. There are a lot of other ways to remove past negative remarks from your credit report, but it is important that your first become current with all over due accounts. You should begin by puling your free annual credit report from https://www.annualcreditreport.com/ so you can begin to triage the worst of your accounts. Once you have a better picture of where you credit is now, you can begin the process of forming a recovery strategy and determine which lenders may be willing to extend credit to you. I would recommend staying away from credit counseling agencies and others such as Lexington Law because they are incredibly expensive and you can everything and more than they are able to do with a little research of your own. You may wish to familiarize yourself with 'credit good will letters' and have a look at the following websites:www.creditboards.comwww.myFico.comGood luck, you will certainly be able to repair your credit in good time!… read more

I have been a customer of GE Capital bank for more than 3 years. I was trying to open the account online but something went wrong with the system - I've got asked to call to their customer service. Once I've called them and provided some clarification details, the person on the phone was able to open the account for me. I heavily using their mobile client for making deposits - pretty easy and user-friendly process. Love the ability to link external accounts.

I agree with Jess below that Woodforest National Bank is a reliable and great option when it comes to banks because they are located in Walmart stores. Pretty much everywhere you go there is a Walmart so you can get the banking assistance that you need. I have found their customer service to be pretty helpful, and I’m happy with their lower transaction and banking fees. I would recommend this bank for anyone who is looking for a convenient bank.… read more

Woodforest National Bank is perhaps the most useful bank in the country because most of them are located in Walmart stores. This bank has saved me a lot of hassle because I have moved about four times in eight years, and there has been a Woodforest branch in all four of these locations. I don't find their checking account itself to be substantially better than any other checking available at a national bank, but their customer service is ideal, with rapidly moving lines and friendly demeanor in all transactions I've had.… read more

In addition their online platform has developed very nicely to be able to do whatever I need it to. Branch workers are always very helpful and polite. Up to date I have had no complaints or bad experiences. If you want a good bank with the local home grown feeling, Wells is your home.… read more

If you have a question about anything you can call direct to your branch or email them and you get a personal answer to any question you may have. They remember you and you are treated like part of the family. I am so satisfied with this bank after being part of the Big three banks for years where you are just a number.… read more

I have been with Credit Union One for about three years and I can honestly say I have never had any problems with them. The one thing I wish that they had was more places I can use an ATM machine that I don't have to pay a fee to use. I like the security that they also offer, I am notified immediately if they question any kind of questionable use on my account, I get emails from them notifying me even if my account is logged into too many times in one day. I am planning on getting a car loan from them in the next month or so, I'm sure they will be a pretty easy process since I already belong with them.… read more

My checking account is with UBS Bank USA. I like it the way they handle their clients. Each time my maintaining balance drops, they don't charge me right away with the penalty. They call me first, notifying that if I can't replenish the account balance they would be constrained to impose the penalty. And they are so endearing when they do this during the course of the conversation. I call it human touch. That to me is very polite and courteous disposition of a Bank.… read more

Whenever I call them, they are always friendly and helpful. There have been times that I made mistakes in my checking, causing the dreaded $29.00 overdraft fee, but a simple phone call with explanation has always been enough to get the charges reversed, which means I don't often have to worry about extra money leaving my account for fees and such.… read more

I have an account with TDBank North. I am very unhappy with them My account was somehow compromised and money was taken and used without my knowledge. They said it was used with an ATM card but I have the card. I have the card though so the bank is telling me they will not refund the money taken without doing a complete investigation. I understand they need to investigate but I have been a customer for maybe 10 years without any previous issues. They should return the disputed funds until/unless they can find no evidence of a theft. Even then if that happens that would be bad for me because the money really was taken. I would recommend another bank.… read more

We have banked with Vystar and its predecessor Jax Navy Fed C/U for nearly thirty years and have never had any problems with them except one recent event where an apparent unauthorized charge on our debit card appeared from a vendor we hadn't used in six months. Also, on the date of the charge we were not in town, making the charge appear fraudulent. Vystar reversed the charge and began an investigation. After three months and a thoroughly helpful Vystar customer service rep we discovered the charge to be correct. The vendor had taken its time to submit the proper paper work. Must be nice to be in no hurry to get paid.… read more

I bank with Chase Manhattan, just Chase to most and I have to say that every time I go in they are nice, the wait is never very long and the place is always clean. One time I needed $150 in gold dollars for a fundraiser and I went in and they said that most branches usually only have about $50 unless you order them in advance. Well, I didn't have that kind of time. I didn't think I would have to order them. So I told the gal I would just drive to a few banks. She told me to wait while she made a couple calls. When she came back about 5minutes later she said she called the bank next door (an independent credit union) and that they had what I needed and someone would bring them right over! Within 10 minutes I was out the door and didn't have to drive all over town! They always go the extra mile when I need them to. Plus hardly any fees and a good interest rate...all the boring things..haha..makes this a great bank I will stay with for years and years!… read more

My deciding factor in choosing Green Dot was how user friendly and easy the card is to use.  I've had a wonderful experience with it since I can use it anywhere as a credit or debit card and refill's are easy. My experience with Direct Deposit and Transfers are easy and wonderful to use. It does cost monthly, but the ease and flexibility are worth it!

I have been banking with one local credit union in San Antonio - Generations FCU - since 2003. It has expanded and acquired more branches since the time I opened my accounts with them. I definitely like their interest rates on loans and very straight-forward membership fees and policies. Overdraft and other account fees are way cheaper than in major banks. My account is free, because I have a direct deposit. The new location is very close to my house. I was able to get several car loans through them at a very low rate and still have a line of credit.… read more

Re: Wells Fargo, when I used their ATM for the first time I was charged a fee that I never agreed to. They referred to it as a "inquirer fee." This was in addition to a $3 fee that I did agreed to. This put my account into the negative. I discussed this with the bank and showed them my receipt which did state that I did not agree to the charge. After a call with the bank manager it was agreed that this was an unintentional mix-up an overdraft was not charged. At least they made it right.… read more

We changed from a different back to WPCU about ten years ago and have had no issues with their banking or service. We have done multiple home refinances and auto loans as the fee structures and rates tend to be the best. The staff is knowledgeable and made every effort to advise us of changing and best rates. One of the better benefits is not being constantly hit with numerous fees for the privilege of banking with them. The only negative that I have is the lack of locations to do ATM transactions. On the flip side, if I have to use a out of network ATM, WPCU allows me to recover the cost of the transaction. So, they do almost everything right to earn and keep my business.… read more

Allegacy Federal Credit Union is a southeastern credit union that provides outstanding service. The company is extremely conservative with credit lending decisions.

I have been a customer for over two decades and have not had a problem. Their standards are high and they take few risks, especially when it comes to borrowing. I can't say that I have always been happy with their decisions, but in retrospect, I believe the correct decision was made.… read more

I have had an Capital One 360 account for about 6 months and I can honestly say I have never been so pleased with a bank before. For those of you who don't know, CO 360 is an online-based banking experience. I moved to the middle of nowhere, Tennessee where there are mostly Credit Unions and very few big banks, so I decided to open a CO 360 account. You can deposit checks just by taking a picture of them with your phone; you can do Person2Person transfers and if the receiver also has Capital One the transfer is instant (Example: I told my roommate to get us Taco Bell on the way home and transferred $15 to her, which she received immediately). They also give you the option of opening as many savings accounts as you'd like, and even have an automatic-savings plan where you choose how much to put in each savings account every month. Whenever I call the bank for any questions or assistance, a customer service representative answers IMMEDIATELY. No confusing and misleading menus! I recommend it to everyone. Did I mention there's no annual fees or minimums?… read more

When I lived in New York I was drawn to TD Bank for their flexible hours (closed at 7pm, open on Sundays). That worked great for a while until my student privileges expired. They would charge me $5 if I didn't have a minimum of $50 in the account. There were also no TD Banks or ATMs in the Brooklyn area, and they would charge you $2 if you withdrew money at a non-TD Bank ATM. In the end I realized this bank was established for rich, Wall Street people and closed my account.… read more

I have a Bank Account with Fifth Third Bank. I absolutely love this bank. The only downfall was the opening deposit amount of $50 because I was just getting back on my feet. At the time I opened my account with them, I had terrible credit due to a separation that I had recently went through. I was trying to get my life back in order and I was denied an account by almost every bank. Fifth Third Bank offered me a second chance with their second chance checking. I opened my second chance checking account and began to use it wisely. After six months of continuous responsible checking with Fifth Third Bank they helped me get approved for a small personal loan to help rebuild my credit. They also offer an identity Theft program that is a great tool to alert you when something looks suspicious. I love Fifth Third Bank!… read more

I had a Bank account with Huntington some time back and at first things seemed all on the up and up, Then Their was a problem with a transfer. I tried to call customer service and was on hold for at least 30-45 minutes and then finally got threw the person on the other end was extremely rude and said they were transferring me to another department. The customer service person failed to mention before transferring me that that department was not even open. Very frustrating and I didn't want to have to wait another 45 minutes on hold again. So anyone who don't like to wait and anyone who don't make $100,000 or more a year should not bank with Huntington.… read more

I was a day late. I spoke with the manager about waving the NSF fee since it was my first time and I was a valued customer. She politely said no. Therefore, I not only had that check bounce, but another check bounced as well. I had to pay two NSF fees and was unable to cover my bills because of it.

The main issue with the bank is the hidden charges which they never tell you about while you are opening an account with them.For transactions that you do overseas they are going to charge $5 as processing fees which other reputed banks are not.Also if for 3 months you don't deposit any money they are going to charge you for that.In my opinion this information should be given to customers prior to opening the account.… read more

I switched to Huntington bank this year because it does not hassle me with service fees, and it is close to the university I will be attending. I love how Huntington is open every day of the week. It is convenient for people who work during the week and can only make it to the bank on the weekend. Overall I am satisfied with this service. My biggest issue is that checks take several days to clear and the bankers can be a bit pushy when they are trying to sell the bank's credit card. For instance, when I walked into the bank the first time after opening an account, the banker I worked with skipped hellos and immediately asked if I was still considering the credit card even though I told him no last time. Usually the staff is friendly and takes care of my needs quickly when I visit, however.… read more

I currently have 5/3 Bank for my checking and savings account, as well as, for a mortgage loan. We chose this bank primarily because of location (right across the street from our previous address). We have never had any issues with them and I have always found their customer service to be excellent (kind, considerate, respectful, pleasant and attentive to my needs). Setting up the mortgage with them and our accounts was easy breezy. The only issue we have with them now is that they are not nearby so we have to travel some ways to get to them now that we relocated. It would be nice if they upgraded to things such as taking a pic of a check and utilizing those tools like Chase does. Outside of that, I do recommend this bank to anyone who is searching for a new bank.… read more

I applied for a home mortgage at Mountain West Bank in Idaho. It turned into a miserable experience. The first mortgage broker took all my information and started to shop for rates. Two anxious weeks later he told me that no one wanted my mortgage. I have great credit and 50% down payment but because it was a rural home with minimal fire protection (the home is on forest service land) no one wanted the loan. I talked to a second loan officer at Mountain West who said that he had other contacts to check. Another long week of waiting and no response. When I started to call these loan officers back they didn't want to take my calls. Very disappointing. I would not recommend doing business with them in the future.… read more

I recently opened up an account with Woodforest National Bank. I have had this account for less than a year, but I can already tell that this bank stands out among the others because it truly cares about its banking customers. Checks deposited to your account are available immediately. Even checks deposited through ATM are available the same day - within the hour. There is no ridiculous holding process for larger checks or deposited funds. The tellers are always friendly and happy to help. The only complaint that I have would be the number of locations in the Houston area, inner loop. One important aspect of your bank is number of locations. Direct deposit works for me now, but any time I need to be physically present for any banking, I do have to hunt down a location.… read more

Citibank. During my younger corporate years, I was delinquent with my credit card payments at one point. Couple of years after, I was unexpectedly approved for a Citibank Visa credit card. I must say that their application assessment is thorough and they give considerations or chances for young professionals to reestablish their credit.

They provide answers to all our questions and will have a very friendly relation with the customers.

Around one year ago I opened an account at a local Busey Bank, in my home city. It´s not a very well-known bank, but it´s close to my home and, so far, I´ve had no problem with it. The bank features a no minimum balance requirement, with the sole condition of getting the statements on-line. It offers debit and credit cards, online banking, mobile and direct deposit, and its customer service is excellent. The only detail I´m a little bit disappointed with is the fact that every time I sign-in online I have to wait for an E-mail with an access code, but that problem is a minor one. The problem lies on the fact that, I don´t know why, the system is unable to recognize my computer. It´s somehow a bargain, but nothing compared to the possibilities it features.… read more

MidFirst Bank has been the best bank I've ever used. The fact that they allow you to use any ATM and not charge you a fee is the most solid choice for going with them. They always make you feel welcome every time you visit their locations. The only negative experience I have had with them is putting a hold on my account for a purchase I made for $2. I appreciate the fact that a bank will look out for you but it caused a problem when I didn't know and I was trying to make a purchase. I guess I would've appreciated a phone call or an email telling me that they put a hold on the account...and did a $2 purchase for something unusual really warrant a hold? Other than that, great bank and I will be a member for years to come!… read more

This bank only gave me about 5 mobile transfer actions per month which was far less than what I would prefer because I like to make transfers from my savings to checking account to make sure I had enough funds for what I wanted to buy. I also use my mobile banking system a lot so it was a serious problem I had with this bank.… read more

Quick Summary:This Visa offer is issued by Simmons First National Bank. This card is intended for consumers, or "personal use" with a nearly perfect credit history. Rates may vary among applicants, however the lowest standard APR is 8.25%* (Variable)*.Important Rates: There is no annual fee for this card.*Rewards:This is not a rewards card.Credit Record Needed:Based on the FICO score recommendation, applicants should have a great or nearly perfect credit record. A FICO credit score of 781 is recommended for a higher chance of approval, but this is not required. There are a number of other factors that this issuer may also consider when making decisions for approval. While your FICO score is usually a very important factor, you may want to consider other areas that may affect a decision for approval. For example, your debt to income ratio, recent credit inquiries, 30+ day delinquencies, or current credit accounts nearing the maximum amount may affect a credit decision.
						FICO scores/credit scores are used to represent the creditworthiness of a person and may be one indicator to the credit type you are eligible for. However, a credit score alone does not guarantee or imply approval for any Simmons First National Bank product.Other Basics:The grace period listed for the Simmons Bank Visa® Platinum is at least 25 days*. So interest charges will not be applied for new purchases during this time. Be aware that some issuers will begin charging interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the transaction date. This card contains the brand of Visa, where acceptance is global. Most businesses that accept credit cards will accept Visa as a form of payment.Our Editor's Commentary:Do you have excellent credit? If so, the Simmons Bank Visa® Platinum credit card is a solid offer worth a second look.

There is no annual fee or balance transfer fee. Better yet, it comes with a low APR of 7.50% (Variable). Combine this with other platinum benefits and you have a winner.Approval Rate:There were 3 people that reported their status to us after they applied. They provided us with helpful qualification information, including their credit scores, the rates offered to them, household income and more. 67% of those applicants were approved.There have been no approvals in our internal system that we can calculate for this card. This could be due to lack of time that this card has been listed at Finance Globe or from other various factors. As we gain more information about the approval rates, we will update them here.  Furthermore, if your FICO score is close to or higher than 781, then your chance of approval 
					may be even greater.Approval Time:Approval time for this offer is not listed. You should expect a final credit decision within a couple of 
				weeks, but normally much sooner.Community Opinion:Based on community reviews, we found that 
				50% of 2 users recommend this card.

Merger with Simmons Bank Offers Product EnhancementsFebruary 1st, 2017On Dec. 14, Southwest Bancorp and Bank SNB announced plans to merge with and into Simmons First National Corporation and Simmons Bank, based in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. This partnership not only enables our shareholders to continue to experience growth on their invested capital but also brings a significant addition of products to those we serve. Bank SNB customers will soon have access to trust and wealth management services, SBA lending and a broader retail product set.
The decision to merge with Simmons Bank was not one we made lightly. It had to be the right partner and the right fit. Our two companies share a common culture and history, and our products complement each other well. Simmons Bank’s geographic reach encompasses Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, and Tennessee, and includes more than 145 branches.  Being part of that network will provide even more convenience for our customers and more opportunities for our employees, who can grow their careers in a combined organization that spans seven states. 
While the merger offers attractive enhancements, let me reassure you that many things will remain the same. Because we complement rather than overlap geographies, you will continue to deal with the excellent local bankers you have always worked with at Bank SNB, and excitingly, the Bank SNB brand will continue to be used even after the merger. 
Despite our excitement and anticipation, the merger will not occur immediately. The regulatory process for consolidating two public banking institutions is long, requiring many levels of governmental approval.  We anticipate closing the transaction during the third quarter of 2017 with final system consolidation during the first quarter of 2018. 
Thank you for your business relationship, and we look forward to bringing you even more products and services in the future.  Stay up-to-date with our progress at bankSNB.com or SimmonsBank.com. 
On the Mark was written by Bank SNB President and CEO, Mark Funke.
