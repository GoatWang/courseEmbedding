Cloud Peak Energy Seeks Acquisitions
Dec 1 16
Unless Cloud Peak Energy Resources LLC specify otherwise in any prospectus supplement, we will use the net proceeds (after the payment of offering expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions) from our sale of securities for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things: paying or refinancing all or a portion of our indebtedness outstanding at the time and funding working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions (which may consist of acquisitions of discrete assets or businesses).


Cloud Peak Energy Resources and Cloud Peak Energy Finance Corp Announce Final Results of its Exchange Offers
Oct 13 16
Cloud Peak Energy Inc. announced the final results of the offers to exchange by its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, Cloud Peak Energy Resources LLC and Cloud Peak Energy Finance Corp. of up to $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of their outstanding 8.50% Senior Notes due 2019 and 6.375% Senior Notes due 2024, for new secured 12.00% second lien notes due 2021 to be issued by the issuers and, in some cases, cash consideration, upon the terms and conditions described in the issuers’ offer to exchange dated September 12, 2016. The Exchange Offers expired at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on October 12, 2016. The Exchange Offers are expected to settle on October 17, 2016. For 8.50% Senior Notes due 2019, a principle amount of $237,906,000 with 79.30% and for 6.375% Senior Notes due 2024, a principle amount of $143,592,000 with 71.80%. As previously announced, the exchange offer for the 2019 Notes was conditioned upon a minimum of $200,000,000 aggregate principal amount outstanding of 2019 Notes being tendered, and that condition has been satisfied. The exchange offer for the 2024 Notes was not conditioned upon any minimum amount of 2024 Notes being tendered. The consideration for each $1,000 principal amount of old notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) prior to October 4, 2016 (the early tender date) and accepted for exchange pursuant to the exchange offers will be the principal amount of the new secured notes with respect to such series of old notes, plus a cash payment of $53 in the case of the 2019 Notes and $40 in the case of the 2024 Notes. The consideration for each $1,000 principal amount of old notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) after the early tender date, but before the expiration date, and accepted for exchange pursuant to the exchange offers will be the principal amount of the new secured notes with respect to such series of old notes, but without any cash payment. Holders whose old notes are exchanged in the exchange offers will also receive accrued and unpaid interest from the most recent interest payment date for the old notes up to, but not including, the settlement date.


Cloud Peak Energy Updates Revolving Credit Facility
Sep 20 16
Cloud Peak Energy reported that, effective September 9, 2016 its subsidiary Cloud Peak Energy Resources entered into the Second Amendment to Credit Agreement which amends its Credit Agreement, dated as of February 21, 2014, among CPE Resources, the guarantors party thereto, PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and a syndicate of lenders. The primary modifications to the Credit Agreement implemented by the Amendment are: Replaced the quarterly EBITDA-based financial covenants that previously required CPE Resources to (a) maintain defined minimum levels of interest coverage and (b) comply with a maximum net secured debt leverage ratio, with a new monthly minimum liquidity covenant that requires CPE Resources to maintain liquidity of not less than $125 million as of the last day of each month. Reduced the maximum borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement to $400 million, from the previous maximum capacity of $500 million. Revised the permitted debt covenant and permitted lien covenant to permit the issuance of second lien debt in an amount up to $350 million. Revised various negative covenants and baskets that would apply to, among other things, the incurrence of debt, making investments, asset dispositions and restricted payments. Established a requirement for deposit account control agreements in favor of the administrative agent for certain deposit accounts. The Amendment did not change the maturity of the Credit Agreement, which remains February 21, 2019.

Antelope
Coal LLC Federal Coal Lease

 

On
June 30, 2011, Antelope Coal LLC, an indirect subsidiary of
Cloud Peak Energy Inc., entered into a Federal Coal Lease (the
“Lease”) with the United States of America through the
Bureau of Land Management (the “BLM”) of the United
States Department of the Interior for the West Antelope II North
Coal Tract, which is effective on July 1, 2011.  Subject to
the terms and conditions thereof, the Lease covers approximately
2,838 acres and provides Antelope Coal LLC with the exclusive right
to drill for, mine, extract, remove or otherwise process and
dispose of the coal deposits in, upon, or under the lands described
in the Lease.  The BLM estimates the tract contains
approximately 350 million tons of mineable coal.  The company
bid approximately $297.7 million and has submitted a payment for
approximately $59.5 million, which is the first of five equal
payments for the federal coal lease.  The company is also
required to pay customary production royalties and per acre annual
rental payments to the BLM, and the company has agreed to indemnify
the BLM from any claims arising out of the company’s
activities and operations under the Lease.

 

The
foregoing overview of the Lease does not contain all of the terms
and conditions of the Lease.  For the complete terms and
conditions, refer to Exhibit 10.1 of this Form 8-K, which
is incorporated into this Item 1.01 by reference.

 
 

 




Item
2.03



 



Creation
of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.




 

Item 1.01
of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated herein by
reference.

 

Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

 

This
Form 8-K contains “forward-looking statements”
within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements
are not statements of historical facts and often contain words such
as “may,” “will,” “expect,”
“believe,” “anticipate,”
“plan,” “estimate,” “seek,”
“could,” “should,” “intend,”
“potential,” or words of similar meaning.
Forward-looking statements are based on management’s current
expectations or beliefs, as well as assumptions and estimates
regarding our company, industry, economic conditions, government
regulations and energy policies and other factors. Forward-looking
statements may include, for example, (1) our estimates of
proven and probable coal reserves, future production and reserve
life, (2) our ability to obtain all required regulatory
permits and approvals to mine newly acquired coal tons in a timely
and cost-effective manner, (3) the impact of pending or future
third party litigation and regulatory challenges, (4) business
development and growth initiatives; and (5) other statements
regarding our plans, strategies, prospects and expectations
concerning our business, operating results, financial condition and
other matters that do not relate strictly to historical facts.
These statements are subject to significant risks, uncertainties,
and assumptions that are difficult to predict and could cause
actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied
in the forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the
factors that could adversely affect our future results, refer to
the risk factors described from time to time in the reports and
registration statements we file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”), including those in Item 1A - Risk
Factors in our most recent Form 10-K and any updates thereto
in our Forms 10-Q and current reports on Forms 8-K. There may be
other risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or
that we currently believe are not material. We make forward-looking
statements based on currently available information, and we assume
no obligation to, and expressly disclaim any obligation to, update
or revise publicly any forward-looking statements made in this
Form 8-K, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise, except as required by law.

necessary and convenient in the exercise of the rights and
privileges granted, subject to the conditions herein
provided.

 

PART Il.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 

Sec. I.
(a) RENTAL RATE - Lessee must pay lessor rental annually and
in advance for each acre or fraction thereof during the continuance
of the lease at the rate of $ 3.00 for each lease
year.

 

(b) RENTAL
CREDITS - Rental will not be credited against either production or
advance royalties for any year.

 

Sec. 2.
(a) PRODUCTION ROYALTIES - The royalty will be 12.5 percent of
the value of the coal as set forth in the regulations. Royalties
are due to lessor the final day of the month succeeding the
calendar month in which the royalty obligation accrues.

 

(b) ADVANCE
ROYALTIES - Upon request by the lessee, the BLM may accept, for a
total of not more than 20 years, the payment of advance royalties
in lieu of continued operation, consistent with the regulations.
The advance royalty will be based on a percent of the value of a
minimum number of tons determined in the manner established by the
advance royalty regulations in effect at the time the lessee
requests approval to pay advance royalties in lieu of continued
operation.

 

Sec. 3.
BONDS - Lessee must maintain in the proper office a lease bond in
the amount of $5,000.00. The BLM may require an increase in this
amount when additional coverage is determined
appropriate.

 

Sec. 4.
DILIGENCE - This lease is subject to the conditions of diligent
development and continued operation, except that these conditions
are excused when operations under the lease are interrupted by
strikes, the elements, or casualties not attributable to the
lessee. The lessor, in the public interest, may suspend the
condition of continued operation upon payment of advance royalties
in accordance with the regulations in existence at the time of the
suspension. Lessee’s failure to produce coal in commercial
quantities at the end of 10 years will terminate the lease. Lessee
must submit an operation and reclamation plan for the BLM’s
approval pursuant to 30 U.S.C. 207(c) prior to conducting any
development or mining operations or taking any other action on a
leasehold which might cause a significant disturbance of the
environment.

 

The lessor
reserves the power to assent to or order the suspension of the
terms and conditions of this lease in accordance with, inter alia,
Section 39 of the Mineral Leasing Act, 30 U.S.C.
209.

 

5. LOGICAL
MINING UNIT (LMU) - Either upon approval by the lessor of the
lessee’s application or at the direction of the lessor, this
lease will become an LMU or part of an LMU, subject to the
provisions set forth in the regulations.

 

The
stipulations established in an LMU approval in effect at the time
of LMU approval will supersede the relevant inconsistent terms of
this lease so long as the lease remains committed to the LMU. If
the LMU of which this lease is a part is dissolved, the lease will
then be subject to the lease terms which would have been applied if
the lease had not been included in an LMU.

 

(Continued
on page 2)

 

  

 

 

Sec. 6.
DOCUMENTS, EVIDENCE AND INSPECTION - At such times and in such form
as lessor may prescribe, lessee must furnish detailed statements
showing the amounts and quality of all products removed and sold
from the lease, the proceeds therefrom, and the amount used for
production purposes or unavoidably lost.

 

Lessee
must keep open at all reasonable times for the inspection by BLM
the leased premises and all surface and underground improvements,
works, machinery, ore stockpiles, equipment, and all books,
accounts, maps, and records relative to operations, surveys, or
investigations on or under the leased lands.

 

Lessee
must allow lessor access to and copying of documents reasonably
necessary to verify lessee compliance with terms and conditions of
the lease.

 

While this
lease remains in effect, information obtained under this section
will be closed to inspection by the public in accordance with the
Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552).

 

Sec. 7.
DAMAGES TO PROPERTY AND CONDUCT OF OPERATIONS - Lessee must comply
at its own expense with all reasonable orders of the Secretary,
respecting diligent operations, prevention of waste, and protection
of other resources.

 

Lessee
must not conduct exploration operations, other than casual use,
without an approved exploration plan. All exploration plans prior
to the commencement of mining operations within an approved mining
permit area must be submitted to the BLM.

 

Lessee
must carry on all operations in accordance with approved methods
and practices as provided in the operating regulations, having due
regard for the prevention of injury to life, health, or property,
and prevention of waste, damage or degradation to any land, air,
water, cultural, biological, visual, and other resources, including
mineral deposits and formations of mineral deposits not leased
hereunder, and to other land uses or users. Lessee must take
measures deemed necessary by lessor to accomplish the intent of
this lease term. Such measures may include, but are not limited to,
modification to proposed siting or design of facilities, timing of
operations, and specification of interim and final reclamation
procedures. Lessor reserves to itself the right to lease, sell, or
otherwise dispose of the surface or other mineral deposits in the
lands and the right to continue existing uses and to authorize
future uses upon or in the leased lands, including issuing leases
for mineral deposits not covered hereunder and approving easements
or rights-of-way. Lessor must condition such uses to prevent
unnecessary or unreasonable interference with rights of lessee as
may be consistent with concepts of multiple use and multiple
mineral development.

 

Sec. 8.
PROTECTION OF DIVERSE INTERESTS, AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY - Lessee
must: pay when due all taxes legally assessed and levied under the
laws of the State or the United States; accord all employees
complete freedom of purchase; pay all wages at least twice each
month in lawful money of the United States; maintain a safe working
environment in accordance with standard industry practices;

About Us
Our Mission Statement
Cloud Peak Energy aims to be a leading energy producer operating in a safe, responsible and caring manner.

We will operate in accordance with our values.
We will not lose sight of our goal of maximizing the long-term financial return to our shareholders.
We believe that by ensuring the safety and long-term health of our employees are not compromised and that by being a good neighbor in the communities in which we live and work, value will be maximized.
We will run the business in a sustainable way to ensure we maintain our “license to operate” (i.e. support of employees, communities, regulators, elected officials, customers, suppliers).

Our current strategy is to build on our strong US domestic position to develop our export sales and explore international production opportunities.



Our Values
Cloud Peak Energy’s values are the underlying principles that guide the way we do business. We will hold each other accountable to not deviate from these values in all our business dealings.
Safety – The safety of everyone involved in our business will never be compromised.
Caring – We care about the impact of our actions on people and the environment both inside and outside the company.
Honesty – We are honest and transparent in all interactions with each other and those outside the company.
Courage – We will be courageous in all our dealings and will hold ourselves accountable for our actions and not avoid difficult issues.
Respect – We will show respect to all those involved in every interaction and work to engage all our employees in the business.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Cloud Peak Energy Inc. (NYSE: CLD) is a firm headquartered in Gillette, Wyoming which mines coal in the Powder River Basin. The company was formed as a corporate spin-off from Rio Tinto Energy America in 2009. [1][2] In its 2009 Annual Report Rio Tinto stated that it held a 48.3% stake in Cloud Peak Energy and its directly owned mines.[3] Cloud Peak Energy also has a 50% stake in the Decker Coal Company, which operates the Decker Mine in Montana.

Operations[edit]
The firm operates three open pit mines from thick deposits in Wyoming and Montana.[4]
Crow Nation[edit]
The firm has contracted with the Crow Nation to mine 20 million tons of coal annually on its reservation for shipment by rail to coal terminals in the Pacific Northwest for shipment to Asia. The project is called the Big Metal Project after a legendary Crow chief.[5] Big Metals Coal is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cloud Peak. The facilities of Cloud Peak's Spring Creek Mine are located directly to the east of the reservation and will be available for the use of Big Metal.[6]
