          Home        

At The Coffey Law Office, our Chicago employment attorneys, take the time to listen to your concerns.
After we understand your important issues, we gather and then carefully review all the pertinent details. If the facts and circumstances of your case indicate that your employer or former employer may have violated a law, we will propose that you retain the firm to further investigate and evaluate your case.
This service also includes contacting the employer or former employer, obtaining a copy of your personnel file, and attempting to negotiate an amicable resolution of the issues. The Coffey Law Office charges a one-time, non-refundable fee for an investigation and evaluation.
The fee is based on your financial ability to pay and the extent of the work required to determine if the case is meritorious. This does not necessarily mean that The Coffey Law Office will litigate your case, but we will perform the most thorough evaluation possible based on the available facts and information. We will then advise you of your legal rights, and whether or not you do indeed have grounds to bring any legal claims.
Chicago Employment and Employee Protection Attorneys 
At The Coffey Law Office, our Chicago employment lawyers value our clients and deal with them in a no nonsense, straightforward manner. We tell clients what they need to know to make informed decisions, not what they want to hear. Call us today for some straight talk about your case. We won’t keep you in the dark and promise you the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, but we will let you know where you stand legally.
In other words, we are not a factory law firm. We are a small law firm dedicated to providing you with the attention and responsiveness that you and your workplace issues deserve. We know it can be devastating to you to lose your job and / or be subjected to other workplace issues that affect you personally, physically, financially and emotionally. Let us help you do something about it.
