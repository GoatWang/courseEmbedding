Testimony of Scott Sleyster
      President, Prudential Retirement Services and Guaranteed Products
February 13, 2003
Good afternoon, Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Andrews and members of
      the Subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to appear this afternoon
      to testify about the need for investment advice for participants in
      Defined Contribution retirement plans and the safety and soundness
      associated with the provisions contained in The Pension Security Act 
      an issue that could impact millions of retirement plan participants. I am
      Scott Sleyster, President of Prudential Retirement Services and Guaranteed
      Products, a business of Prudential Financial. Prudential has over 75 years
      of experience serving the retirement needs of public, private, and
      non-profit organizations. We manage or administer more than $60 billion of
      retirement assets and provide services to 1 million Defined Contribution
      participants and 600,000 Defined Benefit annuitants.

Participants Urgently Need Investment Advice
Let me begin, Mr. Chairman, by stating that as you and Chairman Boehner
      recognized in your sponsorship and reintroduction of The Pension Security
      Act, federal pension law needs to be amended and modernized to encourage
      employers to provide workers with access to professional investment
      advice. When ERISA was passed in 1974, Defined Benefit plans were the
      primary platform upon which retirement plans were being delivered and
      thus, the focus of legislation was based heavily on the Defined Benefit
      system. Today, Defined Contribution plans dominate the retirement
      landscape with over 40 million workers relying on Defined Contribution
      plans for all or part of their non-social security retirement income. As
      you know, Defined Contribution plans shift all the investment risk to
      workers. In Defined Benefit plans, the employer retains the investment
      risk and typically hires actuarial firms to establish funding requirements
      and test plan adequacy, and hires investment professionals to design
      appropriate asset allocation strategies and to make investment decisions.
      In Defined Contribution plans, participants are typically making these
      decisions on their own; and clearly, these workers want and need access to
      advice.
This is evidenced in a survey of participants that Prudential recently
      conducted. The survey found that the majority of workers are still a long
      way from a secure retirement, and that, because of poor goal-setting and a
      lack of savings, more than ever before, they need guidance and advice.
      Among the surveys notable findings are:

57% of American workers feel they are not saving as much as they
          should for their retirement. Among workers who are not enrolled in any
          employer-sponsored retirement plans, this figure rises to 73%.


Few workers have established an informed retirement savings goal.
          Only 52% of all respondents have set any type of a goal, and barely
          28% of those between 21 and 34 have a formal plan. In a very
          disappointing finding, upon follow-up questioning, we learned that 30%
          of those who indicated that they had established a goal indicated they
          did so by guessing. This is consistent with findings in The 2002
          Retirement Confidence Survey2 indicating that only 32% of
          workers surveyed have calculated how much money they will need to have
          saved by the time they retire.


Many workers are eligible for employer-sponsored retirement plans
          but do not participate. Based on their demographic profile, these
          individuals might need the most help. Out of these non-participants,
          68% do not have a college degree, 45% have less than $50,000 in annual
          income. Of these, 54% are married with children.


Defined Contribution participants indicate that they would like to
          get financial advice through their plan to help them better manage
          their investment decisions. A strong majority (63%) of participants
          responded that if they had access to a professional investment
          advisor, they would increase their savings level, and 41% said they
          would reallocate their portfolio based on this advice. Personalized
          advice can also help non-participants gain the confidence they need to
          join employer-sponsored plans. In fact, 71% of non-participants
          indicated that personalized planning would influence their decision to
          participate in the plan.


Fund Providers Are Best Positioned To Offer Advice To The Plan
      Participants In Plans They Administer
Mr. Chairman, we at Prudential are committed to finding effective and
      efficient ways to provide investment advice to Defined Contribution plan
      participants. While some have expressed concern that advice from fund
      providers has the potential to be biased, there are several reasons why
      fund providers are actually best positioned to offer advice to the plans
      they administer. Furthermore, the legislation includes crucial protections
      that ensure that participants are protected from conflicts of interest.
      The reasons we are best suited to provide advice and participants would be
      protected are: Here are the reasons:

Efficient and Effective Delivery: Plan recordkeepers who
          currently offer investment funds already have access to, and knowledge
          of, plan investment options and rules, as well as payroll and
          contribution records for each participant. Delivery of investment
          advice could be done at a fairly low cost since it is only an
          extension of the services already provided to the plan.


ERISA Fiduciary Status: Advisors would be required to
          acknowledge their status as fiduciaries and be subject to ERISAs
          fiduciary responsibility rules and prudence standard. ERISA requires
          fiduciaries to act in the best interest of participants and to be
          liable for any breach of their fiduciary duty. Simply put, under these
          rules it would be illegal for advisors to make specific investment
          recommendations for the sole purpose of increasing their (or their
          firms) compensation.


Marketplace Standards: The Defined Contribution market is
          intensely competitive and will would create significant pressure for
          advisors to provide the best possible advice. Inevitably, this will
          lead to benchmarking of performance, which will further safeguard
          participants interests. Plan fiduciaries Also, employerswill have
          an extensive universe of investment advisors to choose from and ample
          opportunities and choices to replace any advisors not performing at
          the highest level.


Monitoring by Plan Fiduciary: Plan sponsors would continue to
          select the range of investment choices available to participants in
          their Defined Contribution plans. ERISAs fiduciary rules will would
          continue to apply to the employer who selects the advisor. Thus, the
          employer would be required to act prudently and solely in the interest
          of participants in selecting and periodically monitoring the advisor
          to assure that advice was being provided in the best interest of
          participants. However, the bill does encourage employers to offer
          advice by making it clear that if they fulfill these duties, they will
          not be liable for the specific advice given by the advisor.



Fee and Limitation Disclosure: Investment advisors would be
        required to disclose, in plain writing, to the employer and to
        participants: fees, the nature of the advisors affiliation (if any)
        with the available investment options, and any limitations on the scope
        of the advice they provide.


Participant Control: Participants would remain in control of
        their investment decisions. The bill requires that all investment
        decisions be made by the participant; not the advisor. The advisor may
        not make discretionary would not have discretion to make investment
        decisions on behalf of participants.

Credentialed Advisors: Advisors would be required to be
        appropriately credentialed and would be subject to regulations under
        other Federal or state securities, banking or insurance laws.
      

Conclusion
Mr. Chairman, if the goal of the legislative efforts goal is to help as
      many qualified plan participants as possible gain access to high quality,
      professional investment advice, the overall solution must include the
      ability for fund providers to offer advice. Fund providers serving as
      recordkeepers are in the best position to provide investment advice in a
      low cost and effective manner. If we do not find a more effective way to
      allow Defined Contribution plan participants to access professional
      investment advice, we will not have done enough to help Americans make
      real progress toward achieving retirement security.
Thank you for your time and for inviting me to testify today.
