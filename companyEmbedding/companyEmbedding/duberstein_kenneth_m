Life and career[edit]
Duberstein was born to a Jewish family,[1][2] in Brooklyn, New York. He graduated from Poly Prep Country Day School and Franklin and Marshall College (A.B. 1965) and American University (M.A. 1966). He received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Franklin and Marshall in 1989. While in college he was a member of Zeta Beta Tau. He is married to Jacqueline Duberstein and has four children.[3]
During President Reagan's two terms in office, he served as White House Chief of Staff (1988–1989), as well as both the Assistant and the Deputy Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs (1981–83). Duberstein is said to be the first Jewish-American appointed as White House Chief of Staff (although Hamilton Jordan's maternal grandmother was Jewish).
Prior to joining the Administration, he was Vice President and Director of Business-Government Relations of the Committee for Economic Development. He returned to the private sector between his various White House assignments as Vice President of Timmons & Company Inc, one of Washington's top lobbying firms.[4] Some of the firm's clients include the American Petroleum Institute, Anheuser-Busch, Chrysler, Teva Pharmaceuticals, the American Council of Life Insurers, the American Medical Association, and VISA.[5]
His earlier government service included Deputy Under Secretary of Labor during the Ford Administration and Director of Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs at the U.S. General Services Administration. He began his public service on Capitol Hill as an assistant to Senator Jacob K. Javits.
Among the Board of Directors on which Mr. Duberstein serves are: The Boeing Company, ConocoPhillips, the Fleming Companies, Inc., and The St. Paul Companies, Inc.[6] He also is on the Board of Governors for the American Stock Exchange and NASD, and has served on the Board of Directors of Fannie Mae.[7] He serves on the advisory board for Washington, DC based non-profit America Abroad Media.[8][9]
Duberstein is a trustee of Franklin & Marshall College and Johns Hopkins University and serves as well on a wide range of commissions, task forces, and cultural, educational and volunteer boards, including: Vice Chairman of the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts, Harvard University's Kennedy School Harvard's Institute of Politics Senior Advisory Committee, the board of directors of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Brookings Institution,[10] the Ronald Reagan Institute of Emergency medicine, the National Alliance to End Homelessness,[11] Ford's Theater and The American Council for Capital Formation.[12]
Prior to 1987, Duberstein served on the Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad. He was succeeded in that position by Betty Heitman, the co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee from 1983 to 1987.[13]
In January 1989, Duberstein was awarded the President's Citizens Medal by President Reagan. [14] He is chairman of the Ethics Committee for the U.S. Olympic Committee and served as vice chairman of the independent Special Bid Oversight Reform Commission for the U.S. Olympics Committee. He also appeared on Bloomberg alongside John Podesta.[citation needed]
Duberstein has been a "political adviser" to former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, according to syndicated columnist Robert Novak, who says Duberstein was a source for David Corn's and Michael Isikoff's book about the Valerie Plame affair in which Armitage was found to be the one who leaked Plame's CIA status to Novak.[15]
In an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria aired November 2, 2008, Duberstein announced his support of Democratic candidate Barack Obama for president. This came after he was rebuffed by Sen. John McCain, the GOP nominee, for the position of director of his presidential transition, according to ABC News.[16][17][18][19]
Duberstein was also a consultant on the West Wing episodes '2162 Votes' and 'Separation of Powers.'
Duberstein has been hired by Russian authorities, via Goldman Sachs (an international investment banking firm), to lobby against the Magnitsky Bill (as known as the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act), a bill in the U.S. Congress "to impose sanctions on persons responsible for the detention, abuse, or death of Sergei Magnitsky, and for other gross violations of human rights in the Russian Federation".[20][21]
In 2013, Duberstein was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the Hollingsworth v. Perry case.[22] His position succeeded, as the court would go on to effectively legalize same-sex marriage in California.
Personal life[edit]
He is married to Jacqueline Fain; and has four children from a previous marriage: Jennifer, Jeff, Andy, and Samantha.[23][24]

Life and career[edit]
Duberstein was born to a Jewish family,[1][2] in Brooklyn, New York. He graduated from Poly Prep Country Day School and Franklin and Marshall College (A.B. 1965) and American University (M.A. 1966). He received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Franklin and Marshall in 1989. While in college he was a member of Zeta Beta Tau. He is married to Jacqueline Duberstein and has four children.[3]
During President Reagan's two terms in office, he served as White House Chief of Staff (1988–1989), as well as both the Assistant and the Deputy Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs (1981–83). Duberstein is said to be the first Jewish-American appointed as White House Chief of Staff (although Hamilton Jordan's maternal grandmother was Jewish).
Prior to joining the Administration, he was Vice President and Director of Business-Government Relations of the Committee for Economic Development. He returned to the private sector between his various White House assignments as Vice President of Timmons & Company Inc, one of Washington's top lobbying firms.[4] Some of the firm's clients include the American Petroleum Institute, Anheuser-Busch, Chrysler, Teva Pharmaceuticals, the American Council of Life Insurers, the American Medical Association, and VISA.[5]
His earlier government service included Deputy Under Secretary of Labor during the Ford Administration and Director of Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs at the U.S. General Services Administration. He began his public service on Capitol Hill as an assistant to Senator Jacob K. Javits.
Among the Board of Directors on which Mr. Duberstein serves are: The Boeing Company, ConocoPhillips, the Fleming Companies, Inc., and The St. Paul Companies, Inc.[6] He also is on the Board of Governors for the American Stock Exchange and NASD, and has served on the Board of Directors of Fannie Mae.[7] He serves on the advisory board for Washington, DC based non-profit America Abroad Media.[8][9]
Duberstein is a trustee of Franklin & Marshall College and Johns Hopkins University and serves as well on a wide range of commissions, task forces, and cultural, educational and volunteer boards, including: Vice Chairman of the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts, Harvard University's Kennedy School Harvard's Institute of Politics Senior Advisory Committee, the board of directors of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Brookings Institution,[10] the Ronald Reagan Institute of Emergency medicine, the National Alliance to End Homelessness,[11] Ford's Theater and The American Council for Capital Formation.[12]
Prior to 1987, Duberstein served on the Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad. He was succeeded in that position by Betty Heitman, the co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee from 1983 to 1987.[13]
In January 1989, Duberstein was awarded the President's Citizens Medal by President Reagan. [14] He is chairman of the Ethics Committee for the U.S. Olympic Committee and served as vice chairman of the independent Special Bid Oversight Reform Commission for the U.S. Olympics Committee. He also appeared on Bloomberg alongside John Podesta.[citation needed]
Duberstein has been a "political adviser" to former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, according to syndicated columnist Robert Novak, who says Duberstein was a source for David Corn's and Michael Isikoff's book about the Valerie Plame affair in which Armitage was found to be the one who leaked Plame's CIA status to Novak.[15]
In an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria aired November 2, 2008, Duberstein announced his support of Democratic candidate Barack Obama for president. This came after he was rebuffed by Sen. John McCain, the GOP nominee, for the position of director of his presidential transition, according to ABC News.[16][17][18][19]
Duberstein was also a consultant on the West Wing episodes '2162 Votes' and 'Separation of Powers.'
Duberstein has been hired by Russian authorities, via Goldman Sachs (an international investment banking firm), to lobby against the Magnitsky Bill (as known as the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act), a bill in the U.S. Congress "to impose sanctions on persons responsible for the detention, abuse, or death of Sergei Magnitsky, and for other gross violations of human rights in the Russian Federation".[20][21]
In 2013, Duberstein was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the Hollingsworth v. Perry case.[22] His position succeeded, as the court would go on to effectively legalize same-sex marriage in California.
Personal life[edit]
He is married to Jacqueline Fain; and has four children from a previous marriage: Jennifer, Jeff, Andy, and Samantha.[23][24]

Kenneth M. Duberstein
Chairman & CEO
Kenneth M. Duberstein is chairman and CEO of The Duberstein Group, an independent strategic planning and consulting company advising leading corporations and a select group of trade associations.
Duberstein served as a key member of the Reagan Administration during his various assignments as White House Chief of Staff, Deputy Chief of Staff and Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs.  He was a principal architect of the winning Reagan congressional coalition during the historic first term and returned to the White House for the last two years of the Administration to help lead and guide the rebuild of the Reagan Presidency after the so-called Iran-Contra scandal. Reagan left office at 68% job approval; the highest of any two term president since polling began.
Among the Board of Directors on which Duberstein serves are:  The Boeing Company (Lead Director and Chairman of the Governance, Organization and Nominating Committees), the Travelers Companies (Chairman of the Nominating and Governance Committee), and Mack-Cali Realty Corporation.  He previously was the Presiding Director at Conoco-Phillips and a member of the board at Dell, Inc.
He is a Lifetime Trustee of Franklin & Marshall College and The Kennedy Center for Preforming Arts.  He is chairman of the Harvard University Institute of Politics at the Kennedy School, and serves on a wide range of commissions, task forces, and cultural, educational and volunteer boards, including the board of directors of the Brookings Institution, the National Alliance to End Homelessness, and The Colin L. Powell School of Civic and Global Leadership.  He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, having served on its board for 10 years.
Prior to joining the Reagan Administration, Duberstein was Vice President and Director of Business-Government Relations of the Committee for Economic Development. He returned to the private sector between his various White House assignments as Vice President of Timmons & Company Inc., a government relations firm. His earlier government service included Deputy Under Secretary of Labor during the Ford Administration and Director of Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs at the U.S. General Services Administration. He began his public service on Capitol Hill as an assistant to Senator Jacob K. Javits (R-NY).
From 2003 to 2006, Duberstein was a consultant for storyline and accuracy for the Emmy Award winning TV series West Wing. He also appears as a commentator on network cable and Sunday morning news programs.
He was awarded the President’s Citizens Medal by President Reagan in January 1989. Duberstein graduated from Franklin and Marshall College (A.B., 1965) and American University (M.A., 1966). He received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Franklin and Marshall in 1989.
He is married to the former Jacquelyn Fain and he has four children: Jennifer, Jeff, Andy and Samantha.

Based on reports released by the International Atomic Energy Association (IAEA), Iran is in compliance with the parameters of the agreement, specifically regarding its levels of low-enriched uranium, heavy water, its reconfiguration of the Arak heavy water reactor, and the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant. In exchange for its compliance with the deal, sanctions on Iranian businesses and banks have been lifted. All News

Duberstein Group Firm  Lobbying ProfileFormer Chief of Staff, White HouseSee also: Individual Lobbying Profile 
BioWhen Washington's regulatory apparatus appeared poised to block Comcast's attempt last year to acquire NBC Universal from  General Electric , Comcast turned to a cadre of lobbying firms to lubricate the process. One of their highest-paid advocates was  The Duberstein Group , led by Chairman  Kenneth Duberstein .  Duberstein, a serial revolver who has spent a career commuting between K Street and the Capitol, was eager to assist.  Comcast spent nearly $12.94 million in 2010 to lobby the federal government, and on January 23 the New York Times reported  that both the FCC and Justice Department approved the acquisition with next to no interference from Congress.  Duberstein, intimately familiar with legislative, executive, and private sector transactions, has represented Comcast for 12 years. Duberstein came to Washington as an assistant  to Sen. Jacob Javits (R-NY) in 1966. Between 1970 and 1981, he worked in the General Services Administration, and then, the Department of Labor.  Show More Information About Duberstein, Kenneth M Starting in 1981, Duberstein worked in the Reagan administration as the assistant to the president for legislative affairs, leaving in 1984 to work as congressional liaison for the Reagan-Bush re-election campaign. Afterward, he took a position at the lobbying firm  Timmons & Company . While at Timmons, he lobbied for clients that included the American Petroleum Institute, Anheuser Busch, TEVA Pharmaceuticals and Visa.  He left Timmons in 1987 after being appointed President Ronald Reagan's chief of staff, a position he held until the end of Reagan's presidency. In 1990, he founded the Duberstein Group, and his current clients include Comcast, BP America, Time Warner Cable, Goldman Sachs, General Motors and Honeywell. Duberstein's lucrative contracts will have him frequently making the commute from K Street to the Capitol for a long time, given the fallout from BP's role in the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, continuing allegations of fiduciary wrongdoing on the part of Goldman Sachs, and impending negotiations over net neutrality making his cable companies skittish.Employment TimelineEmployment HistoryPeriodEmployerTitleAdditional Info1990-Duberstein GroupRevolving Door Personnel: (14)Chairman & CEOFirm lobbying profileMajor Donor profile1987-1989White HouseRevolving Door Personnel: (676)Chief of StaffAgency lobbying profileMajor Donor profile1984-1984Reagan-Bush '84Revolving Door Personnel: (5)Member, Congressional Liaison Team1984-1986Timmons & CoRevolving Door Personnel: (20)VPFirm lobbying profile1981-1983White HouseRevolving Door Personnel: (676)Asst to Pres, Legislative AffairsAgency lobbying profileMajor Donor profile1976-1977Dept of LaborRevolving Door Personnel: (119)Dep UndersecAgency lobbying profileMajor Donor profile1970-1976General Services AdministrationRevolving Door Personnel: (37)Dir, Cong Intergovt AffairsAgency lobbying profileMajor Donor profile1966-1966Javits, Jacob KRevolving Door Personnel: (7)Research AsstCmte for Economic DevelopmentRevolving Door Personnel: (5)VP, Govt Relations  Lobbying Firm     Private Sector     Federal Govt.      State/Local Govt.

Influence & Lobbying
The primary goal of much of the money that flows through U.S. politics is this: Influence. 
	    Corporations and industry groups, labor unions, single-issue organizations - together, they 
	    spend billions of dollars each year to gain access to decision-makers in government, all in 
	    an attempt to influence their thinking.

    found at the left, to learn more about Washington's influence industry and its most powerful players. 
Interest Groups
Just about any interest group you can think of has a presence in Washington-and spends 
    money to maintain that presence. Here we've totaled all the campaign contributions over the
	years from more than 100 interest groups, so that you can see patterns that might 
    have affected policies with an impact on your life. We also track how much interest groups 
    have been spending on lobbying, which is the other side of the influence coin.
Lobbying
Professional advocates make big bucks to lobby members of Congress and government 
    officials on the issues their clients care about. But the money that industries, companies, 
    unions and issue groups spend on lobbying is often just a drop in the bucket compared to 
    what they can reap in return if their lobbyists are successful. Here you can see who 
    spends what on federal lobbying and where they focus their resources. 
Revolving Door
You've heard it before - it's not what you know, it's who you know. In our nation's capital, 
    success comes with a combination of knowledge and personal connections. This database tracks 
    thousands of individuals who've spun through Washington's "revolving door", employing professional 
    relationships and know-how accumulated through public service to advance the goals of their private 
    employers.
PACs
In a campaign finance system where all the money originates from individuals, political action 
	committees, or PACs, control the most "corporate" of money. Controlled by companies, trade 
	associations, unions, issue groups and even politicians (a subset called "leadership PACs"), these 
	committees pool contributions from individuals and distribute them to candidates, political parties 
	and other PACs. PACs can also spend money independently on political activities, including advertising 
	and other efforts to support or oppose candidates in an election.
Organizations
Influence in Washington is created from many ingredients. Here we give you at-a-glance profiles of the 
	political donations, outside spending and lobbying expenditures of more than 20,000 labor unions, corporations 
	and trade groups, as well as the number of lawmakers who have personally invested in them. More detailed 
	profiles are available for the 150 or so biggest all-time contributors since 1989.
527s
For the longest time, campaign ads were almost exclusively produced by candidates and political 
    parties, but in recent years outside issue groups have been getting in on the action. They often 
    operate as so-called 527 committees (taking their name from the relevant section of the IRS tax 
    code). Sometimes mysteriously named, these advocacy groups frequently have ties to labor, 
    big business and super-wealthy individuals. Unlike political committees, they can accept 
    unlimited contributions from just about anyone, and they deploy that money in various ways to 
    influence elections. Keep an eye on these shadowy groups here.

Revolving Door
Although the influence powerhouses that line
	    Washington's K Street are just a few miles from the U.S. Capitol building, the
	    most direct path between the two doesn't necessarily involve public
	    transportation. Instead, it's through a door—a revolving door that shuffles
	    former federal employees into jobs as lobbyists, consultants and strategists
	    just as the door pulls former hired guns into government careers.

 While officials in
		the executive branch, Congress and senior congressional staffers spin in and
		out of the private and public sectors, so too does privilege, power, access
		and, of course, money.
Use the search options to discover which public
		relations firms have signed up former White House employees, which lobbyists
		have brought their interests with them to the powerful appropriations committees,
		which interests are employing former members of Congress to lobby on their
		behalf...and much more.

Dina PowellDeputy National Security Advisor
On March 15, President Trump elevated Dina Powell to be his deputy national security adviser, after she'd spent just over two months as assistant to the president and senior counselor for economic initiatives. This kind of promotion is old hat for Powell, who has ascended rapidly throughout her career in both policy and finance.Prior to her work in the Trump administration, Powell was at Goldman Sachs for nine years in various roles, including as president of the Goldman Sachs Foundation -- which, with assets of  more than $500 million, is one of the world's largest corporate charities. She is one of five Goldman alums in the administration, along with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn. However, unlike her colleagues Mnuchin and Cohn, Powell's appointment is a return engagement.

		        She previously worked out of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., and her portfolio includes deep experience in GOP politics. As a fresh University of Texas graduate, Powell went to work in the office of Dick Armey (R-Texas) in 1995, his first year as House Majority Leader. She then became the director of congressional affairs at the Republican National Committee.In 2003, the Egyptian-born Arabic speaker took her first White House job, as assistant in the personnel office under President Bush, the youngest person ever to hold the job. Two years later, she moved to the State Department, as an assistant secretary for educational and cultural affairs. Now, Powell finds herself back in the White House with her most prominent and powerful position yet, dealing with issues of national security.Powell and Ivanka Trump are expected to work on women's economic issues together. She also sits on a number of boards, including those of the Council on Foreign Relations and the World Economic Forum, a gathering best known for its annual retreat in Davos, Switzerland.Updated March 30, 2017 by Ben Berliner
