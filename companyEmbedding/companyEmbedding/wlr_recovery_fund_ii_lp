”), and the Stockholders identified on Schedule 1, and
provides the terms under which the Company was organized and will
operate.



          NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained
herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto,
intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:




I. ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS



     1.1 Formation/Purpose .
(a) The formation of the Company, a single employer separate
and apart from any other entity, without limitation, as a Delaware
limited liability company under the Delaware Limited Liability
Company Act of 1992, as amended (the “ Act ”),
and all actions taken by the Person who executed and filed its
certificate of formation are hereby adopted and ratified, such
Person being an “authorized person” within the meaning
of the Act.



          (b) The
Company is organized to (i) be a holding company for various
automotive interiors systems components businesses, including the
Lear North American ISD Business, and (ii) engage in all such
other lawful transactions and business activities as may be
determined by the Board, subject to Section 3.4(c).



     1.2 Governance as if a Delaware
Corporation . The rights of the members of the Company
(which are referred to herein as “ Stockholders
”) will be governed by the applicable Constituent Documents,
which will be interpreted as if the Company were a corporation
incorporated under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the
“ DGCL ”) and its members were stockholders of
such corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing:



          (a) Except
as required by the Act, neither the Charter, any amendments thereto
nor any other organizational instrument (other than the Certificate
of Formation) will be required to be filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware as required under Sections 101,
103, 241 or 242 of the DGCL (any such document which would
otherwise be so required to be filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware will be filed with the Secretary of the
Company);



          (b) All
taxes and fees otherwise payable by the Company pursuant to
Section 391 of the DGCL will be determined under and payable
solely in accordance with the Act; and


 




 



          (c) Notwithstanding
any other provision hereof, neither the Company nor any other
Person will be subject to the provisions of DGCL Sections 145,
154, 160(a), 170, 172, 173, 174, 203, 220 or 282.



     1.3 Liability to Third
Parties . Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement
or the other Constituent Documents, the debts, obligations and
liabilities of the Company, whether arising in contract, tort or
otherwise, will be solely its debts, obligations and liabilities
and none of the direct or indirect equity holders, directors or
Affiliates of the Company (the “ Company Persons
”) will be personally obligated for any such debt, obligation
or liability. Except as set forth in this Agreement or the other
Constituent Documents, no Company Person will be (i) liable for any
debts, obligations or liabilities, whether arising in contract,
tort or otherwise, of the Company or any other Company Person or
(ii) required to loan or contribute any funds to the
Company.



     1.4 Powers . The
Company will possess and may exercise all of the powers and
privileges granted by the Act, the DGCL (as if the Company were a
corporation), any other law or this Agreement, together with any
powers incidental thereto, so far as such powers and privileges are
necessary or convenient to the conduct, promotion or attainment of
its permitted business purposes or activities. Without limiting the
generality or effect of any other provision hereof, the Company
will have the power to effect the acquisition of any business or
take any other action consistent with the DGCL. As to any third
person or entity, the signature of any officer of the Company on
any document will be conclusive evidence of the authority of such
officer to execute such document for and on behalf and in the name
of the Company.



     1.5 Fiduciary Duties .
No director of the Company shall be personally liable to the
Company or any of its Stockholders for monetary damages for breach
of fiduciary duty as a director, provided that the foregoing
provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director
(i) for breach of such director’s duty of loyalty to the
Company or its Stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in
good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing
violation of law, or (iii) for any transaction from which such
director derived an improper personal benefit.




II. CAPITALIZATION



     2.1 Capitalization .
The capitalization of the Company is as set forth in the Charter.
Subject to Sections 3.2 and 3.4(c), the Board has the
authority to issue additional Capital Stock, which may include
different classes of equity.



     2.2 Stockholders .
(a) As of the Effective Date, and as a condition to the
closing of the Lear Acquisition Agreement, the Stockholders will

contribute $50 million in cash in exchange for fifty percent
(50%) of the Capital Stock, and (iii) Franklin will contribute

2




 



the Stockholders and the number of shares of Capital Stock and
percentage holding of each of them respectively is as set forth on
Schedule 1 , and, as of the Effective Date, no other
parties shall own or have rights to acquire any Capital Stock of
the Company.



          (b) Subject
to Sections 3.2 and 3.4(c), the Company is authorized to issue
Capital Stock in exchange for either capital contributions, or the
provision of services (together, “ Capital Stock
Consideration ”), having a Fair Market Value equal to the
value of the Capital Stock issued as determined in good faith by
the Board. The amount of Capital Stock held by each Stockholder
shall not be affected by either (i) any issuance by the
Company of Capital Stock to other Stockholders, (ii) any
change in the Capital Account of such Stockholder (other than such
changes to reflect additional Capital Stock Consideration from such
Stockholder in exchange for new Capital Stock) or (iii) any
distributions not in redemption of Capital Stock. The shares of
Capital Stock shall be certificated and the Board shall maintain,
or cause to be maintained, a Capital Stock ledger. No Stockholder
shall be required to make any additional capital contributions to
the Company.



          (c) Except
as otherwise provided in this Agreement, no Person other than the
parties set forth on Schedule 1 will be a Stockholder of the
Company, and no Capital Stock of the Company will be issued or
transferred, without compliance with the terms and provisions of
the Company’s Constituent Documents and the execution by any
such Person of a joinder to this Agreement whereby such Person
agrees to be bound by this Agreement and the Company’s other
Constituent Documents.



          (d) WLR
is the “ Majority Stockholder ”; provided that
once WLR ceases to own 10% or more of the Common Stock of the
Company, it will no longer be the Majority Stockholder for any
purpose hereunder.



          (e) Franklin
and Lear NAOC are the “ Minority Stockholders ”;
provided that upon the earlier of (i) a Minority Stockholder
ceasing to own 5% or more of the Common Stock of the Company or
(ii) a Minority Stockholder selling or transferring more than
20% of the Common Stock it held as of the Effective Date other than
to a Permitted Transferee or in connection with a pledge (or
exercise pursuant thereto), it will no longer be a Minority
Stockholder for any purpose hereunder; provided however, that in no
event shall Lear NAOC cease to be a Minority Stockholder under
clause (i) prior to the date that is eighteen months after the
Effective Date.



          (f) For
purposes of the Act, the Stockholders are the members of the
Company.



     2.3 2007 EBITDA . The
Company shall deliver to the Stockholders, no later than
15 days after the Company’s receipt of its audited
consolidated financial statements for the year ending December 31,
2007, the Company’s calculation of 2007 EBITDA (the “
Company Calculation ”).



     (a) The Company Calculation
shall be prepared in good faith, based on the Company’s books
and records and, for consolidated net income and the items
in


3




 



subsections (i) (ii), (iii), (iv), (vii), (viii), (ix) and
(xii) in the definition of 2007 EBITDA, in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.



          (b) If
Lear disagrees with the Company Calculation, Lear shall provide
written notice (a “ Dispute Notice ”) to the
Company and the other Stockholders of its objection(s) to such
calculation. If Lear does not provide a Dispute Notice within
45 days after the Company’s delivery of the Company
Calculation, the 2007 EBITDA set forth therein shall be deemed the
finally determined 2007 EBITDA. If Lear delivers a Dispute Notice,
the Company and Lear will use good faith efforts during the 30-day
period after the delivery of such Dispute Notice (the “
Resolution Period ”) to seek to resolve the
differences set forth therein. If the Company and Lear cannot reach
written agreement during the Resolution Period, their
disagreements, limited to those issues still in dispute, will be
submitted by the parties for determination by the Accounting
Firm.



          (c) During
the period beginning on the date of the delivery of the Company
Calculation and ending upon the final determination of 2007 EBITDA
(including the Resolution Period, if necessary), the parties will
provide to each other such reasonable access to personnel involved
in the Company Calculation and to financial and other information
of the Company as it may request in good faith to determine 2007
EBITDA.



          (d) The
Company and the Stockholders shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to submit its written
statement of its adjudication of the disputes regarding 2007 EBITDA
within 30 days after submission of the matter to the
Accounting Firm. The determination of the Accounting Firm shall
constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and
unappealable and upon which a judgment may be entered by any court
having jurisdiction thereof. In acting hereunder, the Accounting
Firm shall be entitled to the privileges and immunities of
arbitrators.



          (e) If
the finally determined 2007 EBITDA is less than $41,666,666.67, the
Stockholders will contribute to the Company an amount (the “
Shortfall Amount ”) in cash equal to the lesser of
(i) three times the amount by which 2007 EBITDA is less than
$41,666,666.67 and (ii) $60 million. Each of the Stockholders
will contribute to the Company an amount equal to the product of
(x) its respective Company Common Stock Percentage Interests,
multiplied by (y) the total aggregate additional capital
contribution required of all the Stockholders.



          (f) The
amount of any additional capital contribution required hereunder
shall be payable solely by a release of the Escrowed Funds
(together with any income earned on such released funds) or from a
drawdown on a Letter of Credit posted in lieu of depositing funds
in escrow.



          (g) If
the finally determined 2007 EBITDA is equal to or greater than
$41,666,666.67, each of the Stockholders will be entitled to the
return of its entire escrow deposit (plus any income thereon) under
the Escrow Agreement. Similarly, each Stockholder shall be entitled
to have returned promptly from the escrow account the amount by
which such Stockholder’s total Escrowed Funds exceeds
such


4




 



Stockholder’s additional capital contribution required
pursuant to subsection (e) above (together with any income
earned on such released funds).



          (h) Within
three Business Days after the final determination of 2007 EBITDA,
the Company and the Stockholders will provide the escrow agent
under the Escrow Agreement with joint written instructions to
disburse the funds held in escrow thereunder in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.



          (i) The
Company and the Stockholders agree that no additional shares of
Capital Stock will be issued in respect of additional capital
contributions pursuant to this Section 2.3(e), except to
prevent dilution vis-à-vis a third party Stockholder who has
purchased shares of Capital Stock or Options between the Effective
Date and the date of such capital contribution; provided that the
Stockholders’ percentage of ownership of the Company relative
to each other shall stay substantially the same following such
capital contribution.



          (j) The
Company and Stockholders agree that any amounts paid pursuant to
Section 2.3(e) shall for purposes of the Code be accorded
treatment as a capital contribution pursuant to Section 721 of
the Code and none of the parties will take any action or position
inconsistent with such treatment under the Code.



     2.4 Escrowed Funds; Letter of
Credit . As of the Effective Date, each of Lear NAOC, WL
Ross and Franklin shall (a) execute and deliver the Escrow
Agreement and (b) deliver to the escrow agent under the Escrow
Agreement its respective portion of the Escrowed Funds to be
deposited into the escrow account established pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement by delivery to such escrow agent of cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit in a form reasonably acceptable to
Lear NAOC, in the case of a Letter of Credit for the account of WL
Ross or Franklin, and to WL Ross and Franklin, in the case of a
Letter of Credit for the account of Lear NAOC (each a “
Letter of Credit ” and collectively, the “
Letters of Credit ”). The Escrowed Funds (including
the Letters of Credit) shall be used solely as contemplated by
Section 2.3.




III. GOVERNANCE



     3.1 Charter and Bylaws
. Except as provided in this Agreement, the Company will be
governed by the Charter and Bylaws.



     3.2 Preemptive Rights .
After the Effective Date, the Company will not issue, sell or
exchange, agree to issue, sell or exchange, or reserve or set aside
for issuance, sale or exchange, any Capital Stock or Options
(collectively, the “ Preemptive Securities ”),
unless the Company has first offered to sell to each of the
Stockholders such Stockholder’s Pro Rata Share (as defined
below) of the Preemptive Securities, at a price and on such other
terms as have been specified by the Company in writing delivered to
each such Stockholder (the “ Preemptive Offer
”), which Preemptive Offer will be on terms substantially
identical to the terms of the Company’s proposed issuance,
sale or exchange of Preemptive Securities and will remain open and
irrevocable for a period of 20 Business Days from the date it is
delivered by the


5




 



Company (the “ Preemptive Offer Period ”).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Preemptive Securities will not
include (a) Options or other equity securities or rights
issued pursuant to an Employee Plan approved by the Board (subject
to Section 3.4(b)(ii)) and any Capital Stock issued upon the
exercise of any such Options or other equity securities so long as
such Options issued or the equity securities issuable upon exercise
of such Options do not represent in excess of 10% of the fully
diluted Common Stock, (b) the Lear Warrant or any equity
securities issued pursuant to the terms of the Lear Warrant,
(c) equity securities issued by the Company as direct
consideration in connection with the acquisition of another
business entity by the Company or a Subsidiary, whether by merger,
purchase of all or substantially all of the assets of such entity
or otherwise, (d) securities issued as a result of any split
of, reclassification, subdivision of or other distribution pro rata
with respect to, the equity securities of the Company, or
(e) any equity securities issued in a Public Offering or
pursuant to the Reorganization. Each Stockholder may elect to
purchase (or to have its designated Affiliate that is also, or
simultaneously with such purchase becomes, a Stockholder, purchase)
all or any portion of such Stockholder’s Pro Rata Share of
the Preemptive Securities as specified in the Preemptive Offer at
the price and on the terms specified therein by delivering written
notice of such election to the Company as soon as practicable but
in any event before the expiration of the Preemptive Offer Period.
Any Preemptive Securities not elected to be purchased by the end of
the Preemptive Offer Period will be reoffered for a five-day period
by the Company on a pro rata basis to the Stockholders who have
elected to purchase their full Pro Rata Share of the Preemptive
Securities. In the event the Stockholders fail to exercise in full
their preemptive rights as set forth above with respect to the
Preemptive Securities, the Company shall have 60 days
thereafter to sell such Preemptive Securities, at a cash or cash
equivalent price that is not less than the price specified in the
Preemptive Offer. In the event the Company has not sold the
Preemptive Securities within such 60-day period, the Company shall
not thereafter issue or sell any Preemptive Securities without
first complying with the first offer rights set forth in this
Section 3.2. Each Stockholder’s “ Pro Rata
Share ” of Preemptive Securities is the product of
(x) the total number of Preemptive Securities and (y) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of shares or
units of Common Stock then owned by such Stockholder and the
denominator of which is the total number of shares or units of
Common Stock then outstanding.



     3.3 Board Composition and
Representation . (a) The number of directors
comprising the Board will not exceed five. Subject to
Section 3.3(b) and Section 3.3(c), the directors
comprising the Board will consist of (i) two (or, in the
circumstances described in Section 3.3(b), three)
representatives designated by WLR (as long as WLR is the Majority
Stockholder), one of whom will be the Chairman of the Board,
(ii) one representative designated by Franklin (as long as
Franklin is a Minority Stockholder), and (iii) (if Lear NAOC so
elects) one representative designated by Lear NAOC (as long as Lear
NAOC is a Minority Stockholder). The composition of the Board as of
the Effective Date will be as specified on Schedule 2 .
Lear NAOC may elect to designate a director by providing written
notice to the Company to that effect identifying its designee. Such
designee shall become a director on the earlier to occur of
(i) the third Business Day after delivery of such notice and
(ii) the day on which WLR designates its third director. Each
Stockholder agrees to vote or cause its shares of Common Stock to
be


6




 



voted at any meeting of the Stockholders and any and all
postponements and adjournments thereof or in any other
circumstances in which a vote, consent or other approval (including
by written consent) is sought to elect or remove the directors
designated pursuant to this Section 3.3 to serve on the Board
and any other similar matter.



          (b) If
and for so long as Lear NAOC exercises its right to designate a
director, WLR shall be entitled to designate a total of three
representatives to the Board pursuant to
Section 3.3(a).



          (c) If
WLR ceases to be the Majority Stockholder or Franklin or Lear NAOC
ceases to be a Minority Stockholder, the director(s) that the
Stockholder that is no longer the Majority Stockholder or a
Minority Stockholder, as applicable, had been entitled to designate
will be designated by a Majority in Interest.



          (d) Directors
may be removed at any time with or without cause. A director may
only be removed by the affirmative vote of the Stockholder(s)
entitled to designate such director. In the event that a vacancy in
the Board is created at any time by the death, disability,
retirement, resignation or removal (with or without cause) of any
director, such vacancy may be filled only by the Stockholder(s)
entitled to designate such director pursuant to this
Section 3.3.



          (e) The
composition of each Subsidiary Board for a wholly-owned Subsidiary
that is incorporated or formed in the United States of America
shall be the same as that of the Board.



          (f) Directors
appointed to the Board will be compensated in accordance with the
Bylaws.



          (g) The
Company and the Stockholders will take all action necessary to
cause the Subsidiaries of the Company to implement and not
contradict the actions and resolutions of the Board.



          (h) If
and for so long as Lear NAOC does not exercise its right to
designate a Board director pursuant to Section 3.3(a), it will
be entitled to designate one representative to attend meetings of
the Board, any board of directors (or equivalent governing body) of
any controlled Subsidiary (each, a “ Subsidiary Board
”) or any committee thereof in a non-voting observer category
(the “ Observer ”). The Observer will have no
voting rights with respect to any decision of the Board, or any
committee of the Board. The Company will provide written notice to
the Observer of each meeting of the Board or Subsidiary Board or
any committee thereof at the same time and in the same manner as
notice is given to the members of the Board or Subsidiary Board and
will furnish to the Observer copies of all written materials and
other information (including copies of meeting minutes) at the same
time as given to directors at, in advance of, or subsequent to such
meetings. Lear NAOC’s right to designate an Observer will
terminate if it ceases to be a Minority Stockholder.


7




 



          (i) Lear
NAOC and Franklin will each be entitled to designate one
representative to attend meetings of any board of directors (or
equivalent governing body) of any controlled foreign Subsidiary
(each a “ Foreign Subsidiary Board ”) or any
committee thereof in a non-voting observer category (the “
Foreign Subsidiary Observer ”). The Foreign Subsidiary
Observer will have no voting rights with respect to any decision of
the Foreign Subsidiary Board or any committee of the Foreign
Subsidiary Board. The Company will assure that there is provided to
each Foreign Subsidiary Observer written notice of each meeting of
the Foreign Subsidiary Board at the same time and in the same
manner as notice is given to the members of the Foreign Subsidiary
Board and will furnish to each Foreign Subsidiary Observer copies
of all written materials and other information (including copies of
meeting minutes) at the same time as given to directors at, in
advance of, or subsequent to such meetings. Lear NAOC’s right
and Franklin’s right to designate a Foreign Subsidiary
Observer will terminate if it ceases to be a Minority
Stockholder.



          (j) The
Company shall pay all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by each
director and any permitted Observer or Subsidiary Observer in
connection with attending any meetings of the Board, any Subsidiary
Board or any committee thereof. In the event that the Company pays
any fee to a director for serving on the Board, any Subsidiary
Board or any committee thereof, the Company shall pay to each
director a fee in an amount equal to the amount paid to such other
director. So long as any director appointed by WLR, Lear NAOC or
Franklin serves on the Board and for three years thereafter, the
Company shall maintain directors and officers indemnity insurance
coverage reasonably satisfactory to such Stockholder and the
Charter and Bylaws shall provide for indemnification and
exculpation of directors to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law.



     3.4 Management;
Officers . (a) The Board will be responsible for and
will have authority to generally oversee the management of the
Company. The initial officers of the Company will be as specified
on Schedule 2 . Unless otherwise determined by the
Board, the authority of the officers of the Company and the
Subsidiaries will be as is customary for officers of a Delaware
corporation, including, but not limited to, the right and
obligation to manage all labor relations and personnel affairs of
the Company in a manner consistent with the Company’s status
as a single employer separate and apart from any other entity,
without limitation.



          (b) The
Company will not take, and the Company will cause the Board and
officers of each Subsidiary to not take, any of the following
actions without the Required Board Approval:



     (i) incur debt for borrowed money in
the aggregate in excess of $75.0 million;



     (ii) create any employee option,
incentive or similar plan pursuant to which Company equity
securities may be issued (“ Employee Plans
”);


8




 



     (iii) enter into any material
contracts or arrangements outside the ordinary course of the
Company’s and the Subsidiaries’ business, excluding any
acquisition of any business by the Company or any Subsidiary,
whether by merger, purchase of all or substantially all of the
assets of such business or otherwise;



     (iv) consummate a Reorganization or a
Public Offering;



     (v) enter into or modify any
agreement or enter into any transaction between the Company or a
Subsidiary and a Stockholder or any of its Affiliates other than in
relation to any issuance of shares of Capital Stock at Fair Market
Value that complies with Section 3.2;



     (vi) make any amendment to this
Agreement or, except as contemplated in Section 6.1 in connection
with a Reorganization, to the Company’s Constituent
Documents;



     (vii) enter into an agreement
pursuant to which it will sell or otherwise transfer all or
substantially all of the Company’s and the
Subsidiaries’ assets, whether by sale or transfer of assets,
sale of equity, merger or a transaction of a similar nature (a
“ Sale Transaction ”); or



     (viii) approve the dissolution,
winding-up, liquidation or bankruptcy of the Company or a material
Subsidiary.



          (c) The
Company will not take, and the Company will cause the Board and
officers of each Subsidiary to not take, any of the following
actions without the approval of each Minority
Stockholder:



     (i) consummate a Sale Transaction in
which all Stockholders holding the same class of Capital Stock do
not receive the same consideration on the same terms, determined on
the same basis;



     (ii) approve the dissolution,
winding-up, liquidation or bankruptcy of the Company or a material
Subsidiary;



     (iii) enter into or modify any
agreement or enter into any transaction between the Company or a
Subsidiary and a Stockholder or any of its Affiliates other than on
arms length terms; provided, that with respect to any such
transaction (or series of related transactions) that involves
aggregate payments or other property with a fair market value in
excess of $5 million, the Company shall, prior to the
consummation thereof, obtain a favorable opinion as to the fairness
of such transaction or series of related transactions to the
Company or the relevant Subsidiary, as the case may be, from a
financial point of view, from an Arbiter experienced in the subject
matter of such transaction or transactions; provided however, that
if Lear NAOC ceases to be a Minority Stockholder, neither the
Company nor a Subsidiary shall enter into or modify any


9




 



agreement or enter into any transaction between the Company or a
Subsidiary and a Stockholder or any of its Affiliates, without the
approval of Franklin;



     (iv) launch or acquire a new line or
lines of business which is or are (a) individually or in the
aggregate reasonably likely to represent 20% or more of the
Company’s and Subsidiaries’ consolidated annual sales
in the twelve months following its launch or acquisition (as
applicable), and (b) is significantly different from the
business conducted by the Company and the Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Date (after giving effect to the Lear ISD
Closing);



     (v) issue any shares of Capital Stock
at less than Fair Market Value;



     (vi) issue any shares of Capital
Stock other than Common Stock to any Stockholder or Affiliate of
any Stockholder;



     (vii) consummate any recapitalization
or reorganization of the Company’s Capital Stock in which all
Stockholders holding the same class of Capital Stock do not receive
the same consideration, on the same terms, determined on the same
basis;



     (viii) effect any redemption or
repurchase of any Capital Stock or make or pay any dividends or
other distributions other than on a pro rata basis as among
Stockholders holding the same class of Capital Stock;



     (ix) make any amendment to this
Agreement or, except as contemplated in Section 6.1 in connection
with a Reorganization, to the Company’s Constituent
Documents; or



     (x) enter into any Change of Control
or Restructuring transaction between the Company or a Subsidiary
and a Stockholder or any of its Affiliates other than on arms
length terms, provided that any such transaction (or series of
related transactions) shall be deemed to be on arms length terms if
the Company, prior to the consummation thereof, obtains an opinion
as to the appropriate value(s) to be ascribed to the elements of
such transaction and a favorable opinion as to the fairness to each
of the Stockholders, Company or the relevant Subsidiary, as the
case may be, from a financial point of view, from an Arbiter
experienced in the subject matter of such transaction or
transactions. The Company shall nominate a party to serve as the
Arbiter and shall disclose to the Minority Stockholders all
relationships between the Company or the Majority Stockholder and
such nominee during the preceding three years in a written notice
(the “Arbiter Notice”). No later than 15 days
after a Minority Stockholder’s receipt of the Arbiter Notice,
such Minority Stockholder shall notify the Company in writing
whether it consents to the use of such


10




 



nominee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If a
Minority Stockholder does not so notify the Company as to its
consent within 15 days after its receipt of the Arbiter
Notice, it will be deemed to have consented to the nominee set
forth therein. If a Minority Stockholder does not consent to the
use of such nominee, it shall provide the Company and the other
Stockholders with a written statement of its reasons for such
failure to consent and the Company shall then select another
Arbiter and the parties shall comply with the foregoing provisions
of this Section 3.4(c)(x) until such time as an Arbiter has
been selected. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary or in the Act or in the DGCL, if the Company complies with
the provisions of this Section 3.4(c)(x), the Minority
Stockholders shall be foreclosed from alleging that the Company,
any Stockholder or any officer or director of the Company has
breached or violated any fiduciary duty owed by such Person to the
Company or any Stockholder with respect to the valuation of the
proposed transaction and waives any and all rights it or any of its
Affiliates may have relating to the valuation of such
transaction.



          (d) No
vote or other action of the Stockholders is required to authorize
the Company to take or refrain from taking any action, other than
as provided for in Section 3.4.



     3.5 Competitive
Activities . The Company Persons, directly or through
Affiliated entities, are or may be engaged in businesses that may
be competitive with the business of the Company or companies it
owns or in which it invests. Nothing herein, in the Act, the DGCL,
any Constituent Document or otherwise (collectively, the “
Applicable Rules ”) will be deemed to restrict any
Company Person from engaging in such other business activity
(regardless of the effects thereof on the Company or companies it
owns or in which it invests) and, notwithstanding any Applicable
Rule to the contrary, in no event will any Company Person have any
obligation to act or refrain from acting (including without
limitation presenting any opportunity or other matter to the
Company for it to consider or pursue or to maintain the
confidentiality of, or not use, any confidential or proprietary
information) by reason of any relationship with, or actual or
alleged duty to, the Company, provided, however, that this
Section 3.5 will not limit the scope or applicability of
Section 6.5, or any other written contract between a Company
Person and the Company or any other Company Person. The Company and
the other Company Persons will have no rights by virtue of this
Agreement in and to such independent ventures of any Company Person
or the income or profits derived therefrom, and the pursuit of any
such venture, even if competitive with the Company’s
business, will not be deemed wrongful or improper. Each party
hereto agrees that, in any such case, to the extent a court might
otherwise hold that the conduct of such activity is a breach of any
Applicable Rule, it has hereby irrevocably waived any and all
rights of recovery it may otherwise have by reason
thereof.



     3.6 Management of Workforce and
Business . From and after the Effective Date, and
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
management and direction of the Company’s and its
Subsidiaries’ workforce and business, and the
terms


11




 



and conditions thereof, including all wage and salary programs
(including bonuses, and incentive compensation), medical and other
benefit programs, other compensation and benefit programs and the
establishment of procedures, policies and protocols for hiring,
disciplining and firing employees and setting general employee
standards shall be determined by the Board of Directors (as
delegated to the officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries).




IV. TRANSFERS



     4.1 Transfers .
(a) Except for Transfers that comply with this
Article IV, without the Required Board Approval (which, for
purposes of clarification, shall not in any event prejudice the
rights of any other Stockholder under Section 4.2 or 4.3), no
Stockholder may, directly or indirectly, sell, transfer, gift,
assign or otherwise dispose of, or permit, voluntarily or
involuntarily or by operation of law, any security, encumbrance,
interest, pledge, mortgage, lien, charge, adverse claim, option,
warrant, grant of voting rights, preferential arrangement or
restriction of any kind (collectively, an “
Encumbrance ”) upon, all or any portion of such
Stockholder’s Capital Stock, Options or any interest therein
or make or support an application being made for entry of a decree
under Section 18-802 of the Act or enter into an agreement to
do or permit any of the foregoing actions. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Lear NAOC shall be permitted to pledge its Capital Stock
and the Lear Warrant as collateral to secure indebtedness to a bank
or trustee incorporated and doing business in the United States
having a combined capital and surplus of at least $1 billion
upon 45 days prior written notice (a “ Pledge
Notice ”) to the Company, WLR (as long as WLR is a
Majority Stockholder) and Franklin (as long as Franklin is a
Minority Stockholder). In no event may a Stockholder Transfer
Capital Stock or Options to any Person who, in the reasonable
opinion of the Board, is engaged (whether directly or through
Affiliated entities) in any material business that is competitive
with the Business. The Board shall notify any Stockholder within 20
Business Days of receipt of notice of any proposed Stockholder
Transfer of Capital Stock or Options whether or not the Board, in
its reasonable discretion, deems such transfer to be a prohibited
transfer to a competitor in accordance with the foregoing sentence.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall
restrict a Change in Control transaction involving Lear NAOC or any
resulting Transfer as a result thereof. Any purported sale,
transfer, gift, assignment or other disposition or Encumbrance of a
Stockholder’s Capital Stock or Options (hereinafter
collectively referred to as a “ Transfer ”)
which is in violation of this Agreement (a “ Prohibited
Transfer ”) shall be invalid and void, shall not bind the
Company and shall have no effect whatsoever on the Company or its
Stockholders. Any Stockholder which engages in any Prohibited
Transfer shall be liable to the Company for all costs and expenses
incurred by the Company as a result thereof or related thereto,
including with respect to legal action required to enforce the
terms of this Agreement.



          (b) Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the prohibitions in Section 4.1(a) shall not
apply to: (i) the Transfer by any Stockholder of Capital Stock or
Options to the Permitted Transferees of such Stockholder and
(ii) the Transfer by any Stockholder of Capital Stock or
Options to a third party, provided that such Stockholder complies
with Section 4.2 and 4.3, if applicable.


12




 



          (c) Any
Transfer of Capital Stock or Options which is not prohibited by
Section 4.1(a) or 4.1(e) shall be effective only if
(i) such Transfer is in compliance with all applicable
federal, state and foreign securities laws and (ii) the
Transferee has agreed in writing to be bound by the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.



          (d) If
shares of Capital Stock or Options are certificated, each
certificate representing the Capital Stock or Options shall be
stamped or otherwise imprinted with a legend or legends customary
in form reflecting the restrictions on transfer set forth in this
Agreement and under applicable securities laws.



          (e) Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event may a
Transfer by any Stockholder be made if the Board concludes in good
faith that such Transfer is reasonably likely to result in
(i) the Company being in violation of any applicable law or
(ii) the dissolution of the Company. In making the
determination whether a Transfer is reasonably likely to result in
such a termination or dissolution or is reasonably likely to cause
such violation, the Board, in its sole discretion, may require the
assignee to furnish, at such assignee’s expense, an opinion
of counsel passing on this issue in a form reasonably acceptable to
the Board, with such counsel to be reasonably acceptable to the
Board.



     4.2 Right of First
Refusal . (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, if
at any time any Stockholder proposes to Transfer any Capital Stock
or Options in any manner to one or more third parties (other than
to Permitted Transferees), then such Stockholder (the “
Transferring Stockholder ”) shall give all other
Stockholders (the “ Offeree Stockholders ”)
written notice of its intention to make the Transfer (the “
Transfer Notice ”), which Transfer Notice must include
(i) a description and the number of shares of Capital Stock to
be transferred and a description of the Options, if any, to be
transferred and the number of shares of Capital Stock for which
such Options are exercisable (“collectively, Offered
Securities ”), (ii) the identity of the prospective
transferee(s) (the “ Proposed Transferee ”),
(iii) the consideration, if any (the “ Offered
Price ”), and the material terms and conditions upon
which the proposed Transfer is to be made (the “ Offered
Terms ”), and (iv) an offer to sell the Offered
Securities to the Offeree Stockholders at the Offered Price and on
the Offered Terms. The Transfer Notice must certify that the
Transferring Stockholder has received a bona fide offer from the
Proposed Transferee(s) and in good faith believes a binding
agreement for the Transfer is obtainable on the terms set forth in
the Transfer Notice. The Transfer Notice must also include a copy
of any written proposal, term sheet, or letter of intent or other
agreement relating to the proposed Transfer. Upon the request of
the Company or any Offeree Stockholder, the Transferring
Stockholder shall promptly furnish to the Company or to such
Offeree Stockholder such other information as may reasonably be
requested to establish that the offer from the Proposed
Transferee(s) is bona fide. If the Offered Price includes
consideration other than cash or if there is no consideration, the
cash-equivalent value of the non-cash consideration or the Fair
Market Value of the Offered Securities, as the case may be, will be
determined by the Board in good faith pursuant to the Required
Board Approval.


13




 



          (b)
Offeree Stockholders’ Option . The Offeree
Stockholders will have an option for a period of 20 Business Days
from receipt of the Transfer Notice (the “ Holder Option
Period ”) to elect to purchase all (but not less than
all) of such Offeree Stockholder’s pro rata portion,
calculated relative to the Capital Stock held by all Offeree
Stockholders electing to purchase Offered Securities, at the same
price and subject to the same material terms and conditions as
described in the Transfer Notice (the “ Holders’
Purchase Option ”). Each Offeree Stockholder may exercise
the Holders’ Purchase Option by so notifying the Transferring
Stockholder in writing before expiration of the Holder Option
Period. If one or more Offeree Stockholders gives the Transferring
Stockholder notice that they desire to purchase Offered Securities,
payment for such Offered Securities shall be in cash by certified
check or wire transfer, against delivery of certificates
representing such Offered Securities, at a place agreed upon
between the parties and at the time of the scheduled closing
therefor, which shall be no later than 30 Business Days after the
Offeree Stockholders’ receipt of the Transfer Notice. Any
Offered Securities not elected to be purchased by the end of the
Holder Option Period will be re-offered for a five-day period by
the Transferring Stockholder to the Offeree Stockholders who have
elected to purchase their full pro-rata portion of the Offered
Securities; if such Offeree Stockholders collectively subscribe for
more than the available Offered Securities, such Offered Securities
will be allocated on a pro-rata basis.



          (c)
Transferring Stockholder’s Right to Transfer . If the
Offeree Stockholders do not exercise the Holders’ Purchase
Option with respect to all of the Offered Securities, then all
elections to purchase such Offered Securities shall be null and
void and the Transferring Stockholder may Transfer the Offered
Securities to the Proposed Transferee at the Offered Price or at a
higher price as long as such Transfer is consummated within
75 days after the date of the Transfer Notice. If the Offered
Shares are not transferred to the Proposed Transferee within such
period, a new Transfer Notice must be given before the Transferring
Stockholder may Transfer any Capital Stock or Options.



     4.3 Tag-Along Rights .
(a) If one or more Stockholders other than Lear NAOC (“
Selling Stockholder ”) proposes to sell Capital Stock
to a third party purchaser (the “ Prospective
Purchaser ”) pursuant to a bona fide offer to purchase
such Capital Stock (a “ Qualified Offer ”), such
Selling Stockholders may engage in such transaction, subject to
their prior compliance with Section 4.2, only if they assure
that the other Stockholders or holders of Options (“
Tag-Along Stockholders ”) also shall be afforded the
right to sell a proportionate share of their Capital Stock or
Options to the Prospective Purchaser simultaneously therewith on
terms and conditions at least as favorable to the Selling
Stockholders as the terms and conditions set out in the Qualified
Offer. Upon receipt by one or more Selling Stockholders of a
Qualified Offer, the Selling Stockholders shall notify the
Tag-Along Stockholders in writing of such offer and its terms and
conditions (the “ Offer Notice ”), which written
notice shall include the name of the Prospective Purchaser and the
consideration offered in connection therewith. In order to exercise
their right to sell their Capital Stock or Options as set forth
above, the Tag-Along Stockholders must provide written notice of
such intention to the Selling Stockholders within 20 days after the
date of their receipt of the Offer Notice. If the Tag-


14




 



Along Stockholders do not provide such written notice within
20 days, the Selling Stockholders may sell their Capital Stock
to the Prospective Purchaser on the terms of the Qualified Offer as
long as such sale is consummated within 75 days after the date
of the Offer Notice. If the Capital Stock is not transferred to the
Prospective Purchaser within such period, a new Offer Notice must
be given before the Selling Stockholders may sell any Capital
Stock. Each participating Tag-Along Stockholder individually, not
jointly and severally, shall make such Tag-Along
Stockholder’s proportionate share of any representations and
warranties made in connection with any such Transfer. In no event
shall any Tag-Along Stockholder be liable for indemnification or
similar obligations in connection with such Transfer other than
severally on a pro rata basis in an amount not greater than the
proceeds actually received by such Tag-Along Stockholder in
connection with such Transfer.



          (b) The
co-sale rights provided to any Tag-Along Stockholder under
Section 4.3(a) shall be applicable to any direct or indirect
sale (including by means of a merger, reorganization, or other
similar transaction) of the Capital Stock of the Company held by a
Stockholder, other than Lear NAOC, including any transfer
(including by means of a merger, reorganization, or other similar
transaction) of all or substantially all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock, or its equivalent, of such Stockholder
or its Affiliates to a third party; provided that
Section 4.3(a) shall not apply to an indirect transfer of
Capital Stock caused by changes in the identity of or investors in
advisory clients of Franklin or funds or other investment vehicles
included in the definition of “WLR” or a transfer of
Capital Stock by a Stockholder that is an advisory client of
Franklin or a limited partner or comparable passive investor in a
fund or other investment vehicle included in the definition of
“WLR” that receives capital stock pursuant to a normal
course distribution (including a winding up) pursuant to the
constituent documents of such fund or other investment
vehicle.



     4.4 Sale of the Company
.



          (a) If
the Board approves a Sale Transaction in accordance with
Section 3.4, each Stockholder will consent to such Sale
Transaction and will vote all of its Capital Stock in favor of such
Sale Transaction, if such vote is required under applicable law,
and, if Capital Stock is to be transferred, will Transfer all of
its Capital Stock and Options on the terms and subject to the terms
and conditions of such Sale Transaction. Subject to
Section 4.4(b), each Stockholder agrees to (i) cooperate
in any Sale Transaction as reasonably requested by the Board and
(ii) execute and deliver all documents and instruments
reasonably requested by the Board, in each case, as are required in
order to effectuate such Sale Transaction.



          (b) The
obligations of each Stockholder set forth in Section 4.4(a) in
connection with a Sale Transaction are subject to the satisfaction
of the following conditions: (i) upon the consummation of the
Sale Transaction, each Stockholder of the same class shall receive
or have the option to receive the same form of consideration and
the same amount of per share consideration (with respect to any
Options on an as converted or exercised basis); (ii) if any
Stockholder is given an option as to the form and amount of
consideration to be received, each Stockholder of the same class
shall


15




 



be given the same option; and (iii) (in the case of Lear NAOC only)
if the consideration to be received by the Stockholders for the
Capital Stock or Options upon consummation of the Sale Transaction
does not consist of cash or Marketable Securities any securities
issued to Lear NAOC as consideration for the Sale Transaction will
be subject to substantially similar liquidity protections (whether
granted by the buyer or another party) as those set forth in this
Agreement. Each Stockholder individually, not jointly or severally,
shall make such Stockholder’s proportionate share of any
representations and warranties made in connection with any such
Sale Transaction; provided, however, that while Lear NAOC may be
required to provide its proportionate share of indemnification with
respect to representations and warranties regarding the Company, in
no event shall Lear NAOC be required to make any representations
and warranties other than with respect to title to the Capital
Stock or Options to be sold by Lear NAOC in connection with such
Sale Transaction, its authority to enter into and perform its
obligations in connection with such Sale Transaction, and the lack
of any conflicts resulting from its execution, delivery and
performance of the documents and transactions in connection with
such Sale Transaction. In no event shall any Stockholder be liable
for indemnification or similar obligations in connection with such
Sale Transaction in an amount greater than the proceeds actually
received by such Stockholder in connection with such Sale
Transaction. Notwithstanding the above, the Board, if requested by
Lear NAOC, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
agreement of the purchaser in a Sale Transaction to purchase the
Lear Warrant (as adjusted to account for the exercise price
thereof) without requiring the holder thereof to exercise the Lear
Warrant in connection with such Sale Transaction.



     4.5 Call Option . If
Lear NAOC intends to make a Lear Demand Request, it will first
notify the Company (whether before or after the date on which Lear
NAOC has the right to exercise a Demand Registration Right) and
will offer (and/or cause to be offered) to WLR (as long as WLR is a
Majority Stockholder) and Franklin (as long as Franklin is a
Minority Stockholder) (the “ Optionholders ”)
the option (the “ Call Option ”) to acquire all
(but not less than all) of the shares of Capital Stock and Options
held by it (and its Permitted Transferees) at the Call Price by
delivering written notice to that effect (a “ Call
Notice ”) to the Company, WLR and Franklin. The Call
Option may be exercised by the Optionholders only in whole and not
in part. The Optionholders may assign the Call Option to the
Company, but only in whole and not in part.



          (a)
Determination of Call Price . Upon delivery of a Call Notice
to the Optionholders, the Optionholders and Lear NAOC shall
endeavor in good faith to promptly determine the applicable Call
Price. If the Optionholders and Lear NAOC cannot agree on the
applicable Call Price within 10 days after the delivery of the Call
Notice, as the case may be, they will, as soon as practicable,
select an Arbiter to determine the applicable Call Price. If the
Optionholders and Lear NAOC cannot agree on an Arbiter within
12 days after delivery of the Call Notice, the Optionholders
and Lear NAOC shall each select an Arbiter and shall each instruct
their respective Arbiters to select, within 15 days after
delivery of the Call Notice, a third Arbiter to determine the Call
Price. The Optionholders and Lear NAOC shall instruct the selected
Arbiter to determine the Call Price within 30 days after
delivery of the Call Notice. The determination of the Call Price by
such selected Arbiter shall be final, binding and


16




 



conclusive, absent manifest error; provided, that following the
determination of the Call Price, Lear NAOC can withdraw its Lear
Demand Request and the Call Option by written notice to the
Optionholders within 10 days after the determination of the
Call Price (a “ Lear Demand Withdrawal ”). Lear
NAOC and the Company shall bear all fees, costs and expenses of the
Arbiters engaged pursuant to this Section 4.5 in proportion to
Lear NAOC’s Percentage Interest relative to the
Optionholders’ aggregate Percentage Interest.



          (b)
Exercise of Call Option . If after the Call Price is agreed
or determined and absent a Lear Demand Withdrawal, an Optionholder
wishes to exercise the Call Option, it will notify Lear NAOC of its
intention to do so within 10 days of the Call Price being
agreed or determined and will specify the number of shares of
Capital Stock and/or Options it wishes to acquire. In the event of
competition between the Optionholders, the number of shares of
Capital Stock and/or Options to be acquired by them pursuant to the
Call Option shall be calculated on a pro rata basis (“
Proportionate Interests ”), relative to the Capital
Stock and/or Options held by all Optionholders wishing to exercise
the Call Option (“ Accepting Optionholders
”).



          (c)
Closing of the Call Option . The closing of the Call Option
pursuant to this Section 4.5 (a “ Call Option
Closing ”) shall occur on a Business Day specified by
written notice from the Optionholder holding the greater
Proportionate Interest to Lear NAOC no later than five Business
Days prior to the proposed Call Option Closing. The Call Option
Closing shall occur no later than 30 days after the final
determination of the Call Price. At the Call Option Closing, the
Accepting Optionholders shall pay, without condition, Lear NAOC the
applicable Call Price by wire transfer in lawful money of the
United States of America and in immediately available funds, and
Lear NAOC shall deliver to the Accepting Optionholders an
assignment of, and any certificates evidencing, the Capital Stock
and Options being transferred to them respectively.



     4.6 Redemption . Upon
the occurrence of a Redemption Event in relation to any Stockholder
(the “ Affected Stockholder ”), if the Board
(excluding any director designated by the Affected Stockholder) so
elects (by written notice (the “ Redemption Notice
”) to the Affected Stockholder within 30 days after the
Company becomes aware of the Redemption Event), all of the shares
of Capital Stock and Options owned by the Affected Stockholder and
any Affiliate of the Affected Stockholder shall be deemed
automatically redeemed by the Company for the Redemption Price
without further action of the Affected Stockholder, subject to the
right of Lear NAOC to withdraw its delivery of a Pledge Notice as
set forth below; provided, that if the Board reasonably expects
that a Bankruptcy Decision is likely to occur with respect to a
Stockholder, the Board may elect prior to the occurrence of any
such Bankruptcy Decision that the Company shall exercise the
redemption right pursuant to this Section 4.6, effective
automatically upon the occurrence of a Bankruptcy Decision. The
Redemption Price of the Capital Stock and Options of any Affected
Stockholder shall be determined as of the date of the Redemption
Event, as follows. Upon delivery of the Redemption Notice to the
Affected Stockholder, the Company and the Affected Stockholder
shall endeavor in good faith to promptly determine the applicable
Redemption Price. If the Company and the Affected Stockholder
cannot agree on the applicable Redemption Price within
15


17




 



days after the delivery of the Redemption Notice, they will, as
soon as practicable, select an Arbiter to determine the applicable
Redemption Price. If the Company and the Affected Stockholder
cannot agree on an Arbiter within 20 days after delivery of
the Redemption Notice, the Company and the Affected Stockholder
shall each select an Arbiter and shall each instruct their
respective Arbiters to select, within 25 days after delivery
of the Redemption Notice, a third Arbiter to determine the
Redemption Price. The Company and the Affected Stockholder shall
instruct the selected Arbiter to determine the Redemption Price
within 50 days after delivery of the Redemption Notice. The
determination of the Redemption Price by such selected Arbiter
shall be final, binding and conclusive, absent manifest error. Lear
NAOC shall have the right, exercisable within 10 days after
determination of the Redemption Price, to withdraw its delivery of
a Pledge Notice, in which event the Company shall not have the
right to redeem Lear NAOC’s Capital Stock and Options
pursuant to this Section 4.6. The Affected Stockholder shall
bear a portion of the fees, costs and expenses of the Arbiters
engaged pursuant to this Section 4.6 equal to such Affected
Stockholder’s Percentage Interest. The Company shall bear the
balance of such fees, costs and expenses. Payment for such
redemption shall be made no later than 45 days after the later
of delivery of the Redemption Notice and the final determination of
the applicable Redemption Price. Each director designated by the
Affected Stockholder shall be excluded from any Board decisions
(and from the definition of “Required Board Approval”)
in connection with this Section 4.6 and, if the Affected
Stockholder is a Minority Stockholder, its approval pursuant to
Section 3.4(c) shall not be required in connection with any
Company action in connection with this Section 4.6.




V. TAX MATTERS; ALLOCATIONS AND DISTRIBUTIONS



     5.1 Tax
Characterization . The Stockholders agree to a partnership
characterization under section 301.7701-3 of the Regulations, and
no election inconsistent with such treatment shall be made unless
unanimously approved by the Board.



     5.2 Tax Matters Member
. WLR is designated as the tax matters partner of the Company
pursuant to section 6231(a)(7) of the Code (the “ Tax
Matters Member ”) and must take such actions as are
necessary to cause each other Stockholder to become a “notice
partner” within the meaning of section 6223 of the Code. WLR
may not take any action contemplated by sections 6223 through 6229
of the Code unless unanimously approved by the Board. Except as
provided in Section 5.1 and in this Section 5.2, upon
prior notice to Franklin and Lear NAOC, the Tax Matters Member is
authorized to make all appropriate tax elections to be made by the
Company. WLR may notify the Board that WLR no longer desires to
serve as the Tax Matters Member; in such case, the Board will
designate another Stockholder to serve as the Tax Matters
Member.



     5.3 Allocation of Profits and
Losses . (a) Except as provided in Section 5.3(b)
or 5.4, Profits and Losses will be allocat
