STEARMAN, JEFFREY N. et al., vs. CENTEX HOMES



Coverage Analysis in CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS

.

STEARMAN, JEFFREY N. et al., vs. CENTEX HOMES
A defendant builder of mass produced housing may be held strictly liable
for construction defects.  This question is firmly established in
California cases beginning 30 years ago with Kriegler v. Eichler Homes,
Inc. (1969) 269 Cal.App.2d 224.  (See, inter alia, Fleck v. Bollinger
Home Corp. (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 926; Alcal Roofing & Insulation v.
Superior Court (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1121; Becker v. McMillin Construction
Co. (1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1493; Orndorff v. Christiana Community Builders
(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 683; GEM Developers v. Hallcraft Homes of San Diego,
Inc. (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 419; Gentry Construction Co. v. Superior Court
(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 177; Oliver v. Superior Court (1989) 211 Cal.App.3d
86; Huang v. Garner (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 404; Del Mar Beach Club Owners
Assn. v. Imperial Contracting Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 898; Ravens Cove
Townhomes, Inc. v. Knuppe Development Co. (1981) 114 Cal.App.3d 783; Stuart
v. Crestview Mut. Water Co. (1973) 34 Cal.App.3d 802; and Avner v. Longridge
Estates (1969) 272 Cal.App.2d 607.) 
The question is whether a plaintiff can recover under strict liability
when a defect in one component part of a house causes injury to other component
parts of the house, but not to persons or property apart from the structure. 
Defendant asserts such damage constitutes nothing more than injury to
the product itself, a loss for which strict liability compensation is
barred by the economic loss rule of Seely v. White Motor Co. (1965) 63
Cal.2d 9.  It argues damage to a defective product itself is simply
the products failure to function properly, for which the only remedy lies
in a warranty action through which the disappointed buyer can seek to recoup
the benefit of its bargain. 
California authorities read together represent a considerable body of
law, expressly or by implication rejecting defendants assertion that owners
whose residences are constructed on defective lots and foundations may
not recover in strict liability for resulting physical injury to their
homes. The court held that the damage plaintiffs sustained to their home
is physical injury falling outside the parameters of economic loss and
is thus compensable under strict liability in tort.

IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
FOURTH APPELLATE DISTRICT
DIVISION THREE
 
JEFFREY N. STEARMAN et al.,
      Plaintiffs and Appellants,
              
v.
CENTEX HOMES,
      Defendant and Appellant.
      G019311
     (Super. Ct. No. 717653)
     O P I N I O N
 Appeals from a judgment and orders of the Superior Court of Orange
County, Byron K. McMillan, Judge.  (Retired judge of the Superior
Court, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6
of the California Constitution.)  Judgment affirmed as modified.
 Rodarti, Feld & Gelfer, Richard G. Feld and Scott H. Gelfer
for Plaintiffs and Appellants.
 Epsten & Grinnell, Douglas W. Grinnell and Luis E. Ventura
as Amicus Curiae on behalf of Plaintiffs and Appellants.
 Morgenstein & Jubelirer, Jean L. Bertrand and Natasha L.
Golding for Defendant and Appellant.
 Paul B. Campos, Gordon & Rees, Douglas B. Harvey, Robert
V. Dugoni and David Collins as Amici Curiae on behalf of Defendant and
Appellant.
 Defendant Centex Homes appeals from a judgment in favor of plaintiffs
Jeffrey and Linda Stearman in a strict liability action arising out of
defendants defective construction of the foundation of plaintiffs tract
home, resulting in severe slab movement and deformation.  The defects
caused extensive cracks throughout the interior and exterior surfaces of
the home.
 The issue is not whether a defendant builder of mass produced
housing may be held strictly liable for construction defects.  The
affirmative answer to that question is firmly established in California
cases beginning 30 years ago with Kriegler v. Eichler Homes, Inc. (1969)
269 Cal.App.2d 224.  (See, inter alia, Fleck v. Bollinger Home Corp.
(1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 926; Alcal Roofing & Insulation v. Superior Court
(1992) 
8 Cal.App.4th 1121; Becker v. McMillin Construction Co. (1991) 226
Cal.App.3d 1493; Orndorff v. Christiana Community Builders (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d
683; GEM Developers v. Hallcraft Homes of San Diego, Inc. (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d
419; Gentry Construction Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 177;
Oliver v. Superior Court (1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 86; Huang v. Garner (1984)

 Rather, the question is whether a plaintiff can recover under
strict liability when a defect in one component part of a house causes
injury to other component parts of the house, but not to persons or property
apart from the structure.  Defendant asserts such damage constitutes
nothing more than injury to the product itself, a loss for which strict
liability compensation is barred by the economic loss rule of Seely v.
White Motor Co. (1965) 63 Cal.2d 9.  It argues damage to a defective
product itself is simply the products failure to function properly, for
which the only remedy lies in a warranty action through which the disappointed
buyer can seek to recoup the benefit of its bargain. 
 Defendant contends the precise issue here has not been directly
decided in California, but to the extent Seely and other appellate courts
of this state have touched upon it, they have reached the wrong conclusion,
or are poorly reasoned, inapt and nonbinding.  We are invited to depart
from our own longstanding judicial tradition and, in its place, adopt the
strong majority rule of other jurisdictions which, according to defendant,
have interpreted Seely correctly and would prohibit strict liability recovery
under the facts of this case.
 Plaintiffs, on the other hand, assert our own courts have considered
the economic loss rule in construction and non-construction cases alike,
and have uniformly allowed recovery of strict liability damages where,
as here, a defect has caused physical damage to the property.  They
further note a number of other states have applied strict liability to
mass-produced housing defects, and thus California is not the odd-ball
defendant purports it to be.  (Plaintiffs have also filed a cross-appeal
to which we will turn after concluding our discussion of the appeal.) 
 Amici curiae expand upon the positions of both parties. 
From divergent viewpoints, they trace the development of the strict liability
doctrine in this state and others, offering sharply conflicting analyses
of a dizzying array of authorities (several hundred of them).  In
the end, after having laboriously trudged our way through the labyrinth,
we do not find this to be a particularly complex or close case.
 Defendants premise that the economic loss rule bars strict liability
recovery for physical damage to plaintiffs home is unsupported and indeed
contradicted by Seely and other California decisions.  (See International
Knights of Wine, Inc. v. Ball Corp. (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 1001 and Gherna
v. Ford Motor Co. (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 639.)  Moreover, we are not
convinced the strong majority of other jurisdictions would, as defendant
claims, find plaintiffs confined to a warranty recovery.  Indeed,
defendant and its amici could cite no more than six out-of-state decisions
dealing with analogous facts.  Our own research confirms the paucity
of cases. 
 But it really doesnt matter:  The answer lies within our
state.  California authorities read together represent a considerable
body of law, expressly or by implication rejecting defendants assertion
that owners whose residences are constructed on defective lots and foundations
may not recover in strict liability for resulting physical injury to their
homes.  We step in line with this law in holding the damage plaintiffs
sustained to their home is physical injury falling outside the parameters
of economic loss and is thus compensable under strict liability in tort.
FACTS
 Defendant is a mass producer of homes in Southern California. 
In February 1990, plaintiffs bought a Centex tract house in San Clemente. 
Problems with the property began to appear shortly after plaintiffs moved
in and continued over the next few years.  In 1993, plaintiffs sued
the builder, stating only one cause of action, for strict liability in
tort.  They alleged defendant constructed the home on inadequately
compacted soil, causing slab movement and deformation which, in turn, damaged
the structure and yard improvements, diminished the propertys value, and
required plaintiffs to incur expenses for remedial measures, including
employing various professionals to assess the situation and make recommendations.
 At trial, plaintiffs and their experts testified to post-construction
movement and continuing deformation of the slab foundation which resulted
in, inter alia:  a significant separation between the ceiling and
wall joints over the entire length of the house; cracks in the drywall
throughout virtually every room; separation and cracks in tile counters
in the bathrooms and kitchen; and cracks in the exterior stucco. 
Each of these problems worsened over time.  Plaintiffs engineering
experts opined the slab foundation would have to be replaced.  Plaintiffs
cost estimator testified that replacing the slab 
would require emptying out the house, disconnecting utility lines,
removing appliances, ripping out floors, removing windows and doors, and
jacking up the structure.  After replacement of the slab, the house
would be lowered onto it and virtually rebuilt.  Including moving
and alternate housing costs for the four months it would take to complete
the repairs, the total cost would exceed $260,000.
 There is no issue regarding the sufficiency of the evidence to
establish the defective construction or resultant damage to the home. 
However, defendant contended throughout the proceedings that the economic
loss rule barred plaintiffs from recovering under strict liability when
only damages to the product itself were claimed.  The court rejected
this assertion at every juncture, denying defendants motions for nonsuit
and directed verdict and refusing defendants proposed special instruction
which stated, Plaintiffs are not permitted to recover damages under a
strict liability cause of action for purely economic loss or for mere damage
to the product itself.  [] If the only evidence of damages presented
by plaintiff[s] establishes purely economic injury or damage to the product
itself resulting in the reduction in fair market value of plaintiffs residence,
then you may not award damages to plaintiffs.
 The jury returned a special verdict finding plaintiffs house
was defectively constructed, causing plaintiffs damages of $135,000. 
Defendant then renewed its challenge, reprising the same theme in motions
for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial, both of which
the trial court denied.
DISCUSSION
Defendants Appeal
 In Seely v. White Motor Co., supra, 63 Cal.2d 9, widely recognized
as the progenitor of the economic loss rule, the court held a commercial
trucker who purchased a defective truck was entitled to breach of express
warranty damages for lost profits from his heavy-duty hauling business
and for money paid on the purchase price, but could not recover these economic
losses under strict product liability.  (Id. at pp. 13-17.) 
Tracing the development of warranty and strict liability law, the Seely
court observed warranty grew as a branch of the law of commercial transactions
and was primarily aimed at controlling the commercial aspects of these
transactions.  [Citations.]  (Id. at p. 16.)  It concluded
warranty rules function well in a commercial setting.  (Ibid.) 
Warranty adequately protected the Seely plaintiff, a trucker who could
have shopped around until he found the truck that would fulfill his business
needs, and could be fairly charged with the risk that the product would
not match his economic expectations, unless the manufacturer agreed that
it would.  (Id. at p. 19, italics added.)
 On the other hand, the Seely court reasoned, strict liability
for purely economic losses would unjustifiably expose the manufacturer
for damages of unknown and unlimited scope.  (Seely v. White Motor
Co., supra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 17.)  Explaining, it observed commercial
enterprises have widely varying needs which are ordinarily communicated
to the dealer, not the manufacturer, who would be liable even though it
never agreed the product would perform as a particular purchaser needed
it to perform.  (Id. at pp. 16-17.)  (In Seely, for instance,
the truck proved unsatisfactory for plaintiffs heavy-duty hauling business,
but performed well for the subsequent purchaser, who, after the dealer
made only minor alterations to the truck, drove it 82,000 miles for a less
demanding enterprise.  (Id. at pp. 16-17.)  For this reason and
others which we need not reiterate, the court found, Without an agreement,
defined by practice or otherwise, defendant should not be liable for these
commercial losses.  (Id. at p. 17, italics added.) 
 The Seely court did not end its discussion there, however. 
It added a final paragraph regarding plaintiffs contention the trial court
erred in denying strict liability recovery for physical damage to the truck
itself.  Significantly, the court agreed with plaintiffs argument
that even though the law of warranty governs the economic relations between
the parties, the doctrine of strict liability in tort should be extended
to govern physical injury to plaintiffs property, as well as personal
injury.  (Seely v. White Motor Co., supra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 19, italics
added.)  The court found [p]hysical injury to property is so akin
to personal injury that there is no reason to distinguish them.  [Citations.] 
(Ibid.)  Plaintiff was barred from recovering strict liability damages
for physical injury to the truck not by the economic loss rule, but only
because he failed to prove causation.  (Ibid.)
Definition and Application of the Economic Loss Rule
 The Seely court, drawing a distinction between tort recovery
for physical injuries and warranty recovery for economic loss (Seely v.
White Motor Co., supra, 
63 Cal.2d at p.18), defines the difference primarily by implication. 
As we have noted, the decision contains dicta that, had plaintiff proved
the truck itself was damaged by the defective condition (the truck tended
to gallop), he could have recovered strict liability damages.  (Id.
at p. 19.) 
 Other courts in our jurisdiction have articulated the rule more
definitively.  For instance, Huang v. Garner, supra, 157 Cal.App.3d
404 instructs, [E]conomic loss [is] marked by the loss of the benefit
of the bargain for the goods purchased, lost profits, and replacement costs
for ineffective goods.  Physical damage to property and personal injury,
however, are not considered to be economic loss.  (Id. at p. 420,
internal citation and quotation marks omitted, italics added.)  In
Huang, it was undisputed . . . that the court properly drew the line between
economic and physical damages, determining the cost to repair structural
and other alleged defects which had not actually caused physical damage
to be economic damage.  (Id.at p. 420, italics added.) 
 With regard to defects, the Huang plaintiffs presented evidence
that the plans and specifications for the building were defective in several
ways, including insufficient fire retardation walls, insufficient shear
walls and inadequate structure . . . .  Additional evidence indicated
that deviation from the building plans during construction also contributed
to faulty construction.  (Huang v. Garner, supra, 157 Cal.App.3d
at 
p. 411.)  The plaintiffs sought recovery for physical damages
to their property including damages to the structure caused by deflected
and cracked beams and dry rot damages to the balcony area.  [They]
also sought recovery of economic losses including the cost to repair firewalls,
shear walls, fire stops, and other alleged defects in the structure which
had not caused actual physical damages at the time of trial.  (Id.
at pp. 419-420, italics added.)  The Huang court noted, Apparently
it was agreed by the parties that damages such as the cost to repair allegedly
insufficient shear walls, insufficient fire retardation, and defects in
the structure which did not cause actual physical damage were in fact economic
damages.  (Id. at p. 420.) 
 Huangs definition and application of the economic loss rule,
albeit in the context of a negligence theory, demonstrates defendant is
just plain wrong in contending the physical damage to plaintiffs real
property caused by defective construction of the foundation is only an
injury to the product itself, and thus barred by the economic loss rule
of Seely.  Huang does not stand alone.  As we will discuss, other
cases compel the conclusion that under California law, the physical damages
to plaintiffs property are entirely distinct from economic losses and
are thus recoverable in strict liability. 
 In Gherna v. Ford Motor Co. (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 639, the product
was an automobile in which defective design or manufacture (relating to
wiring or placement of the transmission dipstick next to the exhaust manifold)
caused a fire, destroying the vehicle.  The court did not suggest
the product had injured only itself, thus rendering the loss purely economic. 
Rather, it found the law settled that the doctrine of strict liability
applies to physical harm to person or property.  (Id. at p. 649,
italics added.) 
 Anthony v. Kelsey-Hayes Co. (1972) 25 Cal.App.3d 442 expands
the analysis.  The Anthony plaintiffs did not seek damages arising
out of any personal injury to themselves or any physical damage to their
vehicles attributable to the wheels they contended were defective. 
(Id. at p. 445.)  Rather, they sought recovery for (1) general depreciation
in the value of the vehicles, which the court categorized as loss of
bargain, (2) cost of inspections, repairs, and replacements of the wheels
themselves, and (3) loss of use prior to and during inspections and repairs. 
(Id. at p.446.)  Any issue as to the second item was moot because
plaintiffs had accepted new wheels from the vehicle manufacturer. 
(Ibid.)  In regard to the third claim, the Anthony court observed,
Loss of use is an item of incidental damage.  It appears appropriate,
therefore, to characterize it according to the nature of the damage of
which it is an incident.  Unless incidental to physical property damage,
it would appear that it may be properly classified as a type of economic
loss.  (Ibid., italics added.)  Harkening to Seelys call, it
concluded neither depreciation (definitely a complaint that the trucks
with defective wheels were not of the quality bargained for), nor loss
of use could be recovered under strict liability because plaintiffs did
not claim either item was caused by physical property damage.  (Id.
at p. 447.)  Finally, the court distinguished the plaintiffs case
from Gherna and Kriegler v. Eichler Homes, Inc., supra, 269 Cal.App.2d
224, where strict liability recovery was available because there was ponderable
physical property damage to the property sold and purchased.  (Anthony
v. Kelsey-Hayes Co., supra, 25 Cal.App.3d at p. 448, italics added.)
 Sacramento Regional Transit Dist. v. Grumman Flxible (1984) 
158 Cal.App.3d 289 (Grumman) sheds additional light on the subject. 
Plaintiff purchased 103 busses, with the manufacturers standard written
warranty.  (Id. at p. 292.)  [P]laintiff discovered a broken
fuel tank support during routine maintenance on one of the busses . . .
.  Further inspection of all the busses . . . revealed that at least
26 . . . had the same or similar damage, i.e., cracked fuel tank supports. 
As a result of further inspection plaintiff determined that all the busses
it purchased from defendant would likely suffer the same type of damage
unless certain remedial repairs were undertaken.  (Ibid.)  In
addition, plaintiff found structural defects in the undercarriage battery
frame area of certain other busses [previously] purchased  from defendant
. . . .  (Id. at p. 292, fn. 2.)  Plaintiff sought strict liability
damages based on these latent defects (Id. at p. 292.)
 The Grumman court began its analysis stating, [Strict l]iability
is imposed not only where the defective product causes personal injury,
but also where the defective product causes physical damage to property. 
[Citations.]  The damaged property may consist of the product itself. 
[Citing Seely, International Knights of Wine, Inc. v. Ball Corp. (1980)
110 Cal.App.3d 1001, 1005 (IKW) and Gherna v. Ford Motor Co., supra, 246
Cal.App.2d at p. 649.]  (Sacramento Regional Transit Dist. v. Grumman
Flxible, supra, 158 Cal.App.3d at p. 293, italics added.)  It further
noted, however, where damage consists solely of economic losses, recovery
on a theory of products liability is precluded.  [Citations.] 
(Id. at pp. 293-294.) 
 The Grumman court observed, [T]he line between physical injury
to property and economic loss reflects the line of demarcation between
tort theory and contract theory.  (Sacramento Regional Transit Dist.
v. Grumman Flxible, supra, 
158 Cal.App.3d at p. 294.)  Noting plaintiff did not claim any
physical injury to the busses apart from the manifestation of the defect
itself (ibid.), it found the expenses plaintiff had incurred and would
incur for repair of the defects was not recoverable in strict liability,
which presupposes (1) a defect and (2) further damage to plaintiffs property
caused by the defect.  (Ibid., original italics.)  For lack
of the requisite damage to the property apart from the defect, the court
concluded plaintiffs repair costs were purely economic damages. 
(Ibid.)
 Responding to plaintiffs reliance on Gherna and IKW, supra,
the court distinguished both cases.  The Gherna plaintiff had avoided
a nonsuit by presenting sufficient evidence that defective wiring or a
design defect consisting of the [improper juxtaposition of component engine/transmission
parts] caused a fire which damaged plaintiffs automobile.  (Sacramento
Regional Transit District v. Grumman Flxible, supra, 158 Cal.App.3d at
p. 296, italics added.)  The Grumman court impliedly agreed with the
Gherna courts conclusion that products liability affords a remedy to
one whose property has been physically injured and . . . the remedy is
available where the property injured is the defective product.  (Ibid.) 
Moreover, IKW was distinguishable because the plaintiff there alleged that
due to defective caps or defective application of caps the wine became
unusable and economic loss was incurred.  (Sacramento Regional Transit
District v. Grumman Flxible, supra, 158 Cal.App.3d at p. 297, internal
quotations marks and citation omitted.)  The Grumman court added,
To the extent that IKW may stand for the proposition that a merchant may
sue in products liability for physical injury to its property where that
injury consists of nothing more than the product defect upon which liability
is founded, we decline to follow it.  (Ibid., italics added.)
 The case of San Francisco Unified School Dist. v. W.R. Grace
& Co. (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1318 (Grace) presented the issue in the
hybrid context of a statute of limitations question regarding plaintiffs
ability to state a claim arising from the presence of asbestos materials
used in construction of the school building.  Noting the limitations
period did not begin to run until damage occurred, the court considered
what constitutes the element of damage for purposes of strict liability
and negligence.  (Id. at p. 1327.)  It stated, Until physical
injury occurs -- until damage rises above the level of mere economic loss
-- a plaintiff cannot state a cause of action for strict liability or negligence. 
(Ibid., fn. omitted.) 
 Alluding to the rule enunciated in Seely, the Grace court defined
economic loss as:  [T]he diminution in value of the product because
it is inferior in quality and does not work for the general purposes for
which it was manufactured and sold. . . . 
[It] generally means pecuniary damage that occurs through loss of value
or use of the goods sold or the cost of repair together with consequential
lost profits when there has been no claim of personal injury or damage
to other property.  (San Francisco Unified School Dist. v. W.R. Grace
& Co., supra, 37 Cal.App.4th at p. 1327, fn. 5, internal quotation
marks, italics and citations omitted.)  It explained that under Seely,
the reduction of fair market value of buildings found to contain asbestos
building materials may constitute an economic loss that cannot be recovered
in tort in a strict liability or negligence action.  Under the Seely
analysis, no physical harm to persons or property has yet occurred -- only
[unrecoverable] economic losses.  (Ibid.)
 Summarizing asbestos-in-building cases from all over the country,
the Grace court noted the issue presented itself in two distinct situations: 
Cases involving the mere presence of asbestos in the buildings and those
in which asbestos contamination had occurred.  (San Francisco Unified
School District v. W.R. Grace & Co., supra, 
37 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1328-1329.)  It noted in the latter category,
jurisdictions that adopt Seelys physical injury/economic loss distinction
routinely find that asbestos contamination constitutes the physical injury
element of strict liability or negligence causes of action . . . . 
The injury for which asbestos plaintiffs are being recompensed has been
found to be the contamination of their buildings, not the mere presence
of asbestos.  (Ibid.)  It concluded, In order to be consistent
with the principles of Seely, it appears that until contamination occurs,
the only damages that arise are economic losses that do not constitute
physical injury to property recoverable in strict liability[].  Physical
injury resulting from asbestos contamination, not the mere presence of
asbestos, must have occurred before a cause of action for strict liability
. . . can accrue . . . .  (Id. at p. 1330.)
 Although there is a generous supply of other authorities illustrating
the difference between physical damage and economic loss, a brief notation
regarding one more recent decision should be sufficient to hammer the point
home.  Casey v. Overhead Door Corp. (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 112 involved,
inter alia, defectively constructed windows in a residential tract. 
Plaintiffs argued the trial court had improperly precluded their cost estimator
expert from testifying to certain damages.  The Casey court noted 
the ruling had correctly barred testimony regarding economic losses,
i.e., the removal and replacement of the windows, but it had not prevented
plaintiffs from eliciting testimony regarding damages which were not economic
losses, i.e., the physical damage caused by the defective windows to
the drywall and framing, and the resultant insect infestation and damage
to personal property.  (Casey v. Overhead Door Corp., supra, 74 Cal.App.4th
at p. 123.)  For some unknown reason, plaintiffs had simply stipulated
that the cost estimator would not testify that repair would include new
drywall, new framing and removal of the insects.  (Id. at p. 124.) 
The reviewing court found appellants bound by the admission they had no
evidence to support a claim for any measure of damages other than economic
loss.  (Ibid.)
 Against the background of these decisions, it becomes abundantly
clear the case before us does not, in the strict sense, present an issue
of first impression.  Courts of this state have fully examined the
economic loss rule, drawn the line of demarcation between such loss and
physical injury to property, including to the defective product itself,
and allowed recovery of strict liability damages in the latter instance. 
Of course, as defendant accurately notes, some cases have apparently assumed
physical damages were recoverable.  (See, for instance, Kriegler v.
Eichler Homes, Inc., supra, 269 Cal.App.2d 224, [Californias cornerstone
strict liability construction case permitting recovery of strict liability
damages where defectively-fabricated radiant heat tubes installed in substandard
concrete slab of plaintiffs residence caused failure of the heating system,
emergency and permanent repairs, removal of storage and furniture and the
need for plaintiff and his family to find temporary replacement shelter];
Avner v. Longridge Estates, supra, 272 Cal.App.2d 607 [no physical injury,
but strict liability recovery permissible where portion of rear slope of
plaintiffs tract lot failed twice, lot pad upon which home was built settled
due to improper soil compaction and inadequate drainage, and only apparent
injury was to the property]; Stuart v. Crestview Mut. Water Co., supra,
34 Cal.App.3d 802 [plaintiffs could maintain strict liability action and
recover for loss of home and orchard destroyed in fire as a result of a
developers failure to design and install a system which could deliver
an adequate supply and flow of water].)  But the fact that these and
like cases have not directly discussed the economic loss/physical injury
to property dichotomy does not lessen the import of the cases which have. 
Indeed, the assumption that physical damages to the property are recoverable
tends to reinforce, rather than undermine, our conclusion regarding the
state of the law in California.
 We will not belabor the obvious by engaging in the intellectual
nit-picking defendant presses upon us.  Moreover, it would it serve
no purpose to examine the decisions of other jurisdictions or plumb the
niceties of the Restatement Fourth of Torts, Products Liability, section
21, or its predecessor.  Here, there is no dispute the defectively
constructed foundation resulted in slab movement and deformation causing
physical damage to plaintiffs property, i.e., cracks all over the residence. 
In light of the these facts, the authorities we have discussed, and the
Supreme Courts repeated citing of Kriegler (see, e.g., Peterson v. Superior
Court (1995) 10 Cal.4th 1185, 1200; Becker v. IRM Corp. (1985) 38 Cal.3d
454, 460, overruled in part by Peterson v. Superior Court, supra, 10 Cal.4th
at p. 1210; Price v. Shell Oil Co. (1970) 2 Cal.3d 245, 251), without so
much as a hint of the disapproval defendant insists is warranted, we have
no difficulty at all finding plaintiffs suffered physical injury to their
property.  In so concluding, we reject defendants strained argument
that for purposes of product liability law, a home is the equivalent of,
for instance, a toaster which, when it catches fire due to faulty wiring,
can be said to have injured only itself.  The analogy just doesnt
fit:  When a defective foundation results in cracked walls, ceilings
and counter tops throughout the home, recovery of strict liability damages
is not barred by the economic loss rule. 
Plaintiffs Cross-Appeal
 Plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in denying them recovery
of the costs and fees they incurred in employing geotechnical and structural
experts to obtain and analyze soils samples and perform the necessary design
calculations to enable plaintiffs to determine an appropriate repair
methodology to correct the defect.  They argue, These investigative
costs were completely distinct from the litigation costs due these experts,
and were properly recoverable as part of the cost of repair.  Because
the cross-appeal presents a pure question of law, we conduct a de novo
review.  (Stratton v. First Nat. Life Ins. Co. (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d
1071, 1083.) 
 During the trial, Glenn Tofani, plaintiffs soils expert, distinguishing
between litigation and investigative costs, testified his firm billed plaintiffs
$35,000 for the investigative work performed by it and its subcontractors. 
Florian Barth, a concrete and structural expert for plaintiffs, testified
to between $2,500 and $3,500 in investigative billings and, like Tofani,
separated that amount from costs relating to the litigation.  Defendant
did not cross-examine the experts or otherwise try to contradict the evidence. 
 Plaintiffs initially proposed a modified BAJI No. 1420 instruction
for including investigative costs as part of the cost of repair. 
However, the parties subsequently agreed to let the court decide whether
these costs were recoverable.  After the jury rendered its verdict,
plaintiffs filed a memorandum of costs seeking to recover the investigative
fees as costs to the prevailing party.  However, on the courts instruction,
they later filed a motion to recover the fees as cost of repairs damages. 
Plaintiffs challenge the trial courts denial of that motion. 
Expert Fees as Costs
 Expenses relating to expert witness fees can arise in two contexts. 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (a)(8), the prevailing
party may recover as costs [f]ees of expert witnesses ordered by the court. 
(All further statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure unless
otherwise stated.)  The court here did not order plaintiffs experts
to testify, thus expert fees were not recoverable by plaintiffs as costs
unless expressly authorized by law elsewhere.  (§ 1033.5, subd.
(b)(1).)  Inter alia, section 998 gives the court discretion to order
a defendant to pay a reasonable sum to cover costs of the services of
[plaintiffs] expert witnesses if the defendant rejects plaintiffs statutory
offer to compromise and fails to obtain a more favorable judgment at trial. 
(§ 998, subd. (d).)
 Plaintiffs perforce contend the fees and costs they seek are
not expert fees under sections 998 and 1033.5.  The argument is necessary
because, prior to trial, plaintiffs served a section 998 offer to compromise
their claims against defendant in exchange for $225,000.  Defendant
rejected the offer, and the jury awarded plaintiffs $90,000 less than the
statutory offer.  Thus, under section 998, defendant obtained a more
favorable judgment than the statutory offer, depriving the trial court
of discretion to order defendant to pay plaintiffs expert fees.
Expert Fees as Damages
 Having eliminated any potential consideration of the expert witness
fees as costs, plaintiffs contend they are entitled to recover the fees
as damages.  Citing Ravens Cove Townhomes, Inc. v. Knuppe Development
Co., supra, 114 Cal.App.3d 783, they argue, and for purposes of the cross-appeal
defendant concedes, the cost of repair is the proper measure of damages
in a construction defect case.  (Id. at p. 802.)  Civil Code
section 3333 provides, For the breach of an obligation not arising from
contract, the measure of damages, except where otherwise expressly provided
by this code, is the amount which will compensate for all the detriment
proximately caused thereby, whether it could have been anticipated or not. 
As the Ravens Cove court concluded, since tort damages are intended to
make the injured plaintiff whole, the proper measure of damages [in a
construction defect case] is the cost of remedying the defects together
with the value of the lost use (if any) during the period of injury. 
(Ravens Cove Townhomes, Inc. v. Knuppe Development Co., supra, 114 Cal.App.3d
at p. 802.)
 Regan Roofing Co. v. Superior Court (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1685
is informative.  There, the issue arose in the context of a good faith
settlement motion involving the nonsettling defendants objection to allocation
of $250,000 for expert investigation fees.  (Id. at p. 1694.) 
The court correctly reasoned, It would be proper to view this $250,000
expert expense as damages due for a portion of the cost of repair, which
is an appropriate measure of damages in cases based on damage to real property. 
[Citations.]  (Id. at p. 1709.)  Defendant asks us to disregard
Regan Roofing because it involved a settlement, not a trial.  We find
no meaningful distinction.
 The record is clear the court denied plaintiffs motion, not
because it doubted the credibility of the expert witnesses, but because
it believed the law did not allow it to require defendant to pay the expert
fees, even if they were incurred solely in relation to the costs of repair. 
The court was wrong.  Plaintiffs were entitled to be made whole. 
 Defendant protests that all litigation expenses are at least
arguably caused by the wrong out of which the lawsuit arises, and yet the
Legislature has determined expert expenses are recoverable, if at all,
as costs, not as damages.  In support of their argument, they cite
Ripley v. Pappadopoulos (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1616, which states, [C]ompensation
of an expert is, in the first instance, the responsibility of the party
who hires the expert.  (Id. at p. 1624.)  Ripley is inapt: 
It considers the issue of costs under sections 1032 and 1033.5, not damages
under Civil Code section 3333.
 Because the uncontradicted testimony established plaintiffs were
billed $37,500 by professionals who investigated the problems in order
to formulate an appropriate repair plan, it would serve no purpose to remand
the issue for further consideration.  Sections 43 and 906 give an
appellate court power to modify a judgment and direct the trial court to
enter the proper judgment.  That authority will be exercised when,
as here, the record shows the parties rights can be determined fully on
appeal.  (See 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Appeal, §
744, p. 773 and cases cited therein.) 
 
DISPOSITION
 The order denying plaintiffs motion to recover expert fees as
damages is reversed.  The judgment in favor of plaintiffs is modified
to include an additional $37,500 representing those damages.  As so
modified, the judgment is affirmed.  Plaintiffs shall recover their
costs on appeal.

                        Profile Visibility
                      


About Profile Visibility
Profile Visibility is based on the total number of weekly profile views. It provides a weekly snapshot of
            which profiles users are viewing on martindale.com in the form of a ranking. We do not differentiate in
            the case of a tie, which may mean a number of attorneys in the same city display the same
            ranking. For example, if three lawyers each received 20 profiles views last week in Atlanta, and 20 is the
            highest number of profile views for that week, all three lawyers would receive a #1 ranking.

            Peer Reviews
            



About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.

Client Reviews 


About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.

                    I contacted Jeff Stearman regarding custody of my daughter.  In our very first meeting, I was taken back when he suggested that I try to reach a formal agreement with my daughter's father before proceeding with legal action. In other words: before hiring him. He was more concerned with my interest than his own.  Integrity like that is hard to find. I did end up needing legal counsel and Jeff proved to be personable, professional, effective and honest. I highly recommend him.

Law firm response:
Thank you so much for your review. I am glad I could assist and obtain the results for you that you desired. It is usually my practice to see if the parties can reach a mutual agreement prior to necessitating court intervention.

                Jeffrey Stearman did a great job on my case. He fought for my rights and continued until I had satisfying results. He communicated all of my wants, needs and concerns to opposing council and settled my difficult divorce in a much shorter time than I anticipated. I would recommend Mr. Stearman to anyone in need of a great attorney.

                We went through 5 lawyers and we did not get anywhere. With jeffrey we got everything we where asking for. He communicates everything which a lot of attorneys do not at all only when they wanted a payment. Most of all he lets you know of what your situation really is, he does not promise things he knows would be impossible just to get your business.

                    I contacted Jeff Stearman regarding custody of my daughter.  In our very first meeting, I was taken back when he suggested that I try to reach a formal agreement with my daughter's father before proceeding with legal action. In other words: before hiring him. He was more concerned with my interest than his own.  Integrity like that is hard to find. I did end up needing legal counsel and Jeff proved to be personable, professional, effective and honest. I highly recommend him.

                Jeffrey Stearman did a great job on my case. He fought for my rights and continued until I had satisfying results. He communicated all of my wants, needs and concerns to opposing council and settled my difficult divorce in a much shorter time than I anticipated. I would recommend Mr. Stearman to anyone in need of a great attorney.

                We went through 5 lawyers and we did not get anywhere. With jeffrey we got everything we where asking for. He communicates everything which a lot of attorneys do not at all only when they wanted a payment. Most of all he lets you know of what your situation really is, he does not promise things he knows would be impossible just to get your business.

About Profile Visibility
Profile Visibility is based on the total number of weekly profile views. It provides a weekly snapshot of
            which profiles users are viewing on martindale.com in the form of a ranking. We do not differentiate in
            the case of a tie, which may mean a number of attorneys in the same city display the same
            ranking. For example, if three lawyers each received 20 profiles views last week in Atlanta, and 20 is the
            highest number of profile views for that week, all three lawyers would receive a #1 ranking.

            Peer Reviews
            



About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.

Client Reviews 


About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Client Review Ratings, please visit our Client Review Page.

                    I contacted Jeff Stearman regarding custody of my daughter.  In our very first meeting, I was taken back when he suggested that I try to reach a formal agreement with my daughter's father before proceeding with legal action. In other words: before hiring him. He was more concerned with my interest than his own.  Integrity like that is hard to find. I did end up needing legal counsel and Jeff proved to be personable, professional, effective and honest. I highly recommend him.

Law firm response:
Thank you so much for your review. I am glad I could assist and obtain the results for you that you desired. It is usually my practice to see if the parties can reach a mutual agreement prior to necessitating court intervention.

                Jeffrey Stearman did a great job on my case. He fought for my rights and continued until I had satisfying results. He communicated all of my wants, needs and concerns to opposing council and settled my difficult divorce in a much shorter time than I anticipated. I would recommend Mr. Stearman to anyone in need of a great attorney.

                We went through 5 lawyers and we did not get anywhere. With jeffrey we got everything we where asking for. He communicates everything which a lot of attorneys do not at all only when they wanted a payment. Most of all he lets you know of what your situation really is, he does not promise things he knows would be impossible just to get your business.

                    I contacted Jeff Stearman regarding custody of my daughter.  In our very first meeting, I was taken back when he suggested that I try to reach a formal agreement with my daughter's father before proceeding with legal action. In other words: before hiring him. He was more concerned with my interest than his own.  Integrity like that is hard to find. I did end up needing legal counsel and Jeff proved to be personable, professional, effective and honest. I highly recommend him.

                Jeffrey Stearman did a great job on my case. He fought for my rights and continued until I had satisfying results. He communicated all of my wants, needs and concerns to opposing council and settled my difficult divorce in a much shorter time than I anticipated. I would recommend Mr. Stearman to anyone in need of a great attorney.

                We went through 5 lawyers and we did not get anywhere. With jeffrey we got everything we where asking for. He communicates everything which a lot of attorneys do not at all only when they wanted a payment. Most of all he lets you know of what your situation really is, he does not promise things he knows would be impossible just to get your business.

Jeffrey D. Stearman – Attorney at Law
Huntington Beach, CA. Law Firm
Debt Collection & Recovery

Our goal is to provide our clients with the highest standards of quality and service by utilizing cutting edge techniques to collect outstanding receivables in an expeditious and amicable manner.
Attorney Stearman is also a California licensed Private Investigator (CA. PI 20788) which enables him to better locate skipped debtors and locate assets.
Why should I use an attorney instead of a collection agency?

The direct intervention by the Law Office of Jeffrey D. Stearman often results in greater recovery of outstanding accounts receivables and bad debt. In many circumstances, the fear of prompt and substantial legal action results in recovery of outstanding obligations without suit becoming necessary.
Debtors are less likely to ignore a collection letter from an attorney. Collection agencies cannot file small claims lawsuits in California. Only attorneys can do the one thing that debtors fear most: file a lawsuit to collect the debt.
The shock of a process server or the Sheriff on the debtor’s doorstep is a pretty good indication that you are serious about collecting your money. Many creditors just threaten suit. Many debtors know that most creditors will not sue so they just ignore them. Having the Sheriff show up takes your unpaid account to a new level of importance to the debtor. In California, corporate debtors must be represented by a lawyer. The debtor now has to either hire a lawyer of their own, or just lose by default. Either way, they are much more inclined to try to work it out. If not, they know they are facing a collection attorney. In addition, after judgment, the debtor is also facing wage garnishments, bank levies, etc.
What should I look for in a collection attorney?

When selecting a law firm to collect a past due account, the attorney should know how to evaluate your case to maximize recovery. Your lawyer should know how to take the case to trial if necessary and should have the resources find assets and collect unpaid judgments. At the Law Office of Jeffrey D. Stearman, we do not utilize paralegals to do the work. Each case is personally handled by Attorney Stearman. Further, once judgment is obtained, we do NOT need to hire outside private investigators to help identify assets to enforce money judgments, as Attorney Stearman has the advantage of also being a California Licensed Private Investigator.
We offer both hourly and contingent fee agreements.
Call 714-871-7778 or Email our office for a FREE CONSULTATION about your collection matter.

January 9,  2017
My experience with Attorney Stearman in the handling of my car accident was a very positive experience from start to finish. He took care of my needs right away. I didn’t expect to personally get in touch with a lawyer as quickly as I did. The first time I contacted Mr. Stearman on the phone I was able to talk to him right away and he answered my initial questions for me. He was very professional and courteous. I signed up with him because I had confidence right away. He was able to get me a settlement which I thought was fair. Very happy with his services. I would definitely use him again if I had another injury case.
September 2,  2016
Attorney Stearman is a excellent attorney who kept me informed on all activity regarding my auto accident case. He seemed to be always willing to go the extra mile on my case and keep me informed every step of the way. Very knowledgeable and thorough, always examining my case from every angle. I have already recommended him to several friends and will continue to do so. Overall great legal service.
July 25,  2016
This is the best attorney ever. Attorney, Jeffrey Stearman was easy to talk with, also professional, and knowledgeable about the law. I came to Mr. Stearman with a very stressful problem. He took my case and within a very short time resolved all my legal problems. He was also reasonable regarding price. I would highly recommend this attorney if you need help.
April 10,  2016
I’m glad I picked the Law Office of Jeffrey Stearman to help with my personal injury case. I really appreciate the time and effort put into my case, especially in getting it resolved quickly.
December 28,  2015
My experience with Attorney Jeffrey D. Stearman in Fullerton has been outstanding from beginning to end. Initially, he provided me with all of the information, guidance and support I needed when my case started. Throughout the process, he was responsive to my questions, discreet and knowledgeable. If you should find yourself needing an attorney, I cannot recommend Mr. Stearman highly enough. He offers very competitive rates, 100% professionalism and is very accessible by phone and/or email.
October 23,  2015
The divorce procedure is one of the hardest things I have ever endured. Fortunately for me, I hired Jeffrey Stearman to represent me. Mr. Stearman’s ambition, professionalism and good hearted nature got me through the process with my head held high on days when I just wanted to give up. When it was over I walked away with my dignity, self respect and a comfortable future planned for me and my family due to the efforts, work and advice of Mr. Stearman. I would not hesitate for one minute to contact his office again should I need legal assistance.
August 18,  2015
Jeff is a first class attorney who provided me with excellent service. Very available and responsive addressing issues in a timely manner. I would recommend Jeff and will utilize his services again if needed.
July 1,  2015
He was extremely responsive and helpful with my situation. I can be very difficult and ask a lot of questions and he was very helpful and patient with me. I highly recommend Jeff Stearman. Thanks again Jeff.
June 11,  2015
When I shopped Jeffrey D. Stearman, I found that every attorney I spoke with was bouncing all over the place for my business, not paying attention to the information I was providing, and showing no direct honesty as Mr. Stearman did when we spoke. He left me a feeling of confidence and took all of the pressure off of me that an Out Of State case could cause. I highly recommend his services and would not hesitate to use him again.
May 28,  2015
My experience with Mr. Stearman has been excellent. I recommend him highly to anyone with complex child custody and support issues.
March 31,  2015
I had contacted Attorney Jeffrey Stearman on a recommendation from a friend who is also an attorney.  I must say that I am glad to have acted on this recommendation.  Without going into details of somewhat unique and complicated divorce case, Mr. Stearman not only proved his level of expertise, but also offered emotional and practical support which can be an invaluable benefit in such situations.  I felt that he was there to guide and counsel; he truly took the time to help me reach decisions that will best address my concerns while helping me not get caught up in the emotional aspect of this process. I highly recommend Attorney Stearman
December 3,  2014
Jeffrey Stearman did a great job for me & always responded quickly with any questions I had for him, Jeffrey took care of my needs through this process & would highly recommend Jeffrey services.
November 18,  2014
Mr. Stearman was a fantastic lawyer. I never had to give any thought or concerns about my divorce, which meant, I was able to get on with my life. What a relief it was to have him take care of everything for me.
August 29,  2014
Attorney Stearman recently helped me with my case. I greatly appreciated his no-nonsense approach to a process that has a tendency to be emotionally charged. He presents things clearly and educates you on decisions to be made. He was great, efficient, and gracious when things needed to be done. I have already recommended Mr. Stearman to people that I talk with.

June 5,  2014
Outstanding service and results! Attorney Jeffrey Stearman was referred to me by another Lawyer, which turned-out to be a terrific decision. Jeffrey represented me extremely well. He is timely, professional, articulate and very well organized. He follows-up on a regular basis, values mutual respect and spoke to me as a concerned individual. In short, he cares; and it made the difference between my ability to survive financially (and emotionally, etc.) – or declare bankruptcy. I happily survived the case and my children and I are doing very well. I highly regard Mr. Stearman and happily refer Jeffrey Stearman.
April 15,  2014
I met Jeffrey twice and on the second time was able to obtain him as my lawyer. He has been awesome! Compassionate, straight forward, logical, and showed a great deal of patience. I was so frightened about my divorce and how I was going to be able to pay my bills and pay for my ex. Thank you very much, Jeffrey.  You took my calls, tried to keep my costs down and got me through a terrible time in my life. Thank you so much!!!!
February 24,  2014



Mr. Stearman, once again, I want to convey my gratitude in how well you’ve handled my case these past few months. I used to think badly of lawyers (the expense and all). However- its very clear to me I could not navigate the legal system in the way I have without your knowledge and coaching and negotiating expertise. The fact is, with your help, I have a young child that is safe today and would not have been- for that I am so grateful. Feel free to post this on your blog, website or where ever- you deserve it.
February 3,  2014



Attorney Stearman has been an extreme blessing in my current complex divorce. He recently represented me when my husband contested a restraining order and I couldn’t have been more impressed . Attorney Stearman is professional, knowledgeable, and always has the best interest of myself and my children in the forefront of any decision that needs to be made. I would recommend Attorney Jeffrey Stearman without hesitation!
January 15,  2014



It had taken me 2 years to try to finalize my divorce with my prior attorney. After finally going to Attorney Stearman, he quickly understood and assisted with what I needed. He and his assistant Shelby were very friendly and professional. Everything was taken care of for me so fast. I really appreciate the professionalism and expertise of Attorney Stearman and now recommend him to anyone I know going through a divorce
November 18,  2013



From first contact through final agreement, Mr. Stearman and his staff was courteous, professional and sensitive to my needs during a very trying time.

Jeffrey Stearman did a great job on my case. He fought for my rights and continued until I had satisfying results. He communicated all of my wants, needs and concerns to opposing council and settled my difficult divorce in a much shorter time than I anticipated. I would recommend Mr. Stearman to anyone in need of a great attorney.

Jeffrey provides exemplary legal representation. His quick response to my messages and attention to my case details exceeded my expectations. I have recommended Mr. Stearman to others.

I have dealt with approx. 4 lawyers pertaining to a variety of matters.  Mr.  Stearman, however, handled my case with professionalism, confidence and kept me completely informed on what he was doing as well as what the other party was doing. Also, I felt I got the representation that I paid for. Other firms seemed to nickel and dime me to death. I felt my case was a rather uncommon case to handle (family law) but Jeffrey was very confident about the situation and the outcome which in return gave me the confidence to even proceed with the case.  I was very satisfied with the outcome as a result of Jeffrey’s work efforts on my behalf.

Mr. Stearman is a very competent and professional attorney. Going through a divorce is such a very hard thing. My only concern was custody of my children and Mr. Stearman understood that and in the end he got me exactly what I had asked for. He always returned my phone calls and emails promptly. His secretary was always very professional and very nice when I called or had to come in to the office to drop paperwork off or meet with Mr. Stearman. I feel, his best interest is his clients and I would recommend him, with high regards.

I hired Jeffrey Stearman as my defense attorney. He was highly recommended to me and went above and beyond his duties as my attorney. He was informative, always available and most importantly, he cared! I wasn’t just another number or client.

Navigating within the legal system is often extremely complex and at times emotionally challenging. As a first time legal client I was uncertain and at times afraid of what to expect. Attorney Jeffrey Stearman immediately put me at ease with my case and went on to prove the high level of competence he represents. His command of the law, courtroom presence and ability to achieve my objectives and goals are unmatched. Even beyond all these qualities Jeffrey has a true compassion for each of his clients and will treat you with the utmost respect, honesty and commitment. I strongly encourage you to seek out his services and be assured your legal matters are in the best of hands.”

We went through 5 lawyers and we did not get anywhere. With Jeffrey we got everything we were asking for. He communicates everything which a lot of attorneys do not at all only when they wanted a payment. Most of all he lets you know of what your situation really is, he does not promise things he knows would be impossible just to get your business.

I contacted Mr. Stearman to help me with my divorce. My ex-wife was trying to get more money from me. With Mr. Stearman’s help he was able to get my child support lower than what I was paying originally and I was able to get everything that I had asked for. He was very easy to work with and was always available for any questions that I had. I recommend him to anyone I know or to anyone who is going through the same situation. GREAT JOB MR STEARMAN

Jeffrey- you were right on! Experience does pay. You were worth every penny. Thanks so much for getting me though a stressful time. Glad I didn’t go it alone!
March 2,  2012
Mr. Stearman is a consummate professional and one of the most patient, meticulous, and thorough attorneys I have ever dealt with. I recommend Jeffrey without hesitation to anyone interested in superior results.
Feb. 3, 2012
Thank you Attorney Stearman. I was in way over my head. A lot of property was involved, and you found some more I had no clue about in discovery. Those were dark days when no one else said I’d have a chance to come out with a reasonable settlement – but you did it!
Dec. 14,  2011
Jeffrey, I got lucky! I found you! Seriously, without your help my now-ex would have gotten everything his way. He had a powerful law firm paid for by his rich family and I was in the cross-hairs.

My husband and I engaged Mr. Stearman to assist our son in a criminal matter. He responded immediately with sound and reassuring counsel. Mr. Stearman’s fees were reasonable and when he resolved the case without a going to court he surprised us by returning most of our retainer. I would not hesitate to recommend Mr. Stearman. He was compassionate, professional, and competent.
April 15,  2011
Jeff was always on top of my case. Communication was great and he got back to me in a timely manner when I called or email him. His staff was always courteous when I called or came in to drop things off.

 Conducts himself in a provisional way and he is easy to reach.

Mr. Stearman is one of the most professional attorneys there is! Very courteous and professional and lets you know your options and helps you settle your case in a manner that is best for you. Always available by phone or e-mail and is extremely prompt in returning messages or answering question regardless of how minor or major they are. He will fight as hard as he has to to win your case and I would highly recommend him to anyone who has family law issues.

I used the majority Jeffrey Stearman services for a civil lawsuit – breach of contract which is not option as an area of law stated above. I trust Mr. Stearman and will recommend him to all of my friends and families. He respond very quickly and really put his all into assisting me with the civil lawsuit. I have had many lawyers in the past and he by far is the best. I wish we could have met 5 years earlier.
