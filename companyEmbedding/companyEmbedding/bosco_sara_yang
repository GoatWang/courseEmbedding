A U.S. Midwesterner by birth, Bosco speaks and writes Mandarin Chinese. Bosco holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in American Studies from the University of Notre Dame. She also has a Juris Doctorate from Indiana University Bloomington, and in 2014 she was named to the Academy of Law Alumni Fellows, the highest honor bestowed by the university's Maurer School of Law. She is a member of the New York State Bar Association and the American Bar Association. Bosco has served the past six years on the board of the American Chamber in Hong Kong, most recently as a member of the executive committee and treasurer.

Emerson Names Sara Yang Bosco as General Counsel | Business Wire
























































Emerson Names Sara Yang Bosco as General Counsel






April 06, 2016 05:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



ST. LOUIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Emerson (NYSE: EMR) announced today that Sara Yang Bosco, president of 
      Emerson Asia-Pacific, will become senior vice president, secretary and 
      general counsel for the company effective May 15. Timothy G. Westman, 
      who has temporarily filled the role since August 2015, will retire at 
      the end of the year after 30 years with Emerson.
    


      Bosco has led Emerson’s corporate operations and strategic development 
      in the Asia-Pacific region since 2008. She joined Emerson in 2005 as 
      general counsel, Asia-Pacific. In the general counsel role she was 
      responsible for overseeing the company’s legal affairs in the 
      Asia-Pacific region, as well as providing legal counsel on a wide range 
      of matters such as mergers and acquisitions, compliance, dispute 
      resolution, and corporate and commercial operational matters.
    

      “Sara is an experienced attorney and a strong leader whose experience in 
      one of our most dynamic regions will be extremely valuable to this 
      management team and the board,” said Emerson Chairman and Chief 
      Executive Officer David N. Farr. “She brings a diverse record of 
      achievement and will help us navigate important issues and opportunities 
      in the changing times ahead.”
    

      Prior to joining Emerson, Bosco had a long history of supporting Emerson 
      as external legal counsel in her capacity as a partner with the Hong 
      Kong offices of the Baker & McKenzie and Perkins Coie law firms. 
      Admitted to practice law in New York, Bosco has practiced law in New 
      York, Taipei and Hong Kong.
    

      Bosco has more than 30 years of legal experience, with a focus on 
      mergers and acquisitions, cross-border investment and joint ventures. 
      She was named as one of Asia’s leading business lawyers practicing in 
      China and was recognized in AsiaLaw’s leading lawyers surveys. 
      She has been living and working in Asia for the past 24 years. A U.S. 
      Midwesterner by birth, Bosco speaks and writes Mandarin Chinese.
    

      Bosco holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in American Studies from the 
      University of Notre Dame. She also has a Juris Doctorate from Indiana 
      University Bloomington, and in 2014 she was named to the Academy of Law 
      Alumni Fellows, the highest honor bestowed by the university’s Maurer 
      School of Law. She is a member of the New York State Bar Association and 
      the American Bar Association. Bosco has served the past six years on the 
      board of the American Chamber in Hong Kong, most recently as a member of 
      the executive committee and treasurer. She is also an Emerson 
      representative of the US-China Business Council.
