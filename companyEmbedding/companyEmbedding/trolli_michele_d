Michele D. Trolli is Executive Vice President and Chief Information Officer of M&T Bank. She also serves as a member of M&T’s Management Committee.

In her role as Chief Information Officer, Trolli leads a broad range of the company’s technology and banking operations, which include banking services, corporate services, digital and telephone banking, the enterprise data office, enterprise security and enterprise technology. These six divisions account for more than a fifth of the bank’s employees.
 
Trolli has more than 30 years of experience in banking, investments and technology. Prior to joining M&T, Trolli held the position of Senior Director with Franklin Resources Inc., a world-wide investment management company, and was an Executive Vice President and Development Director of KeyCorp, where she directed KeyBank’s application development division. 
 
Trolli sits on the mobile banking board of the Clearing House Association, the nation’s first banking association which today advocates on regulatory, legislative and legal public policy issues on behalf of the U.S. banking industry before policy makers, and previously served for six years as the director-at-large for the Bank Administration Institute (BAI). 

An active member in the community, Trolli serves as the director and chair elect of the board of the Zoological Society of Buffalo, Inc., (“Buffalo Zoo”), and heads their Strategic Planning Committee. She also serves on the board of the Western New York Women’s Foundation.

Trolli received a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from John Carroll University.
 
In 2014, she was recognized by American Banker magazine as one of the “25 Women to Watch,” an honor awarded annually to recognize influential female leaders and executives who provide exemplary work in the fields of banking and finance.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.

History[edit]
In 1948 Willy Mederer founded Willy Mederer KG, a company producing pasta in Fürth, Germany. When sugar rationing regulations were lifted the company changed production from pasta to confectionery.
The company grew in the 1950s and 1960s, widening the product range and rising to 150 staff. Candies were sold under the Wilmed brand, a portmanteau of Willy Mederer. Sales offices in Münich and Stuttgart were opened. In 1975 the company registered the 'Trolli' brand name that became the trading name for the company in 2012.
Willy Mederer died in 1984 and was succeeded by his son Herbert.
Trolli varieties were added, including sour flavours, double layered gummies with foam made using starch mogul machines and the 'Trolli-Burger'. Mederer received the 1993 Candy Kettle Award.[1] A subsidiary, Trolli Iberica S.A., was founded in Valencia, Spain, in 1994. A production site was opened in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 1997. The Mederer Group later opened a packaging plant in Pilsen, Czech Republic.
eFruti, a fruit gummy brand from Neunburg vorm Wald, was acquired by the Mederer Group in 1998 and its name used, slightly altered to eFrutti, as a brand. Gummi Bear Factory of Boizenburg was bought in 2000.[2]

In the United States[edit]
In the 1980s Trolli exports to North America grew to 40 tonnes per day. In 1986 Mederer built a production facility in Creston, Iowa. Trolli's US operations were sold to Favorite Brands International in 1996 and subsequently owned by Nabisco (1999), Kraft Foods (2000), Wrigleys (2005), and Farley's & Sathers Candy Company (2006)[3] which became part of Ferrara Candy Company in 2013.[4]
In 2004 Trolli introduced a roadkill themed gummy candy in the shape of chickens, squirrels, and snakes with tire tracks on them. Kraft Foods, then the owner of the Trolli US brand, pulled the candy from the market in 2005 in response to protests.[5][6]
Sponsorship[edit]
Trolli sponsored the football club SpVgg Greuther Fürth from 2010 to 2014, during which time the stadium was named the Trolli Arena.
Manufacturing plants and factories[edit]
Trolli GmbH has its headquarters in Fürth and has factories in Boizenburg, Neunburg vorm Wald and Hagenow. The original factory in Fürth was closed in 2012.[7]
In 2001 Mederer built a production site in Guangzhou, China. in a joint venture with the Spanish company 'Multi Joyco'. in 2004 Mederer took over 100% of the enterprise. From China Trolli exports its products to nations in Asia, Australasia, North America and the Middle East.
In Europe Trolli has a manufacturing plant in Valencia, Spain, Italy and a packaging plant in Pilsen, Czech Republic.
Products[edit]
Trolli product ranges include: Original, Sour, Soft, Special, Liquorice, Extra Fruity, Marshmallows, Gelatine-free, Gluten, Vegetarian, Lactose-Free and Halal products.

History[edit]
In 1948 Willy Mederer founded Willy Mederer KG, a company producing pasta in Fürth, Germany. When sugar rationing regulations were lifted the company changed production from pasta to confectionery.
The company grew in the 1950s and 1960s, widening the product range and rising to 150 staff. Candies were sold under the Wilmed brand, a portmanteau of Willy Mederer. Sales offices in Münich and Stuttgart were opened. In 1975 the company registered the 'Trolli' brand name that became the trading name for the company in 2012.
Willy Mederer died in 1984 and was succeeded by his son Herbert.
Trolli varieties were added, including sour flavours, double layered gummies with foam made using starch mogul machines and the 'Trolli-Burger'. Mederer received the 1993 Candy Kettle Award.[1] A subsidiary, Trolli Iberica S.A., was founded in Valencia, Spain, in 1994. A production site was opened in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 1997. The Mederer Group later opened a packaging plant in Pilsen, Czech Republic.
eFruti, a fruit gummy brand from Neunburg vorm Wald, was acquired by the Mederer Group in 1998 and its name used, slightly altered to eFrutti, as a brand. Gummi Bear Factory of Boizenburg was bought in 2000.[2]

In the United States[edit]
In the 1980s Trolli exports to North America grew to 40 tonnes per day. In 1986 Mederer built a production facility in Creston, Iowa. Trolli's US operations were sold to Favorite Brands International in 1996 and subsequently owned by Nabisco (1999), Kraft Foods (2000), Wrigleys (2005), and Farley's & Sathers Candy Company (2006)[3] which became part of Ferrara Candy Company in 2013.[4]
In 2004 Trolli introduced a roadkill themed gummy candy in the shape of chickens, squirrels, and snakes with tire tracks on them. Kraft Foods, then the owner of the Trolli US brand, pulled the candy from the market in 2005 in response to protests.[5][6]
Sponsorship[edit]
Trolli sponsored the football club SpVgg Greuther Fürth from 2010 to 2014, during which time the stadium was named the Trolli Arena.
