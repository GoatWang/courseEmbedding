Operations[edit]
Pointer Telocation operates in two areas of the motor vehicle services industry. The company provides RF- and GPS/GPRS-based automatic vehicle location solutions and command-and-control systems for fleet management and stolen vehicle recovery; and in addition, through its Shagrir subsidiary, it provides roadside assistance to motorists.[2]
Corporate history[edit]
Pointer was originally the name of a product developed by Nexus Telecommunications Systems Ltd. and marketed by Eden Telecom Ltd., beginning in 1999 with Eden's founding. The product's name was inspired by the Pointer dog breed. At the time of its establishment Eden was a joint venture of four Israeli investors: Motorola, Nexus, Poalim Investments, and Clal. In 1997 Nexus Telecommunications Systems changed its name to Nexus Telocation Systems Ltd. In 2002 Eden changed its name to Pointer. In 2004 Nexus Telocation Systems acquired Pointer and in 2006 changed its name to Pointer Telocation Ltd.[3][4][5][6][7][8] In May, 2006, Pointer Telocation signed an agreement with Latin American customer netting approximately $1.4 million, which was recorded as a one time income in Q2 2006 financial results.In addition, a new service level agreement was being negotiated with the customer to govern future activities.[9]
Shaul Elovitch's Eurocom Group began accumulating shares of Pointer in August 2008, acquiring 9.03% of the company.[10][11] Since December 2008 Eurocom holds 14.66% of Pointer's shares. DBSI Investments controls 37.27% of the company.[12]
Management[edit]
Giora Inbar, formerly commander of the Lebanon Liaison Unit of the Israel Defense Forces, was brought on board Eden Telecom as CEO with the company's founding in 1999. He left the position as part of the 2004–2005 deal to merge Shagrir with Pointer. In 2005 Danny Stern was appointed CEO and president of Pointer. He vacated the positions in 2011, whereupon David Mahlab became Pointer's CEO and president.[13][14][15]

Operations[edit]
Pointer Telocation operates in two areas of the motor vehicle services industry. The company provides RF- and GPS/GPRS-based automatic vehicle location solutions and command-and-control systems for fleet management and stolen vehicle recovery; and in addition, through its Shagrir subsidiary, it provides roadside assistance to motorists.[2]
Corporate history[edit]
Pointer was originally the name of a product developed by Nexus Telecommunications Systems Ltd. and marketed by Eden Telecom Ltd., beginning in 1999 with Eden's founding. The product's name was inspired by the Pointer dog breed. At the time of its establishment Eden was a joint venture of four Israeli investors: Motorola, Nexus, Poalim Investments, and Clal. In 1997 Nexus Telecommunications Systems changed its name to Nexus Telocation Systems Ltd. In 2002 Eden changed its name to Pointer. In 2004 Nexus Telocation Systems acquired Pointer and in 2006 changed its name to Pointer Telocation Ltd.[3][4][5][6][7][8] In May, 2006, Pointer Telocation signed an agreement with Latin American customer netting approximately $1.4 million, which was recorded as a one time income in Q2 2006 financial results.In addition, a new service level agreement was being negotiated with the customer to govern future activities.[9]
Shaul Elovitch's Eurocom Group began accumulating shares of Pointer in August 2008, acquiring 9.03% of the company.[10][11] Since December 2008 Eurocom holds 14.66% of Pointer's shares. DBSI Investments controls 37.27% of the company.[12]
Management[edit]
Giora Inbar, formerly commander of the Lebanon Liaison Unit of the Israel Defense Forces, was brought on board Eden Telecom as CEO with the company's founding in 1999. He left the position as part of the 2004–2005 deal to merge Shagrir with Pointer. In 2005 Danny Stern was appointed CEO and president of Pointer. He vacated the positions in 2011, whereupon David Mahlab became Pointer's CEO and president.[13][14][15]

					Full Description



Pointer Telocation Ltd., incorporated on July 17, 1991, is a provider of mobile resource management (MRM) products and services for the automotive, insurance industries and other mobile tracking markets, such as cargo, assets, shipping and containers. The Company offers roadside assistance (RSA) services, automobile repair and towing services, stolen vehicle recovery (SVR) and other services. The Company operates through three segments: Cellocator, MRM and RSA. The Cellocator segment designs, develops and produces MRM products that include asset tracking, fleet management and security products. Through the MRM segment, the Company acts as an operator in Israel, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and South Africa by bundling its products together with a range of MRM services. Through the RSA segment, the Company acts as an operator in Israel, providing RSA services, emergency repair services for sale to automotive and insurance companies and car sharing services.CellocatorThe Cellocator segment is engaged in designing, developing and producing customizable MRM products that utilize various radio frequency (RF) and cellular communication technologies, such as global system for mobile communications (GSM), general packet radio service (GPRS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) and code division multiple access (CDMA). Cellocator products are both sold and distributed to its MRM Segment in Latin America and Israel and South Africa, as well as third party operators across the world. Its fleet management products enhance the utilization of fleet vehicles and other mobile resources. The fleet management products also include remote monitoring and control solutions that are included as part of its SVR product line, such as the Command & Control Center (CCC) and communications infrastructure. The Company also provides operators with end units that provide online monitoring of the operating parameters of a fleet vehicle, as well as details on driver behavior. In addition, the Company provides Web access required for the execution of vehicular and fleet management operations. The asset tracking products are designed to track and monitor cargo transported in trailers and containers and or specialized equipment used for construction or agricultural purposes. The Company's asset tracking products include tracking, communication and maintenance capabilities, providing functionality for asset tracking and monitoring of both mobile assets and assets without a constant power supply. The Company's SVR products are designed to prevent vehicles from being stolen and enable vehicles retrieval through co-operation with law enforcement and private security agencies. Its SVR products can also include the option of a distress key that can be used by a driver to alert the CCC, which in turn locates the vehicle and immediately enables operators to provide the required services.The Company offers an end unit with input and output capabilities. The CCC includes databases and software modules required for the execution of certain operations by the operator, as well as monitors to display data collected from the end units, which is then analyzed in order to determine the location of the vehicle. The CCC connects to the end units through radio frequency or cellular communications and commands can be transmitted to the end units from the CCC using either a commercial paging system or cellular networks. Communication is accomplished by either the cellular network in each territory of operation or radio frequency infrastructure with base stations. These stations are dispersed throughout a specific territory and are connected to an existing communications infrastructure. Each base station is equipped with antennae, which receives the end unit's signal and measures the angle, from which the signal arrived for the purpose of locating the vehicle. These measurements together with additional data received from the end units is then converted into digital data and sent to the CCC. The location of the vehicle is established by either triangulation measurements from several base stations installed by the operator or by means of a global positioning system (GPS) device contained within the vehicle.MRMThe MRM Segment provides asset tracking services, fleet management services and SVR services. The Company's asset tracking services in Israel, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil and South Africa provide MRM services to assets both with and or without an onboard power supply. The Company's fleet management services in Israel, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil and South Africa are based on cellular communication, GPS location tools and Web-based applications providing connectivity to the vehicle through products manufactured by its Cellocator segment. The Company provides SVR services in Israel and Argentina, and to a lesser extent in Mexico, Brazil and South Africa. The Company provides MRM services in Israel through the Company and abroad, through its local subsidiaries, Pointer Argentina S.A. (Pointer Argentina), Pointer Recuperacion de Mexico, SA de CV (Pointer Mexico), Pointer do Brasil Comercial Ltda. and Pointer SA (PTY) Ltd. (Pointer South Africa), respectively. In providing MRM services, the Company purchases products manufactured by its Cellocator segment and by third party operators, and accessories, such as alarm systems.RSAThe RSA Segment offers towing services, temporary vehicle replacement services, mobile automobile repair services, as well as vehicle body work and replacement parts installation services as part of its RSA services.
