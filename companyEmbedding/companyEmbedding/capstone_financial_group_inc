(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  This document contains "forward-looking statements". All statements other than statements of historical fact are "forward-looking statements" for purposes of federal and state securities laws, including, but not limited to, any projections of earnings, revenue or other financial items; any statements of the plans, strategies and objections of management for future operations; any statements concerning proposed new services or developments; any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance; any statements or belief; and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing.  Forward-looking statements may include the words "may," "could," "estimate," "intend," "continue," "believe," "expect" or "anticipate" or other similar words. These forward-looking statements present our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the dates on which they are made. Except for our ongoing securities laws, we do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to update any forward-looking statement. You should, however, consult further disclosures we make in future filings of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K.  Although we believe the expectations reflected in any of our forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed in any of our forward-looking statements. Our future financial condition and results of operations, as well as any forward-looking statements, are subject to change and inherent risks and uncertainties. The factors impacting these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:  · our current lack of working capital;  · inability to raise additional financing;  · the fact that our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and they may require our management to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain;  · deterioration in general or regional economic conditions;  · adverse state or federal legislation or regulation that increases the costs of compliance, or adverse findings by a regulator with respect to existing operations;  · inability to efficiently manage our operations;  · inability to achieve future sales levels or other operating results; and  · the unavailability of funds for capital expenditures.  For a detailed description of these and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement, please see "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in this document.  Throughout this Quarterly Report references to "we", "our", "us", "Capstone", "the Company", and similar terms refer to Capstone Financial Group, Inc.

We will provide a copy of our annual report to security holders, including audited financial statements, at no charge upon receipt to of a written request to us at Capstone Financial Group, Inc., 2600 Michelson Dr., Suite 700, Irvine, CA 92612.  OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK  General Business Development  Capstone Financial Group, Inc. (the "Company") is a development stage company which was incorporated in the State of Nevada in July of 2012 as Creative App Solutions, Inc. We were formed to design and sell mobile apps for smart phones and other mobile platforms such as tablets.  In an effort to substantiate stockholder value, we re-assessed our business plan, and have aggressively been seeking out other business opportunities. We have been in preliminary discussions with a private company interested in a potential merger. As of the date of this filing, there have been no definitive agreements reached with this company. If and when we enter into a definitive agreement with any company, we will file a current report on Form 8-K.  On August 26, 2013, we changed our name from Creative App Solutions, Inc. to Capstone Financial Group, Inc. The amendment occurred as a result of our stockholders approving the amendment at the 2013 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and a subsequent vote by the Board of Directors. The Certificate of Amendment is filed as exhibit 3(i)(a) to the Form 8-K filed on August 29, 2013.  On September 6, 2013, we effectuated a 20 to 1 forward split of the Company's issued and unissued common stock as of September 23, 2013, the record date. Immediately after the forward split, the number of shares issued and outstanding increased to 90,200,000. The number of authorized shares increased from 100,000,000 to 2,000,000,000 common shares. The Certificate of Change is filed as exhibit 3(i)(c) to the Form 8-K filed on September 12, 2013.  Recent Change in Management  On August 6, 2013, the Board of Directors ("Board") appointed Darin Pastor to serve as a member of the Board.  On August 26, 2013, Ryan Faught submitted his letter of resignation from his position as President, CEO, Treasurer, and Director of the Company. The resignation was accepted by the Company on August 26, 2013.  On August 26, 2013, Matthew Lane submitted his letter of resignation from his position as Secretary of the Company. The resignation was accepted by the Company on August 26, 2013.  On August 26, 2013, in connection with resignations of Ryan Faught and Matthew Lane, the Board unanimously appointed Darin Pastor to serve as the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), Secretary, Treasurer, and Chairman of the Company.  On August 26, 2013, in connection with resignations of Ryan Faught and Matthew Lane, the Board unanimously appointed George Schneider to serve as the President, Chief Investment Officer ("CIO"), and a Director of the Company.  On September 25, 2013, the Board unanimously appointed Halford W. Johnson as Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") of the Company.  Change of Control  On September 6, 2013, Darin Pastor acquired control of the Company pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Pastor Agreement") entered into by Mr. Ryan Faught (the "Seller") and Mr. Darin Pastor (the "Purchaser"), providing for the purchase by Mr. Pastor from the Seller of 3,548,200 shares of Common Stock, par value $.001 (the "Common Stock"), representing 78.7% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company for a purchase price of $1,774.10.  Additionally, pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Agreement, dated September 6, 2013 (the "Schneider Agreement") entered into by Mr. Ryan Faught (the "Seller") and Mr. George Schneider (the "Purchaser"), providing for the purchase by Mr. Schneider from the Seller of 451,800 shares of Common Stock, par value $.001 (the "Common Stock"), representing 10% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company for a purchase price of $225.90.  Business Overview  Capstone Financial Group, Inc. ("Capstone" or the "Company") provides an array of products and services to a diverse group of clients and customers, including corporations, governments, financial institutions and individuals. Capstone's executive management team consists of leaders who have more than 100 collective years of experience in wealth management and investment banking, with a superior level understanding of clean technology and industrial growth, capital raising services concerning municipal government interests, and private placements and public offerings of corporate debt and corporate equity.  Capstone intends to develop divisions within the Company that will provide small and lower middle market businesses with opportunities for optimal financing, growth, mergers and acquisitions and increased market share. Some of the divisions may include an Investment Banking division, a Clean Technology and Industrial Growth Group. These added divisions will enable Capstone to better advise and assist current and potential corporate clients. As of the date of this filing, these divisions have not been created.  On August 26, 2013, we entered into an Assignment, Assumption and Consent Agreement with Darin Pastor, our chief executive officer, wherein Mr. Pastor assigned the rights and obligations of the Engagement Agreement dated July 29, 2013 with Instant BioScan, LLC, an Arizona limited liability company ("IBS"), in exchange for the Company assuming the obligations of performance under the terms and conditions of the Engagement Agreement. The term of the Engagement Agreement shall be for a period of 270 days from the date of July 29, 2013. Pursuant to the Engagement Agreement we will act in the capacity of an independent contractor, as a financial advisor, investment banker and capital markets agent, where appropriate, in connection with: 1) assisting IBS as it would concern: (a) the refinement of its business plan, (b) the selection, sizing and structure of certain capital market financing alternatives and the securities associated with such financing alternatives, (c) the pre-money estimated valuations of IBS associated with certain capital market financing, (d) the marketing strategy, accounting firm selection, legal counsel selection and investor communications associated with its contemplated project and/or corporate level capital funding, and: 2) the placement by IBS of certain short-term loans, short-term lines or letters of credit and/or other types of short-term credit facilities in the amount of up to approximately $1,350,000. During the three months ended September 30, 2013, we have recorded $121,627 in revenue related to financial services consulting and commissions pursuant to the assignment of the Engagement Agreement.  Going Concern  The Company's financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. As of September 30, 2013 the Company had an accumulated deficit of $107,147. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.  The Company is currently contemplating an offering of its equity or debt securities to finance continuing operations. There are no agreements or arrangements currently in place or under negotiation to obtain such financing, and there are no assurances that the Company will be successful and without sufficient financing it would be unlikely for the Company to continue as a going concern.  The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2013  In the three months ended September 30, 2013, we generated $121,627 in revenues.  Operating expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2013 were $70,325, $57,636 of which was professional fees associated with legal and accounting expenses and the remaining $12,689 was related to general and administrative costs. In comparison, operating expenses from inception (July 10, 2012) to September 30, 2012 were $11,397, of which $10,800 was in professional fees and the remaining $597 was related to general and administrative costs. The increase in professional fees is due to increased legal and accounting work.  Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2013  In the nine months ended September 30, 2013, we generated $121,627 in revenues.  Operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 were $180,854, $166,732 of which was professional fees associated with legal and accounting expenses and the remaining $14,122 was related to general and administrative costs. In comparison, operating expenses from inception (July 10, 2012) to September 30, 2012 were $11,397 of which $10,800 was in professional fees and the remaining $597 was related to general and administrative costs. The increase in professional fees is due to increased legal and accounting work.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of September 30, 2013, we had $ 45,566 in cash. Since inception, we have financed our cash flow requirements through issuance of common stock. As we expand our activities, we may, and most likely will, continue to experience net negative cash flows from operations.  In addition, we have secured a line of credit with E. Venture Resources, Inc., for up to $200,000. As of September 30, 2013, we have utilized $92,200 of the $200,000. The terms of the line of credit provide for an interest rate of 6% per annum with all accrued balances due and payable on July 16, 2015. On August 13, 2013, this liability was paid off by the Company. This line of credit is no longer available to the Company.  Additionally, Ryan Faught loaned $10,000 to the Company. During the three months ended September 30, 2013, Mr. Faught loaned an additional $3,500 to the Company with the same terms. The loan from Mr. Faught bears interest at 6% per annum and is due on July 13, 2015. On August 26, 2013, Mr. Faught forgave $13,500 in debt with the Company plus accrued interest of $702.  On August 8, 2013, we executed a revolving credit grid note with a related party for up to $500,000. As of September 30, 2013, we have utilized $154,442.75 of the $500,000. The terms of the revolving credit grid note provide for an interest rate of 2% per annum with all accrued balances due and payable on August 8, 2013.  On September 13, 2013, we executed a revolving credit grid note receivable with a related party for up to $500,000. As of September 30, 2013, we have utilized $370,000 of the $500,000. The terms of the revolving credit grid note provide for an interest rate of 2% per annum with all accrued balances due and payable on September 13, 2015. On September 13, 2013, we amended the revolving credit grid note to increase the principal amount from $500,000 to $2,000,000. In October 16, 2013, we utilized an additional $549,872.  In the future we anticipate obtaining additional financing to fund operations through common stock offerings, to the extent available, or to obtain additional financing to the extent necessary to augment our working capital.  Even though we have begun to generate revenues, we can make no assurances and therefore we may incur operating losses in the next twelve months. Our limited operating history makes predictions of future operating results difficult to ascertain. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development, particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets. Such risks for us include, but are not limited to, an evolving business model, advancement of technology and the management of growth. To address these risks, we must, among other things, continue our development of relevant applications, stay abreast of mobile app trends, as well as implement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing such risks, and the failure to do so can have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.  The following table summarizes total current assets, total current liabilities and working capital at September 30, 2013 compared to December 31, 2012.   Increase / (Decrease) September 30, December 2013 31, 2012 $ % Current Assets $ 45,566 $ 6,140 $ 39,426 642 % Current Liabilities $ 5,474 $ 300 $ 5,174 1,725 % Working Capital (deficit) $ 40,092 $ 5,840 $ 34,252 587 %  Liquidity is a measure of a company's ability to meet potential cash requirements. We have historically met our capital requirements through the issuance of stock and by borrowings. In the future, we anticipate we will be able to provide the necessary liquidity needed from the revenues generated from operations but there is no assurance that this will happen.  Since inception, we have financed our cash flow requirements through issuance of common stock, and lines of credit. As we expand our activities, we may, and most likely will, continue to experience net negative cash flows from operations. Additionally we anticipate obtaining additional financing to fund operations through additional common stock offerings, to the extent available, or to obtain additional financing to the extent necessary to augment our working capital.  We anticipate that we will incur operating losses in the next twelve months. Our lack of operating history makes predictions of future operating results difficult to ascertain. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development, particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets. Such risks for us include, but are not limited to, an evolving and unpredictable business model and the management of growth. To address these risks, we must, among other things, develop a customer base, develop our marketing strategy, continually develop and upgrade our website, provide, respond to competitive developments, and attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing such risks, and the failure to do so can have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.  Operating activities  Net cash used in operating activities was $57,517 for the period ended September 30, 2013, as compared to $10,597 used in operating activities from inception (July 10, 2012) to September 30, 2012. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to an increase in professional fees, as a result of increased legal work.  Investing activities  Net cash used in investing activities was $370,000 for the period ended September 30, 2013 as compared to $0 used in investing activities from inception (July 10, 2012) to September 30, 2012. The increase is related to the revolving line of credit receivable with a related party.  Financing activities  Net cash provided by financing activities for the period ended September 30, 2013 was $466,943, as compared to $14,000 from inception (July 10, 2012) to September 30, 2012. The increase of net cash provided by financing activities was mainly attributable to capital raised through the sale of common stock and capital provided through a newly executed revolving credit grid note. There was a decrease due to the repayment of the revolving line of credit.  On July 12, 2012, the Company executed a promissory note with Ryan Faught. The unsecured loan is due upon on July 13, 2015 and bears interest at 6%. As of September 30, 2013, we have utilized $10,000 of the $10,000. During the three months ended September 30, 2013, Mr. Faught loaned an additional $3,500 with the same terms. On August 26, 2013, Mr. Faught forgave $13,500 in debt with the Company and accrued interest of $702.  On August 8, 2013, the Company executed a revolving credit grid note with a related party for up to $500,000. The unsecured line of credit bears interest at 2% per annum with principal and interest due on August 8, 2016. As of September 30, 2013, an amount of $154,442.75 has been used for general corporate purposes with a remaining balance of $345,557.25 available. As of September 30, 2013, the balance of accrued interest was $358.  On September 13, 2013, the Company executed a revolving credit grid note receivable with a related party for up to $500,000. The unsecured line of credit bears interest at 2% per annum with principal and interest due on September 13, 2015. As of September 30, 2013, an amount of $370,000 was loaned to the related party with a remaining balance of $130,000 available. As of September 30, 2013, the balance of accrued interest receivable was $264. During October 2013, the Company amended the revolving grid note to increase the credit limit to $2,000,000 and loaned an additional $548,912 to a related party.  We believe that cash flow from operations will not meet our present and near-term cash needs and thus we will require additional cash resources, including the sale of equity or debt securities, to meet our planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the next 12 months. We will require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions, finalization and launch of our website, implementation of our strategy to expand our sales and marketing initiatives, increase brand and services awareness. If our own financial resources and then current cash-flows from operations are insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities. The sale of additional equity securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness will result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that could restrict our operations or modify our plans to grow the business. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us, or at all, will limit our ability to expand our business operations and could harm our overall business prospects.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price.
