History[edit]
Early years[edit]
Hard Drives International was founded in 1988 by Eric and Tim Crown. Initially a mail order business selling computer storage, the company expanded into a storefront when credit card companies wouldn't service startup mail order firms. In 1991, the company changed its name to Insight Enterprises, and distribution included a full line of computers and accessories.[5] The company held its initial public offering in January 1995.[6][7]
Insight became an international company when it acquired TC Computers, based in Montreal, Canada, in 1997. In April 1998, Insight signed an agreement to acquire Choice Peripherals Ltd. and Plusnet Technologies Ltd., an Internet service provider and website hosting and development company operating as Force 9.[8] The acquisition expanded Insight's operations to Europe.[5]
2000-2010[edit]
Insight acquired Action Computer Supplies Holdings PLC, a U.K.-based direct marketer, in October 2001 for approximately $150 million in stock.[9][10] In April 2002, the company acquired Comark for $150 million, increasing Insight's ability to work with clients of all sizes, including the public sector.[9]
In July 2006, Insight entered an agreement to purchase Software Spectrum, a company that focused on software and mobility products for medium and large companies, from Level 3 Communications for $287 million.[11]
Calence LLC, a technology company that focused on Cisco networking and advanced communications, was acquired by Insight in April 2008 for $125 million.[12] Insight acquired U.K.-based Minx Ltd., a European network integrator with Cisco Gold Partner accreditation, in July 2008 for $1.5 million and the assumption of $4.6 million of existing debt.[13][14]
2011-present[edit]
Ensynch, an information technology company founded in 2000, was acquired by Insight in September 2011.[15][16] Insight acquired Inmac Gmbh, a business-to-business hardware reseller based in Germany, in February 2012.[17]
In June 2015, Insight underwent a corporate rebranding which aimed to emphasize the company focus on customer relations and interaction.[2][18] The company launched a new website in July 2015 as part of the shift in company focus.[18] In October 2015, Insight acquired BlueMetal, an interactive design and technology architecture firm based in Boston.[19] Also in 2015, Insight raised $200,000 in its annual campaign for its Noble Cause division. Through Noble Cause, Insight gives to local charities including the Make-a-Wish Foundation, the Boys & Girls Clubs of America and the Ronald McDonald House.[20] In 2016, BlueMetal partnered with INDYCAR, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Microsoft to produce an analytics focused app during the Indianapolis 500.[21] Insight opened an additional sales center at the Meadows Office and Technological Park in Conway, Arkansas in August 2016.[22] Insight announced the acquisition of Ignia, an Australian-based business technology consulting company, in September 2016.[23]
On November 7, 2016 Insight Enterprises announced that they were acquiring the Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based data storage company, Datalink for $11.25 per share in cash, but that the company would remain mostly the same.[24] The $258 million deal closed in the first quarter of 2017 and allowed Insight Enterprises to enhance its data center services.[25][26]
Awards[edit]
In 2013, Insight received the Transformational Licensing Solution Partner of the Year award from Microsoft.[27] Company founders Eric and Tim Crown were awarded the OneNeck IT Services People's Choice Lifetime Achievement Award from Avnet Inc. at the November 2013 Arizona Governor's Celebration of Innovation Awards.[28] The company was featured on the InformationWeek 500 list in 2013[29] and received the Cisco Global Architectural Excellence-Enterprise Networks Award in 2014.
Insight was featured on the Fortune 500 list for its seventh year in 2015.[3] That year it was also recognized as Dell's National Solution Providers of the Year.[30]

We help businesses manage today and transform tomorrow




























You’ve seen a glimpse into who we are. Find out how we got here and how we’re committed to helping you.















"When I look back at the business, the numbers change, a lot of the tactics change, and the products and services change — and the solutions change. But for me, it’s really about the culture and the people."
Tim Crown





Our story began with a college business plan.
Many great entrepreneurial tales start with two innovators inspired by an initial idea. In 1988, Tim and Eric Crown began their story in this fashion. With a business plan that took root in a college assignment and a cash advance from a credit card, they established Hard Drives International — the company that would become Insight.












Today, we're a global company.
Shaped by the evolution in IT, Insight is now a leading provider of Intelligent Technology Solutions™, helping companies around the world implement innovation and improve business performance.

We deliver expertise.
You need answers more than you need equipment. We provide a team with the experience, intelligence and right IT solutions to help you make strategic business decisions. So you can scale faster, optimize your investments and reach your goals.



"Vendors were starting to work together … and they were going to co-support a solution. And that perfectly fit in with what we had hoped for. But we didn’t know there was a solution out there for it."
 Rob LloydChief Information Officer, City of Avondale, Arizona







We integrate confidence.
Trust and confidence are foundational to your IT strategy. To be up-to-date, up-to-speed and fully informed, you need a team that’s collaborative to the core — keeping you efficient and on track to meet your goals.



"Insight worked with the vendors and engineers to make sure all these applications or different systems worked flawlessly. They are very there for us."
 Wally McMullenIS Project Manager, University Health System, San Antonio, Texas







We connect the world.
Our connections make us stronger. With partnerships, people, services and delivery, we’ll help you improve performance and amplify the impact of Intelligent Technology Solutions in your environment. Our commitment is to help your business run smarter.



"Our relationship with Insight is not just that of a client-vendor relationship; it’s a partnership."
 Larry BonfanteChief Information Officer, United States Tennis Association

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
