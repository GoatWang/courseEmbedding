Science Behind the Tests 
Read more about About Natera








A personal story from our CEO



"I first became involved in this field after my sister had a child with Down syndrome. We didn’t know about the child’s condition before the birth, and due to medical complications related to the syndrome, the child passed away a few days later. If we had only known beforehand and had a specialist available, I believe the child’s life could have been saved.
This was a tragic experience for the entire family, and I simply could not believe that in this day-and-age – with all the technology we have at our disposal – we didn’t know about the child’s health earlier.
I founded Natera determined to fulfill a promise to provide parents with the most accurate information possible – as early as possible – about their child’s health, so they can have the chance to provide him or her with the best care possible."
Matthew Rabinowitz, Natera CEO and Founder

Why Genetic Testing?



Impacting millions of lives
Every individual has a unique genome, and we believe that comprehensive knowledge of this genetic makeup is becoming integral to the practice of medicine. The ability to identify the presence of diseases early, accurately, and non-invasively has the potential to impact the lives of millions of patients and save billions of dollars in healthcare costs.
The rapid expansion of next-generation DNA sequencing has unlocked a wealth of information about the role of genomics in disease, and is enabling a new class of tests that improve patient care, particularly in prenatal care and oncology. As the scientific and medical community’s understanding of genetic disease accelerates, Natera believes technologies that enable precise and efficient measurement of mutated fragments of DNA are well positioned to translate this information into health information that improves patient care.

matthew-rabinowitz-Natera_5.png

 

Matthew Rabinowitz, Ph.D.
Chief Executive Officer
Dr. Matthew Rabinowitz has had dual careers in industry and academia. While completing his dissertation, Dr. Rabinowitz co-founded an intelligent online merchandizing company, Panop.com, which later sold for $100M. Shortly after, Dr. Rabinowitz started his second company, Rosum, which developed a location technology using TV signals to augment GPS. He received the World Economic Forum “Technology Pioneers” award for founding Rosum and Natera.
In 2003, Dr. Rabinowitz’s life took a turn; a family member had a child born with a genetic disease, and the child passed away in infancy. Dr. Rabinowitz experienced firsthand the trauma, stress, and devastation that an unexpected diagnosis of genetic disease can bring to a family and was moved to action.
Drawing on expertise from his seemingly unrelated background, Dr. Rabinowitz embarked on a journey to ensure that other families need not experience similar pain. Through a team of experts in medicine, engineering, statistics, and genetics, along with Dr. Rabinowitz's own skills in optimization, signal processing, informatics, and entrepreneurship – Natera was born. Natera’s results have been remarkable; Dr. Rabinowitz and the entire Natera team are dedicated to bringing breakthrough technology to all.
Dr. Rabinowitz is now an authority in the field of prenatal and preconception informatics-based genetic testing. He has served as the Principal Investigator on six research grants awarded by the National Institutes of Health. Multiple publications have emerged in leading journals including Bioinformatics, Human Reproduction, and Molecular Human Reproduction. He actively presents at medical conferences around the world, including at the annual meeting of the American College of Medical Genetics, American Society of Reproductive Medicine, and Fetal Medicine Foundation World Congress.
Dr. Rabinowitz is a board member, advisor, and angel investor for multiple companies in biotechnology, communications, cleantech and healthcare. He has received the Scott Helt Memorial Award from IEEE and was selected by MIT Technology Review Magazine as one of the top 35 technology innovators under 35 in the United States.
Dr. Rabinowitz completed his B.A., M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees at Stanford University, receiving both the Levin and Terman Awards — the highest academic honors offered in engineering and physics — and a graduate fellowship to the school of engineering.

Natera, Inc. Announces Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017; Revises Earnings Guidance for the Year 2017
May 9 17
Natera, Inc. reported unaudited consolidated earnings results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. The company reported total revenues were $46.9 million compared to $61.9 million for the first quarter of 2016, a decrease of 24%, driven primarily by the company's transition to in-network contracts with payers, which reduced the average selling price of tests. Loss from operations for the first quarter of 2017 was $37.0 million compared to loss from operations of $9.6 million for the same period of the prior year. Net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $36.0 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $8.7 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, for the same period in 2016. Loss before income taxes was $35,914,000 compared to $8,685,000 a year ago.

The company anticipates 2017 total revenues of $210 million to $230 million and net cash burn to be $65 million to $75 million. This forecast improves the company's previously provided financial outlook by reducing cash burn expectations by $10 million. GAAP net cash used by operating activities estimated for 2017 to be between $605 million and $705 million and GAAP net purchases of property and equipment estimated for 2017 to be approximately $5 million.

					Full Description



Natera, Inc., incorporated on January 26, 2007, is a diagnostics company. The Company is engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of genetic testing services. The Company operates a laboratory certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) providing a host of preconception and prenatal genetic testing services.The Company's product offerings include its Panorama Non-Invasive Prenatal Test (NIPT) that screens for chromosomal abnormalities of a fetus with a blood draw from the mother; Horizon Carrier Screening (Horizon) to determine carrier status for a large number of severe genetic diseases that could be passed on to the carrier's children; Spectrum Pre-implantation Genetic Screening (PGS) and Spectrum Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) to analyze chromosomal anomalies or inherited genetic conditions during an in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle to select embryos with the probability of becoming healthy children; Anora Products of Conception (POC) test to analyze fetal chromosomes to understand the cause of miscarriage, and Non-Invasive Paternity Testing (PAT), to determine paternity by analyzing the fragments of fetal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in a pregnant mother's blood and a blood sample from the alleged father(s). All testing is available principally in the United States and Europe. The Company also offers Constellation, a cloud-based software product that involves analysis of copy number variations (CNVs) and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in a DNA mixture. It allows laboratory customers to gain access through the cloud to the Company's algorithms and bioinformatics in order to validate and launch tests based on the Company's technology.The Company's technologies allow achieving a high signal to noise ratio when detecting fragments of DNA from samples as small as a single cell, which allows it to deliver screening tests with differentiated specificity, sensitivity and coverage. The Company's commercial tests assess the risk of a range of conditions, from a single blood draw, including common fetal aneuploidies, microdeletions, triploidy and inherited genetic conditions that could be passed on from parent to child. The Company sells its tests directly and partners with other clinical laboratories to distribute its tests globally. All of its products other than its Constellation cloud software product are laboratory developed tests (LDTs). Its multiplexed polymerase chain reaction (mmPCR) technology optimizes the behavior of primers in a reaction to generate a high-resolution measurement of thousands of DNA loci in patient samples. As a result, it can capture mutations from a single DNA fragment within a large background of extraneous DNA found in a patient's blood sample. The Company uses statistical techniques to combine the measurements of its molecular assays with its internal databases and the sources of publicly available genomic information to build detailed models of the genome of interest. This process includes the use of a statistical technique known as maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which is used in other industries, such as in the conversion of a noisy transmitted analog communications signal to a digital format. Panorama helps physicians assess fetal genetic abnormalities by non-invasive screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities, including Down syndrome, Edwards syndrome, Patau syndrome, Turner syndrome and triploidy, which result in intellectual disability, severe organ abnormalities and death of the fetus. Panorama can also identify fetal sex. Panorama is performed on a maternal blood sample, and can be performed as early as nine weeks into a pregnancy. Panorama starts with a simple blood draw from the mother, either in a doctor's office, in a laboratory or through a phlebotomist that may travel to the patient.The Company extracts DNA from each sample, amplifies the specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that it is interested in measuring and then sequences the DNA using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Using its bioinformatics technology, the Company analyzes the DNA sequences to assess the state of the fetal genome, focusing on the SNP data, while incorporating public information from the Human Genome Project. Its bioinformatics algorithm builds billions of detailed models of the genetic state of the sample to determine the diagnosis. After Panorama generates its result, it provides the doctor or the laboratory with a report showing the risk that abnormalities are present in the fetus. Its Panorama microdeletions panel screens for five of the common genetic diseases caused by microdeletions: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (Di George syndrome), 1p36 deletion, Angelman syndrome, Cri-du-chat syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome.The Company's PGS test screens embryos for chromosomal abnormalities prior to transfer of embryos created through IVF procedures, which have non-viable chromosomal abnormalities. This allows IVF physicians to select and transfer embryos with normal chromosome results and combines it with single embryo transfer. Its PGD test screens embryos for couples who are concerned about passing on a specific genetic defect to their child. Anora is its POC product, which tests miscarriage tissue in women who have experienced one or more miscarriages to determine whether there was an underlying genetic reason for the miscarriage(s). Its non-invasive prenatal paternity product allows a couple to establish paternity without waiting for the child to be born.The Company competes with Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, Illumina, F.

SAN CARLOS, Calif., May 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Natera (NASDAQ:   NTRA), a leader in genetic testing, announced the launch of Vistara, a non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT) to screen single-gene disorders. Vistara is a complement to Natera's market-leading Panorama® non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT) and screens for new mutations in 30 genes that have a combined incidence rate of nearly 1 in 600, which is higher than that of Down syndrome.1, 2 These mutations can cause severe conditions that affect skeletal, cardiac, and neurological systems, and often go undetected with routine prenatal screening. Natera will offer Vistara through its leading direct sales channel in the United States. 








Natera has partnered with Baylor Genetics to commercialize Vistara and is initially launching the test to Maternal Fetal Medicine specialists (MFMs) at leading clinics throughout the U.S., and broadly to Obstetrician-Gynecologists (OBGYNs) at a later date, after market education and support. Vistara expands Natera's existing portfolio of women's reproductive health products and will also be well positioned to immediately take advantage of Natera's well-established commercial capabilities, including patient and healthcare provider digital services through Natera's Patient Portal and Natera Connect, and a specialized salesforce that already calls on the nation's busiest MFMs and OBGYNs. 
"Screening for single-gene disorders early in pregnancy can be extremely helpful and is an important next step in the ability to screen for fetuses with major anatomic abnormalities and chromosome imbalances," said Dr. Brian Krishon, a Maternal Fetal Medicine specialist at Houston Perinatal Associates. "As just one example, prenatal screening with confirmatory diagnostic testing for osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) can result in reduced bone fractures through adjusted delivery and post-natal management." 
"This is a paradigm shift in prenatal screening. This technology screens for new mutations that are common and cannot be detected by standard carrier screening, as these mutations are not present on the parents," said Matt Rabinowitz, CEO and founder of Natera. "Our expansion into screening for single-gene mutations builds on the success of Panorama, the market-leading NIPT for common trisomies and microdeletions, and furthers Natera's mission to transform the diagnosis and management of genetic diseases."  
Addressing an Unmet Clinical NeedVistara screens for common single-gene disorders such as Noonan syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, craniosynostosis syndromes, achondroplasia, and Rett syndrome. Noonan syndrome, for example, has non-specific ultrasound findings and may not be detected prenatally without single-gene testing. Noonan syndrome is characterized by short stature, cardiac defects, bleeding problems and mild intellectual disabilities in some cases. It affects 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 2,500 births. 
The incidence of the diseases screened by Vistara is higher than that of cystic fibrosis, which is commonly screened by OBGYNs and is well reimbursed. In addition, these conditions are not screened with existing NIPTs. Ultrasound exams may either completely miss these disorders or identify non-specific findings late (2nd or 3rd trimester) in the pregnancy. Further, family history is not a good indicator of risk for these conditions, which are commonly caused by de novo (not inherited) mutations. Vistara has a combined analytical sensitivity of >99% and a combined analytical specificity of >99% in validation studies.3 Given the combined high incidence of these disorders, Vistara may be used to screen all singleton pregnancies after nine weeks gestation.4 A positive screen result from Vistara will direct the clinician to order the appropriate diagnostic tests, and upon confirmation, guide labor and delivery management, and channel patients to necessary specialists. 
About NateraNatera is a genetic testing company that develops and commercializes non-invasive methods for analyzing DNA. The mission of the company is to transform the diagnosis and management of genetic disease. In pursuit of that mission, Natera operates a CAP-accredited laboratory certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) in San Carlos, CA, and it currently offers a host of proprietary genetic testing services primarily to OB/GYN physicians and fertility centers, as well as to genetic laboratories through its cloud-based Constellation™ software system. 
Product offerings include the Spectrum® pre-implantation genetic test for embryo selection during IVF; the Anora® miscarriage test to understand the genetic causes of a pregnancy loss; the Horizon™ carrier screen  to detect inherited mutations; the Panorama® non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT) to screen for common chromosomal anomalies in a fetus as early as nine weeks of gestation; the Vistara NIPT to screen for single-gene disorders and Evercord™, a cord blood and tissue banking service offered at birth to expectant parents.
Each test described has been developed and its performance characteristics determined by the CLIA-certified laboratory performing the test. 
These tests have not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Although FDA does not currently clear or approve laboratory-developed tests in the U.S., certification of the laboratory is required under CLIA to ensure the quality and validity of the tests.  Natera is also applying its unique technologies to develop non-invasive screening and diagnostic tools for earlier detection and improved treatment of cancer. These tests have not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

SAN CARLOS, Calif., March 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --Natera (NASDAQ:   NTRA), a leader in genetic testing, today announced the upcoming launch of Evercord; a new offering being made commercially available in the second quarter of 2017 that enables expectant parents to collect, store and potentially retrieve their newborn's cord blood and tissue for therapeutic use in transplantation and regenerative medicine applications. Natera aspires to build a different type of national cord blood company, by combining best-in-class cord blood cryopreservation with the company's ability to provide timely information about genetic disease risk; potentially expanding families' stem cell treatment options in the future.   Natera will offer Evercord through its leading direct sales channel in the United States. 








The Market Potential of Cord Blood Stem Cells Newborn stem cells sourced from umbilical cord blood are known to contain hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that can potentially differentiate and regenerate healthy blood and immune systems. Unfortunately, out of the roughly four million births each year in the United States, more than 95% of the cord blood from those births is currently discarded as waste;1 highlighting a significant opportunity both for families who could benefit from cord blood, and for Natera, as it enters the cord blood and tissue banking market. Published data also suggests that one in three people in the United States, or 128 million people, could potentially benefit from regenerative medicine applications which, if proven effective, expands the possible therapeutic use of cord blood stem cells.2 More than 300 studies are currently underway, including clinical trials focused on current and new cord blood stem cell therapies in regenerative medicine.3  These trials hold promise for a growing list of conditions, including Alzheimers disease, cerebral palsy, diabetes (Type I/II), spinal cord injury, cartilage and bone repair, and heart defects. More than 30,000 cord blood stem cell treatments have been conducted worldwide and Natera's prenatal tests, including its carrier test, Horizon™, currently screen for 35 of the nearly 80 diseases where cord blood stem cell treatment has been administered. Considering the research advances in stem cells and regenerative medicine, it is anticipated that number will, more than likely, continue to grow.
Introducing EvercordThe launch of Evercord is part of a partnership with Bloodworks Northwest, one of the oldest and most reputable public umbilical cord blood banks in the country. Evercord's service will offer expectant families the opportunity to bank their baby's umbilical cord blood and tissue for potential medical use by the child or related family member. Under the terms of the agreement between Natera and Bloodworks, Bloodworks will perform processing and testing services on cord blood samples submitted by Evercord customers and will cryo-preserve the banked cord blood and tissue at its Seattle, Washington-based best-in-class cord blood cryopreservation storage facility. The companies also plan to build a new facility in anticipation of future growth.   
The relationship offers several other competitive advantages. Evercord leverages Bloodworks' 20 years of experience processing and banking cord blood; the lab has a strong track record of successfully releasing nearly 1,000 cord blood samples for transplant, more than other leading private cord blood banks. 
Once Evercord is commercially launched, it will expand Natera's existing portfolio of women's reproductive health products, further diversifying Natera's revenue base and adding a traditionally high yield business into its product mix.  Evercord will also be well positioned to immediately take advantage of Natera's well-established commercial capabilities, including: patient and healthcare provider digital services through Natera's Patient Portal and Natera Connect, and a specialized salesforce that already calls on the nation's busiest obstetrics and gynecology offices and fertility centers. 
"At Natera, we believe adding cord blood and tissue banking to our product offerings is a natural extension of our commitment to family health and beyond," said Matt Rabinowitz, CEO and founder of Natera. "Evercord builds on our excellence as a genetic testing company and our mission to transform the diagnosis and management of genetic diseases. Cord blood stem cells have demonstrated regenerative capabilities that medicine is just beginning to learn how to harness; offering a unique opportunity to potentially generate complete genetic information on a human being at the moment of birth. Many of the genetic diseases that cord blood treats today are also conditions that our tests screen for, which could enable us to offer a far more extensive service offering in the future than those offered by leading 'storage-only' cord blood banks today." 
About Bloodworks Northwest's Public Cord Blood ProgramBloodworks Northwest partners with hospitals across the region to recover and store umbilical cord blood from new mothers -- an important source of stem cells for use in cancer treatment, metabolic or immune system disorders, and research. Bloodworks Northwest created the first and only public umbilical cord blood bank in the Northwest of the United States and has program partnerships with 15 hospitals across Washington, Oregon and Hawaii – providing nearly 50 units per month to the national cord blood registry.
About NateraNatera is a genetic testing company that develops and commercializes non-invasive methods for analyzing DNA. The mission of the company is to transform the diagnosis and management of genetic disease. In pursuit of that mission, Natera operates a CAP-accredited laboratory certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) in San Carlos, CA, and it currently offers a host of proprietary genetic testing services primarily to OB/GYN physicians and fertility centers, as well as to genetic laboratories through its cloud-based Constellation™ software system. 
Product offerings include the Spectrum® pre-implantation genetic test for embryo selection during IVF; the Anora® miscarriage test to understand the genetic causes of a pregnancy loss; the Horizon™ carrier test to detect inherited mutations; the Panorama® non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT) to identify common chromosomal anomalies in a fetus as early as nine weeks of gestation; and Evercord™, a cord blood and tissue banking service offered at birth to expectant parents.
Each test described has been developed and its performance characteristics determined by the CLIA-certified laboratory performing the test. 
These tests have not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Although FDA does not currently clear or approve laboratory-developed tests in the U.S., certification of the laboratory is required under CLIA to ensure the quality and validity of the tests.  
Natera is also applying its unique technologies to develop non-invasive screening and diagnostic tools for earlier detection and improved treatment of cancer. These tests have not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Announces Launch of Vistara Single-Gene Mutation NIPTPR NewswireMay 8, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareSAN CARLOS, Calif., May 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Natera (NTRA), a leader in genetic testing, announced the launch of Vistara, a non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT) to screen single-gene disorders. Vistara is a complement to Natera's market-leading Panorama® non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT) and screens for new mutations in 30 genes that have a combined incidence rate of nearly 1 in 600, which is higher than that of Down syndrome.1, 2 These mutations can cause severe conditions that affect skeletal, cardiac, and neurological systems, and often go undetected with routine prenatal screening. Natera will offer Vistara through its leading direct sales channel in the United States.Natera, Inc. Logo MoreNatera has partnered with Baylor Genetics to commercialize Vistara and is initially launching the test to Maternal Fetal Medicine specialists (MFMs) at leading clinics throughout the U.S., and broadly to Obstetrician-Gynecologists (OBGYNs) at a later date, after market education and support. Vistara expands Natera's existing portfolio of women's reproductive health products and will also be well positioned to immediately take advantage of Natera's well-established commercial capabilities, including patient and healthcare provider digital services through Natera's Patient Portal and Natera Connect, and a specialized salesforce that already calls on the nation's busiest MFMs and OBGYNs."Screening for single-gene disorders early in pregnancy can be extremely helpful and is an important next step in the ability to screen for fetuses with major anatomic abnormalities and chromosome imbalances," said Dr. Brian Krishon, a Maternal Fetal Medicine specialist at Houston Perinatal Associates. "As just one example, prenatal screening with confirmatory diagnostic testing for osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) can result in reduced bone fractures through adjusted delivery and post-natal management.""This is a paradigm shift in prenatal screening. This technology screens for new mutations that are common and cannot be detected by standard carrier screening, as these mutations are not present on the parents," said Matt Rabinowitz, CEO and founder of Natera. "Our expansion into screening for single-gene mutations builds on the success of Panorama, the market-leading NIPT for common trisomies and microdeletions, and furthers Natera's mission to transform the diagnosis and management of genetic diseases." Addressing an Unmet Clinical NeedVistara screens for common single-gene disorders such as Noonan syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, craniosynostosis syndromes, achondroplasia, and Rett syndrome. Noonan syndrome, for example, has non-specific ultrasound findings and may not be detected prenatally without single-gene testing. Noonan syndrome is characterized by short stature, cardiac defects, bleeding problems and mild intellectual disabilities in some cases. It affects 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 2,500 births.The incidence of the diseases screened by Vistara is higher than that of cystic fibrosis, which is commonly screened by OBGYNs and is well reimbursed. In addition, these conditions are not screened with existing NIPTs. Ultrasound exams may either completely miss these disorders or identify non-specific findings late (2nd or 3rd trimester) in the pregnancy. Further, family history is not a good indicator of risk for these conditions, which are commonly caused by de novo (not inherited) mutations. Vistara has a combined analytical sensitivity of >99% and a combined analytical specificity of >99% in validation studies.3 Given the combined high incidence of these disorders, Vistara may be used to screen all singleton pregnancies after nine weeks gestation.4 A positive screen result from Vistara will direct the clinician to order the appropriate diagnostic tests, and upon confirmation, guide labor and delivery management, and channel patients to necessary specialists.Read MoreAbout NateraNatera is a genetic testing company that develops and commercializes non-invasive methods for analyzing DNA.
