“Instead of upgrading a twenty year old absorption chiller in a fortyone year old building, we decided to let American DG Energy install a new natural gas fired chiller that we wouldn't have to buy or maintain.”
Executive DirectorMulti-Family Apartment Complex 

 Chiller Cooling Systems 


American DG Energy offers several natural gas chiller system options in the size range from 50 to 1,200 tons. Unlike conventional chiller systems, which use an electric motor to power a compressor driven chiller, a natural gas engine driven chiller uses an internal combustion engine to power a similar compressor in a refrigeration loop. This simple change in how the chiller cooling system is powered creates high efficiency along with heat recovery opportunities for the natural gas engine driven chiller system. Plus, it reduces demand on the grid which can help alleviate high summer electric costs, seasonal blackouts and electricity shortages, which are primarily caused by electric chillers.
While absorption chiller cooling systems also use natural gas, their efficiency and performance have been disappointing relative to engine driven chiller systems. Although a compressor driven chiller is a very efficient system for cooling a building, using a natural gas engine to drive the compressor makes it even more efficient – 2.5 times more efficient than the most efficient absorption chiller. As a result, a natural gas engine driven chiller cooling system provides greater comfort and savings.
Benefits of Engine Driven Chillers
There are several benefits to implementing natural gas engine driven chillers versus absorption chillers or electric chillers, including efficiency, system footprint and the use of natural gas fuel.
The primary benefit of a natural gas engine driven chiller is its high efficiency. As an example, a 200 ton system has a COP of 2.6, which is significantly more efficient than most absorption and electric based chillers on the market. And, certainly is much more efficient than your current system.
A natural gas engine driven chiller cooling system provides superior efficiency due to its the heat recovery capability. The heat from the engine which powers the compressor can be captured through a heat recovery system and then utilized within the building for various applications. The recovered heat can be used to heat domestic hot water, laundry hot water or to provide heat for swimming pools and spas.
Taking advantage of the heat recovery capability of a natural gas engine driven chiller provides significant fuel efficiency resulting in lower energy costs, reduced operating costs and reduced carbon emissions. Additional benefits, if converting from an electric chiller, include avoidance of on-peak electric demand charges and time of day rates.
Another benefit of a natural gas engine driven chiller is its compact size. An engine driven chiller is smaller than your absorption system and has the same footprint as your electric chiller. Replacing your existing system won’t require additional square footage.
In addition, a natural gas chiller cooling system can continue to operate during blackouts and brownouts throughout an emergency. Loss of power will not prevent the natural gas chiller from running. Though you still require some electricity to run pumps and fans, the amount of back-up power required is dramatically less than with other cooling systems.
Finally, our natural gas chiller cooling systems can also be modified to supply ice for rinks or process applications.
Chiller System Installation
Chiller system installation costs are not insignificant. Once the system is in place, the property owner is responsible for its operation and maintenance, requiring either internal man-hours or a third party service contract. For businesses with limited budgets and competing capital improvement projects, obtaining the cash or financing for a turnkey installation of a natural gas chiller cooling system can be difficult. In most cases On-Site UtilityTM is the best option.

Outdoor installation of a CHP system 

Read the “Doral Arrowwood” case study to learn how a resort and conference center reduced energy waste and increased efficiency while conserving capital.Learn more about the benefits of On-Site UtilityTM solutions.View our Greenhouse Gas Reduction Certificate from the EPA. 


“With American DG Energy's On-Site Utility, we're saving 15% on our electricity costs. It adds up to thousands of dollars in savings annually.”
Property ManagerMulti-Family Housing Facility 

 Combined Heat and Power 


Combined heat and power (CHP), also known as cogeneration or distributed generation, is the simultaneous production of two types of energy – heat and electricity – from one fuel source, often natural gas or propane. The ability to create two forms of energy from a single source offers tremendous efficiency and thus both cost savings and environmental benefits.
The key components of a CHP system are an internal combustion, reciprocating engine driving an electric generator. The clean natural gas fired engine spins a generator to produce electricity. The natural by-product of the working engine is heat which is captured and used to supply space heating, heating domestic hot water, laundry hot water or to provide heat for swimming pools and spas. The CHP process is very similar to an automobile, where the engine provides the power to rotate the wheels and the by-product heat is used to keep the passengers warm in the cabin during the winter months.
Efficiency of CHP Systems
Combined heat and power systems use fuel very efficiently. A CHP system provides electricity and heat at a combined efficiency approaching 90%. This is a significant improvement over the combination of the 35% efficient electric utility and a conventional heating boiler with a 65% seasonal efficiency.
Why is there such a big difference in fuel efficiency between the electric utility and a combined heat and power system? The electric utility and CHP system each produce electricity and heat from one source of fuel. However, the heat produced at the electric utility is not used; it goes into the cooling water or up the smokestack along with greenhouse gases and other pollutants. Approximately two-thirds of the fuel’s energy is wasted. Alternatively, while generating electricity, a properly sized combined heat and power system recovers nearly all of the heat it produces and deploys it on site.
Additionally, when purchasing power from the electric utility, a separate source of heat, usually a boiler, is required. Despite using an efficient boiler, the total fuel required to produce conventional electricity and boiler heat is greater than the amount of fuel required to produce simultaneous energy with a combined heat and power system. This demonstrates why CHP-produced energy is more cost effective than the combined energies from the electric utility and local boilers.
Combined heat and power (CHP) technology has been around for over 100 years going back to the days of Thomas Edison. In 1882, the first commercial CHP plant was opened utilizing a single fuel to produce both heat and electricity. With an executive order signed by President Obama calling for 40 GW of new CHP by 2020, representing a 50 percent increase from 2012, CHP is gaining renewed emphasis.    
Benefits of Combined Heat and Power
Because of the high efficiency of the system, CHP provides considerable energy, environmental and economic benefits. CHP systems reduce the demand on the utility grid, increase energy efficiency, reduce air pollution, lower greenhouse gas emissions and protect your property against power outages, while significantly lowering the utility costs of building operations.
Installation and Operation
Installing a combined heat and power system requires capital and experience.  System installations require properly skilled and experienced system engineering, project management, electrical and mechanical work performed. Once the system is in place, continuous operation and maintenance are necessary to optimize performance.   For businesses with a stretched budget and competing capital improvement projects, finding the cash and expertise for turnkey installation of a CHP system presents a challenge. In most cases, an On-Site Utility is the best option.

 Clean Energy Technology 


American DG Energy offers a variety of clean energy technologies, including combined heat and power (CHP), also known as cogeneration, chillers, heat pumps and boilers to provide energy costs savings along with environmental and economic benefits to our customers, all without any impact on your capital budget. American DG Energy has been recognized by the US Environmental Protection Agency for its carbon reduction efforts. These carbon offsets can earn carbon credits, which are monetized in some markets. 
Our key benefits consist of:

Lower energy costs
Capital avoidance
No responsibility
Green energy

Research indicates that customers prefer businesses that don’t just “talk green,” but show real commitment to environmental sustainability in their daily operations. This increasingly sophisticated and demanding marketplace dictates that property owners and managers find effective and efficient energy solutions to stay competitive not only on their balance sheets, but also in the minds of their customers.  
Combined heat and power (CHP)
The highly efficient combined heat and power (CHP), also called cogeneration systems deployed by American DG Energy will significantly lower your electric and hot water costs by $10,000s to $100,000s and reduce your carbon emissions by nearly 50%, offsetting nearly 18,000 tons of carbon dioxide for a 300-room apartment building, hotel, or healthcare facility (approximately 250 KW) over the course of our typical agreement.  This is the equivalent to removing 3,438 vehicles from the roadways.
Natural-Gas Cooling
Our chillers are highly efficient and can help reduce demand on the grid.  And can help your business shrink its carbon footprint. Plus, natural-gas on-site cooling keeps your building safe from summer blackouts and maintains uninterrupted comfort even on the hottest days.  Don’t have natural gas?  Or prefer an electric chiller?  We can help as we only utilize the most efficient chiller system for your individual needs.
High-efficiency hot water heaters / heat pump
Ideal for commercial and industrial sites with substantial hot water requirements, our hot water heaters are highly efficient.  Our heat pumps are twice as efficient as conventional gas-fired boilers and produce significantly fewer emissions. Water-heating efficiency is especially important, because it is the second largest use of energy in most buildings, after space heat.

Property ManagerMulti-Family Housing Facility 

 Combined Heat and Power 


Combined heat and power (CHP), also known as cogeneration or distributed generation, is the simultaneous production of two types of energy – heat and electricity – from one fuel source, often natural gas or propane. The ability to create two forms of energy from a single source offers tremendous efficiency and thus both cost savings and environmental benefits.
The key components of a CHP system are an internal combustion, reciprocating engine driving an electric generator. The clean natural gas fired engine spins a generator to produce electricity. The natural by-product of the working engine is heat which is captured and used to supply space heating, heating domestic hot water, laundry hot water or to provide heat for swimming pools and spas. The CHP process is very similar to an automobile, where the engine provides the power to rotate the wheels and the by-product heat is used to keep the passengers warm in the cabin during the winter months.
Efficiency of CHP Systems
Combined heat and power systems use fuel very efficiently. A CHP system provides electricity and heat at a combined efficiency approaching 90%. This is a significant improvement over the combination of the 35% efficient electric utility and a conventional heating boiler with a 65% seasonal efficiency.
Why is there such a big difference in fuel efficiency between the electric utility and a combined heat and power system? The electric utility and CHP system each produce electricity and heat from one source of fuel. However, the heat produced at the electric utility is not used; it goes into the cooling water or up the smokestack along with greenhouse gases and other pollutants. Approximately two-thirds of the fuel’s energy is wasted. Alternatively, while generating electricity, a properly sized combined heat and power system recovers nearly all of the heat it produces and deploys it on site.
Additionally, when purchasing power from the electric utility, a separate source of heat, usually a boiler, is required. Despite using an efficient boiler, the total fuel required to produce conventional electricity and boiler heat is greater than the amount of fuel required to produce simultaneous energy with a combined heat and power system. This demonstrates why CHP-produced energy is more cost effective than the combined energies from the electric utility and local boilers.
Combined heat and power (CHP) technology has been around for over 100 years going back to the days of Thomas Edison. In 1882, the first commercial CHP plant was opened utilizing a single fuel to produce both heat and electricity. With an executive order signed by President Obama calling for 40 GW of new CHP by 2020, representing a 50 percent increase from 2012, CHP is gaining renewed emphasis.    
Benefits of Combined Heat and Power
Because of the high efficiency of the system, CHP provides considerable energy, environmental and economic benefits. CHP systems reduce the demand on the utility grid, increase energy efficiency, reduce air pollution, lower greenhouse gas emissions and protect your property against power outages, while significantly lowering the utility costs of building operations.
Installation and Operation
Installing a combined heat and power system requires capital and experience.  System installations require properly skilled and experienced system engineering, project management, electrical and mechanical work performed. Once the system is in place, continuous operation and maintenance are necessary to optimize performance.   For businesses with a stretched budget and competing capital improvement projects, finding the cash and expertise for turnkey installation of a CHP system presents a challenge. In most cases, an On-Site Utility is the best option.

We’d Love to Hear From You, Get In Touch With Us!The next time that you’re in need of sand and gravel in Los Angeles, look no further than us here at Western Materials. If you’ve driven past a public garden, baseball field, or construction crew laying road base in Los Angeles or Ventura County, odds are that the dirt, decorative stone or topsoil that you see came from us. Since 1999, we have provided many of our affiliated quarries throughout the state with quality construction aggregates and landscaping materials such as decomposed granite, wood chips, and class 2 base in Ventura.
Superior Materials and Services
Our team brings over 50 years of collective experience in supplying gravel and topsoil in Los Angeles and Ventura to every new job that we take on. Those companies, contractors, and private parties that we supply with aggregates and materials are more than just clients to us; they’re our partners in filling all of the needs for materials such as sand, road base, and wood chips in Los Angeles. From our founding members to our highly-qualified sales, production, and delivery teams, our philosophy has always remained to focus on the following business aspects:

Fielding a knowledgeable staff prepared to answer any question and fulfill any material and supply needs.
Demonstrating the care needed to not only meet, but exceed all of your expectations.
Fulfilling all of the regulatory requirements necessary to deliver on our company’s service guarantees.

We give you more than just road base in Ventura; we offer the peace-of-mind that comes from knowing your construction and landscaping projects are supported by the best materials in the business. Only through your satisfaction with your gravel in Los Angeles do we measure our success.
