VisionChina +7.4% as it reverses subway ad deal with Ledman

 VisionChina Media (NASDAQ:VISN) is up 7.4% after saying it's terminating a recently closed sale of nearly half its subway TV ad business, over operating disagreements. The company had been set for some time to sell a 49% interest in VisionChina New Culture Media, its business operating mobile TV advertising on subways, to Ledman Optoelectronic -- and it closed that deal in September. Last February, it had planned to sell the entire business to Ledman for $119M, but Ledman worked to suspend that deal and it was later terminated. Now, with disagreements over how to operate New Culture, VisionChina will regain the 49% interest in the business and repay Ledman 61M yuan along with interest, in three installments. It will also repay 321.2M yuan in cash by selling 17.09M shares of Ledman, now pledged as collateral. "The company is actively seeking potential purchasers of such equity interest. The company is also exploring other ways to improve its liquidity position," it says in a statement.

Hello, everyone, and welcome to VisionChina Media's first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. The company's first quarter earnings results were released earlier today and are available on the company's IR website at www.visionchina.cn as well as on Newswire services.
Today, you will hear from our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Limin Li, who will talk about our industry, our company's strategy and business operations. Mr. Alfred Tong, will discuss sales and marketing, and Mr. Christopher Patrick Holbert, will discuss financial results and give second quarter and annual guidance.

In addition, a webcast of this conference call will be available on VisionChina Media's Investor Relations website at www.visionchina.cn.
I will now turn the call over to VisionChina Media's Chairman and CEO, Mr. Li.
Limin Li
(Interpreted) Thank you all for joining us today. The first quarter of 2009 further demonstrated our strategy for growth continued to gain traction. We have seen evidence of economic rebound in the advertising industry starting in March and we expect that we will see an even stronger recovery in the second half of 2009. The recent economic environment while challenging has presented opportunities as advertisers have been forced to deploy their advertising budgets more carefully and at times reallocate budgets to different media forms in the search for more cost-effective ways to spend.
As advertising budgets return to more normalized levels, we expect to retain our customers and see a sustainable increase in their spending. We're confident in our guidance for 2009. The first quarter was challenging with seasonality compounded by a weak microenvironment and other industry challenges including pricing pressure in the cities in which we compete with other operators of mobile digital television advertising network. Despite these challenges, we were able to recognize impressive year over year growth with total revenues increasing 100% to 27.3 million.

During 2008, we took advantage of our strong balance sheet to selectively acquire six advertising agencies. Even before the acquisition, VisionChina had strong relationships with these agencies as they were our distributors, which gave us solid working knowledge of their talented workforce and excellent customer relationships. Immediately after acquisition of these agencies, I became personally involved in the management of the sales force that came to us through the acquisition, and I have been very pleased with their results.
Adding these companies to our corporation will have focused our efforts in ensuring that the acquired businesses are highly integrated with all aspects of our operations. I will manage the entire team in the same way we manage our other sales team. Contracts, human resources, corporate culture, training, pricing, income control, commission and financial control policy are all set by our headquarters, and revenues at both headquarters by our experienced corporate finance team. Additionally, Alfred and I are in constant contact with the management team of friends introduced to us by the acquired team. We are introducing CRM software to manage these customers and maintain proprietary customer information.
We believe that over time whether introduced through the acquired team or own sales team, quickly come to appreciate the effectiveness of our platform and consider themselves to be direct clients of VisionChina. The acquisition has already made substantial contribution to our success. And the rest of VisionChina's operations have as a result been positively impacted. We're confident that the synergies remain very nice in connection with these acquisition will provide long-term benefit to the company and our shareholders.
During the first quarter, we expanded into two new cities, Hangzhou and Tianjin, and added three additional lines to our Beijing subway presence, expanding our coverage to five of Beijing eight subway lines, with live cast and advertising capability. On January 1, 2009, we gained the rights to advertise on a second mobile television channel in Beijing subway that increases our network capacity in the capital city.
Our network covers 18 of China's most prosperous cities, carrying a total of 95 million viewers experience per day. Looking ahead to the second quarter and the rest of the year, we will continue to expand our current network and also selectively enter new markets within the public transportation space. We have identified 30 cities that meets very specific criteria for entry, and we will continue to execute through our partners and contracts.
The Chinese government stimulus plan which is largely focused on infrastructure development will likely benefit our company as well and are planning to expand as the transportation systems of our key cities continues to grow. Meanwhile we're also researching other delivery platforms that we might feel allow us to further grow operations in the future.
Our long-term goal is to increase our market share going forward. One of the ways to achieve this goal is through mergers and acquisition deals at the right valuation that will create value for our shareholders. We believe our industry is poised for consolidation and expect to play an active role in this trend. Just one of the many benefits of industry consolidation will be that operating in a less fragmented industry will alleviate some of the pricing pressure already having a negative impact on our operating results.
Recently we told you about the departure of our CFO, Dina Liu, who after two years at the company made the difficult decision to step down to spend more time with her family. We were all sad to see her go, but appreciate her years of financial oversight and contribution to the company's assets. Our Search Committee has initiated the hunt for here replacement and is working to ensure that the right, highly qualified person takes the job.

VisionChina's management works as a team. We continue to have a strong management team in place. The financial department for example remain well stocked. Chris Holbert, our VP of Finance since last year is a New York licensed CPA with experience in US listed companies, a Big Four background, and expertise in financial management and Sarbanes Oxley compliance. Several other financial directors are also from the Big Four accounting firms and bring strong oversight to the company.
In the first quarter, we also added Helen Plummer to our team at the Investor Relations offices. Helen has led our company's Investor Relations effort as an external consultant for the last two years, and her addition to the team helps us to maintain our proactive approach to Investor Relations and ongoing transparency for the benefit of all shareholders.
I would like to conclude by saying that long term growth prospect for our business in the digital mobile TV industry as a whole in China remains very strong, and we are optimistic of our strong fundamentals, leading market position and the exciting future of the digital mobile television industry.
I will now turn the call over to Alfred Tong, our Chief Marketing Officer, who will discuss our marketing and sales efforts in the field.
Alfred Tong
Thank you, Mr. Li. Hello, everyone.
I would first like to go over some key operating metrics. In the first quarter of the year 2009, network capacity, which is measured by total broadcasting hours, was 33,747 hours, up from 31,834 hours in the fourth quarter of 2008, and 25,980 hours in the first quarter of 2008. This increase was due to the addition of Hangzhou and Tianjin as well as the addition of three new lines of Beijing subway to our network, plus the launch of advertising operations on a second television channel in Beijing that is broadcast to subway and separately broadcast to bus.
Our ASP as measured by average advertising service revenue was $792 per broadcasting hour in the first quarter of 2009, down from $1,023 in the fourth quarter of 2008, and up from $493 in the first quarter of 2008. Our ASP were down due to seasonality and overall economic environment combined with the pricing pressure from competitors. Given the rate increase in January 2009 in five key markets, this gives us approximately 15% of that of traditional TV, according to the research by CPR [ph], give us plenty of room to increase rate cut and grow revenues in the region.
In terms of our relationships with customers, we're seeing that companies that once go to VisionChina platform as a new or experimental advertising avenue now consider us to be a fixed part of their advertising spend. On that space, we sold 5.62 advertising minutes per broadcasting hour in the first quarter of 2009 compared to 6.24 minutes in the first quarter of 2008, because of the increase in network capacity. In the first quarter of 2009, the company sold a total of 184,045 advertising minutes in is network compared to 162,183 minutes in the first quarter of 2008, and 281,059 minutes in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Over the quarter, our customer make up (inaudible) of about two part domestic and one part international brands, a quite healthy mix of advertiser across a variety of industries. Our retention and renewable rate remain very strong as well. And the amount of new clients that has once tested on our network, nearly all of them have continued to purchase advertising time on our network. We ended the first quarter with 806 advertising c customers, up from 705 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2008, and 381 customers just one year ago. In the first quarter, 257 customers placed advertisement on our network.
In terms of sales personnel customers, we have 320 salespeople as of March 31, 2008, as compared to 300 at the end of December last year and 208 as of March 31, 2008. It is our goal to extend our sales force to approximately 400 people by the end of 2009. We expanded the contractors with several key customers and added many new customers to our strong client base during the first quarter, including Unilever, Philips, Toyota and (inaudible) which is a well known domestic fashion brand.

Our concentration on clients among FMCG companies continue to provide deterrence from overall economic downturn at FMCG companies. These make up two third of our customer base, rely on ongoing advertising and promotions to quickly move good off store shelves. We're finding them more and more open turn up within portion of their available marketing budget, which used to be used for promotion and event introduction in China as we provide a more cost effective and well targeted use of advertising dollars.
Finally, before turning the call over to Chris, I want to mention that completion of the third phase of CTR Market Research Study (inaudible) of China digital mobile television industry. These findings has provided long-term measurable feedback regarding commuter demographic allowing us and our advertisers to better tailor programming and advertisement to meet the needs of commuters. This statistics continue to demonstrate that VisionChina digital mobile television platform has nation wide audience and generate high retention rate at a fraction of the cost of traditional television, finally (inaudible) the effectiveness of mobile television advertising and to (inaudible) in the past now have a much better understanding of how our media platform can complement the overall advertising strategy.
I will now turn the call over to our VP of finance, Mr. Christopher Holbert.
Christopher Holbert
Thank you Alfred.
VisionChina media's total revenue were 27.3 million in the first quarter of 2009, an increase of 100% compared to 13.6 million in the first quarter of 2008, and a decrease of 20.4% compared to 34.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Our gross margin decreased sequentially due to a combination of a decrease in revenue as a result of expected seasonality and overall weak economic environment and the nature of our fixed cost structure.
Selling and marketing expenses represented 19.4% of the company's advertising service revenues in the first quarter of 2009 compared to 12.2% in the first quarter of 2008 and 13.9% in the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily due to branding and sales building activities to expand the company sales network and strengthen its sales capabilities.
Net margin was 24.6% in the first quarter of 2009 compared to 39.8% in Q1 2008 and 43.3% in the fourth quarter of 2008, again as a result of a combination of decreased revenues and the nature of our fixed cost structure. Our basic and diluted net income per share for the first quarter of 2009 was $0.09 and $0.09 respectively compared to $0.08 and $0.08 respectively in the first quarter of 2008 and $0.21 and $0.20 respectively in the fourth quarter of 2008. Our first quarter net income excluding share-based compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets non-GAAP was 8.5 million.
Our net operating cash flow totaled 4.8 million in the first quarter of 2009 and the average day sales outstanding in the first quarter was 126 days. As we have mentioned in the past, in the third quarter of 2008, we increased our maximum credit days for major national and international brands, as well as for agency contracts to be in line with industry practice, our days sales outstanding as adjusted to reflect an increased number of customers who fall into those categories. Or goal remains to keep days sales outstanding in the 120 days range. It is important to keep in mind that our sales forces are not paid commissions until accounts receivables are collected.
We are very comfortable with the brands on our accounts receivable list as the list is comprised of some of the largest multinational and domestic Chinese brands who maintain strong credit history. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of 122.9 million, a decrease of 40.3 million from the end of 2008. The decrease was mainly a result of earn out payments in connection with our 2008 acquisition of six advertising agency businesses that were previously our distributors. We believe that absent any unexpected drastic change in business conditions, our cash on hand and cash to be generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements in the foreseeable future.

Regarding our share repurchase program, during the first quarter, we purchased 372,412 shares in the open market at an average price of $5.41 in total consideration of around $2 million.
Turning now to 2009 and our guidance. We estimate total revenue, which consists of advertising service revenues only, in the second quarter of 2009 to range from 29.2 million to 32.2 million. Second quarter 2009 net income excluding share-based compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets non-GAAP is expected to be between 6.5 million and 9 million. We maintain our full-year 2009 estimate and expect total revenues will range from 141 million to 157 million. Net income in the full year 2009 excluding share-based compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets non GAAP is expected to be between 49 million and 51 million. We based these estimates on a foreign exchange rate of renminbi 6.8456 per one dollar. I would like to note that our guidance is based on our current network of 18 cities that as of today have already been secured by contracts. If and when more cities are added, our forecast will be impacted.
Helen Plummer
We will now open up the call to questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator instructions). And our first question comes from the line of Wallace Cheung with Credit Suisse. Go ahead.
Wallace Cheung – Credit Suisse
Hi good morning. Mr. Li, Alfred, and Chris, Helen, Hi. Just wanted to ask two questions quickly. Number one is can you explain a bit the reason why the advertisers number seems like down quite a bit in the first quarter and also can you update us about the backlog order as a percentage of your full-year revenue guidance? Thank you. Hello?
Alfred Tong
Wallace, this is Alfred. To answer your question, basically the number of advertiser (inaudible) we ended with 800 advertisers but for the first quarter we basically have a healthy numbers of advertisers. And in terms of the (inaudible) – wait a minute – yes, well, the (inaudible) is about 520 million renminbi and it is about 42% of year 2008 advertisers have already renewed their contracts.
Wallace Cheung – Credit Suisse
But is it sort of a – regarding my first question, is it sort of a trend going forward that we begin to see there'll be less customers but the value for each customer is actually will be much higher than before and also like it or not, will that be leading to may be lower administration expense or marketing expenses as well? Thank you.
Alfred Tong
Actually for Q1 most of them now seems to be spending the money more carefully. So we believe that the number of advertisers will pick up in the second quarter, just we know numbers (inaudible) advertising trend, so because of the worldwide economic recession, the number of advertisers is a little bit less, but we believe that it is going to pick up in the second half.
Helen Plummer
Next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Eddie Leung with Merrill Lynch. Go ahead.
Eddie Leung – Merrill Lynch
Good morning everyone. I guess you know to start with I want to follow up with Wallace's second question on the percentage of pre-sells, the percentage of pre-sell orders of your full-year guidance, how much have you pre-sold of your full-year guidance?
Alfred Tong
(inaudible) about 500 renminbi, that is about half of our guidance, high end guidance number.
Eddie Leung – Merrill Lynch
Got it. And the same question, regarding your sales and marketing expenses, how much of your sales and marketing expenses is variable coast and how much is fixed cost in terms of percentage?
Alfred Tong
(inaudible) and for your question typically most of the percentage is for development cost.
Eddie Leung – Merrill Lynch
And my final question is regarding your acquisitions, could you share with us the percentage of revenues from the agencies that you acquired in last year? For example, can you tell about the first quarter revenues, how much of that is coming from the agencies that you acquired last year?

Dina Liu
Hi Eddie, this is Dina. I would like to answer your question.
Eddie Leung – Merrill Lynch
Hi, Dina.
Dina Liu
Hi. How are you? In respect of revenue contributions from the agencies that were acquired last year, they account for roughly 56.3% of last year's revenue and then for the – out of the contract backlog we have for 2009, that stood at about 520 million renminbi and roughly 31% of it comes from the (inaudible).

Our next question comes from the line of Philip Wan with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead.
Philip Wan – Morgan Stanley
Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I have a few quick questions. Number one is you mentioned about media cost guidance for 2009 is about 42 million and is there any change to this media cost guidance? And my number two question is we have been four months into this year and I'm wondering what is your pricing strategy and are we expecting a price hike for the second half of 2009? I know that the company raised prices for five cities in the first half of 2009, so are we expecting a price hike for all cities or just focusing on the key cities going forward? Thank you.
Alfred Tong
This is Alfred. I would like to answer the second question first. Revenue pricing normally we build a rate structure every six months, and we have a tentatively good the rate by end of May to see whether there is just a rate cut. But I would say because of current economic situation, so this year, probably our focus will extend to increase the penetration rate first, this is our key focus. And then we will reveal the rate based on market demand and also our competitive pricing and also our advertisement spending of each of our advertisers, and then we will finalize our rate cut whether it is our intention or not.
Philip Wan – Morgan Stanley
Okay.
Limin Li
(Interpreted) In terms of media costs, there are two compositions. One is based on the past contract or the existing cities we have already entered, so the media cost is already determined in the contract. And in addition to that in any additional media cost we incur by entering into new contracts.

Our next question comes from the line of James Marsh with Piper Jaffray. Go ahead.
James Marsh – Piper Jaffray
Hi. Two quick questions. First I was hoping you could discuss the ad minutes per broadcasting hour sold, I assume they declined pretty substantially sequentially as well as year-over-year, and I wanted to understand is that driven predominantly by seasonality, or is it do you think driven by competitive actions or maybe you don't want to sell as many units because the rates are not attractive, so if you could talk a little bit about that? And then just what type of I guess ad minute per broadcasting hour should we think about going forward, should we look at previous seasonal quarters and assume it is the same or should it be lower, just a little bit of help there would be appreciated?
Alfred Tong
Regarding the advertising – sales percentage and advertising minute hour, yes, this quarter a little bit increase is because of the product seasonality and also under current economic situation. So when we talk – or more sort of trend looking on the trend and still allow uncertainty. But it seems most of the times they will move their advertising budget from (inaudible) April, May in the second half of the year. So we believe that advertising minutes are principally for the same part of the year will maintain even for – as if may be the same as last year.
James Marsh – Piper Jaffray
Okay, right. Thank you. And then I just had one follow up. We discussed earlier that there is some evidence of an ad market recovery in March and I thought that was very good news, but I was wondering what kind of evidence have you seen? Is it just anecdotal, you're just talking to clients, and they're actually putting money to work, if you can just help me understand what you meant by that?

Alfred Tong
Yes. Starting from – we see that – starting from March fiscal, basically most advertising start to pick up the advertising spending, because after the CMI [ph] they know more about their sales team in the first quarter, so that is why the sales pick up and then they slowly increase their advertising sending. So we will see something from the second quarter basically move their client starts up to the normal level of advertising spend in the last year.
James Marsh – Piper Jaffray
Okay. That is helpful. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from the line of James Lee with Sterne Agee. Go ahead.
James Lee – Sterne Agee
Hi. Just trying to understand your acquisition earn out payments a little bit better, how much payment is there left for the remainder of the year besides what you're paying in the first quarter? And can you help us understand maybe what is your benchmark for earn out 2009, 2010? Is that based on revenue or based on earnings? And the 82 million maximum payment, is that payment for the next two years going to be about 50-50 or is it kind of breakout for in terms of expectation of the outflow? And is that 82 million, the original amount of the agreement or that is based on an amount that is maybe renegotiated subsequently and any clarity on that would be very helpful? Thank you.
Dina Liu
Hi James, this is Dina. I would like to take up your questions, okay. To answer the first part of the question which relates to our obligation for the payment compared to the earn out payment in fact, we have made the payment of 40.7 million in Q1 and the maximum earn out payment in respect of 2008 performance was 69.4. So after we have received considerable investment and also meet certain criteria and then we will have additional 29 million to pay before we fully kind of control agent earn out payment. And then the timing of that will depend on when we are able to own the AR assessment and also what particular terms of the payment will meet the criteria or not.
And then to answer the second part of the question regarding the maximum pay out for 2009 and 2010, based on the agreement, the maximum earn out payment for performance is about 81.1 million because we have already paid deposits to those agencies that we acquired, so the actual cash out – the total of the cash the next two years at 69 million after deduction to those two partners. So based on our cash flow forecast for the next year, we expect that our free cash flow will be more than the earn out payment for the acquisition the next two years. And to answer your third part of the question on the allocation of the earn out payments in 2009 and 2010, right now it is pretty hard to determine right now with recent changes on incentives the acquired team's performance in 2009, and right now we are still (inaudible).
James Lee – Sterne Agee
Now if I can follow up on, Dina, the benchmark of earn out payments, is that based on revenues, or is that based on earnings? Or if we can get a sense, get a flavor of what happened in terms of 2009 earn outs, assuming that that the backlog you just talked about right, 31% of revenue comes from agency, assuming 31% of revenue coming from agency this year, can you give us a sense of how much would the earn out payment be for the performance – in the performance for 2009 and 2010?
Dina Liu
James, there are certain – first to come up with the mechanism for the earn out payment is based on multiples. So while we have (inaudible) the deal structure, the payout is based on the separate P&L by the team and is on the revenues and deducting the media cost an also operating cost itself. And also the earn out payment is also based on even the timing of AR assessment if AR is not scheduled before 180 days, they would lose the claim for those earn out payments. What we have done in fact, we have recently, we have been able to take advantage of significant increase in our franchise value and also in the drop in valuation in market. So we were able to renegotiate with the sellers of the teams to reduce the multiple network teams on those acquisitions, and also reduce the tax on those earn out payments itself, so that we are – those deals are accretive to our shareholders value. And then in terms of their performance, expected performance for 2009, 2010 (inaudible) embedded in the transformation to protect ourselves, and it really depends on the actual results at the end of this year, so we can have a clear idea about the earn out payments, and right now from what we can see is that the integration of the sales team has been very successful and also the franchise value of our platform has been strengthened significantly over the past years, and now we can do that a lot in branded advertisers now, they are coming to us more in terms of the effectiveness of our media rather than the relationships of the salespeople. So we complement that, those advertisers will stay with us, are long term advertisers.

James Lee – Sterne Agee
All right. Thanks for the clarifications, Dina. Sorry to be on the same horse again. I just want to make sure I have a good understanding of this. You seemed to imply that the 81 million, the earn out payment for 2009, 2010, that is a negotiated amount, not the original amount, just curious what was the original amount? And it seems like the earn out payments based on the complication formula, based on more on the bottom line than the top line and therefore it is very difficult to assess at this point?
Dina Liu
The original earn out payment amount was more than what we were able to negotiated with them. So we have been evaluating given the markets conditions and also evaluating our franchise value since late last year and renegotiated the deal to the company's benefit. So, we were very pleased to see that (inaudible).
James Lee – Sterne Agee
Okay. I think this is very important for the existing investors who would like to own the stock. And just refresh our memory, with your renegotiated deal with the acquired agency, what would be the acquired multiple be versus before? Can help us out on that?
Dina Liu
James, this is a very – we have a very complicated formulas in those agreements to protect the company and so what I would say is that, we shall be able to reduce the multiples and to our flexibility and now we are confident that the structure that we have in place are accretive to our shareholders value and even our competitive multiple.
James Lee – Sterne Agee
All right, thank you.

Paul Wuh – Nomura
Hi, just several questions for you. First on the sectors, I wanted to know which industry sectors were the top three contributors to revenue in the first quarter, and if they have changed at all from the fourth quarter? And my second question is, obviously you have added a lot of screens between this quarter, first quarter and the first quarter of last year, I was wondering if you could give us a sense on a screen per screen, in other words the screens that you had existing last year in the first quarter and the screen that you have existing in the first quarter this year, what type of like for like revenue are we seeing, is it down a certain percentage, is it up, just wanted to get an apples to apples comparison if possible? Thank you.
Alfred Tong
For the first question, basically more than 60% of our revenue comes from three key categories which is personal and healthcare products, pharmaceutical products and also food and beverage. So these are the more key areas, basically personal products are about 6.7%, pharmaceutical products are about 13%, and food and beverage is about 19%. And also FMCG products I did the same it is essentially the market so started to pickup a lot, so the rest of the (inaudible) into this product, and we find that fashion accessories and also tourism is also increasing.
Christopher Holbert
Okay. This is Christopher. I will take your question regarding driving revenue per screen. Actually as you probably know, we don't really look at ourselves in that way. Some other players in our industry or sector would look at themselves that way but we don't really look at ourselves in that way as far as calculating revenue per screen. So the metric that we usually look at are the utilization rate, the ASP. So we think that we are at a pretty healthy level and we have seen substantial consistent growth of those metrics compared to Q1 and compared to 2008. So we think that we will see a continuation of fattening up or helping of those metrics going forward in 2009.

Sorry, Eddie. Would you mind repeating your question, please?

HIGH RISK INVESTMENT WARNING:

                End-users of the NetDania software that make use of the trading integration features as direct clients of integrated brokers, should be aware of the level of risk carried by trading in financial markets. Trading foreign exchange and or other financial instruments on margin carries a high level of risk, and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or more of your initial investment, and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with trading, and seek advice from your broker and or an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Anyone opening a live trading account needs to adhere to the laws of their local country as such laws may differ from country to country.                
                
                NetDania expressly disclaims any liability for any lost principal or profits which without limitation may arise directly or indirectly from the use of or reliance on information on our website or the use of our software with broker integration.
