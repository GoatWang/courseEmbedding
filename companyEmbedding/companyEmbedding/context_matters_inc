Our Story — Context Matters





















































Bringing a Vision to Life







Context Matters was born from the realization that there is a common data theme from clinical trial development through market access considerations. Health technology assessment (HTA) agencies outside of the United States were conducting clinical comparative effectiveness and economic evaluations on drugs, yet there was no standardized data approach or searchable capability to understand and compare these assessments. At the same time, information used for these evaluations was based directly on clinical trial data—the same data used for regulatory approval. Disparate data domains, unstructured data, and a lack of understanding as to how the decisions in clinical trial endpoints have an effect very far downstream in reimbursement decisions or comparative and cost-effectiveness calculations were creating a data gap. As a result, the ability of biopharma professionals to make well-informed strategic decisions was being impeded.This data gap was an opportunity to create a data analytical model that would showcase the relationship between clinical trial design decisions and reimbursement decisions—with the ability to drill into what criteria and comparators would be important for later economic and comparative effectiveness evaluations. To address this, we first created an overarching context—starting from the end goal of market access and health outcomes used for both cost and comparative effectiveness evaluations and working back toward the choice of clinical trial endpoints that would have been made at an earlier stage. This required structuring a substantial amount of unstructured data—creating a data architecture that could accommodate disparate domains of data, and utilizing analysts who could parse, match, and categorize across different terminology, language, syntax, and public policy inferences. Every element and data point is subject to the highest level of quality control, rendering an overall flexible data model able to accommodate multiple contexts necessary for complex decision making. Through the integration of our proprietary data model, innovative technology platform, and best-in-class data management process, we have created an elegant solution that relates market access considerations with clinical trial design. Our solution enables a holistic approach that provides pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies the critical data and context needed to develop drugs for both an approvable and a reimbursable label—all at a global level.Today, we work with more than two dozen large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies who are using our data and our application to support a myriad of different activities—from strategic planning of market access to understanding specific drugs and disease conditions, to tracking competitive intelligence, to thinking about clinical trial endpoint selection, to track timelines across regulatory and reimbursement decisions that can extend to label extensions and reassessments.

How can I better understand what comparator or endpoints may be important for an optimal evaluation by a health technology assessment agency?ECONOMIC EVALUATIONSHow do the clinical and economic rationales for decisions vary by drug, by drug class, by disease condition, by analogue, etc.?Did a patient access scheme influence or change the initial reimbursement decision? How much did a risk-sharing agreement matter? Was the scheme successful?Which inputs will be successful in an economic model?   What were the submitted base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and quality-adjusted life-year vs. the agency’s reaction?

Context Matters and IHS Markit Launch Strategic Pricing Tool for Pharmaceutical Industry



Share Article


















PriceCurrents integrates global pricing, regulatory and reimbursement data.







Dynamic timeline visualization enables users to immediately identify potential associations between price changes and reimbursement and/or regulatory events

With PriceCurrents, I can visualize and explore price trends on a single page within moments and even compare multiple drugs with the click of a button.


New York, NY (PRWEB)
July 24, 2017
 Context Matters, Inc., a leading provider of health economics data technology for the pharmaceutical industry, and IHS Markit (Nasdaq: INFO), a world leader in critical information, analytics and solutions, today announced the launch of PriceCurrents, the first integrated data product offering from the two organizations for the life sciences industry. 
PriceCurrents integrates pricing data from PharmOnline International (POLI) from IHS Markit with reimbursement and regulatory data from Context Matters’s Market Access Platform (MAP). Designed as a strategic global pricing tool for the pharmaceutical industry, PriceCurrents provides convergent visualization of associations between pricing changes and regulatory and reimbursement events. Developed with direct input from biopharmaceutical companies that are customers of both IHS Markit and Context Matters, PriceCurrents leverages a proprietary API, custom-built by Context Matters, to drive the seamless data integration. 
Pilot testing of PriceCurrents started earlier this year with select clients, including Janssen Biotech, Inc. “Previously, it would have taken me and my team hours of work manually extracting data from several sources to explore how health technology assessment and regulatory decisions can affect price changes for a particular set of drugs,” explained Dan Pettitt, Global Head of Immunology Market Access and Policy for Janssen. “With PriceCurrents, I can visualize and explore price trends on a single page within moments and even compare multiple drugs with the click of a button.”
“Context Matters was founded on the idea that there is a common theme within data from clinical trial development through market access considerations. To provide those linkages requires technology that seamlessly integrates data from multiple sources—that is the technology that we built,” said Dr. Yin Ho, M.D., M.B.A., CEO of Context Matters. “PriceCurrents is the first demonstration of our integration capabilities with third-party data. It marks the start of an exciting new phase for our technology in reaching its full potential and the beginning of a partnership that will drive future innovation in the industry.”
“The high level of change in the pharmaceutical industry makes it challenging for manufacturers and payers to come to a consensus on price-value data,” noted Gustav Ando, Senior Director & Vice President for IHS Markit. “PriceCurrents delivers a mission-critical tool to the industry that enables rapid analysis and analytical insights on how health technology assessment (HTA) and regulatory approvals shape the pricing of drug assets.” 
IHS Markit and Context Matters currently offer subscription access to PriceCurrents for joint customers with wider release and availability to the tool scheduled for the fall.

Thank you!




For health technology assessment (HTA) agencies, cancer drugs provide a special set of challenges and level of complexity in their reimbursement evaluations. Measuring surrogate endpoints, valuing high-cost combination therapies, and keeping up with innovations like immunotherapies are all nuanced examples that are especially challenging in oncology.

Not All Positive Decisions Are EqualBroadcast date: 2/24/2016In Market Access positive reimbursement decisions are the end goal that drive decision-making throughout the development lifecycle. But often a positive reimbursement decision is only partially positive and restricts the population that has access to the medicine. Making the assumption that every positive decision is without restriction may have repercussions on the critical decisions you make about that drug, from clinical trial design to projection of market size based on population. This webinar offers an insightful discussion that examines the nuances of positive decisions and how to interpret them.   Could Learnings from European Healthcare Markets Apply to U.S.?

What's your blueprint for pharma market access?Context Matters health economics data and technology helps biopharma optimally value new drugs for reimbursement. 



NEWSContext Matters and IHS Markit Launch Strategic Pricing Tool for Pharmaceutical IndustryInsights & Research4 Market Access Assumptions Misleading BiotechsAccelerating Immuno-Oncology (I-O) Therapies to Market webinarsI-O Drugs: Key to the Cancer Moonshot?FDA and 21st Century Entrepreneurial RegulationFrom clinical trial design through regulatory and reimbursement approval—we put market access intelligence in context.







Overcoming hurdles to market access is no small matter. Increasingly, cost-effectiveness and cost-containment are trumping safety and efficacy. Forward-thinking biopharma is looking for new ways to anticipate the criteria (we call it “context”), against which their next drug will be evaluated by agencies / payers for reimbursement.More than tracking health technology assessment (HTA) decisions, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies need a solution that connects the multiple dimensions of reimbursement, regulatory, and clinical trials. Context Matters built the industry-leading market access intelligence solution linking drug development and market data through a sophisticated model. Flexible and scalable, our solution provides both breadth and depth of timely and accurate data gathered across reimbursement, regulatory, and clinical sources. Let Context Matters put you in control of your blueprint for market access with the right data and technology.

Use Case — Context Matters





















































Use Case: Informing Strategic Decisions with the Market Access PlatformSmart data on drug development and market access improves the process of valuing drug therapies and empowers companies to achieve optimal reimbursement for their innovation. The Context Matters Market Access Platform (MAP) delivers structured, linked data—what we call smart data—making comparative analysis and contextual views possible to drive decision-making.See how it’s done with this Use Case. SituationA UK country manager at a midsize pharmaceutical company needs to determine whether to seek approval for reimbursement in the UK from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for a new hepatitis C treatment. The treatment has proven to be as clinically effective as similar drugs, with a similar adverse events profile. The drug has been launched in other markets with mixed results. The treatment is not the first of its kind and established brands are already on the market in the UK and elsewhere. Based on these factors, the reimbursement decision will be extremely price-sensitive and the predicted  incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) will serve as a major determining factor.Initial RequirementsInvestigate drug approvals for hepatitis C in the UKExamine current landscape of approved drugs and associated ICERsDecision CriteriaExtremely price-sensitive due to drug backgroundPredicted ICER will serve as major determining factorSearch and Decision ProcessUse the Context Matters MAP with the Economic Strategy module to aggregate, visualize, and comprehend data-derived insightsRely primarily on the application's charting capabilities to create a snapshot of current market conditions in the UKDrug Valuation/Reimbursement ChallengeDecide whether to seek approval for reimbursement from NICE for a new treatment for hepatitis CFind a quick and easy way to make the right drug pricing and reimbursement decisionDrug BackgroundProduct launched by company in other markets with mixed resultsTreatment proven to be as clinically effective as similar drugs, with similar adverse events profileTreatment not the first of its kindEstablished brands already on the market in the UK and other countriesStep 1 – Define Search

pharmaphorum recently published an article written by our Founder and CEO Yin Ho and Research Analyst Daniel Sanchez: "When Measuring European Regulatory Approval, the Timestamp Matters." The article looks at cycle times in regulatory decisions and how they are being measured in the US and Europe. A cycle time measures the time from the date of submission, through date of approval. We noticed that some of the analyses involving the European Medicines Agency (EMA)’s cycle time used an inappropriate endpoint, resulting in cycle times that looked two months shorter than they actually are.

Interview 
	conducted by: Lynn Fosse, Senior Editor, CEOCFO Magazine, Published   May 
	13, 2013


CEOCFO: Dr. Ho, would you tell us the 
	concept of Context Matters?


Dr. Ho: 
	It is a very straight-forward concept for a very complex problem. Basically 
	Context Matters is a web based application database company that in essence 
	has aggregated large sets of data around pharmaceutical risk - mainly 
	everything in drug development all the way through reimbursement 
	information.  We created the company on a single observation and 
	idea--there was a great deal of publicly available global information about 
	different drugs--how the drugs worked, how drugs were being viewed by the 
	different governments around the world, and how drugs were being judged both 
	in terms of value and risk. None of that information was captured in a way 
	that was straightforward enough for pharmaceutical companies to easily look 
	across and understand the risk that their drug portfolios might be taking 
	on. There was no clear way to understand the value of their products based 
	on how governments, payers, and agencies viewed the products in their 
	portfolio. Basically, there was no clarity or ability to predict how the 
	entities who are responsible for paying for the product were assigning 
	economic value.

 


CEOCFO: 
	What was the most difficult part of the technology to create?


Dr. Ho: 
	I think the most difficult part for any company that is inherently a data 
	company is to ensure data transparency and data integrity, particularly when 
	the data comes from multiple sources, in multiple languages, and available 
	in multiple formats. Rather than focusing on the difficulty of the 
	technology (which was not the most difficult part), it is more appropriate 
	to focus on how to ensure that the data had complete integrity and 
	transparency. Here we are- taking information from multiple countries and 
	capturing methodologies that were somewhat understood by some countries and 
	maybe not as well understood by others. We were taking information from 
	unstructured formats to structured datasets and everything in between and 
	trying to extract the information in a very consistent and 
	quality-controlled way, just to ensure that the information still made sense 
	and still retained the original context around it when a customer or user 
	was looking to find a particular answer or insight. In essence, I would 
	argue that the most difficult part of building the product was to curate and 
	standardize the data and making it meaningful in a way that would support 
	analysis and insights about drug development and drug reimbursement. The 
	technology itself was really not the difficult part. 

 


CEOCFO: 
	The data is not static, so how do you continually keep it current for the 
	latest reports and information?


Dr. Ho: 
	We keep current in two ways. First, I have an extremely talented group of 
	data analysts and data scientists. All of them have masters degrees in 
	public health and some of them have masters in science degrees. Many of them 
	understand data and are comfortable with the inherent uncertainty around 
	multiple sources and fragmented data regardless of the format. This group 
	literally goes through reimbursement decisions made around the world one 
	document at a time, extracting information in a very consistent and 
	efficient methodological way.

 

For data that is already 
	structured, it is all about ensuring the correct parameters for directly 
	loading the information and then applying a rigorous quality control 
	process. 

 

We are what we call 
	information format agnostic in that we do not care about the original 
	format as long as it is published, the origins are clear, and it is 
	source-able. Reliability and data integrity is paramount and we can employ 
	all methods to access the data whether it is through technology or human 
	judgment. 

 


CEOCFO: 
	Who is using your services today?


Dr. Ho: 
	Currently we service life sciences companiesprimarily the pharmaceutical 
	and biotechnology industry. We work closely with commercial market access 
	groups and R&D groups. We work with the groups that are tasked to understand 
	the value of their products and to ensure that their products gain proper 
	access amongst the different countries around the world. The application of 
	our data is actually broader than market access and we find that several of 
	our customers are utilizing the information to influence clinical trial 
	design. We are also beginning to make inroads into biotech, which is a 
	welcome addition.

 


CEOCFO: 
	How long has the product been available in its current format?


Dr. Ho: 
	The 1st commercial grade version of the product launched in 
	September, 2012so about 6 months ago. We had developed prototypes and beta 
	versions prior to September--of which we actually built with the support of 
	our customers. We had early pilot and beta customers who understood the idea 
	of what we were trying to do and who were quite patient, worked with us, and 
	gave us many insights as we were working through those prototypes and 
	through beta versions. When we launched the commercial grade application in 
	September last year it was very quickly welcomed as having much of the data 
	that was difficult to find, and a user experience that was novel and 
	conducive for both analysis and communication. 

 


CEOCFO: 
	What is your geographic reach?


Dr. Ho: 
	Our application covers data from South America, Asia, Europe as well as 
	North America and Australia. Our customers are predominantly from both North 
	America and Europe at this time.

 


CEOCFO: 
	How do you reach potential customers?


Dr. Ho: 
	Much of it comes from networking and word-of-mouth. I came out of the 
	pharmaceutical industry and have found both my former colleagues have been 
	wonderful at introducing us to potential customers. Everyone sees that have 
	created a solution for an increasing need in the marketplace. Global market 
	access for drugs has become increasingly difficult to gauge and manage for 
	pharmaceutical companies. As such, we have found that companies talk about 
	us as do the trade organizations and we are also creating a presence at some 
	of the tradeshows and relevant conferences more recently.

 


CEOCFO: 
	How have you ensured ease-of-use?


Dr. Ho: 
	We invested a great deal in user experience and front-end design on our 
	application. The application that we built was based on the idea that it was 
	not just good enough to collect the information and simply curate it and 
	standardize it. It was more important that the user could determine the 
	context and in essence have control at determining what data interested them 
	and what hypotheses and questions they wished to answer. We designed a user 
	interface on the front end that is made up with a series of different types 
	of screens and functionalities that allow a customer to actually choose the 
	context they want to look at information. We also invested a great deal of 
	time, resources, and effort into dynamic informational graphics displays. 
	When you use our application, you have a delightful experience. You are able 
	to look at a great amount of insightful and very in-depth data all at once 
	without feeling like you are digging you way through a mountain of 
	information. The information is extracted in a sophisticated and transparent 
	way and laid out in a fashion that allows you to manipulate the manner you 
	view the information and ask an infinite number of questions.

 

A large part of what we 
	think has been part of our success is that not only did we go after making 
	sure that the data had great integrity but we put considerable money and 
	resources into ensuring that the application itself as a web-based software 
	tool worked very seamlessly. To us, a driving principle of development is to 
	ensure that the user is in control. Our platform and tools empower our 
	customers by providing them with the information they need in an 
	easy-to-use, intuitive, and delightful manner. We took the best of user 
	experience, information graphics, software development, database management, 
	and data curation and put it all together for a singular data analytics 
	experience.

 


CEOCFO: 
	Do you provide any analysis or summary or is it the raw data and up to the 
	user to decide how they are interested in reviewing?


Dr. Ho: 
	It is actually a combination. We give foremost access to our customers to be 
	able to have direct access to the original data. Raw makes it sound like it 
	has not been refined. In actuality, the data has been extracted directly 
	from the source, but we have curated the actual extraction so the data is 
	clean, standardized, and easy to compare across multiple dimensions without 
	worry that the context will be lost. When data is arrayed in this way and is 
	as agile as we have made it, then our customers are then able to do their 
	own analysis very easily. In fact, most analysis is done by the customer 
	directly and we expect this will only increase as we roll out additional 
	analytical features and functions.

 

That said, our customers 
	will sometimes ask us for analysis across multiple domains of data and we 
	will help them build a customized, sophisticated analysis for that purpose.
	

 

A large part of the 
	vision for our platform is to continue to empower our customers by giving 
	them more capabilities to do analysis easily themselves with smart tools and 
	the ability to cross domains of information.

 


CEOCFO: 
	Are you funded for the growth moving ahead?
Dr. Ho: We have been very fortunate. We 
	have built this company in almost a bootstrap kind of manner. We raised 
	money through friends and family and have also generated revenue from the 
	beginning,

 

We are very bullish 
	about this year and we think it is going to be the year where we will become 
	a self-sustaining business. If we can achieve this milestone, we will then 
	determine if we are going to seek more capital this year to accelerate our 
	reach. I think that is one of the key decisions that are going to play 
	itself out this year.

 


CEOCFO: 
	Are there tweaks you would like to do or additional data you would like to 
	add?


Dr. Ho: 
	Yes we have many products in our pipeline. When we started the company we 
	had a grand ambition to cover pretty much the entire drug development cycle 
	from clinical trials all the way through reimbursement. We started with 
	reimbursement and worked our way backwards toward clinical trials. Because 
	of this approach, we have a series of products in the pipeline and we built 
	a platform to sustain a set of products which are both integrated and 
	available separately. Obviously if we had more capital we would bring many 
	those products to the market a little faster. 

 

We are very fortunate 
	that we have been able to work with customers every step of the way to 
	ensure that much what we build is of value to customers from the beginning. 
	Our deliberate pace of how we have been growing has also won us some very 
	happy users as well. 

 


CEOCFO: 
	Why should the business and investment community pay attention to Context 
	Matters?


Dr. Ho: 
	I think most people have not given the concept of context enough thought, 
	especially when it comes to such a complex world as drug development and 
	life sciences in general. The concept is much larger than just simply drug 
	development and drug reimbursement. It is around the idea that the answer to 
	most questions about value is simply It depends. It depends is 
	determined on the context and the question that is being asked. For our 
	customers, it depends is based on whether you are looking at the value of 
	this drug as determined by one or more countries criteria or if you are 
	basing the value of this drug on its comparators or competition, or if you 
	are assessing the value of the drug on the time horizon of development or 
	the comparators at different points in time.

 

Context Matters has 
	built this thinking into the very core of what we are providing for our 
	customers through our platform, our products, and our services. What we have 
	done is acknowledged that there is an important concept around context that 
	this concept should drive how one views information or how one can change 
	the lens of viewing information. Every strategic analysis based on evidence 
	starts with asking 1) if you can take data out of context and if so, 2) can 
	you at the same time render a judgment that you are comfortable with when 
	data is taken out of context.

 

I think the business and 
	investment community should pay attention to us because we are an exciting 
	and growing company that philosophically understands one of the key 
	principles that have bedeviled Big Data companies and Big Data efforts. We 
	deal with a variety of data, value data integrity to the core, and have 
	created an application and platform that retains context and allows context 
	to be determined by the user.  

 

We are a company to 
	watch out for because we have recognized a critical element for determining 
	relative value and risk and the end result will be a shortened timeline for 
	drug development as the value is understood earlier in the process.
