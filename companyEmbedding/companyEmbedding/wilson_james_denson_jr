Injection of selected numbers of errors in returned loopback data to provide gray-scale type qantification of loop performance measurements



Patent number:  6859900
                                            

Abstract:  An in-band communication scheme reports the results of loop performance measurements from a remote site to a test site, by deliberately injecting, into a loopback sequence of a repeated code word, a selected one of different numbers of errors. The number of errors is selectable from among a plurality of different quantification values, based upon in which of a plurality of respective ranges of loop performance parameters, measured parameter values fall. The error data is thus effectively a gray-scale type of quantification of loop performance measurement data.

Assignee: 
                                                                        Adtran, Inc.
