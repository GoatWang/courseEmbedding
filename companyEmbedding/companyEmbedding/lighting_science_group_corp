Contemporary lighting is an updated mix of the latest trends and styles. Classified by simple smooth angles, grays, monochromes, mixed with clear or white glass.
	




Modern lighting is characterized by clean, sharp lines dominantly in brushed steels and chromes. Modern Lighting transforms lighting fixtures into an artpiece for your home.
	




Traditional lighting is characterized by smooth classic lines that range a variety of historical periods and will make any home look more elegant.
	






Transitional lighting is defined as a mix of contemporary and traditional. This style fuses two top selling styles into one beautiful design for your space.
	




Rustic lighting is known for use of earthy tones, sturdy wrought irons and antler decorations. Rustic lighting fits in everything from a cabin, home in the mountains, or home in the suburbs.
	




Colonial lighting is marked by simple, traditional lines often combined with the use of basic woods or irons. Lanterns, chandeliers and wall sconces with candle-style bulbs make a simple yet attractive luminaire for any space.

Voltage



Low Voltage

			 These outdoor lights run on low voltage direct current (DC) between 12V and 24V. They require an external transformer, and can easily be installed by a homeowner. Wiring between lights can be buried directly in the ground
		






Line Voltage

			 These outdoor lights run on mains power, which is the same power that is inside your home (AC). They do not require an external transformer, but they are best left to professional installation, since they must pass electrical code inspection in most areas.

Why don't we show the price?

					Like many retailers, LightingDirect.com can choose to set its own prices independently. And even though manufacturers require LightingDirect.com and other retailers to display a product's "minimum advertised price" (or MAP), the retailer can choose to sell for less than that. But the price must be conveyed in other ways, and each individual manufacturer's MAP policy determines where the price can be seen.
				

					To see the price for this product at LightingDirect.com, you'll need to place it in your shopping cart, and maybe even proceed to final checkout. If you're not ready to buy the product, simply remove it from the cart.
				

					LightingDirect.com apologizes for any inconvenience. We'd just like to offer you the chance to save extra money while we adhere to manufacturers' MAP policies. LightingDirect.com is also working to educate manufacturers on how their policies impact customers and their buying behavior.

Why don't we show the price?

					Like many retailers, LightingDirect.com can choose to set its own prices independently. And even though manufacturers require LightingDirect.com and other retailers to display a product's "minimum advertised price" (or MAP), the retailer can choose to sell for less than that. But the price must be conveyed in other ways, and each individual manufacturer's MAP policy determines where the price can be seen.
				

					To see the price for this product at LightingDirect.com, you'll need to place it in your shopping cart, and maybe even proceed to final checkout. If you're not ready to buy the product, simply remove it from the cart.
				

					LightingDirect.com apologizes for any inconvenience. We'd just like to offer you the chance to save extra money while we adhere to manufacturers' MAP policies. LightingDirect.com is also working to educate manufacturers on how their policies impact customers and their buying behavior.

About Us








Finding the light within.
At Lighting Science, we believe lighting should work with our bodies and the environment, not against them. That’s why our LED lights are engineered to do more than simply light up spaces. They can actually help you sleep. Or keep you focused. They can even protect endangered wildlife. And they do it all while saving energy, costing less, and looking great.
Rethinking the humble light bulb.
When we think about light, we don’t just think of a bulb or a hue. We consider the genetics and biology of light—from the way it helps animals communicate to the way we use it to set our body clocks. With this scientific knowledge, we’ve created biological lighting innovations for NASA astronauts, new parents, and almost everyone in between.






 


 
Lighting the way to a better world.
By inventing breakthrough LED lighting solutions that truly work in sync with nature, we believe that people and animals across the globe will be safer, stronger, and healthier. Sure, it’s a revolutionary way to look at light. But it’s also as natural and clear as the sun itself.



Our Light Goes Beyond Just Lighting
Our lighting scientists have earned nearly 400 patents for their innovations. Our biologically-corrected lighting was first designed for NASA to help astronauts sleep better.

SCS Lighting Sleep-Ready Light. Sleep Better, Naturally! 7 watt LED AMBER Bulb. Supports healthy sleep patterns, Promotes Natural Melatonin Production with Ambient Low Blue Night Light. 


                        HACK YOUR CIRCADIAN CLOCK Your circadian clock (your sleep/wake cycle) has been tuned over thousands of years, to daily sunrise and sunset. With the SLEEP REDDY LIGHT, simulate a sunset every night with low blue light output and a soothing amber glow. Low blue light can help prevent sleep                        
                             cut out the blue light and give your system a chance to create melatonin naturally!, FALL ASLEEP NATURALLY Sleep soundly and wake up refreshed by cutting out blue light prior to sleep! The SLEEP REDDY LIGHT is engineered to emit specific wavelengths which have been studied by NASA, to improve sleep and keep your body producing melatonin, naturally! Ditch the sleeping pills, and synthetic melatonin, your body knows how to create what you need for a restful sleep. Better sleep for a better you!, THE NEXT GENERATION IN LIGHTING The 7 watt Amber LED light is rated to last 30,000+ hours, provides 630 lumens. The LED Bulb screws into any bedside lamp or NON-DIMMABLE lighting fixture. Sufficient to replace your Reading Light for bed, your LED Reading Light will not block melatonin levels, and you will be amazed how your sleep changes! Ditch the sleeping pills, and try the SLEEP REDDY LIGHT!, FIGHT FATIGUE With a Natural, restful sleep. Flip the switch to an LED light specifically engineered to help you sleep better, and feel less fatigued during the day. The amber glow also called "turtle safe" LED bulb is best used in a bedside lamp, while preparing for sleep. Save money on sleep aids, and sleep therapy, by tapping into your biological clock., COMPARE THE SLEEP REDDY LIGHT to traditional incandescent bulbs, fluorescent and CFL bulbs during the evening when preparing for sleep. Traditional bulbs are rich in blue wavelengths, which suppress melatonin - the sleep hormone. Your body responds to blue light by suppressing melatonin, keeping you alert and awake longer, even if you think you are asleep! Better Sleep quality, better rest, better you!,

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
