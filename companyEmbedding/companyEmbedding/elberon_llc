Located in Austin, Texas, Elberon Investment Fund was initially formed by Elberon LLC in January 2011 to manage the capital of its founder, along with the capital of a limited number of outside investors. As a value investor, we have an effective investment philosophy developed and honed over the past two decades, executed with passion, conviction and focus.  We look to uncover attractively priced companies with strong fundamentals that have been overlooked by the analyst community, large institutions and most of the market.

Elberon Development Group, a third-generation family business, has been developing, constructing, owning, and managing commercial real estate for almost 100 years. Founded by David O. Evans in 1918, the company began as a general contractor. From its beginnings as a builder and seller of homes in Union County, New Jersey, the company has evolved into a full-service commercial real estate business, while maintaining a localized geographic focus in the same area where the business started. As the Port of Elizabeth and Newark and Newark Airport grew and prospered, Elberon continued to develop and own a portfolio of commercial real estate in close proximity. Through the past several decades, tenants have included General Motors, Kraft Foods, Wakefern Food Corp (Shop Rite), Federal Express, DHL, and the United States Postal Service.
Presently, Elberon Development owns and manages a portfolio of approximately 2 million square feet, much of which consists of warehouse space in Elizabeth, NJ, within two miles of either the airport or the Port. The portfolio includes several of the same properties originally developed by the founder of the Company, and several others acquired from third parties. During the past 10 years, many of the sites developed during the 1960s or 1970s have been demolished and redeveloped to create modern, state-of-the art warehouse and office space suitable for the exacting demands of todayâs most quality-oriented tenants. Other properties not fully redeveloped have been substantially renovated or repositioned.
In 2012, the Company received the prestigious NJ-NAIOP Deal of the Year Award for a complex and time-sensitive transaction that resulted in development and construction of a 524,000-square-foot modern distribution and grocery warehouse for Wakefern Food Corp.
The Elberon Group’s most recent major project involves the purchase and planned redevelopment of two sites in Elizabeth, following acquisition of the property in December 2013 and the finalization of a joint venture with The Avidan Group. Ownership expects to construct one or more build-to-suit projects on the land.
Elberon will continue to look for opportunities to leverage its local expertise to grow through acquisition or development in the same geographic area. The Company also provides services to third parties on a selective basis in the form of property management, asset management, or consulting as to leasing, renovation, or development.

About 
Founded by Bruce Salomon in 2011, Elberon Investment Fund is a Texas-based value fund that makes concentrated investments in mid, small, and micro-cap companies. Bruce Salomon has over 20 years of investment experience through multiple market cycles. We focus our efforts on the least efficient part of the market where hard work and skill lead to superior long-term returns.
“Wide diversification is only required when investors do not understand what they are doing.” — Warren Buffett

Strategy

Strategy 
Elberon Investment Fund is a long-biased value investor. We develop a deep fundamental understanding of companies, industries, and their competitive position which allows us to identify where market price differs significantly from intrinsic value. We focus on situations that have an asymmetric risk/reward ratio and allocate resources to our highest conviction ideas.
We specialize in identifying neglected or misunderstood companies, and recognize opportunities where most others see only difficulties. We research and invest heavily when the odds are overwhelmingly in our favor and conviction is high.
“Occasionally the stock market offers us the chance to buy non-controlling pieces of extraordinary businesses at truly ridiculous prices — dramatically below those commanded in negotiated transactions that transfer control.” — Warren Buffett

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

                        LegalZoom.com has received 3.76 out of 5 stars based on 33 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
