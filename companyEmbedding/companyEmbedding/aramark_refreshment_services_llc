FOOD THAT ENRICHES EXPERIENCES






When great food turns a meal into a memory, we know we’ve done our job.







Food inspired by the people we serve.
A revitalizing lunch that powers a team through the workday. 
A warm meal that fuels students through finals. 
The essential nutrients that help a patient recover.
A game-time snack that energizes the most devoted fan.
We create memorable food experiences wherever people work, learn, recover and play.
Whether it’s designing an innovative menu based on consumer insights, setting high service standards, or ensuring we have the right people with the right skills, we put those we serve at the core of what we do.
Our approach is simple:

Craft chef-inspired menus with high-quality ingredients 
Encourage healthier living with nutritious options
Offer convenience that fits different lifestyles
Enable personalized experiences through exceptional service

We believe that excellent food can enhance experiences and empower people to be better. So we work to channel our passion for food into enriching and nourishing the lives we touch. And we do it with a singular goal: to enable great food experiences that go beyond what’s expected.








OUR PASSION FOR FOOD GOES INTO EVERY ITEM WE CRAFT.
See how we feed people’s desire for experiences that matter.













WE BRING FLAVOR TO MANY INDUSTRIES AND SETTINGS

	Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR), Waterbury, Vt., announced that Aramark Refreshment Services LLC, Philadelphia, will acquire the Van Houtte U.S. Coffee Service business, also known as Filterfresh, from GMCR for approximately $145 million.

	The purchase price is subject to adjustment based on Filterfresh’s working capital and indebtedness as of immediately prior to the transaction’s closing.

	GMCR acquired Van Houtte in December 2010 through the purchase of the outstanding capital stock of LJVH Holdings Inc. At the time of the acquisition, GMCR announced it would pursue a sale of a portion of the former Van Houtte business, namely the Filterfresh division, the company says.

	“We believe there is a strong strategic fit between the Filterfresh business and Aramark and we look forward to continuing to work with Aramark as a valued distributor,” said Dave Manly, general manager of the Away from Home business for GMCR’s Keurig business unit, in a statement.

	Through its Refreshment Services group, Aramark provides a wide range of food and beverage services, supplying more than 1 billion cups of coffee annually to business and industry clients worldwide, the company says.

	“Aramark and Filterfresh are both leaders in providing excellent service and quality office coffee and other refreshments to employees in the workplace,” said Jonathan Peters, executive vice president of Aramark Refreshment Services, in a statement. “We look forward to satisfying even more customers through this new partnership.”

	The acquisition agreement is subject to various closing conditions, including obtaining regulatory approval in the United States.
