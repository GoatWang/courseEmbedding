Introduction to The Bahamas


The Commonwealth of The Bahamas, one of the largest financial centres in the world, is directly accessible from a number of major cities. It shares the same time zone as New York, Toronto, and Miami, making it especially convenient for international investors and businesses operating out of those North American business centres.
One of the jurisdictions most notable attributes is the complete absence of income tax. Capital gains and estates are equally free from taxation, making The Bahamas an attractive place to conduct business. The Bahamian government has shown itself committed to meeting the evolving needs of the international community. The local currency, the Bahamian dollar, is fixed at par to the U.S. dollar.
CIBC has been active in the area since 1957. Today, CIBC Trust Company (Bahamas) Limited employs an experienced team of professionals and offers a comprehensive range of services including trust and company administration mutual fund administration, the management of banks and trust companies, and a full range of discretionary investment services.

Description
Introduction to The Bahamas:

The Commonwealth of The Bahamas, one of the largest financial centres in the world, is directly accessible from a number of major cities. It shares the same time zone as New York, Toronto, and Miami, making it especially convenient for international investors and businesses operating out of those North American business centres.

One of the jurisdictions most notable attributes is the complete absence of income tax. Capital gains and estates are equally free from taxation, making The Bahamas an attractive place to conduct business. The Bahamian government has shown itself committed to meeting the evolving needs of the international community. The local currency, the Bahamian dollar, is fixed at par to the U.S. dollar.

CIBC has been active in the area since 1957. Today, CIBC Trust Company (Bahamas) Limited employs an experienced team of professionals and offers a comprehensive range of services including trust and company administration mutual fund administration, the management of banks and trust companies, and a full range of discretionary investment services.

Short description




On October 14th, 2002, Barclays Bank PLC based in London, United Kingdom and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) based in Toronto, Canada combined their retail, corporate and offshore Caribbean banking operations and launched FirstCaribbean International Bank. FirstCaribbean brought together two complementary and leading financial services businesses in the Caribbean, and the promise to offer our customers enhanced products and improved and extended access to banking services. On December 22nd, 2006, CIBC became the majority shareholder in the organisation, now holding 91.5% of the bank's shares in CIBC FirstCaribbean International Bank. CIBC is a leading North American financial institution serving clients in Canada and around the world. It was recently named the strongest bank in North America and the third strongest bank in the world...
 On June 20, 2011 we proudly announced that we would be co-branded under the CIBC banner, adopting the branding CIBC FirstCaribbean. The addition of CIBC to the FirstCaribbean brand emphasizes CIBC's long-term commitment to the Caribbean region, our employees and our clients. The brand combines the strength of two powerful organizations with CIBC FirstCaribbean representing the proud heritage and uniqueness of the Caribbean, backed by the financial strength of CIBC. Our clients and our employees across the Caribbean will continue to benefit from the long-term investment that CIBC is making in the Caribbean - a history that dates back to our first branches opened in 1836...
 CIBC FirstCaribbean is a major Caribbean bank offering a full range of market-leading financial services in Corporate Banking, Retail Banking, Wealth Management, Credit Cards, Treasury Sales and Trading, and Investment Banking. It is the largest, regionally-listed bank in the English and Dutch speaking Caribbean. The bank has over 2,700 staff, 59 branches, 22 banking centres, and seven offices in 17 regional markets.

What is a SWIFT code?

SWIFT codes are used to identify banks and financial institutions worldwide. They are used by the swift network to transmit wire transfers (money transactions) and messages between them. For international wire transfers, swift codes are always required in order to make transactions secure and fast.










These codes were initially introduced by the SWIFT organization as “swift codes” but were later standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as “BIC” meaning “Business Identifier Codes”. Most people think B.I.C. stands for “Bank Identifier Codes” (“bank” instead of “business”) but that is incorrect since non-financial institutions can also join the swift network.


A “BIC code” can be seen by many different names, like “SWIFT code” (most common), “SWIFT ID”, “SWIFT-BIC”, “SWIFT address”, “BEI” (that comes from “Business Entity Identifier”), or even “ISO 9362”, which is the standard format that has been approved by the ISO organization. The acronym SWIFT stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication.


In depth analysis of a swift code

Swift codes are broken down into sections, in the same way telephone numbers are broken into sections, and every section reveals some information about the institution that was assigned this code. They consist of eight or eleven characters. Whenever an eight-character code is used, then it is referring to the headquarters (main office) of the institution.Here is how an 11-character code is broken down and what each section of characters represents. Let's take this imaginary 11-character swift code: 

AAAABBCCDDD


It can be broken down to these sections:

AAAA – BB – CC - DDD


Section 1 (the first 4-characters “AAAA”): This code is used to identify the institution’s global presence (all branches and all divisions around the world). For example, “CHAS” is used for “JPMORGAN CHASE BANK”











Section 2 (5th and 6th characters “BB”): This two-letter code represents the country of this particular institution’s branch and follows the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 standard for representing country codes. For example, “US” for “UNITED STATES”, “GB” for “UNITED KINGDOM”, CA for “CANADA”, etc.


Section 3 (7th and 8th characters “CC”): These characters represent a location code (e.g. “FF” is the code for “Frankfurt”, “KK” is the code for Copenhagen, etc.) and also the second character (8th in the B.I.C.) sometimes carries this information:



If it is equal to “0”, then it typically is a BIC assigned for testing purposes (as opposed to a BIC used on the live network).
If it is equal to “1”, then it denotes a passive participant in the SWIFT network.
If it is equal to "2", then it typically denotes a “reverse billing” BIC, meaning that the recipient of the message has to pay for the message.


Section 4 (9th to 11th characters “DDD”): These final three characters form a “branch code” that refers to the particular branch of the institution. If this section is omitted, then we have an 8-character swift code that is assumed to refer to the HEAD OFFICE of the institution. Also, a typical naming convention is that in the case we are referring to the main offices of an institution, this branch code is “XXX”.


Some popular swift code searches:



Bank of America swift code: Bank of America BOFAUS3NXXX (or simply: BOFAUS3N)
Chase swift code: JP Morgan Chase CHASUS33XXX (or simply: CHASUS33)
HSBC swift code: HSBC Bank PLC MIDLGB22XXX (or simply MIDLGB22)

The transaction, for a purchase price of US$76.8 million, effectively transfers direct ownership of two of CIBC’s Caribbean wealth management firms to its regional affiliate FirstCaribbean in exchange for a larger stake in that entity.FirstCaribbean will issue 51,917,808 common shares in its capital as payment for the Cayman and Bahamas trust companies. CIBC Investments (Cayman) Ltd will at the conclusion of the transaction own 1,445,725,257 or 91.67 per cent (91.39 per cent prior to the transaction) of the shares of FirstCaribbean.“It is great to become part of the FirstCaribbean family,” commented Ben Gillooly, CEO of the acquired entities. “We will be able to leverage FirstCaribbean’s diverse footprint in the Caribbean Region to deliver our products and services to wealth and institutional customers.”   Chairman of FirstCaribbean Michael Mansoor added that the acquisition by FirstCaribbean at this time “speaks to the confidence we place in our wealth segment to leverage the expertise and product offerings of our parent Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and become the market leading wealth services provider in this region.”00   NO COMMENTS- Advertisement -      SUBSCRIBE TO THE COMPASS NEWSLETTERMORE NEWS FROM THIS WEEKMan charged for firearms, criminal property July 20, 2017Prisons boss gets new contract July 25, 2017Police Bail extended for Brac artist July 26, 2017 Cayman Compass is the Cayman Islands' most trusted news website.
