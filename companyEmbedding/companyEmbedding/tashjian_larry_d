Brigham Young University - Marriott School of Management

                    The J. Willard and Alice Sheets Marriott School of Management (MSM) is a business school located in Provo, Utah at Brigham Young University (BYU), a private university in the United States of America owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Going by several different names since its inception in 1891, the business school at BYU has been known as the Marriott School of Management since 1988, when Marriott International founders J. Willard and Alice Marriott made a $15 million donation to the school. The MSM is housed on-campus in the N. Eldon Tanner Building and offers four undergraduate and seven graduate degrees.

Ethical decision-making is strongly emphasized at the school: undergraduate students are required to complete 14 hours of religion coursework for graduation, all MSM students must take at least one course in management ethics, and both students and faculty must commit to abide by the university's honor code. The school also exhibits a unique culture because the majority of its student and faculty bodies are members of the LDS Church.

  valued-based manager in all asset classes. Prior to starting CAM Capital Advisors, 
  he was Chief Executive Officer of Provident Investment Counsel ("PIC"),

  growth. In 1995, he was intimately involved in the sale of PIC to United Asset

  on its board of directors. Near the end of 2000, United Asset Management was 
  acquired by Old Mutual PLC. Prior to joining PIC, Mr. Tashjian worked for the 
  Bank of America, both in retail banking and corporate finance, and his professional 
  career in investment management spans over 30 years. Mr. Tashjian's other professional 
  activities have included directorships at Bavarian Specialty Food Products,

  and PGP Capital Advisors. He also currently serves as Chairman of Investment 
  Managers Series Trust II, a multiple series trust investment company. In 2001, 
  Mr. Tashjian helped found Professional Business Bank in Pasadena, California, 
  which was initially sold to Belvedere Capital Management in 2005, and maintained 
  his involvement with Professional Business Bank through continued board participation 
  until the bank was ultimately sold again in late 2010. During this period of 
  time, he served on the audit committee and chaired both the compensation and 
  loan committees.
