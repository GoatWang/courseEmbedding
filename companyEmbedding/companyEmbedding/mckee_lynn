		About Us | McKee Foods
	




































McKee — A Family Bakery
McKee Foods is best known for our line of Little Debbie brand snack cakes. Little Debbie® is America's leading snack cake brand because we provide consumers with quality products of excellent value.
A family-run company
We are a privately-held, family-run company with a history of innovation and a deeply held belief in the importance of doing business with integrity. Our founding family, the McKee family, is still actively involved in guiding our overall business direction as well as our day-to-day operations.
The McKee family is deeply committed to the company's employees, and each year all eligible full-time and part-time employees receive a share of the company's profits. They live the belief that A Better Way… Begins with Me and expect it to be applied at every level of our organization. Our history of family ownership is one significant way we're different from so many companies doing business today.
How we live and work 
McKee Foods is an equal opportunity employer. Our employees are essential to our continued success. An atmosphere of understanding, cooperation and mutual trust is fostered at all levels. The work environment also encourages personal development and advancement in order to attract, stimulate and reward outstanding employees.

		Company Locations | McKee Foods
	




































Company Locations



 Most of McKee Foods' 6,300 employees work at manufacturing facilities in three states. Having these plants in strategic locations allows the company to deliver fresher products all over the United States and Canada.
 

Collegedale & Chattanooga


 In 1956, McKee Foods moved from Chattanooga to Collegedale, Tennessee . Once the company launched the Little Debbie® line of snacks in 1960, it wasn't long until we needed additional facilities. We expanded in Collegedale for many years, and recently acquired a facility in Chattanooga. 
Gentry


 When we again outgrew our facilities in southeast Tennessee, we opened a plant in Gentry, Arkansas , to allow us to serve more states in the West. The Gentry Plant has been expanded several times to meet ever-growing demand for our products. 
Stuarts Draft


 Plans to expand further into the northeastern United States and Canada prompted construction of a plant in Stuarts Draft, Virginia . That plant houses some of the company's most innovative technology, and it carries on McKee Foods' rich tradition of using the most advanced processes and machinery in the baking industry. 
Kingman


 McKee Foods Kingman, LLC, opened in 1995 to help facilitate growth in the western United States. Since opening, our Kingman, Arizona  facility has upgraded its warehouse and built a new truck garage.

W. McKee Manufacturing


Manure spreading goes high-tech with Eaton products “McKee was so impressed with the VMQ pump’s performance that it made a decision—almost on the spot—to standardize on it for new builds.” Curtis Steele HyPOWER technical group manager Background Manure has long been known as a valuable organic fertilizer for soil. It promotes nutrient and water retention, enabling soil to become more fertile. Although the nutrient value of manure is time-honored, machinery for spreading manure over farmland is anything but dated. Truckmounted, hydraulic manure spreaders made by W. McKee Manufacturing Ltd. of Red Deer, Alberta, Canada, have come into a new age of efficiency with an increased lineup of hydraulic components from Eaton’s Hydraulics Group. Joining Eaton Char-Lynn® motors on McKee standard and fully hydraulic manure spreaders are Vickers VMQ Series fixed-displacement vane pumps, a Vickers manifold with screw-in cartridge valves, and an EFX controller with CONTROL F(x)™ programming software. The Eaton products are supplied to McKee by HyPOWER Systems, an Eaton distributor in Calgary, Alberta. Challenge Well-satisfied with the performance of Eaton pumps and HyPOWER’s customer care, McKee called on HyPOWER when it began experiencing delivery issues with a competitive pump supplier. “We suggested Eaton’s new VMQ pump to drive the Char-Lynn motor that turns floor chains”, says Curtis Steele, HyPOWER technical group manager, “and a double-pump design on spreader models that also require hydraulic beaters. The newness of the VMQ, however, made the folks at McKee hesitant to give it a try. They said that in spite of delivery issues, the competitive pumps were well-seated in the Alberta marketplace as a reliable power source.” Solution Steele emphasized the VMQ’s performance strengths, including its 3,500-psi high-pressure rating and thick casting that makes the pump quieter and more durable than the competitive pump. He also stressed HyPOWER’s inventory support and commissioning services. After a thorough product study, McKee agreed to test the pump on a fully hydraulic manure spreader—a decision that resulted in quick orders. “McKee was so impressed with the VMQ pump’s performance that it made a decision—almost on the spot—to standardize on it for new builds,” Steele says. The VMQ turned out to be the perfect fit for aftermarket replacements as well. Since the shaft and mount are the same as the previously used pump, the VMQ pump was a convenient drop-in replacement. Adding to the pump’s functionality is the fact that it can be easily changed to left- or right-hand rotation to accommodate different chassis models. “Standardizing on the VMQ for the aftermarket was a big benefit for McKee, since it no longer needed to inventory two pump styles,” Steele adds. Results The VMQ pump led the way to more Eaton product installations on McKee manure spreaders. “Once the pump was in place, we started looking at the spreaders from a system standpoint,” Steele reflects. “We replaced a mobile sectional valve and several auxiliary components with Vickers screw-in cartridge valves in a streamlined manifold that controls all the spreader’s hydraulic functions, including a proportional floor speed control.” Next HyPOWER went to work updating the manure feed system by replacing manual variable controls with modern HMI and GPS controls to facilitate variable application rates based on vehicle speed. Steele developed the sophisticated system by utilizing Eaton’s comprehensive F(x) electrohydraulic architecture. Along with Eaton proportional valves, he chose an Eaton EFX 1640 electronic controller, a VFX 100-m LCD display, and the standards based CONTROL F(x) programming suite to pull it all together. Because of HyPOWER’s F(x) expertise, McKee spreaders now incorporate intuitive control screens, enabling end-users to easily control the rate of manure release as the spreaders traverse farmland. “Even though manure is an organic substance, spreading it costs money,” says HyPOWER’s Glen Befus, HyPOWER technical sales, who is now managing the McKee account. “By employing a variable-rate dispersion system, electrohydraulic controls give the manure spreaders maximum efficiency by enabling operators to continuously monitor and control application rates.”

Job Details
               Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of proprietary pharmacological abuse-deterrent opioid products and niche generic products. Elite specializes in oral sustained and controlled release drug products with high barriers to entry. Elite has eight commercial products currently being sold, several additional approved products pending manufacturing site transfer and an additional product under review pending approval by the FDA. Elite's lead pipeline products include abuse-deterrent opioids utilizing the Company's patented proprietary technology, and a once-daily opioid. They are sustained release oral formulations of opioids for the treatment of chronic pain, which address two of the limitations of existing oral opioids: the provision of consistent relief of baseline pain levels and deterrence of potential abuse. Elite also provides contract manufacturing for Ascend Laboratories (a subsidiary of Alkem Laboratories Ltd.) and has partnered with Epic Pharma for the manufacturing and distribution of eleven approved products pending manufacturing site transfer, with Akorn, Inc. to develop an intermediate for a generic product, and a Hong Kong based company to develop a branded product for the United States market and its territories. Elite operates a cGMP and DEA registered facility for research, development, and manufacturing located in Northvale, NJ.
