Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

North Carolina Farm Bureau Insurance Group


                                            I highly recommend Farm Bureau Insurance. Nathan Ray cares about his clients. As my agent, Nathan meets me with intelligence, patience, humor, warmth, knowledge and empathy.

Electro Savings Credit Union


                                            Electro Savings approve loans under a different set of rules to African Americans than Caucasian customers!  I was 7% above their threshold and when I asked to add a cosigner the answer was still NO!   DO NOT PATRONIZE!

                                            After getting fed-up with SEFCU’s “nickel-and-dime” fee structure and lack of branches/ATMs in my area, I decided to close my account in April 2017.
