 Client Testimonials 

								William Rice Atty							
Attorney William Rice did an exceptional job in representing me in getting Social Security disability benefits. A former Attorney put in very little work on my case and when I was denied of benefits, he told me to seek other representation. William Rice took time to thoroughly look over my case history, medical records, etc….
