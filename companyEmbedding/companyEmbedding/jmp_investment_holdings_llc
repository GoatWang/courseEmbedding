FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Accord Group Holdings has received a preferred equity investment from JMP Group, an investment banking and alternative asset management firm. Terms of the financing were not disclosed. Accord is a provider of investment management and advisory services to the real estate private equity industry.
PRESS RELEASE
Accord Group Holdings LLC, a provider of investment management and advisory services to the real estate private equity industry, announced today that it has received a preferred equity investment from JMP Group Inc., an investment banking and alternative asset management firm. Terms of the financing were not disclosed. The composition of Accord’s management committee remains unchanged.
“We plan to take our business to the next level by having the capital that allows us to remain highly aligned with our investors while expanding the range of creative, highly differentiated strategies that we can offer them.”
The funding will enable Accord to facilitate additional hires, overseas expansion and strategic investments in sponsors of real estate private equity funds. “We are pleased to achieve this important milestone for our company with JMP, a leader in providing equity research, institutional brokerage and investment banking services for growth companies and their investors.” said Jack Berquist, a Managing Partner and Co-Founder at Accord. Joe Jolson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of JMP Group added, “Jack and I worked together at Nationsbanc Montgomery in the late 1990’s. JMP is delighted to partner with Accord and provide growth capital to build a world class business.” 





Accord was founded by Jack Berquist, Desi Co and Jeff Sobczynski in 2013. During their careers, Accord’s principals have raised more than $18 billion in equity capital from some of the preeminent institutions in the real estate private equity industry and have completed more than 30 real estate fund investments.
Desi Co, a Managing Partner and Co-Founder of Accord, said, “Real estate private equity inflows remain heavily skewed toward a handful of very large, diversified global players. As a result, many capital-starved sponsors have been left behind that continue to manage highly valuable portfolios of real estate in suboptimal ownership structures. This creates an opportunity for Accord to inject its capital and leverage its core skills to maximize value.”
Jeff Sobczynski, an Accord Managing Partner and Co-Founder that oversees Accord’s investment management business added, “We plan to take our business to the next level by having the capital that allows us to remain highly aligned with our investors while expanding the range of creative, highly differentiated strategies that we can offer them.”

Through its affiliates, Accord provides investment management services for both institutional and high-net-worth investors as well as advisory and capital raising services.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.
