Shares of Select Medical Holdings Corporation (SEM) broke into a new 52-week high yesterday, hitting a peak of $16.70. 
Shares closed at $16.50 after opening at $16.25 for a move of 2.17%. The company now has a market cap of $2.19 billion.

Investors and traders can learn a lot about a stock’s momentum when it sets a new 52-week high. As an example, bullish investors view a company hitting its highest price in a year as a sign of 
momentum and may interpret it as a signal to buy. On the other hand, bearish investors could view a new 52-week high as a signal of the end of a strong run, with the stock possibly peaking out 
before an impending period of decline.


For Select Medical Holdings Corporation, the new 52-week high came on volume of 1.73 million. The stock has a float of 132.76 million shares and average daily volume of $722,368. It has a 
50-day SMA of $14.51 and a 200-day SMA of $13.56. Select Medical Holdings Corporation now has a P/E ratio of 27.8.

 Trade 

Select Medical Holdings Corporation (SEM) traded on unusually high volume on Jul. 19, as the stock 
gained 2.17% to close at $16.50. On the day, Select Medical Holdings Corporation saw 1.73 million shares trade hands on 6,805 trades.

company, potentially setting up a more meaningful move in stock price. The added volume also provides a level of support and stability for price advances.

The stock has traded between $16.35 and $10.20 over the last 52-weeks, its 50-day SMA is now $14.51, and its 200-day SMA $13.56. Select Medical Holdings Corporation

What Our Job Candidates Are Saying



Each interview was handled extremely professionally, everyone went out of their way to ensure I was comfortable, and I felt welcome and valued throughout the entire process.
EP, Pennsylvania



I am almost sad that my interviewing is over with Select Medical. I have met so many wonderful people, who couldn’t have been more gracious and welcoming. I heard from the Manager of Recruitment today, assuring me that she has my resume close at hand should anything cross her desk that would seem like a good fit. It was so nice of her to take the time to call me and close the loop on my time spent there.
I certainly do hope that I will end up as a member of the Select Medical Team, but regardless, it has been the most pleasurable interview experience I have ever experienced. A group of first class people all the way.Thank you for everything, your time, your warmth, and genuine interest.

MECHANICSBURG, Pa., Jan. 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Select Medical Holdings Corporation ("Select Medical") (NYSE:   SEM), today announced its business outlook for calendar year 2017.








Select Medical expects consolidated net operating revenues for the full year 2017 to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion.  Select Medical expects net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, other income/(expense), and equity in earnings/(losses), or Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2017 to be in the range of $540 million to $580 million.  Select Medical expects fully diluted income per common share for the full year 2017 to be in the range of $0.73 to $0.91. 
Select Medical assumed a 40.0% effective tax rate and total shares outstanding of 133 million when preparing the above business outlook for 2017.  The share count includes unvested restricted shares, which have participation rights and are allocated an equitable portion of earnings under the two-class method for calculating income per common share.
The following is a reconciliation of full year 2017 Adjusted EBITDA expectations as computed to the low and high points of the range to the closest comparable GAAP financial measure.  Refer to Select Medical's most recent Form 10-Q filing for a discussion of Select Medical's use of Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating financial performance and determining resource allocation.  Each item presented in the table below is an estimation of full year 2017 expectations.

Select Medical's joint venture subsidiary Concentra operated 301 centers in 38 states.

Information about Select Medical is available at www.selectmedical.com.
Certain statements contained herein that are not descriptions of historical facts are "forward-looking" statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995).  Because such statements include risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements due to factors including the following:

changes in government reimbursement for our services due to the implementation of healthcare reform legislation, deficit reduction measures, and/or new payment policies (including, for example, the expiration of the moratorium limiting the full application of the 25 Percent Rule that would reduce our Medicare payments for those patients admitted to a long term acute care hospital from a referring hospital in excess of an applicable percentage admissions threshold) may result in a reduction in net operating revenues, an increase in costs and a reduction in profitability; 
the impact of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, which establishes new payment limits for Medicare patients who do not meet specified criteria, may result in a reduction in net operating revenues and profitability of our long term acute care hospitals; 
the failure of our specialty hospitals to maintain their Medicare certifications may cause our net operating revenues and profitability to decline; 
the failure of our facilities operated as "hospitals within hospitals" to qualify as hospitals separate from their host hospitals may cause our net operating revenues and profitability to decline; 
a government investigation or assertion that we have violated applicable regulations may result in sanctions or reputational harm and increased costs; 
acquisitions or joint ventures may prove difficult or unsuccessful, use significant resources or expose us to unforeseen liabilities; 
our plans and expectations related to the acquisitions of Concentra Inc. and Physiotherapy Associates Holdings, Inc. and our ability to realize anticipated synergies; 
private third-party payors for our services may undertake future cost containment initiatives that could limit our future net operating revenues and profitability; 
the failure to maintain established relationships with the physicians in the areas we serve could reduce our net operating revenues and profitability; 
shortages in qualified nurses, therapists, physicians, or other licensed providers could increase our operating costs significantly or limit our ability to staff our facilities; 
competition may limit our ability to grow and result in a decrease in our net operating revenues and profitability; 
the loss of key members of our management team could significantly disrupt our operations; 
the effect of claims asserted against us could subject us to substantial uninsured liabilities; and 
other factors discussed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including factors discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" of our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and of the annual report on Form 10-K.

Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we are under no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of any new information, future events or otherwise. You should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results or performance.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 03/03/2008
            

                BBB has determined that Select Medical Holdings Corp. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.

3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards.

5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur
                        
7. total cost of the transaction, including tax, shipping and handling, and other related charges



                    3. If selling products or providing services on Web sites or via other electronic means:

Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                                    4. explains why any relief sought by the complainant cannot or should not be granted.
                                





                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

History[edit]
Co-founded in 1996 by Rocco Ortenzio and Robert Ortenzio, Select Medical began as a regional provider of outpatient physical rehabilitation. Contract therapy was added to the company's specialized health care offerings in 1997, and was quickly followed by the introduction of long-term acute care in 1998. In 1999, Select Medical made one of its largest acquisitions by purchasing NovaCare Physical Rehabilitation and Occupational Health.
In April 2001, the company completed an initial public offering and was listed on NASDAQ. Fourteen months later, Select Medical was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, where it is currently traded under the NYSE: SEM ticker. In 2004, the company acquired the Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation, thus formally adding inpatient medical rehabilitation to its patient care offerings. Further growth in this newest care line continued through joint ventures with Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, SSM Health Care - St. Louis and Baylor Health Care System in 2011.
In 2015, Select Medical completed one of its largest acquisition to date when it entered into a joint venture partnership for the purchase of Concentra, a national health care company that delivers a wide range of medical services, including urgent care, occupational medicine and physical therapy.[2]
In 2016, Select Medical divested its Contract Therapy business, Select Medical Rehabilitation Services, to an affiliate of Revelstoke Capital Partners LLC.[3] Select Medical also acquired Physiotherapy Associates, a national provider of outpatient physical rehabilitation care.[4] This acquisition continues to grow Select Medical's portfolio of outpatient rehabilitation clinics.
Twenty years later, the Select Medical of today encompasses three areas of expertise: long-term acute care, inpatient medical rehabilitation, and outpatient physical therapy, all of which are delivered and supported by more than 42,000 colleagues across the United States.

History[edit]
Co-founded in 1996 by Rocco Ortenzio and Robert Ortenzio, Select Medical began as a regional provider of outpatient physical rehabilitation. Contract therapy was added to the company's specialized health care offerings in 1997, and was quickly followed by the introduction of long-term acute care in 1998. In 1999, Select Medical made one of its largest acquisitions by purchasing NovaCare Physical Rehabilitation and Occupational Health.
In April 2001, the company completed an initial public offering and was listed on NASDAQ. Fourteen months later, Select Medical was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, where it is currently traded under the NYSE: SEM ticker. In 2004, the company acquired the Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation, thus formally adding inpatient medical rehabilitation to its patient care offerings. Further growth in this newest care line continued through joint ventures with Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, SSM Health Care - St. Louis and Baylor Health Care System in 2011.
In 2015, Select Medical completed one of its largest acquisition to date when it entered into a joint venture partnership for the purchase of Concentra, a national health care company that delivers a wide range of medical services, including urgent care, occupational medicine and physical therapy.[2]
In 2016, Select Medical divested its Contract Therapy business, Select Medical Rehabilitation Services, to an affiliate of Revelstoke Capital Partners LLC.[3] Select Medical also acquired Physiotherapy Associates, a national provider of outpatient physical rehabilitation care.[4] This acquisition continues to grow Select Medical's portfolio of outpatient rehabilitation clinics.
Twenty years later, the Select Medical of today encompasses three areas of expertise: long-term acute care, inpatient medical rehabilitation, and outpatient physical therapy, all of which are delivered and supported by more than 42,000 colleagues across the United States.

History[edit]
Co-founded in 1996 by Rocco Ortenzio and Robert Ortenzio, Select Medical began as a regional provider of outpatient physical rehabilitation. Contract therapy was added to the company's specialized health care offerings in 1997, and was quickly followed by the introduction of long-term acute care in 1998. In 1999, Select Medical made one of its largest acquisitions by purchasing NovaCare Physical Rehabilitation and Occupational Health.
In April 2001, the company completed an initial public offering and was listed on NASDAQ. Fourteen months later, Select Medical was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, where it is currently traded under the NYSE: SEM ticker. In 2004, the company acquired the Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation, thus formally adding inpatient medical rehabilitation to its patient care offerings. Further growth in this newest care line continued through joint ventures with Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, SSM Health Care - St. Louis and Baylor Health Care System in 2011.
In 2015, Select Medical completed one of its largest acquisition to date when it entered into a joint venture partnership for the purchase of Concentra, a national health care company that delivers a wide range of medical services, including urgent care, occupational medicine and physical therapy.[2]
In 2016, Select Medical divested its Contract Therapy business, Select Medical Rehabilitation Services, to an affiliate of Revelstoke Capital Partners LLC.[3] Select Medical also acquired Physiotherapy Associates, a national provider of outpatient physical rehabilitation care.[4] This acquisition continues to grow Select Medical's portfolio of outpatient rehabilitation clinics.
Twenty years later, the Select Medical of today encompasses three areas of expertise: long-term acute care, inpatient medical rehabilitation, and outpatient physical therapy, all of which are delivered and supported by more than 42,000 colleagues across the United States.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
