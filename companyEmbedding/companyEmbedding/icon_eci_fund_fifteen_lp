ICON Investments > Individual Investors > ECI Fund Fifteen
ICON ECI Fund Fifteen, L.P.
ICON ECI Fund Fifteen, L.P. (“Fund Fifteen”) is an equipment finance fund that will primarily make investments that are collateralized by equipment. Fund Fifteen’s investments will be in domestic and global companies that utilize equipment and other corporate infrastructure (collectively, “Capital Assets”) to operate their businesses. These investments will primarily be structured as debt and debt-like financings, such as loans and leases, that are collateralized by Capital Assets. In some cases, additional assets, such as accounts receivable, intellectual property, inventory, real estate and stock of such businesses, will collateralize Fund Fifteen’s investments to provide added security for such investments. For example, in the event that the Capital Assets that collateralize an investment are not sufficient to cover a loss, Fund Fifteen would also look to these other assets that were provided as security for its investment to mitigate its losses. There can be no assurance, however, that the Capital Assets and other assets securing Fund Fifteen’s investments will be sufficient to cover any losses that could occur in the event that a borrower or lessee defaults in its payments to Fund Fifteen.

(“Fund Fifteen").  Please read the Fund Fifteen prospectus carefully prior to making any investment decision and consider the risks, charges, expenses and other important information described therein.  Investment in any security involves risk and may lose value.  ICON Securities, LLC does not offer tax, legal, investment, or accounting advice.  Please consult an appropriate professional for advice in these areas.
