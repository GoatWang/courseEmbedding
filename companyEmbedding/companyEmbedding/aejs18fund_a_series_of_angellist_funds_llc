Introduction to AngelList, Part II: Funds



Editor’s note: This is Part 2 of a series on AngelList. Part 1 covers everything you need to know about investing in startups online through Angel.co. I suggest reading it first if you haven’t yet. There’s some important background information there. In this letter, we’ll look at AngelList funds, a new way to build a portfolio of startup investments.
Happy new year, readers,
When it comes to early-stage investing, I’ve found there are generally two theories. They boil down to this:
Spread out your bets across many promising startups to maximize the chance of hitting a grand slam. Help companies when you can.
Focus your investments in a select few startups per year. Then help them succeed.
Billionaire Peter Thiel is a big proponent of the second option, a focused approach. And it’s worked well for the co-founder of Paypal. He sold his early $500,000 stake in Facebook for $1 billion in 2012. That one was good for 2,000 times his investment. He’s made many successful, highly focused investments since.
But what works well for elite Silicon Valley VCs like Peter isn’t for everyone. To succeed with a highly targeted approach, you need millions dedicated to early-stage investments. Having a top-tier network in the Valley sure comes in handy when helping companies scale. And it wouldn’t hurt to have the deep experience that comes from turning a startup into a billion-dollar monster…
For the rest of us, I believe a diversified approach is better. And AngelList has a new line of funds designed for just this.
Each fund will invest in approximately 100 startups listed on AngelList. The current funds are built around themes. The Enterprise fund will invest in startups selling a product or service to businesses, for example. There’s also a Healthcare Fund, a West Coast fund and more on the way.
Fund investments are selected by the experienced team at AngelList, with some help from an advanced computer algorithm. According to a recent article in Fortune, deals are “selected by an algorithm with a bit of human curation on top, and may include stealthy startups that are not shown on AngelList’s public site.”
We don’t know exactly how the automated part of funds works. I suspect it’s mostly based on the quality of co-investors. So if the lead investor in a deal has an excellent track record, the system might tag it for further investigation.
I’ve invested in a few deals along with AngelList funds, and whatever they’re doing, it seems to be working. Those deals are some of my favorite picks: Navdy, Soothe, Cabify, MD Insider and others.
I’d guess that only around one in 15 startups that raise money on AngelList is chosen by funds. They’re selective.
I think of these vehicles like actively managed mutual funds. They just happen to invest in the first, second or third round of a company’s existence. More risk, higher potential reward.
How Much?
Minimum investments range from $20 to $25,000. And you need to be an accredited investor, as I mentioned in Part 1.
Spread out across 100 startups, your stake in each company would be small. But at this early stage of investment, even $200 could turn into quite a lot.
To demonstrate how $200 could turn into serious money down the road, let’s look at AngelList’s most well-known success story to date.
Uber, the on-demand taxi service, listed its seed financing round on AngelList in 2010. At the time, it was a totally unproven concept. There were a few early signs of its success in the local San Francisco market, but nothing earth-shattering.
Today, Uber’s valued at $40 billion. Investors in that deal have made an (estimated) 3,500 times their investments. A $200 investment would be worth around $700,000 today.
Admittedly, Uber is an extreme example. It’s rare that a startup scales that fast. In fact, most will fail before they get to a Series B or C, let alone a $40 billion Series E like Uber.
But the Uber example does show that AngelList and its funds have access to very good deal flow. Its founders are well-networked in the startup capital of the world. I’ve seen it firsthand, and made over 20 investments on the platform. You can see my profile here, and more examples of past AngelList deals here.
We won’t know how these funds will perform for a while. Seed-stage investments take time to grow. Some startups stay “lean” longer and grow slower. Some raise a ton of cash and try to scale at warp speed (Uber). Many fail. It’s the nature of startup investing and it all takes time.
I think AngelList funds will do well. They have high-quality deal flow, which is the critical factor when investing early.
Especially when compared with other investment options out there, I think these funds are a solid choice for those who can afford the risk.
Personally, I like to choose individual deals. But I can see the attraction of a single investment spread across 100 companies, especially if you’d rather not spend hours doing diligence on each deal or don’t feel comfortable picking individual startups.
You can see a list of current and “coming soon” funds on AngelList here. Answers to questions about fees, “carry” and more can be found here.
I had originally planned to cover AngelList’s impressive new hiring tools and “intros,” but funds ended up taking over. Watch for that in a future post.
Good investing,
Adam Sharp

A Run Through The Chinese Pavilion At TechCrunch Disrupt SF












AngelList is expanding globally and launching new vehicles for accredited investors to back what amounts to indexed AngelList syndicate funds for the top deals on the platform.
That’s the latest from AngelList co-founder Naval Ravikant and angel investor Gil Penchina from the stage of Disrupt SF 2014 as the angels who, along with CrunchFund investor (and TechCrunch founder) Michael Arrington, held the audience rapt.
The AngelList platform has grown increasingly robust, and through the syndicate vehicles can now invest in — and lead — Series A rounds, according to Navikant.
“Once my first fund got to $4 million there were people who weren’t able to get into every deal,” says Penchina. “So we launched the SAAS Syndicate… the Bitcoin syndicate, which is doing two deals; the IoT syndicate and a late stage syndicate, which is going to compete with late stage investors.”
Both Penchina and Ravikant see AngelList as a way to democratize the venture model from top to bottom, with the late-stage fund the latest shot from AngelList across the bow of traditional investors. At issue is the dilution that early-stage investors suffer in the high-priced later-stage rounds that have become the norm in Silicon Valley (and beyond) in recent years (thanks Andreessen Horowitz).



As the AngelList syndicates grow larger, they’re also professionalizing. Penchina has eight full-time staff working on his syndicate fund along with another 30 “volunteers.” So far, Penchina has deployed $3 million across his syndicates, but expects that number to soar to $10 million over the next 12 months.”
Ravikant envisions a system that allows an investor’s fund to grow as his experience and track record evolves. “It’s a smooth path up to a fund,” from angel investment, says Ravikant. “You can add backers as you go.”
AngelList is a way to add leverage to an investor’s checkbook. It’s additional firepower to compete against the more established and well-heeled investors in the venture community, and he argues it’s a better deal for the limited partners that invest in funds.
“Institutional LPs go into individual funds now,” he says.
Now that AngelList has managed to embed itself in the U.S. ecosystem, it’s casting its eye on markets around the world. The investment platform is in the process of obtaining regulatory clearance in the UK with plans to move into Canadian and Australian markets shortly thereafter.
The only problem with the AngelList model is the problem of overtaxing resources, both men said. “I’m in too many deals now,” Ravikant said.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
