At NAV

w/ Sales Charge


Go to ETFs >
      










 










 
Class A shares with sales charges performance reflects the maximum 5.5% sales charge, with the following exceptions: Class A shares of Hartford Unconstrained Bond, Hartford Emerging Markets Local Debt, Hartford High Yield, Hartford Inflation Plus, Hartford Municipal Opportunities, Hartford Municipal Real Return, Hartford Strategic Income, Hartford Total Return Bond, Hartford World Bond, Hartford Schroders Emerging Markets Debt and Currency, Hartford Schroders Tax-Aware Bond, Hartford Schroders Emerging Markets Multi-Sector Bond, Hartford Schroders Global Strategic Bond, and Hartford Schroders Income Builder reflect a maximum 4.5% sales charge; Class A shares of Hartford Floating Rate and Hartford Floating Rate High Income reflect a maximum 3.0% sales charge; Class A shares of Hartford Short Duration reflect a maximum 2.0% sales charge.
The performance at NAV does not reflect the impact of sales charges.  If sales charges were reflected the performance shown would have been lower.

Class B shares with sales charges performance reflects a six-year declining Contingent Deferred Sales Charge of 5%, 4%, 3%, 3%, 2%, 1%, respectively. 

Effective September 30, 2009, Class B shares of Hartford Funds closed to new investors, and no new or additional investments, including investments through a systematic investment plan, will be allowed in Class B shares, except for permitted exchanges. For additional information about your privileges with respect to Class B shares, please refer to your prospectus and its supplements.
Class C shares have no up-front sales charge and a 1% Contingent Deferred Sales Charge for 12 months. 

Class F shares, Class I shares, Class R3 shares, Class R4 shares, and Class R5 shares do not assess a sales charge.
R shares are institutional shares and are only available through employer-sponsored retirement plans and 529 college savings plans. R shares do not have front-end or deferred sales charges. However, distribution and other charges apply.
Please see a prospectus for more information about sales charges.
On 10/24/16, certain Schroder Funds ("Predecessor Funds") were reorganized into the Hartford Schroders Funds, that have substantially the same objectives and strategies as their corresponding Predecessor Fund. Performance prior to 10/24/16 reflects performance of the corresponding Predecessor Fund. If fees and expenses were reflected, performance would have differed. Please see the Fund’s detail page for additional Predecessor Fund performance information.

Distribution Yield at NAV (%) Distribution Yield at NAV is calculated by annualizing the distribution for the current period and dividing by the NAV. The Fund's distribution may be comprised of ordinary income and/or returns of capital. The distribution yield is not indicative of current or future fund performance.
Trailing 12 Month Distribution Yield (%) Trailing 12 Month Distribution Yield is the percentage of income aportfolio returned over the past 12 months.

The SEC Yield (%) is the fund’s 30-Day SEC Yield, which represents the hypothetical net investment income earned by the fund over a 30-day period, expressed as an annual percentage rate based on the fund’s share price at the end of the 30-day period. This hypothetical income will differ (at times significantly) from the fund’s actual experience; income distributions from the fund may be higher or lower than implied by the SEC yield. Note: The SEC Yield displayed for the Inflation Plus Fund is the yield of the securities within the portfolio adjusted for inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Because of the inflation adjustment, this Fund’s 30-day yield may be more volatile, and differ substantially from one month to the next, than 30-day SEC yields quoted on traditional (nominal) bond investments.
The Unsub SEC Yield (%) is the Fund's Unsubsidized 30-Day SEC yield without the impact of fee/expense waivers.
On 10/24/16, certain Schroder Funds (“Predecessor Funds”) were reorganized into the Hartford Schroders Funds, that have substantially the same objectives and strategies as their corresponding Predecessor Fund. Performance prior to 10/24/16 reflects performance of the corresponding Predecessor Fund. If fees and expenses were reflected, performance would have differed. Please see the Fund’s detail page for additional Predecessor Fund performance information.

About Us


































About Us
At Hartford Funds, we think differently about money management. Because as much as fund companies and asset managers would like our business to be all about the numbers, it’s not.

 It’s about much more.

 It’s about investors. It’s about advisors. It’s about relationships, confidence and trust.























That’s why our approach is something we call human-centric investing. Human-centric investing works to understand the relationships between investors, their money and their financial advisors…and then create the products and advisor tools designed to serve those investors and their mindsets.
We believe that human-centric investing can create products and advisor tools that not only strengthen bottom lines, but strengthen advisor-client relationships by helping investors better realize their true life goals.
Hartford Funds has $87.1 billion total assets under management as of March 31, 2017 (excluding assets used in certain annuity products). Our line-up includes more than 55 mutual funds in a variety of styles and asset classes and five strategic beta ETFs and two active ETFs. Our mutual funds (with the exception of certain fund of funds) are primarily sub-advised by Wellington Management Company LLP or Schroder Investment Management North America Inc., two institutional managers with comprehensive global investment capabilities. The strategic beta ETFs offered by Hartford Funds are designed to help address investors' evolving needs by leveraging a distinct risk-optimized approach, which identifies risks within each asset class and then deliberately and systematically re-allocates capital toward risks more likely to enhance return potential.
No matter the asset class or type of fund, Hartford Funds will always strive to meet or exceed traditional industry benchmarks, but through human-centric investing, we intend to also raise the bar on performance, and make it mean more than numbers alone.
Because at Hartford Funds…
 
Our benchmark is the investor.

Interpretive Letter to Edward P. Macdonald, Hartford Funds Distributors, LLC




May 12, 2015
Edward P. Macdonald
	Executive Vice President, Deputy General Counsel
	Hartford Funds Distributors, LLC
	5 Radnor Corporate Center
	100 Matsonford Road, Suite 300
	Radnor, PA  19087
Re: Provision of Related Performance Information to Institutional Investors
Dear Mr. Macdonald:
In your letter of May 7, 2015, you request interpretive guidance on behalf of Hartford Funds Distributors, LLC (“Hartford Funds”), an underwriter and wholesale distributor of registered mutual funds, regarding the use of related performance information (as defined below) in communications that are distributed solely to institutional investors, as that term is defined in FINRA Rule 2210(a)(4).  For purposes of this request, “Related Performance Information” means actual performance of all separate or private accounts or funds that have (i) substantially similar investment policies, objectives, and strategies, and (ii) are currently managed or were previously managed by the same adviser or sub-adviser that manages the registered mutual fund that is the subject of an institutional communication. 
Background
You state that Hartford Funds markets registered mutual funds, on a wholesale basis, to financial intermediaries who qualify as “institutional investors” under FINRA Rule 2210(a)(4).  These intermediaries include registered broker-dealers and investment advisers, who may sell or recommend Hartford Funds’ funds to their customers.  The registered broker-dealers assume related suitability and “know your customer” obligations for any such sales and recommendations.  The financial intermediaries are responsible for conducting due diligence on the mutual funds that Hartford Funds sells and, in some cases, determining whether to include these funds on various types of platforms. 
You state that, in addition to providing mutual fund offering materials, Hartford Funds provides financial intermediaries with written and electronic communications regarding the mutual funds, which assist these intermediaries in understanding the funds.  As the marketplace for fund information has evolved, Hartford Funds increasingly is receiving requests from financial intermediaries for Related Performance Information. 
You state that intermediaries request Related Performance Information to analyze and conduct due diligence on mutual funds, portfolio managers, accounts, or particular investment strategies, and to determine if funds and strategies are appropriate and suitable investments for their customers.  You further state that, in cases where a mutual fund has no or only a limited performance history, Related Performance Information may be a particularly critical data point in evaluating the fund.
Hartford Funds proposes to use Related Performance Information only under the following conditions:
This performance information may be provided only if it is actual performance of all separate or private accounts or funds that have (i) substantially similar investment policies, objectives, and strategies, and (ii) are managed or were previously managed by the same adviser or sub-adviser that manages the registered mutual fund that is the subject of an institutional communication.
Hartford Funds will provide materials with Related Performance Information only to persons who qualify as “institutional investors” under FINRA Rule 2210(a)(4), excluding institutional investors who intend to share the Related Performance Information with persons other than institutional investors.
The presentation of Related Performance Information will include all accounts described in the first condition ("Related Accounts"). If there are multiple Related Accounts, the investment performance of such accounts will be presented in a composite or a list (in which the investment performance of each account will be displayed with equal prominence).
Any institutional communication with Related Performance Information will be clearly labeled “for use with institutions only, not for use with retail investors.”  Hartford Funds will instruct institutional investors who receive such materials not to provide them to current or prospective customers or others who are not institutional investors. 
The presentation of Related Performance Information will disclose performance information that is net of fees and expenses of Related Accounts, or net of a model fee that is the highest fee charged to any account managed in the strategy.  If gross performance information is also provided, the institutional communication will prominently disclose that (i) the performance information does not reflect the deduction of fees and expenses, (ii) different funds and accounts have different fees and expenses, and (iii) that the Related Performance Information would have been lower to the extent the related funds or accounts were subject to higher fees and expenses.  The fees and expenses of the registered fund that is the subject of the institutional communication will be prominently disclosed and this fund’s performance information will reflect all fees and expenses.  If the fees and expenses are higher than the fees and expenses of the Related Accounts, that fact will be disclosed.
Related Performance Information will (i) include the performance of each Related Account, (ii) be for a period of at least one year and since the inception of the investment strategy, and (iii) be current as of the most recently-ended calendar quarter.
Related Performance Information will be clearly labeled as such and contain clear disclosure of the applicable dates for the performance.
For a mutual fund in existence for more than one year, its actual performance will be displayed more prominently than the Related Performance Information.
The institutional communications will disclose any material differences between the funds or accounts for which Related Performance Information is provided and the mutual fund that is the subject of the institutional communication. 
All institutional communications that contain Related Performance Information shall comply with all other applicable FINRA rules and federal securities laws and be subject to the same supervisory requirements that Hartford Funds applies to all other firm communications.
Discussion
FINRA Rule 2210 subjects institutional communications to certain content and supervision standards.  In particular, institutional communications must be fair and balanced and must provide a sound basis for evaluating the facts in regard to any particular security.  Institutional communications may not omit material information, include false, exaggerated, or misleading statements, or misstate material facts.  A firm must establish written procedures for the review of institutional communications by a registered principal that are appropriate to the firm’s business, size, structure, and customers.  When those procedures do not require prior-to-use review, the firm must adopt training and surveillance procedures to ensure compliance with the rule.
FINRA has taken the position in the past that the presentation of Related Performance Information in communications with the public, in some cases, may be inconsistent with the content standards of Rule 2210(d)(1).1 However, FINRA has also recognized that communications provided solely to institutional investors do not raise the same investor protection concerns as sales materials provided to retail investors, and FINRA has permitted member firms to provide certain related performance information to certain institutional investors, with appropriate safeguards.  In particular, in 2003, FINRA stated that it would not object if a member firm included Related Performance Information in sales materials for private funds relying on Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“ICA”), if the information was made available only to qualified purchasers, as defined in the ICA and the member firm complied with all other applicable standards in NASD Rule 2210.2
FINRA staff believes that the same rationale used in the 2003 interpretive letter to conclude that it was consistent with the applicable standards of NASD Rule 2210 to include Related Performance Information in sales material for private funds relying on Section 3(c)(7) of the ICA applies in this context.  Accordingly, FINRA staff believes that the use of Related Performance Information in institutional communications in the manner proposed in your letter is consistent with the applicable standards of FINRA Rule 2210.  While we do not object to the use of Related Performance Information in institutional communications as discussed herein, this letter does not affect FINRA’s longstanding position that the presentation of related performance information, other than the performance of a predecessor private account or fund as described above, in communications used with retail investors does not comply with FINRA Rule 2210(d).
The opinions expressed in this letter are staff opinions only and have not been reviewed or endorsed by the FINRA Board of Governors.  This staff letter responds only to the issues raised, and does not address any other rule or interpretation of FINRA, or all the possible regulatory and legal issues involved.
If you have any questions regarding this letter, please contact me at (240) 386-4623, or Joe Savage at (240) 386-4534.
Sincerely,
 
Joseph E. Price

Hartford Funds to Acquire Lattice Strategies | Business Wire


























































Hartford Funds to Acquire Lattice Strategies




Adds strategic beta ETFs to existing portfolio of actively managed 
      mutual funds






May 18, 2016 04:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time



RADNOR, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Hartford 
      Funds announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement to 
      acquire Lattice Strategies, an investment management firm and provider 
      of strategic beta exchange-traded funds (ETF). This acquisition marks 
      Hartford Funds’ expansion into the ETF space, adding robust investment 
      management and product development capabilities to its existing 
      portfolio of actively managed mutual funds.
    


      “We are excited to acquire Lattice Strategies’ distinctive ETF offering 
      and investment capabilities, which we foresee being increasingly 
      demanded by financial professionals and their clients,” said Jim Davey, 
      president of Hartford Funds. “The strategic beta space is a natural 
      extension of Hartford Funds’ actively managed platform, enabling us to 
      enter a fast-growing category that will serve as a foundation for growth 
      in the future.”
    

      The acquisition, which is expected to close in the third quarter of 
      2016, pending customary closing conditions, builds on Hartford Funds’ 
      active management platform and creates nimble in-house investment and 
      product development capabilities for future ETF strategies. Lattice 
      Strategies’ strategic beta ETFs seek growth through multi-factor 
      security selection and the deliberate allocation of risk. Its current 
      ETF lineup includes:
    


        Lattice Developed Markets (ex-US) Strategy ETF (RODM),
      

        Lattice US Equity Strategy ETF (ROUS),
      

        Lattice Global Small Cap Strategy ETF (ROGS),
      

        Lattice Emerging Markets Strategy ETF (ROAM),
      


      In addition to these strategies, Lattice Strategies provides a range of 
      multi-asset solutions, including liquid endowments, alternatives, 
      equity, and income strategies. Upon completion of the acquisition, 
      Hartford Funds will maintain Lattice Strategies’ office in San Francisco 
      and welcome Lattice’s team of more than 20 professionals.
    

      “We look forward to joining the Hartford Funds team,” said Ted Lucas, 
      managing partner and chairman of the investment committee for Lattice 
      Strategies. “Our firms bring complementary strengths that will provide 
      advisors and their clients with the strategies they need to address the 
      investment challenges they are attempting to solve.”
    

      The acquisition will not have a material impact on The Hartford’s 
      financial results.
