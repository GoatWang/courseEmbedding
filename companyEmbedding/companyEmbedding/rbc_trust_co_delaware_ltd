The Delaware Advantage
A Delaware Trust can provide you with valuable benefits today—and for many years to come.
The state of Delaware has long been known as the corporate capital of the United States. More than half of the Fortune 500 companies are incorporated there. But Delaware is also a major center for personal trust management. And with good reason. Compared to other states, Delaware offers:





Greater Confidentiality
A Delaware Trust offers the least governmental interference and the highest degree of confidentiality of all states.




A Higher Level of Protection from Creditors
Shielding trust assets from creditors is a primary consideration in Delaware.






Greater Investment Flexibility
In Delaware, a grantor can retain or give to the trustee as much or as little control over investments as he or she desires.




No Rule Against Perpetuities
Most states require that all interests must vest no later than 21 years after the end of a life (or lives) in being at the creation of the trust.






Lower Administration Costs
The Delaware Court of Chancery has a solid reputation for its well-reasoned decisions on corporate law.




Greater Tax Savings
Delaware provides certain tax exemptions for trusts set up by nonresidents.





As a result, millions of Americans have set up Delaware Trusts, including many of the nation's wealthiest people. For example, while less than one-half percent of the population lives in Delaware, over 10 percent of those listed in the Forbes 400 have established trusts in Delaware.





Conclusion
Delaware Trusts offer a wide range of benefits. They provide the confidentiality and security you desire as well as the investment flexibility and cost savings you need to help you maximize their potential.
For more information about Delaware Trusts, call your financial advisor or RBC Trust Company (Delaware) Limited at 800-441-7698. We will gladly answer any additional questions you may have and, in conjunction with your financial advisor, help you design a trust that best suits your individual financial needs.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation

            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3.

4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
