Restoring safety to your digital world
Learn more about Rubica








Your personal cyber ops team: Full-service security to keep you and your family safe and private in the digital world
Rubica’s secure, private network and team of elite cyber experts provide you with digital security as powerful as the world’s leading companies’. Extremely sophisticated yet easy to use, Rubica operates discreetly in the background, only alerting you if your action is needed, so you can always be confident in your online safety and privacy.







The easiest, most effective way to lock down your online security
You could spend weeks changing passwords, reconfiguring your wi-fi, and updating software to moderately improve your security. Or, you can take five minutes to download Rubica’s app and be safeguarded by the most advanced, effective cyber security available.
Why choose Rubica




 



 



Human intelligence to stop human threats
Rubica puts cyber experts from top security organizations like NSA, US Navy and Scotland Yard on the front lines to protect you against cyber criminals.












									Someone hacked into my computer, stole my information and directed my assistant to wire funds that are now gone forever. With Rubica, I know that won’t happen again, because Rubica protects me, my entire family and my business network.								

									—  Entrepreneur, Los Angeles								



									Rubica keeps my usage data private from my mobile and home internet service providers. With the latest FCC laws that allow service providers to sell my data, I’m glad I have Rubica so that I’m in control of my personal information.								

									—  Lawyer, Miami								



									Rubica immediately alerted me when I accidentally used a site that revealed my password and made it easily available to anyone. Thanks to Rubica, I was able to quickly change other, similar passwords and ensure my safety. It’s a relief that Rubica is always looking out for me.								

									—  Banker, New York								



									I have always been concerned that both my elderly parents and teenagers click ads and email links without understanding the risks. As part of my family, I need Rubica.								

									—  Dentist, Chicago

8.3.  To the extent that any deliverables, reports, summaries, analysis, dashboards or other information provided by Company to CustomerUser include Inventions, or any other proprietary information of Company, or other materials owned by Company or in which Company has an interest (“Pre-Existing Material”), Company shall retain all rights to the Pre-Existing Materials, including any modifications or improvements to the Pre-Existing Materials made during or as a result of the activities contemplated by this Agreement. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Pre-Existing Material and Inventions, including any and all copies or derivative works of Pre-Existing Material and Inventions, are the exclusive property of Company.  You agree to reasonably cooperate with Company to take any steps necessary to record or otherwise effectuate the foregoing ownership of Pre-Existing Material and Inventions.
 

 Modifications. The Software may change from time to time (for example, the Company may push updates to your authorized device, or modify the user interface), and/or the Company may stop providing features (permanently or temporarily), possibly without prior notice to You. In the case of paid licenses, however, the Company will not discontinue the essential features of the Software during your paid license period without offering a reasonable substitute or alternative.

 

 Data Collection and Transmission. In order for the Software to identify patterns associated with security attacks and to perform other functions for which it was designed, it will gather and transmit to the Company’s servers certain technical information, user data, and metadata associated with your authorized device(s) and use of the Software, including but not limited to device IDs, MAC addresses, metadata, IP addresses, URLs and browsing data, HTTP-site application data, network metadata, and device operating system, status, version, and configuration (collectively, “Data”).  You consent to our collection, transmission, storage, monitoring, copying, processing, analysis and use of the Data to administer the Software, to develop and improve the Software and the Company’s other products and services, and to monitor compliance with this Agreement. You acknowledge and agree that this may include transmission of your Data to or from locations in the United States, Europe, and other countries or jurisdictions, potentially including those outside of where you reside or use the Software.  Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to protect the information collected from you in accordance with our Rubica Data Security Policy, the terms of which may be updated at the sole discretion of Company.

 

 Third Party Software. The Software may be accompanied by or utilize certain third-party software components, libraries or applications that are distributed (with or without modifications) under open-source licensing terms (the “Open Source Components”). Your rights with respect to the Open Source Components are, to the extent of any conflict with the Terms, governed by and subject to the terms of the open-source licenses under which they are distributed. You are responsible for complying with those licenses. You may not assume or infer that the Company endorses, or  has reviewed, verified, or authenticated, any Open Source Components or other third-party software that may be furnished with, available through, or used in connection with the Software. Open Source Components and any other third party software, and the information or results provided by them, may be unreliable, inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, or otherwise defective. The Company makes no representations, warranties, or guarantees whatsoever in connection with any third party software or the information or results provided by it.

 

 Term of this Agreement. Your rights under this Agreement will expire at the end of the period(s) for which you have acquired a valid license key from the Company for the Software. The Software may cease to function once the license key has expired. Any license renewals or extensions will be subject to availability and your payment of all applicable fees as then in effect. The Company has no obligation to offer license renewals or extensions, and it may condition renewals upon your acceptance of revised or new terms and conditions. Your rights under this Agreement will automatically terminate, and the Company may suspend or terminate your use of the Software immediately and without notice if you breach any of the terms of this Agreement. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, you agree to promptly and permanently delete all copies of the Software that are on any device(s) or otherwise in your possession or control.

 

Cancellation and Refunds.  Customer will pay for the Service in advance, prior to the first day of Service.  Payments shall be made either on a month-to-month subscription basis or on a term subscription (ex: 6-months, annual, 18-months) as set forth in this Agreement or in the quote for services purchased by Customer online.  Fees for the Service will be reoccurring until this Agreement is terminated by either party.  Cancellation of or changes to month-to-month subscriptions must be made by the Customer on or prior to the 15th day of the month prior to the next month of Service, in order to avoid charges for that subsequent month.  Cancellation of or changes to term subscriptions (ex: cancellation after 8 months of a 12-month prepaid subscription) will result in the Customer receiving a prorated refund (or prorated additional charges) effective as of the 1st day of the following month during which notice of termination is provided to Company by Customer.

 



Limit of Liability. COMPANY’S TOTAL LIABILITY TO USER FROM ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND UNDER ALL THEORIES OF LIABILITY, )EXCLUDING CLAIMS THAT (I) THE SOFTWARE INFRINGES THE RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (II) ARE CONCLUSIVELY ADJUDICATED TO RESULT DUE TO COMPANY’S WILL MISCONDUCT OR (III) BREACH OF ITS DATA PROTECTION OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 10 OF THIS AGREEMENT) WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF FEES USER PAID TO COMPANY FOR THE SOFTWARE LICENSE. IF CUSTOMER HAS AN EVALUATION OR OTHER NON-PAID LICENSE, COMPANY WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO USER WHATSOEVER; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT WHERE LEGAL LIABILITY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, BUT MAY BE LIMITED, COMPANY’S TOTAL LIABILITY SHALL INSTEAD BE LIMITED TO THE SUM OF FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS ($50.00).  COMPANY WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR COSTS OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THESE TERMS OR RESULTING FROM CUSTOMER’S ACCESS TO, USE OF, OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SOFTWARE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT COMPANY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.   You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to implement back-up plans and other safeguards appropriate for the value of the networks, devices, data, and systems with which you use the Software and, accordingly, that the foregoing exclusions and limitations of damages and liability are reasonable. The allocation of risk described in this Section is an essential basis of the bargain between you and the Company, and without it, the fees charged for the Software would be significantly higher. To the extent, if any, that applicable local laws prohibit the exclusion or limitation of certain liabilities or damages, the provisions of this Section will apply fully to the maximum extent permitted by such laws.

 

 Indemnification. In addition to, and in no way limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, Company and Customer expressly agree to the following indemnification provision:

Customer will indemnify Company, its affiliates, and their respective employees, officers, directors, successors, assigns, agents for any and all costs, liabilities, expenses and losses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) (collectively “Costs”) relating to any claims brought by a third party to the extent based upon: (i) negligent or intentionally wrongful acts of Customer or Customer’s employees, agents, or network users; (ii) Customer’s unauthorized modification of the Software  or breach of the terms of this Agreement; or (iii) Customer’s failure to promptly implement security remediation recommendations.
Company shall defend, indemnify, and hold the Customer and its officers, directors, successors, assigns and agents harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, causes of action, loss, damage, liability, cost or expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, arising from or related to third party claims that the Software infringes such party’s intellectual property rights.
 

 Governing Law and Choice of Forum. This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, U.S.A, without regard to the conflicts of law rules thereof.  Any claim or dispute arising in connection with this Agreement shall be resolved exclusively in the federal or state courts situated within King County or Seattle, Washington. To the maximum extent permitted by law, you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts and waive any objections to the jurisdiction or venue of such courts.

 

 Export Restrictions. You agree to comply fully with all relevant export laws and regulations of the United States and other applicable jurisdictions to ensure that neither the Software, nor any direct product thereof, are: (i) downloaded or otherwise exported or re-exported directly or indirectly in violation of such export laws and regulations; or (ii) used for any purposes prohibited by the such export laws and regulations, including but not limited to nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons proliferation.

 

General. Company’s failure to enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign, delegate or transfer this Agreement or any of your rights or obligations hereunder without our prior written consent, and any attempt to do so will be void. We may assign these this Agreement without your consent. This Agreement (together with the Service Agreement, Exhibits and Addendums attached to this Agreement) constitutes the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Software and Service, and they supersede and replace any prior agreements and understandings between you and us regarding the Software or Service. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original and together which shall constitute one and the same agreement.
