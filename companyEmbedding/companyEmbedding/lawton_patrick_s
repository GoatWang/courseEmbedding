Board of Trustees


The Board of Trustees has fiduciary responsibility and is the principal  governance authority for Marquette University. The board is responsible  for preserving and enhancing Marquette’s mission and ensuring that  long-term planning and goals are defined and executed by the university  community. 
Marquette’s bylaws stipulate that the Board of Trustees be  comprised of not fewer than 25 and not more than 40 members, of whom no  fewer than five and no more than eight must be members of the Society of  Jesus. The university’s president serves ex-officio as a member of the  board. The board is self-perpetuating, meaning that trustees are  responsible for electing new members. Trustees serve for three-year  terms and may be re-elected to serve for a maximum of 12 years. Trustees  are volunteers and are not compensated for their service.
The board holds in trust Marquette’s human, physical, and financial  and assets for future generations. The trustees are stewards of  Marquette’s Catholic and Jesuit identity. They establish policies on  university strategy, financial management, fundraising, investments,  property and assets. The board is responsible for hiring and evaluating  the university’s president. The day-to-day administration of Marquette  is the responsibility of the university president and his leadership  team.

Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your community collection!Error when adding to community collectionThis business was removed from the community collection1. St Patrick Catholic Church209 E Iowa StWalters, OK 73572(580) 875-3855Catholic ChurchesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your community collection!Error when adding to community collectionThis business was removed from the community collection2. St Patrick Catholic Church112 E Ohio StWalters, OK 73572(580) 875-3626Catholic ChurchesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your community collection!Error when adding to community collectionThis business was removed from the community collection3. St Patrick's Catholic Church1115 W Petree RdAnadarko, OK 73005(405) 247-5255Churches & Places of WorshipAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your community collection!Error when adding to community collectionThis business was removed from the community collection4. St Patrick Parish3rd E Ohio StWalters, OK 73572(580) 255-0590Churches & Places of WorshipAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your community collection!Error when adding to community collectionThis business was removed from the community collection5. St Patrick's Mission1115 W Petree RdAnadarko, OK 73005(405) 247-5255Missionary ChurchesBusinesses in related categories to Catholic ChurchesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your community collection!Error when adding to community collectionThis business was removed from the community collection6. St Mary's Catholic School611 SW A AveLawton, OK 73501(580) 355-5288SchoolsPrivate Schools (K-12)WebsiteDirectionsMore InfoFrom Business: Here at St. Mary's we offer accredited Catholic Education with high academic standards along with moral and spiritual Christian formation to foster growth in chil…Add to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection7. Blessed Sacrament Religious8 SW 7th StLawton, OK 73501(580) 355-8182Religious OrganizationsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your community collection!Error when adding to community collectionThis business was removed from the community collection8. Blessed Sacrament Catholic Chr606 W Gore BlvdLawton, OK 73501(580) 351-9649Catholic ChurchesWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your community collection!Error when adding to community collectionThis business was removed from the community collection9. Holy Family Catholic Church1010 NW 82nd StLawton, OK 73505(580) 536-6351Catholic ChurchesWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your community collection!Error when adding to community collectionThis business was removed from the community collection10. Svdp Blessed Sacrament ParrishLawton, OK 73501(580) 355-7837Catholic ChurchesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your community collection!Error when adding to community collectionThis business was removed from the community collection11. Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church12 SW 7th StLawton, OK 73501(580) 355-2054Catholic ChurchesClergyWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection12. Holy Family Religious Education1010 NW 82nd StLawton, OK 73505(580) 536-6355Religious General Interest SchoolsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your community collection!Error when adding to community collectionThis business was removed from the community collection13. Saint Ann's Parish Hall8492 State Highway 17Elgin, OK 73538(580) 492-5914Catholic ChurchesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your community collection!Error when adding to community collectionThis business was removed from the community collection14. Immaculate Conception Church307 N 4th StMarlow, OK 73055(580) 658-2365Catholic ChurchesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your community collection!Error when adding to community collectionThis business was removed from the community collection15. Assumption Catholic Church711 W Hickory AveDuncan, OK 73533(580) 255-0590Catholic ChurchesWebsiteSponsored LinksMap ViewSponsoredDidn't find what you were looking for?magnifying glassHelpful Reviews A M A LMohammad j Z. ratedI think no one knows about the value of on time prayer of jumma ( Friday) that's why on every Friday have a different timings, when some one wants he starts prayer of jumma some time 2.30 and some time 3.00 they finish prayer .If some one is responsible he needs to arrange same time prayer of jumma not different timings every Friday.Iglesia De Dios Principe De Pazannabel77 ratedThis church is a wonderful, sp...This church is a wonderful, spirit filled church where you'll feel like family.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.
