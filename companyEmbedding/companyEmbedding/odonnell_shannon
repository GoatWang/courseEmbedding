About




Hello!
I’d like to introduce myself, my name is Shannon O’Donnell and through this portfolio I am presenting to you, a brief sample of my written works I have created during my time as a student. During this time my focus was not solely on technical writing, additionally I studied Criminal Justice and Forensics, something I am sure you will be aware of as you examine my samples. At the moment I am in my senior year of a Bachelor Degree of Technical and Professional Communication at Ferris State University. I graduate in December 2017. This is site is my professional portfolio. Feel free to look around at your leisure. If you have any questions click on the contact tab and send me a message.
Sincerely,
Shannon

Title: Classifed Sales Representative
               Company: Boston Herald
Job Details
               The Boston Herald recently put three different high-end media players through the paces, and offers a good article on the benefits of each. Paul Restuccia loves the Zune HD for its bouncy music effects, the Archos 5 for its video, and the Sony X-Series Walkman for its sharp design. All of the players get demerits for their comparatively few apps available, but such is the state of the market now. Click through to the read link to check out the full article and let us know if you bought any of these players and what appealed to you about them.
