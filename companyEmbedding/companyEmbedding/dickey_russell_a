Betty had a brain tumor removed, followed by radiation treatments.  Unfortunately, almost a year after the surgery and radiation, Betty began to experience localized seizures and we had to move her into an assisted living facility.  We contacted Bibi Pedrosa and the other folks at Quality First Senior Care to provide additional assistance for my sister in the facility where she was placed.They have been excellent in responding to our needs and have provided very good care for Betty.  I should mention that Betty is a large individual (approaching 300 pounds at one time) and Quality First made certain that she had people who could handle her and who were reliable.  Betty has been treated as a member of the family and cared for lovingly.  Unfortunately, my sister's health is continuing to deteriorate and she is now largely bed-ridden and cannot communicate effectively.  Her current caregivers are providing her excellent attention and encourage her to reach her maximum potential.  Our family has come to depend on Quality First and would highly recommend them to anyone.Dr. David LeeLeah M. ratedDr Lee is a young man with very definite ideas about medicine and very little understanding of elderly people.  He may some day be a good doctor but he's not there yet.  He seems to have little empathy for his patients. I think there's even a bit of contempt, a feeling of "Why do these people let themselves get in such a sorry state." He always seems rushed.  I dont think he is in the room for 10 minutes and on my last visit he was typing into the computer for seven of those minutes.  He made an incorrect assumption about one of the meds i am taking and i feel he made an incorrect decision because he wouldn't let me speak.  This is not medicine as it should be practiced. No one could be efficient or offer good care working like this.  It seems to be all about running as many patients through as possible and giving as little back as possible.  Gorski Timothy NKeith A. ratedDr. Gorski saved our baby's life and my wife's life.  My wife had a difficult pregnancy; she suffered from pregnancy-related high blood pressure called "ecclampsia" that actually caused her to pass out (it could have caused her to have a stroke and killed her and our baby).  Our old doctor said she fainted because she had a full stomach and it was nothing to worry about.  We were still worried so we switched doctors to Dr. Gorski who correctly diagnosed her ecclampsia and got her treated for it.  A few months later my wife gave birth to our healthy daughter.  "Highly recommended" is not saying nearly enough about this gifted, talented doctor. Anthony T Tran B MD FACSJeniffer S. ratedDr Tran is such a nice and friendly person. He always make me comfortable with every visit. I love my new breasts. Now I look so curvy, sexy and loving my new body. Yes, I have breast augmentation done at Dr.Tran. He did an amazing job. I got lots of looks and compliments from strangers and friends alike. His patient coordinator is very patient and and answer all of my questions. The receptionists always remember my name when I come. I recomend him to all of my friends. Jeniffer SalinasBatrice, Mark, MDamaria.justice.5 ratedThis doctor is hands down the ...This doctor is hands down the BEST physician in Arlington and maybe one of the best in the Nation. He has countless awards for pioneering research in pathology and can find out whats wrong with someone when the rest can not. He CARES about his patients. The staff will treat you like a family member and make you feel right at home. This is hands down the best Doctor DFW has to offer.Metro Medicalpurrdog ratedWe have used Metro Medical for several years.  We liked the Dr. we were seeing but the management went from bad to worse. Our Dr. recently left Metro Medical because we think he finally got fed up with the way management screwed up everything. The wait time was usually an hour or more and there was a constant turnover of the staff. The gals who took patients in were NOT nurses.The Neighborhood Doctorscott.nance.12 ratedVery easy to deal with. There's usually a short wait time. Almost always see the same Doctor. I've been taking my family there for 10 years, and wouldn't dream of going anywhere else.Butler Jason R MdRonald C. ratedI had an excellent experience with Doctor Butler! He provided options that other doctors never even mentioned.  He gave me hope that I could regain some mobility and with less pain!Hartman, Israel A, MDSusanne S. ratedLoved Dr Hartman but very hard to talk with anyone in his office. Had to leave message to talk to have an appointment scheduled.Milhoan, Rusty AJulie C. ratedHe's the best surgeon. Very careing. I wouldn't want any other surgeon but Dr R.usty Did You Know?Physicians and surgeons help to keep people - from infants to the elderly - as healthy as possible. These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.
