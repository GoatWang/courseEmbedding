Webber & Company.[10] At Google, she worked on the initial viral marketing programs as well as the first Google doodles.[11] Wojcicki also took part in the development of successful contributions to Google such as Google Images and Google Books.[12]
Wojcicki grew within Google to become senior vice president of Advertising & Commerce and lead the advertising and analytic products including AdWords, AdSense, DoubleClick, and Google Analytics.[7]
YouTube, then a small start-up was successfully competing with Google's Google Video service overseen by Wojcicki. Her response was to propose the purchase of YouTube.[7]
She handled two of Google’s largest acquisitions: the $1.65 billion purchase of YouTube in 2006 and the $3.1 billion purchase of DoubleClick in 2007. In February 2014 she became the CEO of YouTube.[13]
Wojcicki, called "the most important person in advertising"[14] was named to Time Magazine’s 100 most influential people in 2015[15] and described in a later issue of Time as “the most powerful woman on the internet”.[16]

On December 16, 2014, ahead of taking her fifth maternity leave, Wojcicki wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal about the importance of paid maternity leave. She is often quoted talking about the importance of finding balance between family and career. Apart of US she has Polish citizenship.[20][21][22] Her grandfather, Franciszek Wójcicki, was a People's Party and Polish People's Party politician who had been elected MP during the Polish legislative election, 1947.[23]

Webber & Company.[10] At Google, she worked on the initial viral marketing programs as well as the first Google doodles.[11] Wojcicki also took part in the development of successful contributions to Google such as Google Images and Google Books.[12]
Wojcicki grew within Google to become senior vice president of Advertising & Commerce and lead the advertising and analytic products including AdWords, AdSense, DoubleClick, and Google Analytics.[7]
YouTube, then a small start-up was successfully competing with Google's Google Video service overseen by Wojcicki. Her response was to propose the purchase of YouTube.[7]
She handled two of Google’s largest acquisitions: the $1.65 billion purchase of YouTube in 2006 and the $3.1 billion purchase of DoubleClick in 2007. In February 2014 she became the CEO of YouTube.[13]
Wojcicki, called "the most important person in advertising"[14] was named to Time Magazine’s 100 most influential people in 2015[15] and described in a later issue of Time as “the most powerful woman on the internet”.[16]

On December 16, 2014, ahead of taking her fifth maternity leave, Wojcicki wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal about the importance of paid maternity leave. She is often quoted talking about the importance of finding balance between family and career. Apart of US she has Polish citizenship.[20][21][22] Her grandfather, Franciszek Wójcicki, was a People's Party and Polish People's Party politician who had been elected MP during the Polish legislative election, 1947.[23]

Early and education[edit]
She is the daughter of Esther Wojcicki, an educator of Russian descent, and Stanley Wojcicki, a Polish American physics professor at Stanford University. She has 2 sisters: Janet Wojcicki, (PhD, tropst and epidemiologist)[4] and Anne Wojcicki, founder of 23andMe. She grew up on the Stanford campus, with George Dantzig as a neighbor.[5] She attended Gunn High School in Palo Alto, California, and wrote for the school newspaper.[6]
Wojcicki studied history and literature at Harvard University and graduated with honors in 1990. She originally planned on getting a PhD in economics and pursuing a career in academia, but changed her plans when she discovered technology.[5]
She also received her Master's of Science in economics from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1993 and a Master's in Business Administration from the UCLA Anderson School of Management in 1998.[7]
Career[edit]
In September 1998, the same month that Google was incorporated, its founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin set up office in Wojcicki's garage in Menlo Park.[8][9] Before becoming Google's first marketing manager in 1999, Wojcicki worked in marketing at Intel in Santa Clara, California[5] and was a management consultant at Bain & Company and R.B. Webber & Company.[10] At Google, she worked on the initial viral marketing programs as well as the first Google doodles.[11] Wojcicki also took part in the development of successful contributions to Google such as Google Images and Google Books.[12]
Wojcicki grew within Google to become senior vice president of Advertising & Commerce and lead the advertising and analytic products including AdWords, AdSense, DoubleClick, and Google Analytics.[7]
YouTube, then a small start-up was successfully competing with Google's Google Video service overseen by Wojcicki. Her response was to propose the purchase of YouTube.[7]
She handled two of Google’s largest acquisitions: the $1.65 billion purchase of YouTube in 2006 and the $3.1 billion purchase of DoubleClick in 2007. In February 2014 she became the CEO of YouTube.[13]
Wojcicki, called "the most important person in advertising"[14] was named to Time Magazine’s 100 most influential people in 2015[15] and described in a later issue of Time as “the most powerful woman on the internet”.[16]
Wojcicki was named #1 on the Adweek 50 list in 2013.[17] She was named #27 on Vanity Fair's New Establishment list in 2015.[18]
Personal life[edit]
Wojcicki married Dennis Troper on August 23, 1998 in Belmont, California.[19] They have five children. On December 16, 2014, ahead of taking her fifth maternity leave, Wojcicki wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal about the importance of paid maternity leave. She is often quoted talking about the importance of finding balance between family and career. Apart of US she has Polish citizenship.[20][21][22] Her grandfather, Franciszek Wójcicki, was a People's Party and Polish People's Party politician who had been elected MP during the Polish legislative election, 1947.[23]

GoogleThe San Jose Mercury News today has a laudatory profile of Susan Wojcicki, SVP Product Management at Google, whom they call with good reason "the most important Googler you've never heard of."
She oversees Google's two main advertising products, AdWords and AdSense, which bring in the vast majority of Google's revenues (and even more of its profits).
Here's what we already knew:


She rented her garage to Larry and Sergey when they first started Google.

Her sister Anne married Sergey Brin.

Here's what we learned:


She's as respected inside Google as she is little-known outside -- and  it suits her just fine to have a low profile. She's known for letting  her teams get credit for the work they do.


She came up with the google doodles! Awesome!

She wasn't just one of the first googler women, she was the first googler mother; as such, she was (and is) a leader on making google a more inclusive workplace. She now has four children -- also very cool.

She was behind Google's two biggest acquisitions: DoubleClick, and YouTube, after failing to keep up with them as head of Google Video

All in all, a very impressive record. She is indeed the most important Googler we'd only vaguely heard of.

Early and education[edit]
She is the daughter of Esther Wojcicki, an educator of Russian descent, and Stanley Wojcicki, a Polish American physics professor at Stanford University. She has 2 sisters: Janet Wojcicki, (PhD, tropst and epidemiologist)[4] and Anne Wojcicki, founder of 23andMe. She grew up on the Stanford campus, with George Dantzig as a neighbor.[5] She attended Gunn High School in Palo Alto, California, and wrote for the school newspaper.[6]
Wojcicki studied history and literature at Harvard University and graduated with honors in 1990. She originally planned on getting a PhD in economics and pursuing a career in academia, but changed her plans when she discovered technology.[5]
She also received her Master's of Science in economics from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1993 and a Master's in Business Administration from the UCLA Anderson School of Management in 1998.[7]
Career[edit]
In September 1998, the same month that Google was incorporated, its founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin set up office in Wojcicki's garage in Menlo Park.[8][9] Before becoming Google's first marketing manager in 1999, Wojcicki worked in marketing at Intel in Santa Clara, California[5] and was a management consultant at Bain & Company and R.B. Webber & Company.[10] At Google, she worked on the initial viral marketing programs as well as the first Google doodles.[11] Wojcicki also took part in the development of successful contributions to Google such as Google Images and Google Books.[12]
Wojcicki grew within Google to become senior vice president of Advertising & Commerce and lead the advertising and analytic products including AdWords, AdSense, DoubleClick, and Google Analytics.[7]
YouTube, then a small start-up was successfully competing with Google's Google Video service overseen by Wojcicki. Her response was to propose the purchase of YouTube.[7]
She handled two of Google’s largest acquisitions: the $1.65 billion purchase of YouTube in 2006 and the $3.1 billion purchase of DoubleClick in 2007. In February 2014 she became the CEO of YouTube.[13]
Wojcicki, called "the most important person in advertising"[14] was named to Time Magazine’s 100 most influential people in 2015[15] and described in a later issue of Time as “the most powerful woman on the internet”.[16]
Wojcicki was named #1 on the Adweek 50 list in 2013.[17] She was named #27 on Vanity Fair's New Establishment list in 2015.[18]
Personal life[edit]
Wojcicki married Dennis Troper on August 23, 1998 in Belmont, California.[19] They have five children. On December 16, 2014, ahead of taking her fifth maternity leave, Wojcicki wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal about the importance of paid maternity leave. She is often quoted talking about the importance of finding balance between family and career. Apart of US she has Polish citizenship.[20][21][22] Her grandfather, Franciszek Wójcicki, was a People's Party and Polish People's Party politician who had been elected MP during the Polish legislative election, 1947.[23]

What's this?




By Jefferson Graham, USA TODAY
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.   Susan Wojcicki is reminiscing about her old home in Menlo Park, Calif. 
"It's a very humble house, less than 2,000 square feet," she recalls fondly. A cozy, four-bedroom home — and incredibly historic.
After earning her MBA in 1998, Wojcicki bought 232 Santa Margarita Ave. for about $600,000. She rented the garage to two Stanford students for $1,700 a month to help with the mortgage. The renters: no ordinary slackers, but the Google Guys, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who incubated Google(GOOG) right there.
"It's a good reminder for the company that we did come from a small house, not a fancy house," says Wojcicki.
Her life-changing decision to open her home to Brin and Page did more than just help start the world's most-popular search engine. It also:
•Landed Wojcicki a key early job at Google less than a year after purchasing the home. Today, she's one of its top-ranked executives, overseeing the crucial online advertising business as vice president of product management. 

•Introduced a future husband to Wojcicki's younger sister Anne, who recently married Brin on an island in the Bahamas. Google has invested $3.9 million in Anne Wojcicki's biotech start-up, 23andMe.
•Created a cottage industry for the Wojcicki family. Susan Wojcicki's husband, Dennis Troper, is an operations executive at Google. Brother-in-law Gregor (married to middle sister Janet) is a former Googler who worked in the finance department. Mom Esther Wojcicki, a teacher, has consulted for Google on educational issues. 
If you've ever clicked a text ad on MySpace, About.com or any thousands of blogs with "Ads by Google," you've got Susan Wojcicki to thank. Expanding ads beyond Google's own search pages was her idea. Now, Google has asked her to further grow the empire by bringing its advertiser base to old media such as newspapers, magazines, radio and television. 
"There are no sets of words that can be used to describe Susan's contribution to the company," says Google CEO Eric Schmidt. "She's historic, in terms of our company's founding. She's also one of those people who thinks very broadly and quickly, and (it's) deceiving because she's so pleasant."
Wojcicki is Google employee No. 18. Her early duties included refining the original Google logo designed by Brin and the overall spare look of the Google home page. She came up with the first of Google's "doodles," the remaking of the logo for holidays and other special events. Her first artistic doodle: an alien lands on Google. 
In Google's fledgling days, Wojcicki, a former junior staffer for chipmaker Intel, was in charge of marketing efforts. Brin and Page charged her with spreading the word about Google on a shoestring. Her big idea: stir word-of-mouth by putting Google's search engine all over the Web. She reached out to companies to license Google search for their websites and offered it free to universities.
In 2003, she came up with her multimillion-dollar brainstorm: AdSense.
'A really novel idea' 
AdSense is an extension of a program Google had successfully launched in 2002, called AdWords. AdWords offers advertisers sponsored search ads, those little text ads that appear near search results. Advertisers have to pay only if the ads get clicked. 
Wojcicki's suggestion: Why not offer these same ads all over the Web, on blogs and websites? Entice Web "publishers" to participate by giving them a portion of the ad revenue. In other words, every time someone clicks on an ad on your site, you get a check. 
Here's how the ads are targeted: Let's say you're reading about computers at tech site Engadget. An ad might appear offering special deals at Dell.com. Or, if you're reading an article at a news site about Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, you might see an ad for a local criminal-defense law firm. 
That's AdSense. 
"It was a really novel idea at the time to serve ads that were targeted dynamically" to a specific Web page, says Wojcicki, sitting in a conference room at the "Googleplex" company headquarters. 
"People were saying, 'This is a sports site, so we'll serve a sports ad.' And we were saying, 'No. We can actually look at the page in real time and figure out what this page is about.' "
Wojcicki's idea turned into a runaway smash. Google doesn't break out revenues from AdSense and AdWords. But the company recently reported quarterly profit of $1 billion, virtually all derived from both ad programs. 
Thousands of tiny entrepreneurs make substantial livings by hosting Ads by Google links at their websites. "More people make money from AdSense than any other vehicle on the Web," says Jennifer Slegg, who runs JenSense, a blog devoted to AdSense. "There are many, many AdSense millionaires."
AdSense "basically turned the Web into a giant Google billboard," says Danny Sullivan, editor of Search Engine Land website. "It effectively meant that Google could turn everyone's content into a place for Google ads."
For her efforts, Wojcicki earned a Google Founders' Award, a financial incentive provided to employees to create new ideas. Spokesman David Krane says it's designed to keep employees and give them the same kind of economic award they would receive if they had formed their own companies. 
Krane won't disclose how much current Founders' Awards are worth, but the first two awarded to Googlers (not to Wojcicki) were $12 million each. 
Venturing into offline ads 
Creating things has kept Wojcicki at Google over the years. "I love taking an idea … to a prototype and then to a product that millions of people use," she says.
"People write in from all over the world giving you feedback, telling us how a product (AdSense) changed their lives, how they were able to start a business with it, and that's just incredibly rewarding."
Her next big challenge: translating Google's simple, measurable advertising network to radio, TV and print.
Ever wanted to run an ad on the radio but didn't know how to set it up? Google has an Audio Ads section on its website with links to radio producers who will create an ad for $75 to $100. Select stations and time slots, and you're on the air. 
The radio venture recently left test mode and is open to the general public. Google is testing the concept in print and on TV; that test is available only to a small percentage of advertisers.
Sullivan and other Google analysts are skeptical about the nascent program's chances. With radio ads, Sullivan says, Google "will give information on when the ad played, with more data than before, but that still doesn't prove that anyone heard the ad. They haven't done anything innovative or different to show if the ad really worked."
'A real challenge' ahead 
Bringing the Google ad network to old media "will be a real challenge," says Greg Sterling, an independent analyst at Sterling Market Intelligence. "The ability to serve a relevant ad against someone's query is one of the great innovations of the Internet, and it's not transferable to other media, where people are more passive."
Wojcicki concedes that ads on TV and radio won't be as measurable. But she says such ads placed through Google will have more data to mine than old media currently provide, thanks to Google's obsessive tracking of numbers via its network of computers. "For example, in TV we can provide second-by-second data on what's being watched on the ad," she says. 
She cautions that it's still very early for Google Radio: "The first things we're doing are really just providing online ways for people to purchase the inventory easier."
Raised in Silicon Valley 
Wojcicki has plenty of experience at being eyewitness to a forming business. Brin and Page originally met her and landed at the Menlo Park house via a friend of Wojcicki's who was dating Brin. 
The house that gave birth to Google was always filled with mutual friends, Wojcicki says. Most of them techies themselves, their No. 1 question for Brin and Page back then: Who needs yet another search engine? 
The answer: " 'Not another but a better search engine,' " Wojcicki recalls. "From the beginning, they had a very clear vision that they could build something much better than what existed at the time."
Wojcicki grew up in Palo Alto on the campus of Stanford University. Dad Stanley Wojcicki chairs Stanford's physics department.
Mom Esther, a journalism teacher at Palo Alto High School, says she expected Susan to become an English professor. Instead, after a post-college job at educational software firm MagicQuest, she was bitten by the tech bug. 
Now, Google is "such a presence" in their lives that the Wojcickis try to limit family-time chatter about the company, Esther says, though not always successfully. "It's so innovative and exciting. They're doing all sorts of interesting things, and it's fun to hear about it."
That so many of her relatives were drawn to Google isn't unusual, says Susan Wojcicki. "There are lots of people in the Silicon Valley who are interested in working at a fast-moving, dynamic company like Google," she says. "Not just my family members."
Meanwhile, the humble house where Google was incubated was purchased by Google in September. Google won't disclose how much it paid, but homes in the neighborhood sell for more than $1 million. "I haven't had time to think about what we'll do with it," says CEO Schmidt. "But I figured we should buy it sooner rather than later."

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Susan Wojcicki has called herself “the mom of Google” — in fact, the Internet giant was born in her garage that she rented out to recent graduates Sergey Brin and Larry Page. 
Susan joined Google in 1999 as Google’s first marketing manager and  led the initial development of several key consumer products including Google Images and Google Books. In 2002, Susan began working on Google’s advertising products and over the next 12 years she led teams that helped define the vision and direction of Google’s monetization platforms. She went on to become Senior Vice President of Advertising and Commerce, where she helped to build and grow key advertising products like AdWords, AdSense, DoubleClick and Google Analytics. 
Today, Susan heads up YouTube, where she oversees content and business operations, engineering and product development.
Susan graduated with honors from Harvard University, holds a master’s in economics from UC Santa Cruz, and an MBA from UC Los Angeles. In 2015, Susan was named to Time’s list of the 100 most influential people in the world.

Google's Susan Wojcicki - the woman who brings online, offline and bottom line together

Susan Wojcicki, Google’s senior vice-president of product management who 
  oversees all of the technology giant’s advertising products, has quite a lot 
  riding on her. Quite simply, she is the woman tasked with generating 97pc of 
  Google’s vast revenues.














Susan Wojcicki is the boss of AdSense, the advertising business that accounts for 97pc of revenue at Google. It was in her garage that the search engine was created.

 In a rare UK interview, the woman who gave Google co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, their first humble office premises, her garage, in 1998, reveals her vision for Google’s hugely successful search advertising business.  “Yes, I did rent my garage out to Larry and Sergey in 1998. I had just got out of business school and bought a house. So I needed to get some renters in order to help pay the mortgage,” she says coolly.  It was undoubtedly the best investment she ever made. However, despite their repeated requests, Wojcicki, resisted working for the new young company called Google for the first year the two developers beavered away in her garage.  However, at apoint during 1999, Wojcicki said she had her “a-ha” moment, when she knew she had to start working for Google. “I was online desperately trying to search for something and couldn’t access Google for some reason and then couldn’t find any information I needed. I suddenly thought getting information you need is going to become very important online. That’s when I started working for Google,” she explains.  Google Employee Number 18, of a whopping 23,000-strong global workforce, some 11 years later, Wojcicki is largely referred to as the woman who created AdSense – a key component of Google’s hugely successful search advertising system which sells relevant display advertising to companies. Having started as the company’s marketing manager, she now oversees all of Google’s advertising products including AdWords, AdSense and DoubleClick.

 According to its last financial report, Google’s total revenue for Q3 2010 was $7.29bn – the majority of which comes from Wojcicki’s department.  This week, of course, Google has been in the news after the European Commission announced a formal inquiry into how it manages its ranking of companies in search and how it then advertises against those rankings. The EC’s move came after complaints from three internet companies who alleged they were the victims of search “penalties” which had put their businesses at risk.  Wojcicki is clear in her answer – Google, which dominates the search market, makes every attempt to be transparent and will look at ways to improve. Even the EC admitted that it wasn’t yet clear that Google had a serious case to answer. “Given our success and the disruptive nature of our business, it’s understandable that we’ve caused unease among other companies and caught the attention of regulators,” she said.  “We respect this process and will continue to work closely with the European Commission to answer their questions. But one thing that’s often overlooked is that we actually provide more information about how our ranking works than any other major search engine. On the advertising side, we give our customers lots of information about how the ad auction works, as well as tips on how to improve their ad quality scores, and the ability to simulate their bids to give them more transparency. ”  Google insiders know that success often breeds suspicion, particularly if that success is based on new technology which few people outside the business actually understand. When asked if AdSense was her creation, Wojcicki’s becomes a little uncomfortable, saying: “It’s a controversial question – various people had the idea but what I can say is that I was the first product manager who worked on it and made it happen. I was one of the key people who brought it [AdSense] together.  “I am also the only person who has worked on AdSense for the last eight years continually and I am responsible for Google’s advertising system – which accounts for approximately 97pc of the company’s revenues.”  In fact, a senior Silicon Valley executive, who wished to remain anonymous, goes as far to call Wojcicki “the money” in Google. “If you think about Google’s large and ever-expanding business, very little of its endeavours, such as YouTube or Gmail, make profit or any significant revenues,” the source said. “As useful and great as these services are, the money still comes from the same place it has always has done in Google – from its unrivalled search advertising business – and that’s Wojcicki’s responsibility. She is very powerful and hugely influential at Google and in Silicon Valley.”  Recently promoted to an elite group of eight senior vice-presidents at Google, and a long-standing member of the company’s operating committee, Wojcicki, aware of the impact of her words, is unsurprisingly guarded in every reply.  However, despite recurring hesitance, when talking about her vision of Google’s advertising evolvement, she becomes more fluent. “Right now I am focusing on the power of mobile and location in terms of the endless opportunities for advertisers wanting to get the most out of Google,” she explains.  “Right now offline and online are coming together because of smartphones.  “It’s a really rich theme and we are just at the beginning of understanding the possibilities. These smartphones have not been around for that long, only two and a half years. Penetration is still growing but already the way that we shop and purchase everything is changing.”  Wojcicki, citing a Forrester study, says that although 42pc of in-store sales are influenced by online only 7 pc of purchases actually happen online. This is where she sees the next big opportunity, supported by the fact that there has also been a 30pc growth (according to Forrester) in mobile shopping queries which shows that people are going online while in shops, or near shops, to make decisions before buying offline.  In a very neat addition to its Google Product Search, the technology giant has partnered with more than 70 large retails brands, such as Best Buy, in a move which sees the search company receive live feeds of each “partner” store’s stock in real time.  This means that when someone searches for a specific product on their mobile phone, using the Google mobile app in the US, they will be informed which stores near them at that point in time has the product, in which size and how many they have left.  The stores, according to Wojcicki, already have the data stream, so there is no extra work except the act of wiring it up as a feed to Google.  She says that the product is just “the beginning” of what Google plans to do to make offline and online come together in a more seamless and useful fashion, for both consumer and advertiser alike.  Wojcicki is confident that the service, which is currently a free add-on to participating brands, will be able to operate around the world.  When asked for her response to those Google critics who say that the search giant regularly crosses the “creepy line” on intrusion when expanding its reach with similar innovations, Wojcicki’s guard reappears.  After a moment’s thought, she says carefully:  “We are a consumer company and our success is directly linked to our users trusting us. Therefore we have the same incentive as the user: they want to see relevant advertising so their experience of Google is positive and we want to deliver it.  “Our interests are aligned with the user.”  Wojcicki’s guard goes up higher still when pressed on what Google’s plans are for the cashing in on the social space – an area it is severely lagging behind its competitors, such as the fast-growing Facebook.  Earlier this year, Google was rumoured to be building a Facebook rival, GoogleMe.  Last week, TechCrunch reported that the new social product could be called Emerald Sea or Google +1.  Wojcicki will not be drawn on the speculation.  However, she admits that “social can be an important way that people make purchase decisions too”, and that Google is “working on developing products in this area”. Her pointed silence on this issue, over all others, speaks volumes.  Location and mobile may be the hot technology themes in 2011, but social is getting hotter by the minute, and Google has yet to strike it rich in this area – which Wojcicki will undoubtedly be working on improving.  Video is another area where she is focusing her energy – especially as YouTube needs to start finally paying its way since Google purchased the once loss-making company in 2005.  “We are testing a lot of products around video advertising at the moment – which are doing well at better targeting,” she said.  “One thing I am excited about is offering people a range of very relevant advertising videos, before or alongside a piece of video content, which people can choose from. I think video advertising is a hugely compelling medium.”  However, Wojcicki’s remit does not stretch to answering questions about Google TV’s commercial plans, despite the commercial video solution being key to its implementation.  The new service recently launched in the US, against the backdrop of a considerable backlash from certain media outlets, fearful of the Google experience spreading to TV. Wojcicki says it’s not her area.  Refreshingly, she has very little to say when asked what it’s like to be one of the only women in a very senior position at Google, a rarity in most major companies, especially technology ones.  “I am responsible for creating and overseeing the future products that make up Google Advertising. I don’t focus on being a woman as Google don’t.  “The company measures my success whether the products work and bring in decent levels of revenue,” she says.  Judging by the company’s latest financial report, her recent promotion was well deserved.

            Susan Wojcicki's path to becoming Google's Senior Vice President of Advertising & Commerce, responsible for 95% of the company's revenue, can be traced back to the many "start-ups" she and her sister began as children. The real momentum came after changing her career path to computer science, renting her garage to Google's founders, and ultimately becoming Google's first marketing person and navigating their mission through advertising ever since.
            






              CEO of YouTube Susan Wojcicki was with Google from the very beginning when she rented her garage to two young computer scientists: Sergey Brin and Larry Page.
 
Long before Google found a home in her garage, Wojcicki grew up on the Stanford campus where her father taught physics and where she came to love the creativity that accompanied technology. She went on to graduate from Harvard University and then to earn a masters in economics from University of California at Santa Cruz and an MBA from the Anderson School of Management at UCLA.
 
An early power user of the Google search engine, Wojcicki realized its significance and became one of the first business people to join the company. Wojcicki, now a mother of four, currently leads all new product development including Google's two main advertising vehicles, AdWords and AdSense, and is responsible for 96% of Google's revenues. She's also responsible for everyone's favorite, Google Doodles. After proposing that Google purchase YouTube and then handling the acquisition, in February 2014, she became the head of YouTube. Her sister, Anne Wojcicki, is also a MAKER!
