Spectacular Move on Portlogic Systems Inc. (OTCMKTS:PGSY)

By Jermaine Farmer -  July 23, 2017

Portlogic Systems Inc. (OTCMKTS:PGSY) is a micro-cap stock that has truly gone nuts over the past 5 days. In that time, shares of PGSY have advanced over 300% in a monster move that has clearly grabbed hold of the attention of traders on the OTC over the course of the move. Fueling the action, the company just announced that it has appointed Meeta S. Litake (B.E. – CSE and MBA) as Chief Technology Officer, effective July 18, 2017. In this role, Ms. Litake will lead the company’s global IT function and play a key role in envisioning and developing Portlogic’s technology strategy across all business lines.
According to the company’s latest release, she has 13 years total experience, teaching Engineering and Computer Science in academic institutions, as well as 5 years of corporate experience in software development, start-ups and consulting in the mobile sector.
Portlogic Systems Inc. (OTCMKTS:PGSY) is a development stage company that develops and sells enterprise mobile marketing applications solutions, kiosk hardware, and software products. Its solutions include m2Meet, a community networking software solution; m2Bank, a financial transactions system that facilitates bill payments, money transfers, and account management; and m2Market, a mobile marketing solution that is used to deliver marketing materials to mobile phones.
The company also offers m2Ticket, a mobile ticketing sales engine, which manages the sale and delivery of tickets through mobile phones for the transportation and entertainment industry; m2Kiosk, a line of standard and custom kiosks hardware and software that integrates with mobile phone applications in the marketing, financial, and ticketing industries; and m2Workflow, a customer relations management solution on mobile phones for service industries.
In addition, it develops and licenses portal software products that enable customers to operate their own online social networking portal without requiring any technical programming or Website design skills, as well as provides custom software programming services to customers who license its products. Further, the company specializes in data and voice telecommunications technologies.
According to company materials, “Headquartered in Toronto, Canada, Portlogic Systems, Inc. was incorporated in 2004. The company is a telecom solutions provider, mobile and Internet software developer, and solutions provider for electronic payments, ticketing and marketing delivery and community communication systems.”

As noted above, the company just announced a new CTO appointment, a move which plays a part in a remarkable stock price recovery move that has been accompanied by a rejuvenation in microcap trader enthusiasm.
CEO Michael De Valera stated, “We are delighted to bring on board and welcome Meeta Litake as the newest member of our team. Both personally and professionally, she fits extremely well with our mobile product development roadmap. Together, we will continue developing Portlogic’s vision and growth opportunities, enabling our customers to continue to take advantage of the most innovative telecommunication solutions on the market.”
This appointment demonstrates Portlogic System’s ongoing commitment and next significant step in building a top caliber executive management team.
We’ve witnessed more than 230% during the past week in terms of shareholder gains in the listing. The situation may be worth watching. PGSY has a track record that includes a number of dramatic bounces. Furthermore, the stock has benefitted from a jump in recent trading volume to the tune of a bit over 1800% beyond what we have been seeing over the larger time frame.
Of course, we have been burying the lead a bit here because of one remarkable dynamic for this stock: the stock’s tiny trading float of around 180K shares. As savvy traders are well aware, a restricted trading float and a jump in trading volume can crimp supply and push share prices higher. In this case, that’s the elephant in the room.
Currently trading at a market capitalization of $12.9M, PGSY has virtually no reported cash on the books, which must be weighed relative to about $331K in total current liabilities. The company is pre-revenue at this point. You can bet we will update this one again as new information comes into view.

Portlogic Systems Inc. (OTCMKTS:PGSY) On a Bull Run

By Jermaine Farmer -  July 27, 2017 


SHARE

Facebook
Twitter






Portlogic Systems Inc. (OTCMKTS:PGSY) is a low-priced trading equity that’s clearly begun to spur some major interest among OTC players as shares bounce up off recent lows. PGSY’s principal recent catalyst is its announcement that it has entered into an agreement with Mobicloud Technologies Pvt. Ltd. to provide IT consulting and product development. According to the release, Mobicloud’s scope will be to develop mobile app and VoIP products, and provide cloud-based, enterprise and other end-to-end solutions to Portlogic customers.
CTO Meeta Litake, who previously worked with Mobicloud, stated, “We are very excited to work with Mobicloud as our developer to provide and create new solutions and products for the company. With the combination of both teams and their collective, extensive knowledge with the latest technology trends and development practices, this will help Portlogic Systems further build its customer base.” The news has helped the stock on a monumental run from under $0.03 per share to over $0.14 per share on an intraday basis just over the past seven days.
Portlogic Systems Inc. (OTCMKTS:PGSY) is a development stage company that develops and sells enterprise mobile marketing applications solutions, kiosk hardware, and software products. Its solutions include m2Meet, a community networking software solution; m2Bank, a financial transactions system that facilitates bill payments, money transfers, and account management; and m2Market, a mobile marketing solution that is used to deliver marketing materials to mobile phones.
PGSY also offers m2Ticket, a mobile ticketing sales engine, which manages the sale and delivery of tickets through mobile phones for the transportation and entertainment industry; m2Kiosk, a line of standard and custom kiosks hardware and software that integrates with mobile phone applications in the marketing, financial, and ticketing industries; and m2Workflow, a customer relations management solution on mobile phones for service industries.
The company develops and licenses portal software products that enable customers to operate their own online social networking portal without requiring any technical programming or Website design skills, as well as provides custom software programming services to customers who license its products. Further, the company specializes in data and voice telecommunications technologies.
According to PGSY materials, “Headquartered in Toronto, Canada, Portlogic Systems, Inc. was incorporated in 2004. The company is a telecom solutions provider, mobile and Internet software developer, and solutions provider for electronic payments, ticketing and marketing delivery and community communication systems.”

As noted above, PGSY just announced that it has entered into an agreement with Mobicloud Technologies Pvt. Ltd. to provide IT consulting and product development. This is obviously a huge catalyst for the company, which is well-demonstrated by the stock’s recent ripping trend higher. We have seen the stock break above its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages in recent days, and growth potential is obviously part of the driving narrative.
According to the company’s communications, this agreement demonstrates the company’s ongoing commitment and next significant step in continuing to build up its new solution offering and growth prospects.
In all, recent action has seen more than 300% piled on for shareholders of the stock during the trailing week. Market participants may want to pay attention to this stock. PGSY is a stock who’s past is littered with sudden rips. What’s more, the stock has seen an influx in interest of late, with the stock’s recent average trading volume running exceeding 1800% beyond its prior sustained average level.
This is particularly important given the stock’s tiny trading float of roughly 180K shares. As savvy traders are well aware, ramping trading activity can overwhelm available supply in a stock with this type of small float, leading to an upward burst in prices.
Now commanding a market cap of $19.95M, PGSY has virtually no cash on the books, which must be weighed relative to about $331K in total current liabilities. The company is pre-revenue at this point. We will update the story again soon as further details emerge.
