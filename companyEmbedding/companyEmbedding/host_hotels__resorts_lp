Our Strategy
What is a REIT





Our Strategy



Superior Diversified Portfolio
We own one of the most geographically diversified portfolios of superior hotel real estate in the industry and partner with leading operators and premier brands in the hospitality industry. We target high-quality assets in major markets and premier resort and convention destinations, while utilizing the strength of our balance sheet to be opportunistic and flexible in our approach. We remain disciplined yet nimble and open to investing in lodging assets that are accretive to our stockholders and where we believe our employees and analytical expertise can create real value. Our diverse portfolio of high-quality hotel properties is a key component of driving stockholder value.
 
Strong Asset Management
Our strategy is to drive operating performance and implement value-added real estate decisions to maximize stockholder value and drive long-term profitability. To enhance our profitability, our enterprise analytics group offers independent feasibility, business intelligence, revenue management, capital expenditures acumen and financial planning and analysis. This distinctive expertise allows us to benchmark and monitor hotel performance and cost controls and complete deep-dive analytic reviews across brands and properties to seek new opportunities that could increase profit. These core functions assist our asset management team in focusing on their key goal of maximizing EBITDA per room at every one of our hotels and enhancing the overall portfolio. Working closely with our operators, our asset managers ensure the best practices and strategic initiatives learned at individual properties are being deployed at each hotel.  When possible, we also look for ways to improve contract flexibility through the extension or purchase of ground leases or the restructuring of management agreements. Ultimately, through successful execution of these strategies, we strive to maximize the performance of our hotels and position us to pursue higher sales proceeds upon disposition.
 
Strategic Capital Allocation and Value Enhancement
We are disciplined with capital allocation and focused on seeking to earn returns that exceed our cost of capital, with the goal of creating long-term value and strong returns for our stockholders. We are prudent with our investments and go beyond the acquisition of marquis properties, constantly mining and seeking to enhance the value of our irreplaceable real estate through value enhancement initiatives. We believe opportunities may exist across our portfolio and we critically analyze the wealth of data and information from our properties to implement strategies that capitalize on the value of the real estate.  




What is a REIT



According to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), a Real Estate Investment Trust, or REIT, is a company that owns or finances income-producing real estate. Modeled after mutual funds, REITs provide investors of all types regular income streams, diversification and long-term capital appreciation. REITs typically pay out all of their taxable income as dividends to shareholders. In turn, shareholders pay the income taxes on those dividends. 
REITs allow anyone to invest in portfolios of large-scale properties the same way they invest in other industries – through the purchase of stock. In the same way shareholders benefit by owning stocks in other corporations, the stockholders of a REIT earn a share of the income produced through real estate investment – without actually having to go out and buy or finance property.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Host Inc. operates as a self-managed and self-administered REIT. Host Inc. is the sole general partner of Host L.P. and holds approximately 99% of its partnership interests. Host L.P. is a limited partnership operating through an umbrella partnership structure. The remaining common OP units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners.  Forward-Looking Statements  In this report on Form 10-Q, we make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as "anticipate," "believe," "could," "expect," "may," "intend," "predict," "project," "plan," "will," "estimate" and other similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions and forecasts of future results. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated at the time the forward-looking statements are made.  The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements:   the effect on lodging demand of (i) changes in national and local economic and business conditions, including concerns about the duration and strength of U.S. economic growth, global economic prospects, consumer confidence and the value of the U.S. dollar, and (ii) factors that may shape public perception of travel to a particular location such as natural disasters, weather, pandemics, changes in the international political climate, and the occurrence or potential occurrence of terrorist attacks, all of which will affect occupancy rates at our hotels and the demand for hotel products and services;   the impact of geopolitical developments outside the U.S., such as the pace of the economic recovery in Europe, the effects of the United Kingdom's referendum to withdraw from the European Union, the slowing of growth in markets such as China and Brazil, or unrest in the Middle East, all of which could affect the relative volatility of global credit markets generally, global travel and lodging demand, including with respect to our foreign hotel properties;   risks that the recent travel ban to the United States and proposed immigration policies will suppress international travel to the United States generally;   volatility in global financial and credit markets, and the impact of budget deficits and pending and future U.S. governmental action to address such deficits through reductions in spending and similar austerity measures, which could materially adversely affect U.S. and global economic conditions, business activity, credit availability, borrowing costs, and lodging demand;   operating risks associated with the hotel business, including the effect of increasing operating or labor costs or changes in workplace rules that affect labor costs;   the effect of rating agency downgrades of our debt securities on the cost and availability of new debt financings;   the reduction in our operating flexibility and the limitation on our ability to pay dividends and make distributions resulting from restrictive covenants in our debt agreements, which limit the amount of distributions from Host L.P. to Host Inc., and other risks associated with the amount of our indebtedness or related to restrictive covenants in our debt agreements, including the risk of default that could occur;   our ability to maintain our properties in a first-class manner, including meeting capital expenditures requirements, and the effect of renovations, including temporary closures, on our hotel occupancy and financial results;   the ability of our hotels to compete effectively against other lodging businesses in the highly competitive markets in which we operate in areas such as access, location, quality of accommodations and room rate structures;   our ability to acquire or develop additional properties and the risk that potential acquisitions or developments may not perform in accordance with our expectations;   relationships with property managers and joint venture partners and our ability to realize the expected benefits of our joint ventures and other strategic relationships;   risks associated with a single manager, Marriott International, managing a significant portion of our properties;   changes in the desirability of the geographic regions of the hotels in our portfolio or in the travel patterns of hotel customers;   the ability of third-party internet and other travel intermediaries to attract and retain customers;   our ability to recover fully under our existing insurance policies for terrorist acts and our ability to maintain adequate or full replacement cost "all-risk" property insurance policies on our properties on commercially reasonable terms;   the effect of a data breach or significant disruption of hotel operator information technology networks as a result of cyber attacks;   the effects of tax legislative action and other changes in laws and regulations, or the interpretation thereof, including the need for compliance with new environmental and safety requirements;   the ability of Host Inc. and each of the REITs acquired, established or to be established by Host Inc. to continue to satisfy complex rules in order to qualify as REITs for federal income tax purposes and Host Inc.'s and Host L.P.'s ability and the ability of our subsidiaries, and similar entities to be acquired or established by us, to operate effectively within the limitations imposed by these rules; and   risks associated with our ability to execute our dividend policy, including factors such as investment activity, operating results and the economic outlook, any or all of which may influence the decision of our board of directors as to whether to pay future dividends at levels previously disclosed or to use available cash to pay special dividends.  We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions, including those risk factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that we will attain these expectations or that any deviations will not be material.  Operating Results and Outlook  Operating Results  The following table reflects certain line items from our statement of operations and significant operating statistics (in millions, except per share and hotel statistics):  Historical Income Statement Data: Quarter ended March 31, 2017 2016 Change Total revenues $ 1,348 $ 1,339 0.7 % Net income 161 184 (12.5 )% Operating profit 171 151 13.2 % Operating profit margin under GAAP 12.7 % 11.3 % 140 bps Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 367 $ 345 6.4 % Diluted earnings per share 0.21 0.24 (12.5 )% NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share (1) 0.44 0.41 7.3 % Comparable Hotel Data: 2017 Comparable Hotels (2) Quarter ended March 31, 2017 2016 Change Comparable hotel revenues (1) $ 1,209 $ 1,173 3.1 % Comparable hotel EBITDA (1) 324 304 6.5 % Comparable hotel EBITDA margin (1) 26.75 % 25.9 % 85 bps Change in comparable hotel RevPAR - Constant US$ 3.4 % Change in comparable hotel RevPAR - Nominal US$ 3.6 % Change in comparable domestic RevPAR 3.8 % Change in comparable international RevPAR - Constant US$ (7.1 )% ___________  (1) Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share and comparable hotel operating results (including comparable hotel revenues and comparable hotel EBITDA and margins) are non-GAAP (U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the SEC. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for more information on these measures, including why we believe that these supplemental measures are useful, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and the limitations on the use of these supplemental measures.  (2) Comparable hotel operating statistics for 2017 and 2016 are based on 90 hotels as of March 31, 2017.  Revenue per Available Room ("RevPAR")  Comparable RevPAR on a constant US$ basis improved 3.4% for the first quarter, driven by an 80 basis point increase in occupancy and a 2.4% increase in average room rate. Our results benefited from strong performance in our Washington, D.C. market due to the Presidential inauguration and Women's March in January, while the shift of the Easter holiday into the second quarter in 2017 drove improvements in group demand for the portfolio as a whole. Excluding the Washington, D.C. market, the comparable RevPAR increase was 1.4%. Results were mixed across our other markets, as Seattle, Denver and San Diego experienced double-digit RevPAR growth, while San Francisco, New York, Florida and Boston experienced declines in RevPAR for the quarter. The Easter holiday shift helped fuel strong growth in group business, with increases in both room nights and rates; however, transient nights decreased due to displacement from the increased group volume and rate growth was inhibited by increased supply growth in many of our major markets, reduced arrivals from international markets and cautious business spending.  On a constant US$ basis, RevPAR at our comparable international properties decreased 7.1% for the first quarter primarily due to declines in both rate and occupancy at our properties in Rio de Janeiro due to the weakened Brazilian economy and difficult comparisons to the prior year pre-Olympic activity.  Rooms  Total room revenue remained flat for the quarter, reflecting the 2.5% increase in comparable hotel room revenue, offset by lost revenue from 2017 and 2016 hotel dispositions. For the quarter, total room expenses decreased 0.9%, as a result of dispositions, while comparable hotel room expenses increased 2.1% for the quarter, primarily driven by an increase in travel agent commissions.  Food and beverage  Food and beverage revenues increased 3.4% for the quarter, as the comparable food and beverage revenue increase of 4.8% was partially offset by the effect of hotel dispositions. Furthermore, food and beverage expenses decreased, as the improvement in revenues was due to increases in banquet revenues, which generally have lower overall costs as a percentage of revenues than restaurant and outlet sales. These factors, coupled with improvements in overall productivity and controlled food and beverage costs, led to improvement in food and beverage profit.  Operating profit  Operating profit margins (calculated based on GAAP operating profit as a percentage of GAAP revenues) increased 140 basis points, to 12.7%, for the first quarter of 2017. These operating profit margins are affected significantly by several items, including dispositions, depreciation and corporate expenses. Our comparable hotel EBITDA margins, which exclude these items, increased 85 basis points, to 26.75%, for the quarter. The improvements in both GAAP operating profit margins and comparable hotel EBITDA margins were driven by strength in food and beverage profits, labor productivity improvements on a per occupied room basis and a decrease in insurance premiums. The productivity improvements are reflective of the time and motion studies we have initiated at some of our largest hotels over the past two years and continue to implement at our medium and smaller-sized hotels. These studies have resulted in hotel managers establishing more accurate labor model standards and improved and expanded forecasting tools, which allow managers to more effectively schedule labor based on demand and to minimize excess staffing, thereby reducing costs.  Net income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share  Net income for the quarter decreased $23 million due to a decrease in gain on sale of assets of $42 million, which was partially offset by a $20 million improvement in operating profit, described above, and a $5 million increase in equity in earnings of affiliates. Adjusted EBITDA increased $22 million for the quarter due to improvement in our comparable hotel EBITDA and strong performance at three of our non-comparable hotels that were under renovation last year, slightly offset by the sale of eleven hotels in 2016 and 2017. These changes, along with the effect of the decrease in the weighted average shares outstanding due to the repurchase of approximately 14 million shares in 2016, led to a decrease in earnings of $0.03, or 12.5%, per diluted share for the quarter and an increase in Adjusted FFO per diluted share of $0.03, or 7.3%, for the quarter.  The trends and transactions described for Host Inc. affected similarly the operating results for Host L.P., as the only significant difference between the Host Inc. and the Host L.P. statements of operations relates to the treatment of income attributable to the third party limited partners of Host L.P.  Outlook  Forecasts for the United States economy continue to be cautiously optimistic for 2017; however, expectations of economic stimulus through tax reform, infrastructure spending or regulatory easing during 2017 have waned. Therefore, we do not anticipate an impactful increase in business investment in 2017, a significant driver of demand for our portfolio.  Additionally, supply growth is expected to accelerate in 2017. In particular, markets in which we own a significant number of hotels have experienced above-average supply growth during this cycle, which may continue to impact the ability of our managers to grow room rate in the near-term and could also lead to downward pressure on occupancy.  As expected, we experienced strong operations in the first quarter due to the Presidential inauguration and related activities in January and the Easter holiday shift into the second quarter for 2017. Therefore, we expect that the first quarter operating performance, including our group business, will likely exceed the operations for the remaining quarters of the year. As a result, we estimate that comparable RevPAR growth for the full year 2017 will be between 0.0% and 2.0% on a constant US$ basis.  The current outlook for the lodging industry is uncertain; therefore, there can be no assurances that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings will continue for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, slower than anticipated growth in the economy, changes in travel patterns, and international economic and political instability.  Strategic Initiatives  Portfolio  Our portfolio includes multiple types of premium hotels, primarily located in major markets and premier resort and convention destinations. We continue to focus on long-term results by investing in properties that we believe have strong demand generators, are in premier locations, appeal to multiple customer segments and achieve premium rates. At the same time, we intend to strategically dispose of assets that we believe will experience lower growth and/or higher capital expenditures requirements.  Acquisitions. During the quarter, we completed the following acquisitions:   The Don CeSar and Beach House Suites complex in St. Pete Beach, Florida for $214 million, with Davidson Hotels & Resorts being selected as manager. The hotel has been recognized for excellence by Historic Hotels of America, with 347 rooms and suites along the Florida Gulf coast, award winning dining options and approximately 38,000 square feet of meeting space.   The 305-room W Hollywood in Hollywood, California for $219 million. The hotel includes approximately 11,000 square feet of high-quality retail space and seven prominent supergraphic billboard signs.   The ground lease at the Miami Marriott Biscayne Bay for $38 million.  Dispositions. During the quarter, we sold the JW Marriott Desert Springs Resort & Spa for $172 million, including $12 million of furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement funds retained at the hotel. Subsequent to quarter end, we sold the Sheraton Memphis Downtown for $67 million. This hotel, as well as the Hilton Melbourne South Wharf, was classified as held-for-sale as of March 31, 2017.  Balance Sheet  Debt transactions. On March 20, 2017, we issued $400 million of 3?% Series G senior notes due April 2024 and received net proceeds of approximately $395 million, net of discount, underwriting fees and expenses. The net proceeds were used to repay $250 million that had been drawn under the revolver portion of our credit facility earlier in the quarter and for general corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2017, we had $784 million of available capacity remaining under the revolver portion of our credit facility.  Capital Investments  Redevelopment and Return on Investment Capital Expenditures. Redevelopment and return on investment ("ROI") projects primarily consist of large-scale redevelopment projects designed to increase cash flow and improve profitability by capitalizing on changing market conditions and the favorable locations of our properties, including projects such as the redevelopment of a hotel, the  repositioning of a hotel restaurant, the installation of energy efficient systems or the conversion of underutilized space to more profitable uses. Additionally, in conjunction with the acquisition of a property, we prepare capital and operational improvement plans designed to maximize profitability. We deployed approximately $16 million for these projects during the first quarter of 2017.  We expect that redevelopment and ROI projects for 2017 will be approximately $90 million to $115 million, representing a reduction of approximately $125 million from 2016.  Renewal and Replacement Capital Expenditures. These expenditures are designed to ensure that our standards for product quality are maintained and to enhance the overall competitiveness of our properties in the marketplace. We deployed $64 million on renewal and replacement capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2017. We completed the renovation of all 285 rooms at the San Francisco Marriott Fisherman's Wharf and renovated almost 43,000 square feet of meeting space at the Westfields Marriott Washington Dulles. We expect that our investment in renewal and replacement expenditures in 2017 will total approximately $275 million to $300 million.  Results of Operations The following table reflects certain line items from our statements of operations (in millions, except percentages): Quarter ended March 31, 2017 2016 Change Total revenues $ 1,348 $ 1,339 0.7 % Operating costs and expenses: Property-level costs (1) 1,151 1,164 (1.1 ) Corporate and other expenses 29 27 7.4 Gain on insurance and business interruption settlements 3 3 - Operating profit 171 151 13.2 Interest expense 39 39 - Gain on sale of assets 17 59 (71.2 ) Benefit for income taxes 6 9 (33.3 ) Host Inc.: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests 3 2 50.0 Net income attributable to Host Inc. 158 182 (13.2 ) Host L.P.: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests 1 - N/M Net income attributable to Host L.P. 160 184 (13.0 ) ___________  (1) Amount represents total operating costs and expenses from our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations, less corporate and other expenses and gain on insurance and business interruption settlements.  N/M=Not meaningful.  Statement of Operations Results and Trends  For the first quarter of 2017, the results of hotels acquired or sold during the comparable periods (collectively, our "Recent Acquisitions and Dispositions") impacted our year-over-year comparisons. Comparisons of our operations were affected by the acquisition of two hotels during the first quarter: the W Hollywood acquired in March 2017 and The Don CeSar and Beach House Suites complex acquired in February 2017. Dispositions include the sale of one hotel in 2017 and ten hotels in 2016. The table below presents the effects on earnings from our Recent Acquisitions and Dispositions (in millions, increase (decrease)):   Quarter ended March 31, 2017 2016 Change Revenues: Acquisitions $ 12 $ - $ 12 Dispositions 3 68 (65 ) Total revenues $ 15 $ 68 $ (53 ) Net income (excluding gain on sale): Acquisitions $ 4 $ - $ 4 Dispositions 1 11 (10 ) Net income (excluding gain on sale): $ 5 $ 11 $ (6 )  Hotel Sales Overview The following table presents total revenues in accordance with GAAP and includes both comparable and non-comparable hotels (in millions, except percentages): Quarter ended March 31, 2017 2016 Change Revenues: Rooms $ 843 $ 843 0.0 % Food and beverage 422 408 3.4 Other 83 88 (5.7 ) Total revenues $ 1,348 $ 1,339 0.7  Rooms. Total rooms revenues remained flat for the quarter. For our comparable hotels, rooms revenues increased 2.5% for the quarter due to an increase in occupancy along with a shift to higher rated group business. The net effects of our Recent Acquisitions and Dispositions reduced rooms revenues by $29 million for the quarter.  Food and beverage. Total food and beverage ("F&B") revenues increased 3.4% for the quarter. The results reflect strong banquet and audio video business, which led to an increase in F&B revenues on a comparable hotel basis of 4.8% for the quarter, offset by the net effect of our Recent Acquisitions and Dispositions, which reduced F&B revenues by $19 million for the quarter.  Other revenues. Total other revenues decreased 5.7% for the quarter, primarily due to the net effects of our Recent Acquisitions and Dispositions, which reduced other revenues by $5 million. At our comparable hotels, other revenues included an increase in cancelation and attrition fees as well as amenity fees.  Property-level Operating Expenses The following table presents property-level operating expenses in accordance with GAAP and includes both comparable and non-comparable hotels (in millions, except percentages): Quarter ended March 31, 2017 2016 Change Expenses: Rooms $ 219 $ 221 (0.9 )% Food and beverage 277 284 (2.5 ) Other departmental and support expenses 319 328 (2.7 ) Management fees 56 57 (1.8 ) Other property-level expenses 100 93 7.5 Depreciation and amortization 180 181 (0.6 ) Total property-level operating expenses $ 1,151 $ 1,164 (1.1 )  Our operating costs and expenses, which have both fixed and variable components, are affected by changes in occupancy, inflation, and revenues (which affect management fees), though the effect on specific costs will differ. Our wages and benefits account for approximately 57% of the operating expenses at our hotels (excluding depreciation). Other property-level expenses consist of  property taxes, the amounts and structure of which are highly dependent on local jurisdiction taxing authorities, and property and general liability insurance, all of which do not necessarily increase or decrease based on similar changes in revenues at our hotels.  Rooms. Rooms expenses decreased 0.9% for the first quarter, primarily due to the net effects of our Recent Acquisitions and Dispositions, which reduced rooms expenses by $8 million. At our comparable hotels, rooms expenses increased 2.1% for the quarter, due primarily to an increase in travel agent commissions, commensurate with the increase in group business.  Food and beverage. F&B expenses decreased 2.5% in the first quarter. The results reflect a decrease in comparable F&B expenses of 0.2% for the quarter due to controlled labor costs and a decrease in food and beverage costs due to the shift to more banquet business. The decrease also reflects the net effect of our . . .  May 02, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

Expedia®+ Voyager Credit Card Review: How Does it Stack Up? 
























































































Expedia®+ Voyager Credit Card Review: How Does it Stack Up Against Other Travel Cards?








Simon Zhen




Jun 02, 2017 |
            Be First to Comment!

























If you're like me, you probably make it a habit of booking trips through online travel sites. They're great tools for finding deals on flight, hotels, and more. Some even offer their own credit cards to help you save more money on travel -- a great way to get rewarded for your loyalty.
I took a look at the four major online travel sites that offer credit cards -- Priceline, Travelocity, Expedia, and Orbitz -- and compared their cards to determine the best online travel site card.
Here's what I looked at when reviewing the Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card, Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card, Expedia®+ Voyager, and Orbitz Rewards Visa® cards:
Travel Site Cards - Rewards rates



Card
Bonus rewards
Base rewards




Priceline Rewards Visa
5 points per dollar on priceline.com purchases
1 point per dollar on all other purchases


Travelocity Rewards American Express
3 points per dollar on eligible Travelocity purchases
1 point per dollar on all other purchases


Expedia+ Voyager
4 Expedia+ points per dollar on eligible Expedia purchases and 2 Expedia+ points per dollar on dining & entertainment
1 Expedia+ point per dollar on all other purchases


Orbitz Rewards Visa
10% Orbucks back on eligible hotels booked via mobile app (8% through desktop/web) and 7% Orbucks back on flight booked via mobile app (6% through desktop/web)
2% Orbucks on all other purchases



You want to earn points fast, so you can get those free flights and hotel stays. So, it makes sense to first look at how quickly these online travel site credit cards can make that happen.
Orbitz Rewards Visa ®Takes First Place
Based on the numbers alone, you can see that the Orbitz Rewards Visa® card stands out with its amazing rewards rates on travel purchases made through the Orbitz website. The caveat to Orbitz is that you'll have to deal with their rather confusing Orbucks program. But once you have that figured out, great rewards follow.
For example, you can get 10% back on eligible hotels booked through the Orbitz mobile app. You can also use the mobile app to get 7% back on flights.
If you're not an app person, you can still get good rewards on desktop, but it's important to know that they differ. Either way, Orbitz rewards are highly competitive with travel credit cards.
Priceline and Travelocity Take Second Place
But, Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card and Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card have simple rewards programs. You get bonus points on travel purchases made through their sites and a flat 1 point per dollar for everything else.
Such a simple program stresses one thing: you’ll get value from these cards only if you use them for travel purchases. Otherwise, any other rewards card would be better.
Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card gives more points per dollar on bonus travel but Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card picks up the slack with a stellar redemption option.
Expedia®+ Voyager Takes Third Place
The Expedia®+ Voyager card has a rewards program that aims to convince cardholders to always keep the card in their wallets.
You’ll get bonus points for booking travel through Expedia — which is usually done online. But to get bonus points for restaurants and entertainment, you’ll have to carry the Expedia®+ Voyager card in your wallet.
To encourage more spending, the card gives you 5,000 bonus Expedia+ points. This happens when you spend $10,000 in the prior year (a 0.05% point bonus on $10,000 spent).
After our Review of the Expedia®+ Voyager Card we realized that while the rewards rate is decent and the bonus is nice, that's not enough to differentiate Expedia from the pack.
WINNER (Rewards rate): Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card
Travel Site Cards - Redemption



Card
Priceline Rewards Visa
Travelocity Rewards American Express
Expedia+ Voyager
Orbitz Rewards Visa




Bonus rewards
5 points per dollar on priceline.com purchases
3 points per dollar on eligible Travelocity purchases
4 Expedia+ points per dollar on eligible Expedia purchases and 2 Expedia+ points per dollar on dining & entertainment
10% Orbucks back on eligible hotels booked via mobile app (8% through desktop/web) and 7% Orbucks back on flight booked via mobile app (6% through desktop/web)


Base rewards
1 point per dollar on all other purchases
1 point per dollar on all other purchases
1 Expedia+ point per dollar on all other purchases
2% Orbucks on all other purchases


Redemption options
Statement credit toward any purchase
Statement credit toward any Travelocity purchase in the past 90 days
Flights and hotel stays booked through Expedia
Qualifying hotel booking through Orbitz


Redemption value
1 point per cent, starting at $25
Increments of 5,000 points for $50, 7,500 points for $75 or 20,000 points for the cost of an airline ticket or flight + hotel package up to maximum credit of $400
Varies based on travel reward
$1 Orbuck per $1



The Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card may help you rack up points the fastest, but the value of those points may not be as great as they initially seem. With the accumulated Orbucks, you can only redeem for bookings at qualifying hotels through Orbitz. That can be restrictive when you're missing the other major aspect of travel: flights.
The Expedia®+ Voyager card also forces you to use your points toward travel booked through Expedia, but at least you can use the points for flights and hotels. These redemptions are not as limiting. They are great if you happen to always find the best prices on Expedia.
Meanwhile, the two remaining cards only offer statement credits, which mean your balance is being erased by however much you earn back. I feel statement credits are the best reward options -- think of it as receiving a refund on a past purchase -- very convenient.
The Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card has one noteworthy highlight. It lets you redeem a statement credit for up to $400 on flights or eligible hotels and vacation packages with no blackout dates, booked through Travelocity for just 20,000 points (2 cents of value per 1 point). That’s an incentive for you to save up those points instead of redeeming at the lower denominations. The Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card, however, is very attractive because of its extremely flexible redemption options. You can pretty much “erase” any purchase with your accumulated points. (Reminds me of the popular Barclaycard Arrival Plus™ World Elite MasterCard®.)

The optimal redemption on the Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card is the $400 statement credit for 20,000 points, which can be earned with $6,667 in Travelocity purchases (3 points/$). Meanwhile, to redeem $400 on the Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card, you’ll need 40,000 points, which can be earned with $8,000 in Priceline purchases (5 points/$).
So, you’ll get slightly better redemption values with the Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card, but you’ll have more flexible redemption options with the Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card. There’s no proper way to evaluate the two advantages so I’m calling it a tie between the two.
WINNER (Redemptions): Tie (Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card and Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card)
Annual Fee

Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card: $0
Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card: $0
Expedia®+ Voyager: $95
Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card: $0

Travel credit cards are notorious for having annual fees -- often because they have various travel perks that justify such fees (e.g., free checked bags, complimentary lounge passes and companion tickets).
None of the online travel agency credit cards have any ties to specific airlines or hotel chains, so they don’t really have any of these standout travel benefits that would warrant an annual fee.
Of the four cards, only Expedia®+ Voyager has an annual fee. At $95 per year, it’s a quite a lot for anyone who doesn't like annual fees. But, the card has a set of great travel benefits -- particularly its $100 statement -- to make up for that fee.
However, when strictly speaking about the cost of the annual fee, it’s a three-way tie between the Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card, Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card, and Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Cards.
WINNER (Annual fee): Tie (Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card, Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card, and Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card)
Interest Rates

Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card: 14.99-21.99% APR
Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card: 14.99-24.99% APR
Expedia®+ Voyager: 14.24-22.24% APR
Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card: 15.99-24.99% APR

It’s never a good idea to pay interest on a credit card, especially a rewards credit card. Also, rewards credit cards tend to have higher interest rates, which is the case for all four online travel agency credit cards.
Their APRs are relatively similar but the one with lowest average APR is Expedia®+ Voyager. Meanwhile, the Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card has the highest average APR -- probably because it has such high rewards rates.
Even though Expedia®+ Voyager takes the cake for interest rates, (again) I don’t ever suggest that you pay interest on any rewards credit card. The value of your rewards will be wiped out by those interest charges.
WINNER (Interest rate): Expedia®+ Voyager
Card Coverages
Did your flight get delayed for a long time? You might be compensated for lodging, food, and more as you wait for the next flight. This is just one example of how card coverages can be useful. Every credit card comes with its own suite of card coverages that you should take into account.
Below is a table that lists out the protection and coverages offered by each card:
A Barclaycard spokesperson did not reply to me with a full guide of benefits for the Priceline Rewards Visa and Travelocity Rewards Amex cards. The information below is based on standard Visa benefits (for Priceline) and on the latest Travelocity Rewards Amex benefits guide I could find online.

With the exception of the Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card, all of the online travel agency cards provide a decent set of card coverages that encompass regular retail purchases to travel. You’ll notice that, for the Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card and Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card, I highlight certain coverages that are available only to Visa Signature cards.
Visa Signature is the upper tier version of Visa Platinum -- they offer different benefits. Priceline and Orbitz will give out different versions depending on your credit. Essentially, you want the Visa Signature version because of its extended list of coverages.
Again, looking at the chart, I’d say that the Visa Signature versions of the Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card and Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card offer the best card coverages in the group. Expedia®+ Voyager was almost able to keep up with these two cards but it fell out of the contest because it doesn’t offer travel services and assistance (I spoke with a Citi customer service rep to confirm this).
WINNER (Card coverages): Tie (Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card andOrbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card)
Travel Site Cards - Travel Benefits



Card
Travel benefits




Priceline Rewards Visa
No pre-set spending limit and personal concierge; travel upgrades and discounts at select Visa partners (Visa Signature)


Travelocity Rewards American Express
None


Expedia+ Voyager
$100 annual statement credit for airline incidentals on qualified airlines or Wi-Fi carries or for the Global Entry fee; no foreign transaction fees and free personal concierge


Orbitz Rewards Visa
No pre-set spending limit and personal concierge; travel upgrades and discounts at select Visa partners (Visa Signature) plus no foreign transaction fees



We’re talking about online travel agency credit cards here, so we have to look at the travel perks that these cards offer (if any).
Right off the bat, Travelocity® Rewards American Express® Card is looking bad due to a lack of any noteworthy travel benefits. So, lets focus on the other cards.
Given that Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card and Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card are capable of being Visa Signature cards, you can receive free nights and discounts through Visa’s hotel and car rental partners. However, the Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card stands taller with the waived foreign transaction fees, which means you’re not going to pay currency exchange fees when swiping your card abroad.
However, the card with the best travel perk is definitely Expedia®+ Voyager. The $100 statement credit can be used for a basket of things including checked bags, in-flight meals, Wi-Fi access, lounge passes on 10 major airlines (AirTran Airways, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, United/Continental Airlines, US Airways and Virgin America Airlines) and the $100 Global Entry application fee. The Global Entry program allows pre-approved travelers to receive expedited clearance upon entry into the U.S.
Expedia®+ Voyager card has a $95 annual fee because of the $100 statement credit. If you can maximize this $100 statement credit, you’ll more than recoup the annual fee. Top this perk off with the rest of the card’s travel benefits and you’ve got a solid travel companion.
WINNER (Travel benefits): Expedia®+ Voyager
Verdict: Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card
Oddly, the Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card and Orbitz Rewards Visa® Credit Card actually tied with three winning categories each. So, why did I give the crown to thePriceline Rewards™ Visa® Card?
Firstly, the hotel-only redemption option on the Orbitz card stood out as a major restriction to how you can spend your points. And, it carries the highest average APR of the group. These two aspects led me to favor the Priceline Rewards™ Visa® Card.
Winners and Losers, You Decide
Ultimately, you know what's best for your needs and preferences. This rundown is meant to give you as much information as possible, but you know yourself better than anyone else.
Your credit cards should help you enjoy and get the most out of your experience, but they are not the experience. Choose your destination, choose your credit card, and be present in the moment.

News


















Chances are good that a hotel room will cost you more this year. The Hotels.com Hotel Price Index reports that global hotel prices rose 3 percent in 2014, the fifth straight annual increase.Fortunately, we know a few tricks to help you slash rates. Here are 10 ways to make your next vacation a bit more affordable.1. Go in the off-seasonThe top way to save on your hotel room is to travel during off-peak times. Money Talks News finance expert Stacy Johnson says traveling in the off-season can cut your hotel costs by up to two-thirds.Traveling at off-peak times helped me save more than a $100 a night at Cedar Point. With fewer people traveling, hotels drop their rates in the off-season to pull in as much business as they can.2. Stay midweekIf off-season travel doesn’t work for you, try to hit your destination during the week rather than on the weekend. Unless the hotel you’re staying at caters to business travelers, you’ll probably find cheaper rates on weekdays.

3. Search online for promo codesBefore booking a hotel, try searching online for coupon codes or promo offers. If you’re booking through a third-party website, don’t forget to search for codes associated with the booking site as well as the hotel.In addition, follow your favorite brands on Facebook and Twitter. Companies occasionally distribute codes or announce flash sales on social media. You might even send a message to the company and ask if they have a coupon for loyal customers like you.4. Shop aroundHotels are a bit like cars: Each one offers roughly the same thing for a different price. Find the best rate by searching for hotel prices on a couple of different sites or use an aggregator site like Trivago.com. Be sure to clear the cookies from your computer between searches to ensure your search history isn’t influencing your results.Also, don’t neglect calling the hotel directly. In my experience, some of the best rates are offered by the hotel itself.5. Think outside the hotelSometimes the best deal isn’t a hotel at all. If you have a large family or are traveling with a group, you may find it’s cheaper to rent a vacation home.For a different experience, you could try a bed and breakfast, Airbnb or a hostel. Really adventurous souls can try couch surfing.6. Bundle your vacationIf you’re using a third-party site, try bundling your vacation. Some sites will provide discounts if you buy airfare or rent a car at the same time you book a hotel room. However, you should also price out your airfare and room separately to ensure you’re getting a bargain.7. Rethink the entertainment packageMany hotels offer entertainment packages that add meals and attraction tickets to your room. On the face of it, many of these packages seem a good deal. But do some research before making your reservation.Learn what is in the package so you don’t spend on perks you don’t want. Also, it may be just as cheap to buy the included items separately. And by waiting to make those ticket and meal purchases after you arrive, you’ll likely have greater flexibility in your schedule.8. Sign up for a loyalty programFrom Choice Hotels to Hyatt, hotel chains fitting every budget offer loyalty programs. They often work like frequent-flier miles, earning you free nights after a certain number of stays.They may also entitle you to discounts and other perks, like evening receptions or room upgrades. Best of all, most are free to join.9. Join a clubMembership has its privileges, and some organizations have negotiated discounts with hotel chains. AARP and AAA are two groups known for helping members get rate cuts. If you’re a member, be sure to ask about special rates before booking your stay.10. Ask for a dealFinally, the best way to cut your hotel rate may be to simply ask. Don’t bother using a third-party booking site or even the hotel chain’s 800-number for this strategy. Just call the front desk of the hotel and ask for the lowest nonrefundable rate they offer.Another option is to make a refundable reservation and then continue to shop around. If you find a lower price, go back to your preferred hotel and ask if it can match the competition’s price. At the very least, the hotel may offer you an upgrade.What’s your secret way to save on lodging? Share with us in comments below or on our Facebook page.

Host Hotels & Resorts (NYSE: HST) is an American real estate investment trust and the owner of lodging real estate based in Bethesda, Maryland.
History[edit]
Host Hotels & Resorts was formed in 1993 when the Marriott Corporation split into two separate entities, creating Marriott International and Host Marriott. The latter was renamed Host Hotels & Resorts in 2005, to reflect a growing number of non-Marriott hotels in their portfolio.[3]
Marriott International represented the original Marriott company prior to Marriott's 1982 acquisition of the old Host International Company, founded in 1897 as the Van Noy Railway News and Hotel Company by the Van Noy Brothers of Kansas City, MO. After the spin-off, the original assets and services comprising the Host International acquisition, encompassing the ownership of lodging real estate and operators of airport terminal concession businesses and franchises, were consolidated as the Host Marriott Corporation.
On January 2, 1996, Host Marriott further divided into two separate companies. Host Marriott continues to own lodging real estate. A new company, Host Marriott Services Corporation (now known as HMSHost Corporation) was created to hold and operate concessions at airports, on toll roads, and at sports and entertainment attractions.
On April 4, 1996, Host Marriott sold 18 Residence Inns and 16 Marriott Courtyard Hotels to Hospitality Properties Trust to focus on other areas of the business.[4]
On June 21, 1997, Host Marriott acquired Forum Group, Inc. and its retirement communities, Marriott Senior Living Services.[5]
In December 1998, Crestline Capital Corporation was spun off to allow Host Marriott to complete an announced conversion to a REIT. As part of the spinoff, Host Marriott arranged to lease back much of the property that was being spun off. At the end of the year, the preparations were completed with Host Marriott emerging as a REIT on January 1, 1999.[6]
November 2005, Host Marriott announced that it would purchase 38 domestic and international hotel properties for approximately $4.1 billion. The seller was Starwood Hotels & Resorts, a hotel owner/operator based in White Plains, New York. Starwood would continue to manage the portfolio of 20 Sheratons, 13 Westins, two W's, one St Regis, one Luxury Collection hotel, one nonbranded property. As part of the transaction, Host Marriott was renamed Host Hotels & Resorts to better reflect its more diversified portfolio of hotel brands.[7]

Host Hotels & Resorts (NYSE: HST) is an American real estate investment trust and the owner of lodging real estate based in Bethesda, Maryland.
History[edit]
Host Hotels & Resorts was formed in 1993 when the Marriott Corporation split into two separate entities, creating Marriott International and Host Marriott. The latter was renamed Host Hotels & Resorts in 2005, to reflect a growing number of non-Marriott hotels in their portfolio.[3]
Marriott International represented the original Marriott company prior to Marriott's 1982 acquisition of the old Host International Company, founded in 1897 as the Van Noy Railway News and Hotel Company by the Van Noy Brothers of Kansas City, MO. After the spin-off, the original assets and services comprising the Host International acquisition, encompassing the ownership of lodging real estate and operators of airport terminal concession businesses and franchises, were consolidated as the Host Marriott Corporation.
On January 2, 1996, Host Marriott further divided into two separate companies. Host Marriott continues to own lodging real estate. A new company, Host Marriott Services Corporation (now known as HMSHost Corporation) was created to hold and operate concessions at airports, on toll roads, and at sports and entertainment attractions.
On April 4, 1996, Host Marriott sold 18 Residence Inns and 16 Marriott Courtyard Hotels to Hospitality Properties Trust to focus on other areas of the business.[4]
On June 21, 1997, Host Marriott acquired Forum Group, Inc. and its retirement communities, Marriott Senior Living Services.[5]
In December 1998, Crestline Capital Corporation was spun off to allow Host Marriott to complete an announced conversion to a REIT. As part of the spinoff, Host Marriott arranged to lease back much of the property that was being spun off. At the end of the year, the preparations were completed with Host Marriott emerging as a REIT on January 1, 1999.[6]
November 2005, Host Marriott announced that it would purchase 38 domestic and international hotel properties for approximately $4.1 billion. The seller was Starwood Hotels & Resorts, a hotel owner/operator based in White Plains, New York. Starwood would continue to manage the portfolio of 20 Sheratons, 13 Westins, two W's, one St Regis, one Luxury Collection hotel, one nonbranded property. As part of the transaction, Host Marriott was renamed Host Hotels & Resorts to better reflect its more diversified portfolio of hotel brands.[7]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
