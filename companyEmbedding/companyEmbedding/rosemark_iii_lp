Citing Case 




116 Ohio App.3d 306 (1996)


The STATE of Ohio, Appellee,
v.
ROSEMARK, Appellant.


Court of Appeals of Ohio, Ninth District, Lorain County.
Decided December 11, 1996.








Attorney(s) appearing for the Case
 Donald Robinson, Lorain County Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.
Gold, Rotatori & Schwartz Co., L.P.A., Gerald S. Gold and John S. Pyle, for appellant.





REECE, Presiding Judge.
Appellant Dorian Rosemark appeals from the judgment order of the court of common pleas denying his motion to vacate his guilty plea.
 I
Appellant Dorian Rosemark was indicted on a charge of aggravated trafficking in drugs. Rosemark pleaded guilty to the charge on the date of trial, January 25, 1995. Sentencing was scheduled for March 10, 1995. After twice requesting to have the sentencing date continued, Rosemark moved to vacate his guilty plea on March 31, 1995.
Rosemark's motion was heard by the trial court on April 14, 1995. The trial court denied the motion on October 18, 1995. On October 27, 1995, the court sentenced Rosemark to a term of incarceration for five to twenty-five years. This appeal followed.
II
In his sole assignment of error, Rosemark asserts that the trial court erred in denying his motion to vacate his guilty plea. We reject this argument.
"[A] presentence motion to withdraw a guilty plea should be freely and liberally granted. Nevertheless, it must be recognized that a defendant does not have an absolute right to withdraw a plea prior to sentencing." State v. Xie (1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 521, 527, 584 N.E.2d 715, 719. See, also, State v. Barnett (1991), 73 Ohio App.3d 244, 250, 596 N.E.2d 1101, 1104-1105. Determining whether there is a reasonable and legitimate basis for the withdrawal of the plea is a matter within the trial court's sound discretion. Xie, supra, at 526, 584 N.E.2d at 718-719, citing State v. Peterseim (1980), 68 Ohio App.2d 211, 22 O.O.3d 341, 428 N.E.2d 863. Absent an abuse of discretion, the trial court's decision must be affirmed. Xie, 62 Ohio St.3d at 527, 584 N.E.2d at 719-720. In order to find an abuse of discretion, we must find that the trial court acted unjustly or unfairly; that its ruling was unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable. Id. at 526-527, 584 N.E.2d at 718-720.
Where a defendant (1) is represented by competent counsel, (2) is given a full hearing before entering the plea, and (3) is given a hearing on the motion to withdraw during which the court considers the defendant's arguments in support of the motion, the trial court does not abuse its discretion in denying the plea withdrawal. Peterseim, supra, 68 Ohio App.2d at 214, 428 N.E.2d at 865-866. See, also, State v. Lockett (Mar. 6, 1996), Summit App. No. 17523, unreported, 1996 WL 99772. These elements were met in Rosemark's case.
Rosemark was represented by competent counsel throughout the proceedings. The following occurred at the hearing when Rosemark pleaded guilty:
"The Court: Mr. Rosemark, I'll ask at this time, how do you plead to the charge of Aggravated Trafficking in Drugs, a felony of the first degree?
 "The Defendant: Guilty.
"The Court: All right. Do you understand that that charge carries with it a term of incarceration, an indefinite term of incarceration, of not less than four, five, six, or seven years, to a maximum of 25 years in prison?
"The Defendant: Yes, your Honor.
"The Court: Do you also understand that that charge carries five years of actual incarceration, which means that it is not probationable and that the Court must order that you serve a minimum of five years' actual incarceration? Do you understand that?
"The Defendant: Yes, your Honor.
"The Court: There is also a possible fine up to $10,000; however, there is a mandatory fine of $7,500. So in other words, the Court must impose a fine of at least $7,500; do you understand that?
"The Defendant: Yes. Yes, sir.
"The Court: * * * You have a constitutional right to a jury trial, and when you plead guilty, you waive, that is, you give up your right to a jury trial; do you understand that?
"The Defendant: Yes, sir.
"The Court: If a trial were held, the State of Ohio could bring witnesses in who may testify against you at that trial. Then you would have the opportunity to face, question and cross examine those witnesses. However, when you plead guilty, you give up the opportunity to face and cross examine your accusers; do you understand?
"The Defendant: Yes, sir.
"The Court: Similarly at a trial, you could compel witnesses to come to court by subpoenaing them, and those witnesses may testify favorably to you. But by pleading guilty, you waive the opportunity to have witnesses appear and testify on your behalf; do you understand?
"The Defendant: Yes, sir.
"The Court: Now, if a trial were held, before the State of Ohio could be successful and obtain a conviction, the State would have to prove your guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. That is no longer necessary when you plead guilty because you admit to the charge; do you understand?
"The Defendant: Yes, sir.
"The Court: And lastly, if that trial were held, you could not be forced to testify against yourself; are you aware you have that right?
 "The Defendant: Yes.
"* * *
"The Court: Has anyone forced you in any way to plead guilty in this case? "The Defendant: No, sir.
"The Court: Has anyone threatened you causing you to plead guilty?
"The Defendant: No, sir.
"* * *
"The Court: * * * At this time I'm going to ask that the Prosecutor offer a brief statement of facts.
"Mr. Robinson: Yes, your Honor. On September 15th, 1993, at approximately 6:30 p.m., the Defendant contacted Detective Leiby from the Elyria Police Department. Defendant made a phone call from the area of East Avenue—East—I'm sorry, 8th Avenue and Middle Avenue in Elyria, Ohio, at which time the Defendant offered to sell Detective Leiby a sheet of LSD. A sheet of LSD is the equivalent of 100 hits, or had 100 hits of LSD on it, which is greater than three times the bulk, in exchange for $300. LSD is a Schedule I drug.
"The Court: Fine. Mr. Rosemark, you've heard the statement of the Prosecutor; is it substantially correct?
"The Defendant: Yes, your Honor.
"* * *
"The Court: * * *. Having reviewed with you in open court all of your rights, I'm going to ask you now for the final time, how do you plead to the one charge of Aggravated Trafficking in Drugs, a felony of the first degree?
"The Defendant: Guilty.
"The Court: I'm going to accept your plea of guilty. I believe you entered it knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently."
Rosemark also confirmed before the court that he signed a plea sheet, entering a plea of guilty. He stated that he understood the implications of signing the plea sheet.
The court considered evidence regarding Rosemark's motion to withdraw his guilty plea at a hearing on April 14, 1995. After reviewing the evidence presented at this hearing, the court decided that Rosemark had entered his plea knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently and refused to vacate his guilty plea.  Our review of the record does not support a conclusion that the court abused its discretion in making that determination.
Rosemark further contends the court erred in refusing to vacate his plea because the plea was induced by threats of physical harm made to him by a detective on the Elyria Police Force. Our review of the alleged threatening statements reveals that the detective made the statements with regard to Rosemark's cooperation with the police. The statements referred to the possible implications of prison life for Rosemark and certainly could not be construed as an inducement to plead guilty and face a sure prison term. Thus, Rosemark's contention that his plea was induced by threats lacks merit.
From the evidence presented, we cannot hold that the trial court acted in an unreasonable or arbitrary manner in denying Rosemark's motion to withdraw his guilty plea. The record does not reflect incompetent representation by Rosemark's counsel. The record does reflect a thorough inquiry by the court prior to its acceptance of Rosemark's plea and consideration of his arguments to vacate the plea.
Accordingly, Rosemark's sole assignment of error is overruled.
III
The assignment of error is overruled, and the judgment of the trial court denying Rosemark's motion to vacate his guilty plea is affirmed.
Judgment affirmed.
DICKINSON and SLABY, JJ., concur.

					Pursuant to Ind. Appellate Rule 65(D), this Memorandum Decision shall not be regarded as precedent or cited before any court except for the purpose of establishing the defense of res judicata, collateral estoppel, or the law of the case. ATTORNEYS FOR APPELLANTS:  ATTORNEY FOR APPELLEE:  ROBERT J. PALMER May Oberfell Lorber Mishawaka, Indiana  DAVID L. MIRKIN Mirkin Law Offices, P.C. South Bend, Indiana  DONALD E. WERTHEIMER South Bend, Indiana  IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF INDIANA MARK LAFOREST and MARCIA LAFOREST, Appellants-Plaintiffs/ Counterclaim-Defendants, vs. ROSEMARK HOMES OF SOUTH BEND, INC. Appellee-Defendant/ Counterclaim-Plaintiff.  ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )  No. 71A03-0601-CV-53  APPEAL FROM THE ST. JOSEPH CIRCUIT COURT The Honorable Michael G. Gotsch, Judge Cause No. 71C01-9806-CP-830  May 21, 2007 MEMORANDUM DECISION - NOT FOR PUBLICATION KIRSCH, Judge   Following a remand from this court on a claim for breach of contract, Mark LaForest (    Husband    ) and Marcia LaForest (    Wife    ) (collectively the     LaForests    ) appeal the trial court    s award of damages to Rosemark Homes of South Bend, Inc. (    Rosemark    ), raising the following issues: I.  Whether the trial court on remand erred in awarding damages where there was insufficient evidence that the damages were the natural, foreseeable, and proximate result of the LaForests     breach of contract.  II.  Whether the trial court on remand, which was presided over by a judge other than the original trier of fact, erred by failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing for the purposes of calculating and itemizing Rosemark    s damages.  III.  Whether the trial court on remand erred in scheduling a hearing to determine Rosemark    s appellate attorney fees.  Rosemark, in turn, counterclaims and raises the following issue: IV.  Whether the trial court on remand erred by omitting closing costs in the form of realtor fees and real property taxes from Rosemark    s damage award.  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY This is the second appeal in this case. This court    s prior memorandum decision was rendered on September 29, 2003, and set forth the underlying facts as follows: In the spring of 1997, Husband    s employer reassigned him from New Jersey to South Bend, Indiana. Wife remained in New Jersey until Husband found a new home. In late June 1997, Husband discussed with Rosemark vice president Mike Everett a four-bedroom home that was to be built on lot number 56 in Westwood Hills and featured in a builders     showcase in September 1997. Husband toured a similar four-bedroom home built by Rosemark and sent pictures and plans to Wife.  2   The LaForests requested several modifications to the original plan, including the transformation of a fourth bedroom into an open loft. On July 13, 1997, the LaForests and Rosemark signed a construction agreement and general building specifications, which incorporated the modifications and specified that the home was to be ready for possession on September 24, 1997. The agreement also required that any additions or changes be made in writing. On August 5, 1997, the LaForests satisfied the down payment requirement of $24,170.00. During the construction of the home, the LaForests objected to the following: the siding was Brentwood vinyl instead of Barkwood vinyl; the chimney chase was made of one-half brick laminate instead of full brick; Rosemark did not install a plastic air barrier over the insulation in the basement; Rosemark constructed a different style of front porch than that specified by the contract; and Rosemark constructed a different style of screened porch and deck than that specified by the contract. Rosemark and the LaForests discussed each of these changes. The LaForests orally approved these changes but refused to sign written reductions of these changes. In early September 1997, the LaForests learned that Rosemark had installed a septic tank approved for a three-bedroom home. On September 24, 1997, the LaForests provided Rosemark with a list of complaints. When no agreement was reached, the LaForests refused to purchase the home. On June 17, 1998, the Laforests filed a complaint alleging conversion, seeking recovery of earnest money [in the amount of $24,170.00] paid on the contract for construction of the home, and giving notice of lis pendens against the subject property. On August 24, 1998, Rosemark filed its reply, counterclaim, and motion to dismiss the conversion claim and lis pendens notice. Rosemark    s counterclaim sought     damages for loss of income, costs incurred for maintaining the property, costs associated with the re-sale of the home, and other expenses incurred due to the breach.     1 . . . In April 2001, the trial court released $24,170.00 from an escrow fund to Rosemark. LaForest v. Rosemark Homes of South Bend, Inc., No. 71A03-0212-CV-429, slip op. at 2-4 (Ind. Ct. App. Sept. 29, 2003); Appellant    s App. at 15-17.  1  Rosemark requested total damages in the amount of $79,165.71, which, in part, consisted of $21,135.85 for loss of income from the sale of the house, $17,482.25 in interest payments on the mortgage for the property, $13,577.75 in attorney fees, builders     insurance, maintenance and landscape expenditures.  3   The matter was tried to the bench, and on June 4, 2002, the trial court entered judgment finding for Rosemark both on the LaForests     complaint and on Rosemark    s counterclaim. Without itemizing Rosemark    s damages, the trial court awarded Rosemark $10,188.12 in damages, which when added to the $24,170.00 that Rosemark had previously been paid totaled $34,358.12. Rosemark filed a motion to correct error seeking to modify the order from $10,188.12 to $54,995.71, arguing that the latter amount was the actual loss it had incurred. This modification would have awarded Rosemark $79,165.71 in damages. Two days later, the LaForests also filed a motion to correct error seeking to vacate and modify the judgment against them and contending that Rosemark failed to build the home in accordance with the construction specifications, which released them from the obligation to purchase the home. Following a hearing, the trial court denied both motions. In September 2002, the LaForests appealed, and Rosemark filed a cross-appeal. In a memorandum decision dated September 29, 2003, this court affirmed the trial court    s judgment against the LaForests in the breach of contract claim and affirmed the trial court    s decision to enter damages in favor of Rosemark. However, finding that the damage award was outside the scope of the evidence, our court ordered the case remanded for recalculation and itemization of damages. The LaForests filed a petition for rehearing, which our court denied. Thereafter, on April 1, 2004, our Supreme Court denied the LaForests     petition to transfer. On remand, with a different judge presiding, the trial court entered findings of fact and conclusions thereon and awarded Rosemark $36,401.69. This amount was in addition to the $24,170.00 that Rosemark had been previously paid, for a total payment of $60,571.69. The 4   LaForests now appeal, and Rosemark counterclaims. Additional facts will be added as necessary. DISCUSSION AND DECISION I.  Damages  The LaForests challenge the trial court    s order on remand to pay Rosemark $36,401.69 in damages. Our review of an award of damages is limited. J.E. Stone Tree Service, Inc. v. Bolger, 831 N.E.2d 220, 227 (Ind. Ct. App. 2005). We do not reweigh the evidence or judge the credibility of witnesses, and we will consider only the evidence favorable to the award. Id.; Abbey Villas Dev. Corp. v. Site Contractors, Inc., 716 N.E.2d 91, 101 (Ind. Ct. App. 1999), trans. denied. A damage award must be supported by probative evidence and cannot be based on mere speculation, conjecture, or surmise. Bolger, 831 N.E.2d at 227. A party injured by a breach of contract is limited in its recovery to the loss actually suffered, and may not be placed in a better position than it would have enjoyed if the breach had not occurred. Id. Thus, a damage award must be referenced to some fairly defined standard, such as cost of repair, market value, established experience, rental value, loss of use, loss of profits, or direct inference from known circumstances. Abbey Villas, 716 N.E.2d at 101 (citing 4-D Bldgs., Inc. v. Palmore, 688 N.E.2d 918, 921 (Ind. Ct. App. 1997)). We will reverse an award only when it is not within the scope of the evidence before the finder of fact. Id. In our September 29, 2003 memorandum decision, a panel of this court noted:  5   Rosemark identifies six categories of damages and corresponding evidence to justify its claim for additional compensation. [sic]     (1) loss of income from the original purchase price and the resale value; (2) maintenance of the property costs; (3) payment of interest on loans for builder financing; (3) [sic] insurance; (4) tax liability; (5) costs associated with the February 1999 closing; and (6) attorneys fees.     Appellee    s Br. at 12. After subtracting the $24,170.00 already granted to Rosemark, the remaining damages calculated by Rosemark total $54,995.71. We take issue with the inclusion of the February 1999 closing costs, because Rosemark would have incurred similar costs even if the LaForests had purchased the home. The remaining damages, however, are supported by the evidence and are the natural, foreseeable, and proximate consequence of the LaForests     breach. Although we do not endorse the precise amount that Rosemark requests, we do agree with its contention that its damages award is clearly outside the scope of the evidence. We therefore remand with instructions to recalculate Rosemark    s damages consistent with this opinion. LaForest, slip op. at 7-8; Appellant    s App. at 20-21. On remand, the trial court itemized Rosemark    s requested damages as follows: a.  Maintenance Costs, totaling $4,895.01:   ª $483.45 in payments [for electricity] from 10/17/96 thru 2/20/99.   ª $892.57 in payments [for gas] from 10/7/97 thru 2/26/99.   ª $2,469.00 in landscape maintenance from 3/1/98 thru 10/31/98.   ª $582.87 in housecleaning from 1/20/98 thru 2/24/99.   ª $430.00 in interior touch-up work on 4/8/98 and 10/9/98.   ª $ 37.12 for light bulbs and other maintenance supplies.  b.  Payment of Interest on Loans for Building Financing by James R. Lewis, totaling $17,482.25:   ª $17,482.25, which represents Standard Federal Loan Interest from 10/1/97 thru 2/1/99.  c.  Insurance Costs, totaling $1,110.78:   ª $1,110.78 in payments made to Builder    s Risk Insurance from 10/1/97 thru 2/26/99.  d.  Tax Liability, totaling $929.00:   ª $929.00 in additional taxes owed by James R. Lewis due to loans. 6   e.  Loss of Income due to Resale, totaling $21,135.85:   ª $21,135.85, representing the original contract price plus agreed extras ($251,135.85) less the sale price on 2/26/99 ($230,000.00).  f. Litigation Expenses, totaling $15,018.80   ª $13,577.75 in trial attorney    s fees   ª $275.55 (representing one-half of . . . mediator fees).   ª $756.00 in deposition costs to St. Clair Court Reporting.   ª $109.50 in deposition costs to Holle and Associates.   ª $300.00 in bookkeeping (accounting) fees. g. Closing Costs, totaling $18,594.02:   ª $18,594.02 representing the closing costs when the house was sold on 2/26/99. The foregoing expenses total the sum of $79,165.71. Appellant    s App. at 10-11. Thereafter, the trial court awarded Rosemark all of its claimed damages, with the exception of the closing costs that our court had previously ruled to be improper. The damage award was $60,571.69, but, since the LaForests had already paid $24,170.00, the trial court ordered the LaForests to pay $36,401.69. We consider separately each element of the trial court    s damage award. The trial court found probative evidence that Rosemark: (1) incurred $21,135.85 in damages     due to resale,     which was the difference between the original price of $251,135.85 minus the February 1999 sale price of $230,000.00; (2) incurred $17,482.25 in mortgage interest expenses; 2 and (3) expended $1,110.78 in insurance costs. The trial court also found that, under the terms of the construction agreement, Rosemark was entitled to recover  2  We note that while statutory pre-judgment interest here may have been a more appropriate measure of interest damages, statutory pre-judgment interest would exceed this amount. See IC 24-4.6-1-103.  7   attorney fees in the amount $13,577.75. After carefully reviewing the record before us, we agree that these damages were within the scope of the evidence presented on remand. The trial court also found probative evidence that Rosemark was entitled to damages of $4,894.01 for maintenance costs and litigation costs of $1,441.05. After reviewing the record before us, we find that the evidence supports the award of $3,370.02 in maintenance costs 3 and $1,141.05 in litigation expenses. 4 Finally, the trial court allowed damages in the sum of $929.00 for additional personal taxes owed by James R. Lewis, a principal in Rosemark. We disallow such damages because they are neither explained nor documented in the record, nor were they shown to be reasonably foreseeable or otherwise within the contemplation of the parties at the time they entered into their contract. II.  Hearing on Remand  The LaForests next contend that the trial court on remand abused its discretion by failing to order a new trial on the issue of damages. Indiana Trial Rule 63(A) allows a successor judge to perform any post-trial duties that the judge who conducted the trial or hearing could have performed. However, there are instances in which the successor judge    s failure to preside at trial renders him ill-equipped to perform the functions of the regular trial judge. Holmes v. Holmes, 726 N.E.2d 1276, 1281 (Ind. Ct. App. 2000), trans. denied. T.R. 3  Specifically, we disallow the expenses for light bulbs of $37.12 (because the invoice was dated after the date of resale of the residence and this discrepancy is unexplained in the record); paint touch-up costs of $430.00 since there is no explanation why these costs would not have been covered by warranty; landscaping charges of $554.00 for removing dead trees and the planting of new trees, shrubs, and flowers since these costs are unexplained in the record; and cleaning costs of $402.87 since they are disproportionate and unexplained in the record.  8   63(A), therefore, also contemplates,     if [a judge] is satisfied that he cannot perform those duties because he did not preside at the trial or for any other reason, he may in his discretion grant a new trial or new hearing, in whole or in part.     Id.     In these instances, the discretion to conduct a new hearing or trial     is a privilege allowed a judge within the confines of justice to decide and act in accordance with what is fair and equitable.         Id. (quoting Urbanational Developers, Inc. v. Shamrock Eng    g, Inc., 175 Ind. App. 416, 420-21, 372 N.E.2d 742, 746 (1978)). Here, at the request of the LaForests     counsel, the trial court on remand held a hearing to allow counsel for each party to explain why claimed damages should or should not be allowed. This hearing resulted in a twenty-five-page transcript. Thereafter, the trial court based its determination of damages on guidance from our court    s memorandum decision, exhibits from the original trial, and the information he obtained during the hearing on remand. Further, in the interest of efficiency, it was reasonable for the trial court to have the attorneys review the evidence concerning damages rather than allow the individual parties to testify. The trial court acted within its discretion when it decided on a damage award without holding a new trial. Id. III.  Attorney Fees  The LaForests contend that the trial court erred in scheduling a hearing for the purpose of determining Rosemark    s appellate attorney fees for the 2003 appeal when Rosemark failed to request an award of appellate attorney fees in either the trial court or this court prior to our 2003 decision. Rosemark counters that, because the construction agreement provides for an 4  We disallow the bookkeeping expense of $300.00, which is not explained in the record.  9   award of attorney fees to the prevailing party, it is also entitled to appellate attorney fees. Appellee    s Brief at 16.         The general rule in Indiana and other states is that each party to litigation must pay his own attorney fees. However, an award of attorney fees may be authorized by contract, rule, statute, or agreement.         Marion-Adams School Corp. v. Boone, 840 N.E.2d 462, 467 (Ind. Ct. App. 2006) (quoting Morgan County v. Ferguson, 712 N.E.2d 1038, 1043 (Ind. Ct. App. 1999) (citation omitted)). Here, the construction agreement provided,     Should any litigation be brought regarding the Project or this Construction Agreement, the Contractor is entitled to recover his attorney fees from the Buyer, should he prevail.     Appellant    s App. at 100. For many years, our court denied appellate attorney fees in cases where attorney fees were provided for in a contract provision. Seibert v. Mock, 510 N.E.2d 1373, 1378 (Ind. Ct. App. 1987).     We viewed an award of attorney fees as merged in the judgment and not available for appellate fees.     Id. (citing McCormick v. Falls City Bank, 57 F. 107 (7th Cir.1892)).     More recently, we have recognized the parties to such a contract intended to indemnify the injured party and have excepted appellate attorney fees from the general rule of merger on equitable principles.     Id. (citing Radio Distrib. v. Nat    l Bank & Trust, 489 N.E.2d 642, 649 (Ind. Ct. App. 1986)). The preferred procedure for requesting appellate fees is to timely file a petition for allowance of attorney fees with the trial court after appellate proceedings have initiated. Vazquez v. Dulios, 505 N.E.2d 152, 154 (Ind. Ct. App. 1987). Without citation to authority, the LaForests contend that, to be timely filed, the petition for  10   attorney fees must also be filed prior to the appellate court having rendered its opinion. We find no support for this contention. Indiana Appellate Rule 67 provides for the assessment of costs on appeal. Indiana CPA Soc    y, Inc. v. GoMembers, Inc., 777 N.E.2d 747, 752-53 (Ind. Ct. App. 2002); Commercial Coin Laundry Systems v. Enneking, 766 N.E.2d 433, 442 (Ind. Ct. App. 2002).         Costs     include the filing fee, the cost of preparing the Record on Appeal, postage, and     additional items as permitted by law.         Indiana CPA Soc    y, 777 N.E.2d at 753 (quoting App. R. 67(B)). As such, attorney fees are sometimes permitted under this rule. Id.; Enneking, 766 N.E.2d at 442. Appellate Rule 67(A) provides:     Upon a motion by any party within sixty (60) days after the final decision of the Court of Appeals or Supreme Court, the Clerk shall tax costs under this rule.     While recognizing that attorney fees are not always considered costs, we find persuasive the timing set forth in this rule. By the LaForests     own admission, Rosemark,     did not request appellate attorney fees until it filed its request for hearing on October 3, 2003, four days after this Court rendered its opinion and remanded the case to the trial court.     Appellant    s Brief at 29. As such, the trial court was within its discretion to conclude that appellate attorney fees could be awarded. The trial court did not err in deferring the consideration of appellate attorney fees until this matter is returned to the trial court    s jurisdiction on remand. IV.  Closing Costs  Rosemark finally contends that the trial court erred in omitting from its damage award closing costs in the form of realtor fees and real property taxes. Specifically, Rosemark 11   argues that it would not have incurred the realtor fee and property taxes if the LaForests had not breached the contract. In their response to Rosemark    s cross-appeal, the LaForests counter that the law of the case bars Rosemark    s argument. We agree. The LaForests argue that our court    s September 29, 2003 determination that closing costs were excluded from the calculation of damages was the law of the case.     Under the law of the case doctrine, an appellate court    s determination of a legal issue is binding both on the trial court on remand and on the appellate court on a subsequent appeal, given the same case with substantially the same facts.     Boonville Convalescent Ctr., Inc. v. Cloverleaf Healthcare Servs., Inc., 834 N.E.2d 1116, 1125 (Ind. Ct. App. 2005), trans. denied (2006) (citing Montgomery v. Trisler, 771 N.E.2d 1234, 1238 (Ind. Ct. App. 2002), trans. denied). To invoke the law of the case doctrine, matters decided in the prior appeal clearly must appear to be the only possible construction of an opinion. In our 2003 memorandum decision, we determined that closing costs would not be included in the claimed damages. Rosemark, however, failed to appeal our decision that closing costs were excluded from the damage award. As such, our court    s determination on closing costs was left unchallenged. While recognizing that the law of the case doctrine is discretionary, we fail to find any extraordinary circumstance that could persuade us to revisit the already decided issue of closing costs and hold Rosemark may not recover closing costs here. Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. 5  5  On July 12, 2006, Rosemark filed a Motion for Appellate Attorney fees. The Motion requested     that the Court order that this matter be remanded to the Trial Court for determination of Rosemark Homes      12   SHARPNACK, J., and MATHIAS, J., concur.  appellate attorney fees after the Court of Appeals has ruled on the appeal of this matter.     Rosemark failed to specify whether the requested fees were for the first or second appeal. Our court held the motion in abeyance to be decided by this panel after the case was fully briefed. Because we remand for the trial court to determine the amount, if any, of attorney fees warranted for the 2003 (first) appeal, we direct this motion be referred to the trial court as well. The trial court should not award Rosemark fees for the cross-appeal and, indeed, should consider awarding the LaForests the costs that they incurred in defending it.  13

These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.

These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.
