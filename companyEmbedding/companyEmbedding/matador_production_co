Operations




 

Matador Resources Company’s focus is to create a risk balanced portfolio of exploration opportunities for oil and natural gas in unconventional resource plays, supplemented with exploration for more conventional targets.  We concentrate our exploration efforts primarily on known hydrocarbon-producing areas with well-established production histories offering the potential for multiple-zone completions.  During the last few years, we have concentrated on the Eagle Ford shale play in South Texas and more recently on the Permian Basin in Southeast New Mexico and West Texas.
Our principal areas of operation consist of:

Southeast New Mexico and West Texas – Delaware and Midland Basins
South Texas – Eagle Ford shale
Northwest Louisiana and East Texas – Haynesville shale, including Middle Bossier shale, and traditional Cotton Valley and Hosston (Travis Peak) plays

Operations




 

Matador Resources Company’s focus is to create a risk balanced portfolio of exploration opportunities for oil and natural gas in unconventional resource plays, supplemented with exploration for more conventional targets.  We concentrate our exploration efforts primarily on known hydrocarbon-producing areas with well-established production histories offering the potential for multiple-zone completions.  During the last few years, we have concentrated on the Eagle Ford shale play in South Texas and more recently on the Permian Basin in Southeast New Mexico and West Texas.
Our principal areas of operation consist of:

Southeast New Mexico and West Texas – Delaware and Midland Basins
South Texas – Eagle Ford shale
Northwest Louisiana and East Texas – Haynesville shale, including Middle Bossier shale, and traditional Cotton Valley and Hosston (Travis Peak) plays

ABOUT MATADOR
Matador is a full-service content production company with offices in New York and Los Angeles.
Founded in 2013 by Jay Peterson and Todd Lubin, the company is a creative collaboration between two
experienced producers and longtime friends, bringing together their unique vision and knack for making
popular and innovative content across a variety of platforms.
MATADOR TEAM
 Jay Peterson
Founder, CEO 
Prior to founding Matador, Jay served as the Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President of Production and Development at Original Media, an Endemol Company. During his tenure at Original, Jay developed and produced several hit television series, including History’s Swamp People, Spike’s Inkmaster, AMC’s Comic Book Men and Discovery’s Dual Survival. He expanded Original’s portfolio into new categories such as sports (MMA Uncensored Live), talk (The Gayle King Show), music (Unplugged) and live television (Nokia’s Rihanna Live for MTV, VH1 and Palladia), and strengthened the franchises and economics of existing shows such as Storm Chasers, LA Ink and The Rachel Zoe Project. Before joining Original, Jay was the President of K2 Pictures, where he served as Executive Producer on numerous projects, including the Showtime feature documentary Same Sex America, the daily ESPN series Classic Now and the Kennedy Center’s 9/11 memorial special, Concert for America (NBC).

Jay PetersonFounder, CEO Todd Lubin
Co-Founder 
Todd served as Executive Producer and showrunner of NBC’s hit reality show, The Biggest Loser before starting Matador. His tenure lasted nine seasons, an unprecedented 175 episodes and over 330 hours of primetime programing. Todd was the primary creative decision maker in all facets of the show, overseeing a crew of 200 and managing the show’s franchise partnerships with Ford, General Mills and Subway as well as collaborations with Michelle Obama, the NFL and NASCAR. Under Todd’s leadership, the show reached its highest ratings across all demographics. Prior to running The Biggest Loser, Todd produced content as diverse as the USA Network’s live country music show, Nashville Star, and the documentary-style 30 DAYS for F/X. He has also produced series for MTV, VH1, and The Sundance Channel, and directed and produced the award-winning documentary, Year of the Bull, which sold to Showtime in 2003. Todd started his career producing feature films with Derek Cianfrance (Blue Valentine) and working in development for filmmaker Michael Mann (The Insider, Ali).

Matador, a.s. (a joint-stock company) is a multinational car tire producer based in Púchov, Slovakia, as well as the corresponding group of companies.
It exports above 87% of its production into 80 countries worldwide. It does not produce only tires, but also associated and similar products and services. It has several trading companies and a network of shops. The largest export customers are the United States, UK, Germany, and the CIS states.
Matador now also produces conveyor belts, automotive parts and machinery.
History[edit]
The company arose in the town of Púchov in 1947 as a "national enterprise" that was split off from the old firm Matador Bratislava.
Matador Bratislava was founded in 1905 (till 1911 known as the "Matador - Gummi und Balata Werke") involved mainly in the production of rubber hoses and belts in its new facilities in Petržalka, a district of Bratislava. Since 1925, it has produced tires (the first tires producer in former Czechoslovakia). Its tires were fitted to many Czechoslovak automobiles of the 1930s, thus contributing in co-operation with the brands Škoda, Tatra, Aero and others to the development of automotive industry in Central Europe. The firm was nationalized in 1946 and privatized in 1995. Its trade name has been Matadorex, a.s. since the privatization.
Matador in Púchov itself was established as a "national enterprise" (since 1988 "state-owned enterprise") for tire production in 1947. Production started in 1950. It was called "Gumárne 1. mája" (which translates to "rubber works of 1st of may"), at that time and sold its products under the trademark Barum. Gradually it expanded its production and became the monopoly producer of air tubes (since 1962) and the main producer of rubber conveyor belts (since 1955) in Czechoslovakia. It also started to produce truck radial tires in the 1970s. The company founded its own R&D center in 1987 (now "Vipo") and provided technical assistance for the construction of rubber works in India, Indonesia, Ethiopia, Cambodia, Burma, Syria, Turkey, Iran and Yugoslavia. In 1991 it was turned into a joint-stock company and privatization took place 1992-1994. The trademark of the products of the company was changed to Matador and the firm's name was changed to Gumárne Barum in 1991 and to Matador in 1993.
The joint venture "Continental Matador" for the production of truck tires was established in Púchov in September 1998. In 1999 the transformation of the company took its final phase by change of management and by shift to division management system. The management of the Company is being transformed to the German model.

In 2001, Matador was one of the first companies in middle Europe to fulfil technical specification ISO/TS 16949. This is a system of quality management in the automotive industry accepted by important automotive associations.
In December, 2001 the company Det Norske Veritas issued the Management Quality System Certificate in accordance with standards ISO 9001:2000, valid for design, production, assembling, servicing and sales of machines and equipment for rubber industry and management of design and development, production, servicing and sales of moulds.
In September 2005 Matador celebrated its one hundredth anniversary and introduced a new company logo to represent the company.
In 2007 the company Continental AG acquired 51% of the Matador Rubber Division.
On July 1, 2008 Continental and Matador Group agreed on the transfer of an additional 15% of the shares in Continental Matador Rubber, at which date the Continental Group owned 66% of the shares in Continental Matador Rubber.
In 2009 Continental AG Hannover increased their capital share to 100%. New Continental’s distribution-logistic centre was open in that year in Puchov, for Central and Eastern Europe, as well as the new production finalisation hall.
In May 2010 Continental opened a new production hall in Púchov that enabled an increase of capacities for the production of passenger and light truck tires.
