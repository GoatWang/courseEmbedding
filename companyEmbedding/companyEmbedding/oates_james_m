Title: Local Artist
               Company: Mainely Pottery
Job Details
               As you see, Mainely Pottery is more than just nice pottery. We do not always have a moose lingering among the hostas, he likes the apples. We do usually have lot of flowers in Jeannette's wonderful annual and perennial gardens. Like a fortunate marriage the flowers migrate into the shop to find an array of vases waiting to be used. You are welcome to wander through the gardens which are on the south side of the gallery. Also you can visit the studio next door to the gallery at Mainely Pottery. In the studio, you'll usually find Jamie working on some aspect of making pottery and waiting to be distracted. Mainely Pottery was started in 1988 by Jamie Oates, resident potter, and Jeannette Faunce, gallery manager and gardener. Our mission has always been to show people fine Maine-made pottery and to educate people about what is involved in creating handmade pottery. The friendships and the gardens which have developed over the years are the bonuses we've cultivated. We are very fortunate to have a wonderful staff, Sea, Lesia and Kathleen, who can tell you what pottery is good for the microwave, the dishwasher and the oven. We are also very good and experienced at shipping pottery across the US and occasionally beyond. Please visit our sampler gallery to see the variety and quality of craftsmanship you will find at Mainely Pottery.
