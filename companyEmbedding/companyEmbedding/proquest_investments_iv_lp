ProQuest Investments - Investment Criteria













































Investment Criteria
ProQuest Investments invests in companies and technologies with the potential to become substantial, sustainable enterprises. We target companies with breakthrough technology and products, proven management, large market potential, and a realizable business strategy. As a result of investing across a diversity of sectors and stages, our average investments range from $250,000 to $25,000,000.
                  



We look for breakthrough technologies and products that have the potential to revolutionize drug discovery, patient treatment, and healthcare delivery. Strong intellectual property is a critical component.






We invest in people with a demonstrated track record of success, exceptional leadership, and the commitment to grow the company into a substantial enterprise.






We focus on opportunities in initial addressable markets of at least $200 million where there is a significant unmet need for the company's products and technology.






We support teams with a clear strategy of product development, launch and revenue building. They should demonstrate an executable roadmap to substantial value creation, key milestones required to achieve their goal, and the capital required along the way.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for NTS (NYSEMKT:NTS) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A
