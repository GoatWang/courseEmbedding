Our knowledge of the innate practices of Chinese commerce blended with our experience within the U.S. and the Americas offers a compelling advantage to capitalize on the growth of the Chinese economy as well as other emerging markets such as Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Ecuador.In 2017, we launched a new division to distribute Cannabidiol (CBD) crystal in the U.S. and CBD-based products to Chinese speaking population.  The launch of Green Products Distribution and the associated online store is a key part of the expansion plans underway. Our primary goal with this launch is to retail CBD-based products in Chinese-speaking communities, which collectively represent a potential global market of over 2 billion people. Our culturally diverse team has the critical edge in generating global commerce opportunities to these small to medium sized emerging companies. We seek to help navigate through what are often confusing cultural and legal challenges. Our team members have strong working knowledge of the unique characteristics of business operations in the U.S., China, and South America. By employing a multicultural team, through our offices in the U.S. Shanghai, and various locations in South America, we possess numerous advantages critical to international business success.

ABOUT US





CD International Enterprises, Inc. (OTCQB :CDII) is a U.S.-based company that sources and distributes industrial commodities in China and the Americas and provides international business and consulting services. Our mission is to provide a platform to support, develop, and nurture these international businesses opportunities which will play a vital role in the ongoing globalization of economic activity. We offer business solutions which foster growth and the ability to compete successfully on a global scale. As a result, our organization serves as a vehicle to allow investors to participate directly in the rapid growth of emerging markets in China and the Americas.Headquartered in Plantation, Florida, CD International Enterprises currently operates in two primary business segments: Trading and Consulting Services. Our greatest strength lies in the quality of our personnel. Our success in a variety of cross border transactions is proof of our experience and ability to accomplish our goals. Our organization has the unique ability to identify emerging market opportunities and provide comprehensive solutions or services relevant to conducting international business. Our knowledge of the innate practices of Chinese commerce blended with our experience within the U.S. and the Americas offers a compelling advantage to capitalize on the growth of the Chinese economy as well as other emerging markets such as Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Ecuador.In 2017, we launched a new division to distribute Cannabidiol (CBD) crystal in the U.S. and CBD-based products to Chinese speaking population.  The launch of Green Products Distribution and the associated online store is a key part of the expansion plans underway. Our primary goal with this launch is to retail CBD-based products in Chinese-speaking communities, which collectively represent a potential global market of over 2 billion people. Our culturally diverse team has the critical edge in generating global commerce opportunities to these small to medium sized emerging companies. We seek to help navigate through what are often confusing cultural and legal challenges. Our team members have strong working knowledge of the unique characteristics of business operations in the U.S., China, and South America.

CD International Enterprises (CDII) Signs a Letter of Intent to Purchase Iron 
Ore 





PLANTATION, Florida, May 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ - CD International 
Enterprises, Inc. (OTC: 
CDII), a U.S.-based company that sources industrial commodities and 
provides business and management corporate consulting services, today announced 
that CD International has entered into a letter of intent with a Honduras-based 
company to purchase iron ore (62% to 63% Fe).

Per the letter of intent, CD International agrees to purchase 100,000 metric 
tons of iron ore (62% to 63% Fe) per month over a period of 12 months. The total 
shipment over a period of 12 months will be 1.2 million metric tons of iron ore. 
The monthly supply can be increased to 500,000 metric tons per month or 6 
million metric tons of iron ore per year. The initial 12 months contract of 
1.2 million metric tons of iron ore values approximately $84 million on basis of 
the current CIF China price. 

According to Chinese customs data, China's imports of iron ore rose 7.5 percent 
to a record 1.024 billion tons in 2016. The total topped the 2015 record of 
952.84 million tons. China's 2017 March iron ore imports rose 11 percent from 
the same month a year earlier to the second-highest monthly amount on record as 
the world's second-biggest economy ramped up a 
drive for cheap overseas supply as the cost of domestic output grew. Imports in 
March were 95.56 million tons, according to data from the General Administration 
of Customs. For the first quarter of 2017, imports grew 12 percent to 271 
million tons. That is a quarterly record. This rise was the result of two 
factors: resilient steel demand in China (partly driven by government stimulus 
measures) and the replacement of Chinese domestic iron ore production by the 
import of cheaper high-grade ore imports, mainly from Australia and Brazil.

Dr. James Wang, Chairman and CEO of CD International commented on the letter of 
intent, “We are pleased to enter this letter of intent, as we have been 
proactively sourcing iron ore supply for our Chinese clients. This newly sourced 
supply could provide us a stable supply of iron ore for our clients in China. 
Under our new mineral trading model, we believe we can create a profit center 
while we limit exposure of our capital to market risk. Imported iron ore to 
China will continue at the levels we are seeing now, or perhaps even grow as we 
go forward. We actively pursue new mineral suppliers for our clients in China in 
both South and North America. As we move forward, we believe we are well 
positioned to take advantage of increasing demand of iron ore by China in years 
to come.”

CD International Enterprises 
Launches Newly Formed Subsidiary and Online Store to Distribute Cannabidiol (CBD)-Based 
Products in Chinese-Speaking Communities





PLANTATION, Florida, April 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ - CD International 
Enterprises, Inc. (OTC: 
CDII), a U.S.-based company that sources industrial commodities and 
provides business and management corporate consulting services, today announces 
the launch of its newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary, Green Products 
Distribution, Inc., and its newly launched online store (http://www.greencbdproducts.com/cbd), 
as well as a new initiative to distribute bulk Cannabidiol (CBD) crystal in the 
U.S. 

The launch of Green Products Distribution and the associated online store is a 
key part of the expansion plans underway. CD International's primary goal with 
this launch is to retail CBD-based products in Chinese-speaking communities, 
which collectively represent a potential global market of over 2 billion people. 
After bringing its online store to fully functioning status within the next 
several weeks, the Company plans to contract an online marketing firm to market 
the online store and its products in Chinese-speaking communities across the 
world. Other plans include developing a mobile app for optimal distribution of 
CBD-based products through mobile devices.

The Company is also actively sourcing a variety of CBD-based products in the 
U.S. and plans to enter several distribution agreements for their distribution 
in the near term. Related plans include distributing CBD-based products through 
retail chains of pharmaceutical and Chinese Medicine stores in China.

Dr. James Wang, Chairman and CEO of CD International, commented, "We are very 
excited to begin retailing CBD-based products in Chinese-speaking communities 
through the newly established subsidiary, while also pursuing opportunities to 
distribute bulk CBD crystal in the U.S. Research has indicated CBD to be 
effective in treating epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, cirrhosis of the liver and 
to provide relief from hangover, anxiety and stress. Because natural extract of CBD-based products is so similar to traditional Chinese medicine, management 
believes there is huge opportunity in Chinese-speaking communities for CBD-based 
products. We plan to choose the best products available to start penetration of 
these enormous potential markets."

CBD is a natural concentrate extracted from cannabis or hemp and is considered a 
food nutrient delivering the benefits of cannabinoids without the psychotropic 
effects of tetrahydrocannabinol ("THC") when derived from industrial hemp. The 
ongoing research into the effects of CBD on a variety of diseases is expanding 
in the U.S., as the domestic cannabis industry opens up. Research has indicated 
that CBD is a non-toxic and non-addictive natural concentrate extracted from 
industrial hemp. According to some major research institutions and a CNN 
documentary, CBD has shown to be effective in treating epilepsy, Alzheimer's 
disease, cirrhosis of the liver and to provide relief from hangover, anxiety and 
stress.

CBD has been legalized in all 50 states of the U.S. The primary function of CBD 
is to protect the brain and nervous system, help digestion problems, relieve 
pain and reduce anxiety and stress. This concentrate can be widely used in 
nutrition supplements, skin care products, normal beverages and functional 
beverages.

Commenting on the CBD distribution agreement, Dr. James Wang, Chairman and CEO 
of CD International, said, "We are very excited to enter this brand new business 
to develop a new profit center. CBD supplements have become a hot spot in the 
health products market in the U.S. According to The CBD Report published by The 
Hemp Business Journal, CBD is one of the fastest growing market categories in 
the U.S. hemp and legal marijuana industries with a compound annual growth rate 
of 59%. In 2015, the CBD industry grew from a nearly invisible market a few 
years ago to $202 million in consumer sales, and it is further expected to grow 
to $2.1 billion in consumer sales by 2020. If we are able to distribute 100 
kilograms per month or 1,200 kilogram per year in the U.S., we would generate 
over $60 million in revenues according to the current market wholesale price. 
Management is confident that our new business could generate substantial profit 
opportunities for our shareholders for years to come."

CBD is an abbreviation for Cannabidiol, a naturally-occurring cannabinoid 
component found in cannabis that comprises up to 40% of the plant. Cannabidiol 
is “a cannabinoid devoid of psychoactive effect.” After THC

CBD has been shown to have positive health benefits, but does not cause any 
psychoactive effects.

CD International Enterprises Issues Letter to Shareholders

Jun 15, 2015, 08:30 ET
		  		  								
						 from   CD International Enterprises, Inc 











 
















































 

 




















 


DEERFIELD BEACH, Fla., Jun. 15, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --CD International Enterprises, Inc. ("CD International") (OTC: CDII), a U.S.-based company that sources and distributes industrial commodities internationally and provides business and management corporate consulting services, issued a letter to shareholders from its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. James Wang, which reads as follows:
Dear Fellow Shareholders:
With the completion and filing of our full year fiscal 2014 audited financials, we have taken the majority of steps necessary to regain compliance with our regulatory reporting requirements.  We anticipate the filing of the remaining quarterly financial statements to be made in the coming weeks to finally complete that process and set the stage for a new chapter in our Company's history.
For the past several years we have been working diligently to transition the Company from an owner of manufacturing operations in China to a service based organization that sources and distributes industrial commodities internationally and provides management corporate consulting services.  In this way we believe we are well positioned to leverage our managerial footprint in the U.S., China and the Americas while avoiding the need for significant capital expenditures.   In order to complete that transition, we exited all of our remaining manufacturing business in China beginning in 2013 and ending with the discontinuing of our magnesium production operations in 2014.  As these operations had been consistently losing money since the global financial crisis in 2008, management decided to exit all of these operations to focus on business services and other less capital intensive business opportunities.
With the completion of that transition, we are currently structured into two business segments.  Our Mineral Trading Segment sources and distributes industrial commodities to China, and our Consulting Segment provides business consulting services to companies that operate or are seeking business opportunities primarily in China and the Americas.  
In our consulting segment, we provide a suite of consulting services to clients who conduct business in China or seek to conduct business within China. We generate revenues by providing services in the areas of capital structure, strategic partnerships, mergers, acquisitions, translation services, managing and coordinating the process of obtaining necessary government approvals and licenses in China, as well as marketing and sales support. We tailor our suite of services to meet the specific needs of each individual client. A significant component of our competitive advantage lies in the quality of our personnel. Members of our team possess a strong working knowledge of the unique characteristics of business operations in the Americas and China. Our function is to provide the necessary resources for Chinese entities to invest in the Americas and entities from the Americas to invest in China.
Our Mineral Trading Segment is operated under our wholly owned U.S. subsidiary CDII Minerals, Inc., which was incorporated in 2010. CDII Minerals is strategically positioned throughout several countries in South America and has developed the foundation and relationship network to expand rapidly.  Over the past several years we have successfully purchased iron ore, tin ore, and copper concentrate in Ecuador, Bolivia and Chile and exported to China. Currently, we are working to expand our trading business in South America and are also evaluating other business opportunities with local companies to expand our South American presence.
In order to fulfill a niche market and add value through facilitating smooth international transactions, we have strategically positioned our Company as an intermediary between our suppliers in South America and our buyers in China.  Through a unique understanding of local business practices in each country, CDII Minerals arranges all required logistics and processing from the point of production through its final destination including the documentation and permits necessary to export and import the material. 
As we move through the coming years we are excited to now have the Company in a position to leverage our core competencies unburdened by the capital intensive legacy manufacturing operations in China.  We have established a substantial business network in China and the Americas and our team is now actively seeking to monetize that network on several fronts:
First, our team has identified several acquisition candidates to accelerate revenue growth and build a solid base for the future.  Management is working diligently to complete at least one such acquisition prior to the end of calendar 2015. 
Second, through working to bridge large Chinese investments into certain projects in the Americas we believe we have the opportunity to realize multiple potential "home-runs" to impact future revenue and earnings. 
And third, the network we have established in Latin America has us poised to achieve substantial growth when mineral and industrial commodities markets rebound in the coming years.  Our diverse presence throughout Latin America gives our partners and clients a unique advantage in commercial transactions we manage through our local expertise and business networks in each country., 
In closing, I would like to thank each and every shareholder for their support.  We believe we have navigated through a tremendously challenging period for CD International over the past several years and we are now poised to move into a new growth phase.  We intend to work diligently to achieve that growth on all fronts to create substantial value for our shareholders for years to come.
Sincerely,Dr. James WangCEO
