                                                            Overview                        
                                                        
Tonix is developing innovative pharmaceutical products to address public health challenges, with two therapeutic programs focusing on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). TNX-102 SL or Tonmya® is Tonix's lead product candidate, designed as a bedtime treatment for PTSD, is currently in Phase 3 study in the military-related PTSD population. TNX-601 (tianeptine oxalate), designed as a daytime treatment for PTSD, is in preclinical development. PTSD is a serious condition characterized by chronic disability, inadequate treatment options especially for military-related PTSD and overall high utilization of healthcare services creating significant economic burden. Other products in development include TNX-801, a live synthetic version of horsepox virus, at the pre-IND application stage, to be developed as a potential smallpox-preventing vaccine.
The proposed trade name Tonmya (ton-MY-ah), for TNX-102 SL for the management of PTSD, has been conditionally accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
PTSD
The development of TNX-102 SL in PTSD is supported by both clinical and mechanistic rationales. In May 2016, Tonix announced positive topline results from a Phase 2 study, referred to as AtEase, investigating the efficacy and safety of bedtime TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg and 5.6 mg in military-related PTSD. To obtain FDA agreement on the Phase 3 program and the proposed New Drug Application (NDA) plan, Tonix held a successful End-of-Phase 2/Pre-Phase 3 meeting with the FDA in the third quarter of 2016. In December 2016, TNX-102 SL for the treatment of PTSD was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA based on the AtEase data. Tonix began enrolling participants into its first Phase 3 trial, the HONOR study, in the first quarter of 2017 after receiving FDA agreement on the study design and interim analysis plan.
Tonix's other PTSD program, TNX-601, is an oral formulation of tianeptine oxalate, designed as a daytime treatment for PTSD. Tianeptine oxalate is a novel polymorph and salt discovered and characterized by Tonix to improve stability and manufacturability. Tianeptine sodium (amorphous) is not approved in the US but marketed for depression in Europe, Asia, Latin America - first approved in France in 1987. The clinical development of TNX-601 for PTSD can leverage the post-marketing experience of tianeptine outside the U.S and Tonix's significant clinical and regulatory experience in PTSD.
Other Development Programs
TNX-801 is potential smallpox preventing vaccine containing a live synthetic version of horsepox virus. Since TNX-801, a biological product, will be developed for a "serious or life-threatening condition caused by exposure to lethal or permanently disabling toxic biological" , Tonix believes the "Animal Efficacy Rule" is applicable. The Animal Efficacy Rule ("Animal Rule"), a regulation which permits the licensure of a biological product based on safety testing in humans and efficacy testing in animals. In addition, the licensure of TNX-801 may be qualified for Priority Review Voucher under the Medical Countermeasure (MCM) incentive provided by the 21st Century Cures Act.
Our experienced team has a strong track record of success in drug development, regulatory approvals, and product launch activities.
TNX-102 SL (cyclobenzaprine HCl sublingual tablets) is an Investigational New Drug and has not been approved for any indication. Tonmya(R) has been conditionally accepted by the FDA as the proposed trade name for TNX-102 SL for the treatment of PTSD.

Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. Key Developments

Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. Announces U.S. Food and Drug Administration Conditional Acceptance of Tonmya as Brand Name for TNX-102 SL (Cyclobenzaprine Hcl Sublingual Tablets) for the Treatment of PTSD
Jul 6 17
Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. reported that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has conditionally accepted the proposed trade name Tonmya (ton-MY-ah) for TNX-102 SL (cyclobenzaprine HCl sublingual tablets) for the management of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Tonix recently launched the Phase 3 HONOR study of Tonmya in military-related PTSD, from which topline results are expected to be reported in the second half of 2018. Tonmya was designated a Breakthrough Therapy by the FDA for the treatment of PTSD. A request for proprietary name review for Tonmya will be submitted once the PTSD New Drug Application (NDA) is submitted. FDA's final approval of Tonmya is subject to NDA approval. A request for review of Tonmya as the proposed name for TNX-102 SL for the management of fibromyalgia has been withdrawn at the FDA. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has granted the federal registration of the Tonmya mark.


Tonix Pharmaceuticals Presents Retrospective Analyses of Treatment Response and Remission to TNX-102 SL in A Phase 2 Military-Related PTSD Study
May 30 17
Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. presented an oral pipeline presentation on May 30, 2017 entitled Low-Dose Bedtime Sublingual Cyclobenzaprine (TNX-102 SL) for the Treatment of Military-Related PTSD: Retrospective Analyses of the Mediators and Moderators of Treatment Response at the 2017 American Society of Clinical Psychopharmacology Annual Meeting in Miami Beach. The presentation can be found on the Scientific Presentations page on Tonix. TNX-102 SL (cyclobenzaprine HCl sublingual tablets) is an investigational new drug and has not been approved for any indication. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to TNX-102 SL for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A mediator variable specifies how a particular effect or relationship between two other variables occurs. Sleep quality was a potential mediator of treatment response because improvements in sleep quality measured at week 4 by the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance scale in patients receiving TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg correlated with reduction in PTSD severity measured by change from baseline in the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) score at week 12. Baseline PTSD severity threshold was a potential moderator of treatment response. A retrospective analysis of the Phase 2 AtEase data indicated a study entry CAPS-5 severity score of 33 is more aligned with the entry criteria of previous PTSD pharmacotherapy registration trials using prior CAPS versions. In the At Ease baseline CAPS-5 33 subgroup, the effect size of TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg is approximately 0.5 on total CAPS-5 and also approximately 0.5 on cluster B (intrusion) and cluster E (arousal and reactivity) scores. The effect of TNX-102 SL was studied on remission, which was defined by CAPS-5 < 11 at week 12, and sustained remission, which was CAPS-5 < 11 at both weeks 8 and 12. TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg showed a statistically significant increase in sustained remission relative to placebo. TNX-102 SL was well-tolerated with a high completion rate in AtEase. Non-dose related tongue numbness was commonly reported in participants receiving TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg or 5.6 mg, which was generally transient and never rated as severe. There were no adverse event-related discontinuations in the TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg group. No clinically significant changes in weight or vital signs over the 12 weeks of study were observed. About TNX-102 SL and the Phase 3 HONOR Study TNX-102 SL is a patented sublingual transmucosal formulation of cyclobenzaprine that is in Phase 3 development. PTSD is a serious condition characterized by chronic disability, inadequate treatment options especially for military-related PTSD, and an overall high utilization of healthcare services that contributes to significant economic burdens. In a Phase 2 study, TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg was found to be effective in treating military-related PTSD, which formed the basis of the Breakthrough Therapy designation granted by the FDA. Tonix is currently conducting a Phase 3 trial of TNX-102 SL in military-related PTSD in the United States, the HONOR study, which is a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg in participants with military-related PTSD. This two-arm, adaptive-design trial, is targeting enrollment of up to approximately 550 participants across approximately 35 clinical sites. An unblinded interim analysis will be conducted once the study has accumulated efficacy results from approximately 275 randomized participants. In a recent Cross-disciplinary Breakthrough meeting, the FDA confirmed that a single-study new drug application (NDA) approval could be possible if the topline data from the HONOR study are statistically very persuasive.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.
