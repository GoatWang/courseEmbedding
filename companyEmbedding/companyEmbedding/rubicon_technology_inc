Rubicon is the world leader in sapphire crystal growth technology andlarge-diameter sapphire substrates.

With its unmatched, end-to-end ability to manufacture and deliver superior quality sapphire, Rubicon helps manufacturers in the LED, RFIC and optical industries achieve challenging targets for product performance, yield and total cost. As demand for larger diameter sapphire escalates, more manufacturers in dynamic, growing markets trust Rubicon and its proven ability to deliver high volumes of the highest quality substrates.




Patterned Sapphire Substrates
Rubicon Technology, Inc., the global leader inlarge-diameter sapphire substrates, has leveraged its unique expertise to create a complete line of Patterned Sapphire Substrates—PSS—up to 8” in diameter. We offer fully customizable sub-micron patterning capability with tight dimensional tolerances, within ± 0.1 μm. With an edge exclusion zone as small as 1 mm, Rubicon gives you more usable area to maximize the number of chips per wafer. 

 

Vertical Integration – Powder to Pattern
Rubicon Technology is the only sapphire manufacturer that is vertically integrated from the processing of raw aluminum oxide powder to the creation of highly customized patterned sapphire substrates.  Vertical integration has fostered the ability to grow progressively larger sapphire while maintaining exceptional sapphire quality, controlling cost, and excelling as the industry’s most reliable, consistent and innovative technology partner.

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

The most comprehensive equity research coverage available online.


          Never miss a single piece of research, upgrade, downgrade or target price change by any analyst firm on any stock!

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

The Company's product lines include sapphire cores; four and six-inch sapphire wafers; four, six, and eight-inch patterned sapphire substrate (PSS) wafers, and optical sapphire components. The Company's Sapphire is also used as an exterior component in mobile devices, specifically camera lens covers, dual flashes and home buttons on certain newer model smartphones and as the crystal covering the faces of certain smart watches. In addition, some consumer electronics original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) use sapphire faceplates for smartphones. For the LED market, it sells 2 to 6-inch material in core form and four, six and eight-inch material in polished and PSS wafer form. Its principal customers are semiconductor device manufacturers and wafer polishing companies.The Company Rubicon has developed technology for every stage of production from raw material processing through crystal growth, fabrication, wafer finishing, patterning and cleaning. Its crystal growth technique is referred to as ES2, which produces sapphire crystals for use in its sapphire products. ES2 is derived from the Kyropoulos method of crystal growth. It markets and sells products through its direct sales force to customers in Asia, Australia, North America and Europe.CoreThe core product line consists of its sapphire cores drilled from sapphire boules with high-precision. The sapphire cores are of 2 to 6 inches in diameter, which its customers further process into wafers for use in LED applications and into components, such as lens covers for mobile devices.PolishedThe polished product line consists of polished, ultra-clean, four, six and eight-inch sapphire wafers. Its polished wafers undergo two polishing phases, including both a mechanical and a chemical mechanical planarization phase. Its four and six-inch sapphire wafers are used as substrates for the manufacture of LED chips and for other semiconductor applications, such as Silicon-on-Sapphire (SoS) Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits (RFICs).Patterned sapphire substratesThe PSS product line consists of polished, ultra-clean, four and six-inch patterned sapphire wafers. It offers customizable, sub-micron patterning capability with dimensional tolerances within 0.1 of a micron. It also offers smallest edge exclusion zone maximizing the usable wafer surface area yielding more chips per wafer. Its four, six, and eight-inch PSS wafers, which are polished wafers that undergo additional processes of photolithography and dry plasma etching to produce a patterned surface.OpticalThe Company offers optically polished windows and ground window blanks of sapphire. It provides sapphire and other crystal products in various sizes, shapes and product formats for specialty applications. Its optical sapphire components are available in various shapes and sizes, including round and rectangular windows and blanks, domes, tubes and rods. These optical sapphire products are used in equipment for a range of end markets, including defense and aerospace, medical devices, oil and gas drilling, semiconductor manufacturing and other markets.

As demand for larger diameter sapphire escalates, more manufacturers in dynamic, growing markets trust Rubicon and its proven ability to deliver high volumes of the highest quality substrates.




Patterned Sapphire Substrates
Rubicon Technology, Inc., the global leader inlarge-diameter sapphire substrates, has leveraged its unique expertise to create a complete line of Patterned Sapphire Substrates—PSS—up to 8” in diameter. We offer fully customizable sub-micron patterning capability with tight dimensional tolerances, within ± 0.1 μm. With an edge exclusion zone as small as 1 mm, Rubicon gives you more usable area to maximize the number of chips per wafer. 

 

Vertical Integration – Powder to Pattern
Rubicon Technology is the only sapphire manufacturer that is vertically integrated from the processing of raw aluminum oxide powder to the creation of highly customized patterned sapphire substrates.  Vertical integration has fostered the ability to grow progressively larger sapphire while maintaining exceptional sapphire quality, controlling cost, and excelling as the industry’s most reliable, consistent and innovative technology partner.



Rubicon is the world leader in sapphire crystal growth technology andlarge-diameter sapphire substrates.

With its unmatched, end-to-end ability to manufacture and deliver superior quality sapphire, Rubicon helps manufacturers in the LED, RFIC and optical industries achieve challenging targets for product performance, yield and total cost. As demand for larger diameter sapphire escalates, more manufacturers in dynamic, growing markets trust Rubicon and its proven ability to deliver high volumes of the highest quality substrates.




Patterned Sapphire Substrates
Rubicon Technology, Inc., the global leader inlarge-diameter sapphire substrates, has leveraged its unique expertise to create a complete line of Patterned Sapphire Substrates—PSS—up to 8” in diameter. We offer fully customizable sub-micron patterning capability with tight dimensional tolerances, within ± 0.1 μm. With an edge exclusion zone as small as 1 mm, Rubicon gives you more usable area to maximize the number of chips per wafer.
