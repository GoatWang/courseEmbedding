The Power of Persistence: Breakthroughs in Your Prayer Life

Product DetailsAbout Michael CattDepartment: Michael CattCategory: Paperback, Michael CattMichael Catt, senior pastor of Sherwood Baptist Church and executive producer of the Georgia congregation’s runaway hit films Facing the Giants and Fireproof, is often asked why God has blessed their efforts in such a remarkable way. His answer is simple:“We have a praying church that is walking in unity. We pray over every ministry and every decision.”The Power of Persistence is Catt’s invitation to a prayer-without-ceasing way of life. Stories from scripture and personal ministry experiences attest to the prophetic and profitable work of prayer. Engaging chapters on prayers of penitence, learning from the Psalmist, praying for children, the lost, and in response to spiritual warfare guide us to a breakthrough level of communication with the God who is eager to hear our cries and accomplish His work through us.Michael CattMichael has served as Senior Pastor of Sherwood Baptist Church since 1989. The church has 3,000 members and has averaged one hundred baptisms each year. Thousands have joined the church from Albany and 29 surrounding communities. The church has changed from a neighborhood church to a regional, multi-ethnic congregation with members from eleven nations. Sherwood has three campuses covering 130-plus acres—the main church campus, the lower school campus and the upper school campus. The 82-acre sports complex, Legacy Park, is currently being developed with tennis courts, soccer fields, baseball fields, equestrian center, fishing pond, pavilion and other facilities to reach the community through sports and recreation. “Path to Truth,” the weekly broadcast of Sherwood’s services, is seen in over ninety markets around the country and is also available on the web and via podcast at www.sherwoodbaptist.net.Michael’s life verse: “For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your bond-servants for Jesus’ sake.” (2 Corinthians 4:5) Michael’s vision statement: “Whoever wants the next generation the most will get them.”Michael holds degrees from Mississippi College, Luther Rice Bible College and Seminary and Trinity Seminary. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Mobile in 2010.Michael and his wife Terri have been married since 1974. They are the proud parents of two grown daughters, Erin and Hayley.

Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions.
