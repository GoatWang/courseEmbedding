Scott RandallFounderRandall Consulting
G: Hi, Scott. Thank you for being a part of NonStop Innovations. What has Randall Consulting been working on lately?
S: We've actually been working on a new product called SMART (system management and automatic recovery for Tandem), that will be released by the end of the year. It automates system recovery, and monitors and reports errors. We're currently looking for early adopters so we can move into beta.
 
G: That's great. Is this a unique solution or is it comparable to other solutions?
S: There is a more expensive product that some of our clients are currently using, but because the price tag is so high and the functionality is more than what most companies need, we saw an opportunity to develop our own solution. We've noticed that, in general, NonStop users want to learn from errors and recover from errors, but there are features of the existing product that are unnecessary or unwanted. For example, in a single day, there could be hundreds of individual error messages for users to deal with, which can be overwhelming, and also annoying. So, we are including a feature that will allow error messages to be grouped together, making it easier for customers to analyze and deal with errors. Our goal is really to provide the features that customers need and want.
 
G: Could you tell me a little bit about your other product, the NonStop Productivity Toolbox?
S: Sure. NPT is our flagship product, with over 50 integrated tools, all developed internally, and its main purpose is to increase productivity by automating tasks. For example, a customer was migrating from one footprint to another--S-series to Blades--and needed to move their data. One of the tools, called Repart (short for repartitioning) loads data in parallel, and was really essential to their migration. It took a task that would have taken weeks down to hours. This is the only software that automates the process of loading data in parallel, which is otherwise a cumbersome process.
 
G: I also saw that you're presenting on big data at the NonStop TBC.
S: Yes, the session is called “Big Data and SQL/MX Update.” It isn't a vendor theater, so it is purely educational.
G: Excellent. Well, I look forward to seeing you in San Jose.
 
[Abstract for "Big Data and SQL/MX", which will be presented by Scott at 2:30pm on Monday, November 4th at TBC:
Big Data means different things to different organizations. For some, it’s an avalanche of data. For others, it can be a hefty transaction load, wide rows or almost any extreme data metric. In either case, Big Data must be analyzed to provide value. This presents a number of challenges. Hadoop is a recently touted scalable solution for unstructured Big Data, relying on parallelism and distribution of data for performance. How different is SQL/MX? NonStop SQL/MX is designed for structured data and the deep analytics required for Business Intelligence. SQL/MX was built on the NonStop foundation that defined parallelism, scalability and availability, and with features that allow equal distribution of data through hash keys and partitioning features. Combine highly available, scalable, nearly unlimited enterprise SAN storage capacity and no data is too big for SQL/MX.]
