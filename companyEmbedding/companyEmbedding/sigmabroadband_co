	CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS




	 




	 




	This
	quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking
	statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities
	Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and
	Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
	amended, or the Exchange Act, that involve substantial risks and
	uncertainties. In addition, we, or our executive officers on our
	behalf, may from time to time make forward-looking statements in
	reports and other documents we file with the Securities and
	Exchange Commission, or SEC, or in connection with oral statements
	made to the press, potential investors or others. All statements,
	other than statements of historical facts, including statements
	regarding our strategy, future operations, future financial
	position, future revenues, projected costs, prospects, plans and
	objectives of management are forward-looking statements. The words
	"expect," "estimate," "anticipate," "predict," "believe," "think,"
	"plan," "will," "should," "intend," "seek," "potential" and similar
	expressions and variations are intended to identify forward-looking
	statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain
	these identifying words.




	 




	Forward-looking
	statements in this report are subject to a number of known and
	unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual
	results, performance or achievements to differ materially from
	those described in the forward-looking statements, in this report
	as well as in the other documents we file with the SEC from time to
	time, and such risks and uncertainties are specifically
	incorporated herein by reference.




	 




	Forward-looking
	statements speak only as of the date the statements are made.
	Except as required under the federal securities laws and rules and
	regulations of the SEC, we undertake no obligation to update or
	revise forward-looking statements to reflect actual results,
	changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting
	forward-looking information. We caution you not to unduly rely on
	the forward-looking statements when evaluating the information
	presented in this report.

	PART I—FINANCIAL INFORMATION




	 






	ITEM 1.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	 




	The
	financial statements of SigmaBroadband Co. ("SigmaBroadband Co." or
	the "Company") as of March 31, 2017 and 2016 included herein have
	been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to U.S.
	generally accepted accounting principles and the rules and
	regulations of the SEC. In addition, certain information and note
	disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in
	accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles have
	been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations,
	although the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to
	make the information presented not misleading. These financial
	statements reflect, in the opinion of management, all adjustments
	(consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to
	present fairly the results for the interim periods. The results of
	operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative
	of the results for the full year.

	Notes to Financial Statements




	March 31, 2017




	(Unaudited)




	 




	Note 1 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
	POLICIES




	 




	Organization




	SigmaBroadband Co. ("Sigma" or the "Company") was incorporated in
	Georgia in October 2012. The Company has been in the development
	stage since inception and has not generated any revenue to date.
	The Company is a full service, facilities-based broadband service
	provider, local exchange and inter-exchange carrier serving
	residential and commercial customers with a special focus on rural
	areas.




	 




	Basis of Presentation




	The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared
	in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
	for interim financial information. Certain information and footnote
	disclosures normally included in annual financial statements
	prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
	principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such
	principles and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
	Commission for Form 10-Q. All adjustments, consisting of normal
	recurring adjustments, have been made which, in the opinion of
	management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results of
	interim periods. The results of operations for such interim periods
	are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected
	for a full year because of, among other things, seasonality factors
	in the retail business. The unaudited financial statements
	contained herein should be read in conjunction with the audited
	financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended
	December 31, 2016.




	 




	Equipment, net




	Equipment is stated at cost. Major renewals and betterments are
	capitalized while maintenance and repairs, which do not extend the
	lives of the respective assets, are expensed when incurred.
	Depreciation is computed over the estimated useful lives of the
	assets using the straight line method of accounting.




	 




	The Company has estimated the useful life of the equipment to be 10
	years.




	 




	The cost and accumulated depreciation for equipment sold, retired,
	or otherwise disposed of are relieved from the accounts, and any
	resulting gains or losses are reflected in income.




	 




	At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the assets have been fully
	impaired.




	 




	Use of Estimates




	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
	accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
	America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
	affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
	accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
	estimates. 




	 




	Segment Information




	The Company follows Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 280,
	"Segment Reporting". The Company currently operates in a single
	segment and will evaluate additional segment disclosure
	requirements as it expands its operations.




	 




	Net Loss Per Common Share




	Basic net (loss) income per common share is calculated using the
	weighted average common shares outstanding during each reporting
	period. Diluted net (loss) income per common share adjusts the
	weighted average common shares for the potential dilution that
	could occur if common stock equivalents (convertible debt and
	preferred stock, warrants, stock options and restricted stock
	shares and units) were exercised or converted into common stock.
	There were no common stock equivalents at March 31,
	2017.




	 




	Income Taxes




	The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting
	for future income taxes. Under this method, future income tax
	assets and liabilities are recorded based on temporary differences
	between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their
	corresponding tax basis. In addition, the future benefits of income
	tax assets including unused tax losses, are recognized, subject to
	a valuation allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not
	that such future benefits will ultimately be realized. Future
	income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax
	rates and laws expected to apply when the tax liabilities or assets
	are to be either settled or realized. The Company’s effective
	tax rate approximates the Federal statutory rates.

	Notes to Financial Statements




	March 31, 2017




	(Unaudited)




	 




	Stock-Based Compensation




	Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value in
	accordance with ASC 718,”Compensation – Stock
	Compensation”, when applicable. Under FASB Accounting
	Standards Codification No. 718, companies are required to measure
	the compensation costs of share-based compensation arrangements
	based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the
	financial statements over the period during which employees are
	required to provide services. Share-based compensation arrangements
	include stock options, restricted share plans, performance-based
	awards, share appreciation rights and employee share purchase
	plans. As such, compensation cost is measured on the date of grant
	at their fair value. Such compensation amounts, if any, are
	amortized over the respective vesting periods of the option grant.
	The Company applies this statement prospectively.




	 




	Equity instruments (“instruments”) issued to other than
	employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the
	instruments, as required by FASB Accounting Standards Codification
	No. 718. FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 505, Equity
	Based Payments to Non-Employees defines the measurement date and
	recognition period for such instruments. In general, the
	measurement date is when either a (a) performance commitment, as
	defined, is reached or (b) the earlier of (i) the non-employee
	performance is complete or (ii) the instruments are vested. The
	measured value related to the instruments is recognized over a
	period based on the facts and circumstances of each particular

	Recent Accounting Pronouncements




	The

	operations.




	 




	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-03. The amendments in this
	Update make the guidance in Updates 2014-02, 2014-03, 2014- 07, and
	2014-18 effective immediately by removing their effective dates.
	The amendments also include transition provisions that provide that
	private companies are able to forgo a preferability assessment the
	first time they elect the accounting alternatives within the scope
	of this Update. The Company is in the process of evaluating the
	impact of the adoption of this ASU.




	 




	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Stock Compensation,
	which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for
	share-based payment award transactions. The guidance will be
	effective for the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016,
	including interim periods within that year. The Company is in the
	process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this
	ASU.

	At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, a stockholder and officer
	of the Company was owed $15,468 and $14,105 by the Company for
	funds he had advanced to pay for certain expenses. The loan bears

	Note 4. NOTE PAYABLE




	 





	In December 2013, the Company signed an agreement to purchase
	certain telecommunications equipment for $10 million. The agreement
	called for the Company to sign an installment agreement for
	$1,000,0000. The installment agreement, as amended in November
	2015, calls for this balance to be amortized over a six year term
	with interest accruing at 8% per annum. Additionally, under the
	terms of this modification, payments will begin 48 months after the
	signing of the original agreement (December 2013) at which time all
	interest accrued until that time will be due and payable. Interest
	only payments will begin in month 49 and will continue through
	month 72 at which time a balloon payment of the principal and any
	unpaid interest will be due. At March 31, 2017 and December 31,
	2016, accrued interest on this note totaled

	$304,187 and
	$284,187

	,
	respectively.





	 




	The amendment stipulates that the remaining $9,000,000 owed by the
	Company will be paid by the issuance of 10,000,000 shares of the
	Company's preferred stock within 36 months from the date of the
	amendment.




	 




	Note 5. STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT




	 





	The Company has authorized 500,000,000 shares of common stock with
	a par value of $0.0001 per share. At March 31, 2017,

	shares of common stock were
	issued and outstanding.





	 




	The Company has authorized 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock
	with no par value. No shares were issued or outstanding at March
	31, 2017.




	 




	In first quarter of 2016, the Company issued 100,000 shares of
	common stock for consulting services, the common shares issued were

	The Company currently has no federal or state tax examinations in
	progress, nor has it had any federal or state examinations since
	its inception. All of the Company's tax years are subject to
	federal and state tax examinations. The Company is only subject to
	state taxes in Georgia.

	 




	 




	Note 8. GOING CONCERN




	 




	These
	financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis,
	which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and
	discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the
	foreseeable future. The Company has yet to demonstrate sustainable
	profitability and it does not currently have the funding to fully
	implement its business plan. Future losses are anticipated in the
	continued development of its business, raising substantial doubt
	about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
	 The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon
	the Company generating profitable operations in the future and, or,
	obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay
	its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they
	come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the
	next twelve months with existing cash on hand, loans from directors
	or stockholders or through debt or equity financings.




	 

	 





	The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect
	the possible future effects on the recoverability and
	classification of assets or the amounts and classification of
	liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the
	Company to continue as a going concern.




	 






	Note 9. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS




	 





	On May 7, 2017, Kelvin D. Smith tendered his resignation as the
	Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and Executive
	Vice President of Business Affairs for SigmaBroadband
	Co.


	, and on May 10, 2017 the
	Company accepted the resignation. Mr. Smith’s decision to
	resign did not involve any disagreement with the Company, the
	Company's management or the Board of Directors.





	 




	On
	May 8, 2017, Timothy Valley tendered his resignation as the Chief
	Financial Officer of the Company, and on May 10, 2017 the Company
	accepted the resignation. Mr. Valley’s decision to resign did
	not involve any disagreement with the Company, the Company's

	General Overview




	 




	SIGMABROADBAND
	CO. is a registered Georgia company. The Company has certain
	technology assets which had been fully impaired as of December 31,
	2015. The Company is to be engaged in the business of providing
	voice, data, and digital video as a triple play bundled service to
	rural markets in the United States of America.

	We plan to offer our customers traditional cable
	video programming, Internet services, telephone services and IPtv,
	as well as advanced video services such as on
	demand,


	 


	high
	definition (“HD”) television and digital video recorder
	(“DVR”) service. We plan to provide national and
	international long distance service. Our business plan include
	goals for increasing customers and revenue. To reach our goals, we
	will actively invest in our network and operations in order to
	improve the quality and value of the products and packages that we
	offer.





	 






	 




	11










	 






	 




	SIGMABROADBAND
	CO. has never declared bankruptcy, it has never been in
	receivership, and it has never been involved in any legal action or
	proceedings. Since becoming incorporated, has not made any
	significant purchase or sale of assets, nor has it been involved in
	any mergers, acquisitions or consolidations. SIGMABROADBAND CO. is
	not a blank check registrant as that term is defined in Rule
	419(a)(2) of Regulation C of the Securities Act of 1933, since it
	has a specific business plan, purpose and substantial
	assets.




	 




	Since
	our inception, we have been engaged in business planning
	activities, including researching the industry, identifying target
	markets for our services and developing our SIGMABROADBAND CO.
	models and financial forecasts, performing due diligence regarding
	potential geographic locations and acquisitions most suitable for
	establishing our offices and identifying future sources of
	capital.




	 




	Currently,
	SIGMABROADBAND CO. has officers and directors who have assumed
	responsibility for all planning, development and operational
	duties, and will continue to do so throughout the beginning stages
	of the Company. Other than the Officers/Directors and other
	management team, there are no employees at the present time. We do
	anticipate hiring regular employees when the need
	arises.




	 




	SIGMABROADBAND
	CO. currently has no intention to engage in a merger or acquisition
	with any unidentified company. However, we may pursue strategic
	acquisitions that complement our current business model within the
	technology industry which may allow us to expand our activities,
	capabilities, advance our production and revenue.




	 




	 SIGMABROADBAND
	CO.’s fiscal year end is December 31.




	 




	Industry Background




	 




	Approximately
	100 million Americans do not have broadband at home today and most
	of them are living in rural communities across America. We intend
	to be a leading provider of cost-effective and reliable technology
	services for home, small to medium sized businesses in the areas we
	serve and to create value to our shareholders.




	 




	We
	intend to deliver innovative communications, information and
	entertainment. Our voice, data and video products and services
	offer over intelligent wireless, wireline, cable, fiber, broadband
	and global IP networks that meet customers' growing demand for
	speed, mobility, security and control. As a committed corporate
	citizen, we use our advanced communications services to address
	important issues confronting our society today, especially in rural
	America. We plan to follow a strategy of being first to our
	regional markets with technology and services first introduced in
	metropolitan areas by national service providers.




	 




	We
	intend to be a full service, facilities-based cable operator, local
	exchange and inter-exchange carrier serving both residential and
	commercial customers by providing voice, data and digital video
	services. We intend to employ the newest technology available in
	the marketplace today, which provides quality of service (QoS),
	reliability, security, redundancy and continuity of service always.
	In the future, we will be recognized as a leader in the data
	network, IP telephony and cloud-based services. Our potential
	customers are located in some of the country’s largest cities
	to families living in rural communities. We intend to establish a
	dominant national presence in the triple-play broadband, cable and
	telecom industry in America.




	 




	Plan of Operation




	 




	We are
	a development stage company, incorporated on October 19, 2012 and
	have not started operations or generated or realized any revenues
	from our business operations. However, we have substantial
	technology assets ready to deploy in the rural markets where we
	plan to provide our services.




	 




	Our
	auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that our
	auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as
	an on-going business for the next twelve (12) months. Our
	auditors’ opinion is based on the uncertainty of our ability
	to establish profitable operations. The opinion results from the
	fact that we have not generated any revenues. Accordingly, we must
	raise cash from sources other than operations. Our only other
	source for cash at this time is investments by others in our
	Company.




	 




	Our
	Officers and Directors are responsible for our managerial and
	organizational structure which will include preparation of
	disclosure and accounting controls under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of
	2002. When these controls are implemented, they will be responsible
	for the administration of the controls. Should they not have
	sufficient experience, they may be incapable of creating and
	implementing the controls which may cause us to be subject to
	sanctions and fines by the Securities and Exchange Commission which
	ultimately could cause you to lose your investment.




	 






	 




	12










	 






	 




	Since
	incorporation, the Company has financed its operations originally
	through private capital and then, loans from stockholders and
	executives of the Company. As of March 31, 2017 we had $176 cash on
	hand.  We had totaled operating expenses of $23,415 which
	were related to general and administrative costs (See
	“Financial Statements”).




	 




	To
	date, the Company has not fully implemented its planned principal
	operations or strategic business plan. SIGMABROADBAND CO. is
	attempting to secure sufficient monetary assets to increase
	operations. SIGMABROADBAND CO. cannot assure any investor that it
	will be able to enter into sufficient business operations adequate
	enough to insure continued operations.  




	 




	Our
	intended plan of operations is to offer voice, data, and video
	services and implement the necessary sales and marketing support to
	begin generating revenue. If SIGMABROADBAND CO. does not produce
	sufficient cash flow to support its operations over the next 12
	months, the Company will need to raise additional capital by
	issuing capital stock in exchange for cash in order to continue as
	a going concern. There are no formal or informal agreements to
	attain such financing. SIGMABROADBAND CO. cannot assure any
	investor that, if needed, sufficient financing can be obtained or,
	if obtained, that it will be on reasonable terms. Without
	realization of additional capital, it would be unlikely for
	operations to continue and any investment made by an investor would
	be lost in its entirety.




	 




	SIGMABROADBAND
	CO. currently does own significant plant or equipment that it can
	seek to sell in the near future in order to sustain its operations
	if not able to raise necessary capital for its business.
	 




	 




	Our
	management anticipates hiring employees over the next twelve (12)
	months as needed. Currently, the Company believes the services
	provided by its officers and directors appear sufficient at this
	time.




	 




	The
	Company has not paid for expenses on behalf of any directors.
	 Additionally SIGMABROADBAND CO. believes that this policy
	shall not materially change within the next twelve
	months.




	 




	The
	Company has no plans to seek a business combination with another
	entity in the foreseeable future.




	 




	Impact of Inflation




	 




	We believe that the rate of inflation has had negligible effect on
	us. We believe we can absorb most, if not all, increased
	non-controlled operating costs by operating our Company in the most
	efficient manner possible.




	 




	Results of Operations




	 




	We have
	generated no significant revenues since inception. we have incurred
	operational expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and
	2016 in the amounts of $23,415

	 

	and $82,230
	respectively.  This decrease of $58,815 in operating expenses
	was primarily the result of one-time professional fees in
	2016. 




	 




	General Trends and Outlook




	 




	We believe that our immediate outlook is extremely favorable, as we
	believe the competition is very limited in our market niche for
	broadband voice, data and video in the rural markets and only a
	limited number of companies competing with us in the marketplace.
	However, there is no assurance that such national competitor will
	not arrive in the future. We do not anticipate any major changes in
	the triple-play telecommunications industry. We believe that 2017
	and beyond will be a slow growth years for us. We will need to gain
	strength and stability in the regional rural markets we intend to

	Liquidity and Capital Resources




	 




	The
	financial statements have been prepared assuming the company will
	continue as a going concern as per its business plan. F

	or the three months ended March 31, 2017, the
	company has a net loss of $23,415

	. The company has financed
	its activities from its stockholder. As of March 2017 and December
	2016 the Company had $176 and $167 in cash on hand
	respectively.




	 




	The
	company intends to finance its future business and development
	activities and its working capital needs largely from the sale of
	equity securities until such time that funds generated from
	operations are sufficient to fund working capital
	requirements.

	ITEM 3:    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
	DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK




	 




	Market
	risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial
	instrument, derivative or non-derivative, caused by fluctuations in
	interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. Changes
	in these factors could cause fluctuations in results of our
	operations and cash flows. In the ordinary course of business, we
	are not exposed to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate
	risks.





	 






	ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES




	 




	Based
	upon the required evaluation of our disclosure controls and
	procedures, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief
	Financial Officer concluded that as of March 31, 2017 our
	disclosure controls and procedures were inadequate and not
	effective to ensure that information was gathered, analyzed and
	disclosed on a timely basis.




	 




	There
	has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting
	(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the
	Exchange Act) that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended March
	31, 2017, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
	materially affect, our internal control over financial
	reporting.




	 




	Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures




	 




	Under
	the supervision and with the participation of our management,
	including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
	Officer, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
	design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as
	defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
	Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
	Financial Officer have concluded that, at March 31, 2017, such
	disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, based on our
	delinquent filings. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls
	and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information
	required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under
	the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
	within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.
	Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
	controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
	required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under
	the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management,
	including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
	or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow
	timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

	Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial
	Reporting




	 




	The
	Company's management is responsible for establishing and
	maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as
	defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act of
	1934 as a process designed by or under the supervision of the
	company’s principal executive and principal financial
	officers and effected by the company’s board of directors,
	management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
	regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
	preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes
	in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
	United States of America and included those policy and procedures
	that:




	 






	●




	Pertain to the
	maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
	fairly reflect the transaction and dispositions of the assets of
	the company.






	 






	●




	Provide reasonable
	assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
	preparation of finical statements in accordance with accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States of America and
	that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only
	in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
	the company; and






	 






	●




	Provide reasonable
	assurance regarding prevention for timely detection of unauthorized
	acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that
	could have a material effect on the financial
	statements






	 




	A
	control system, no matter how well conceived or operated, can
	provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives
	of the control system are met under all potential conditions,
	regardless of how remote, and may not prevent or detect all errors
	and all fraud. Because of the inherent limitations in all control
	systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
	that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the
	Company have been prevented or detected. Our internal control over
	financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance
	regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
	preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
	accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
	United States of America.




	 




	The
	Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the
	Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
	March 31, 2017. In making this assessment, the Company’s
	management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
	Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
	(“COSO”) in Internal Control­Integrated Framework
	(COSO 2013 framework) and SEC guidance on conducting such
	assessments. The COSO framework is based upon five integrated
	components of control: control environment, risk assessment,
	control activities, information and communications and ongoing
	monitoring.




	 




	Our
	disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide
	reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of our
	disclosure control system are met. Because of inherent limitations
	in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
	absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a
	company have been detected. Based on their evaluation as of the end
	of the period covered by this report, management concluded that our
	disclosure controls and procedures were not sufficiently effective
	to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of our
	disclosure control system were met.




	 




	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting




	 




	No
	change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting
	occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2017, that materially
	affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
	Company's internal control over financial reporting.

	PART II—OTHER INFORMATION




	 




	 






	ITEM 1.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS




	 




	The
	Company is not involved in any legal proceedings and is not aware
	of any pending or threatened claims.




	 




	The
	Company expects and may be subject to legal proceedings and claims
	from time to time in the ordinary course of its business,
	including, but not limited to, claims of alleged infringement of
	the trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third
	parties by the Company and its licensees. Such claims, even if not
	meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant
	financial and managerial resources.





	 






	ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF
	PROCEEDS




	 




	There
	have been no sales of unregistered securities during the quarter
	ended March 31, 2017.




	 




	During
	the three months period ended March 31, 2017, there was no
	modification of any instruments defining the rights of holders of
	the Company's common stock and no limitation or qualification of
	the rights evidenced by the Company's common stock as a result of
	the issuance of any other class of securities or the modification
	thereof.




	 




	During
	the period covered by this filing, the Company did not sell any
	securities that were not registered under the Securities
	Act.

	I,
	Jeffery A. Brown, certify that:




	 






	1.




	I have reviewed
	this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of SigmaBroadband
	Co.;






	 






	2.




	Based on my
	knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a
	material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make
	the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such
	statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period
	covered by this report;






	 






	3.




	Based on my
	knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
	information included in this report, fairly present in all material
	respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash
	flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in
	this report;






	 






	4.




	The
	registrant’s other certifying officer and I are responsible
	for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures
	(as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and
	internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange
	Act Rules 13a–15(f) and 15d–15(f)) for the registrant
	and have:






	 






	(a)            




	Designed such
	disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure
	controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to
	ensure that material information relating to the registrant,
	including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by
	others within those entities, particularly during the period in
	which this report is being prepared;






	 






	(b)            




	Designed such
	internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal
	control over financial reporting to be designed under our
	supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the

	statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
	accepted accounting principles;






	 






	(c)            




	Evaluated the
	effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and

	end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation;
	and






	 






	(d)            




	Disclosed in this
	report any change in the registrant‘s internal control over
	financial reporting that occurred during the registrant’s
	most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter
	in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or
	is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant’s
	internal control over financial reporting; and






	 






	5.




	The registrant's
	other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most
	recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to
	the registrant’s auditors and the audit committee of the
	registrant’s board of directors (or persons performing the
	equivalent functions):






	 






	(a)            




	All significant
	deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
	internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
	likely to adversely affect the registrant’s ability to
	record, process, summarize and report financial information;
	and






	 






	(b)            




	Any fraud, whether
	or not material, that involves management or other employees who
