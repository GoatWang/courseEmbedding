AEP Promotes Dennis E. Welch To Chief Administrative Officer













	COLUMBUS, Ohio, Sept. 27, 2011 – Dennis E. Welch has been promoted to executive vice president and chief administrative officer of American Electric Power (NYSE: AEP), effective Oct. 1.

	Welch, 60, has served as executive vice president – Environment, Safety & Health and Facilities since December 2007. He joined AEP in 2005 as senior vice president – Environment and Safety. In his new role, Welch will add Shared Services – which includes Information Technology, Human Resources and Business Logistics – to his current responsibilities. Welch will report to AEP President Nicholas K. Akins.

	“Dennis is a proven leader with a unique ability to build relationships that have helped AEP achieve success in many areas, including our environmental and sustainability efforts,” Akins said. “His commitment to improving the company’s safety and health performance, ensuring regulatory compliance and advocating for better public policy has been a great asset. I look forward to his continued contributions to AEP in his new role.”

	From 2001 to 2005, Welch served as president and chief operating officer of Yankee Energy System, an operating subsidiary of Northeast Utilities (NU). A 20-year veteran of NU, Welch previously served as vice president of Environmental, Safety & Ethics, director of Environmental Health and Safety and manager of Occupational Safety at NU. Prior to joining NU, Welch held various positions at Stone & Webster Engineering.

	Welch earned a bachelor’s degree in environmental, health and safety management from Indiana State University at Terre Haute and a master’s degree in business and human resource management from the Hartford Graduate Center of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He completed the Environmental Leadership Program at Yale University’s School of Forestry and Environmental Studies.

	American Electric Power is one of the largest electric utilities in the United States, delivering electricity to more than 5 million customers in 11 states. AEP ranks among the nation’s largest generators of electricity, owning nearly 38,000 megawatts of generating capacity in the U.S. AEP also owns the nation’s largest electricity transmission system, a nearly 39,000-mile network that includes more 765-kilovolt extra-high voltage transmission lines than all other U.S. transmission systems combined. AEP’s transmission system directly or indirectly serves about 10 percent of the electricity demand in the Eastern Interconnection, the interconnected transmission system that covers 38 eastern and central U.S. states and eastern Canada, and approximately 11 percent of the electricity demand in ERCOT, the transmission system that covers much of Texas. AEP’s utility units operate as AEP Ohio, AEP Texas, Appalachian Power (in Virginia and West Virginia), AEP Appalachian Power (in Tennessee), Indiana Michigan Power, Kentucky Power, Public Service Company of Oklahoma, and Southwestern Electric Power Company (in Arkansas, Louisiana and east Texas). AEP’s headquarters are in Columbus, Ohio.

"I am proud to join TRC's Board of Directors," said Mr. Welch. "I look forward to contributing to the Company's efforts to generate sustainable, profitable growth and secure its position as a leading service provider in the markets it serves." 
Prior to joining AEP, Welch spent 22 years at Northeast Utilities (NU) where he held the position of Vice President of Environment, Safety & Ethics before being named President and Chief Operating Officer of NU's Yankee Gas Services Company and Yankee Energy System subsidiaries. Prior to NU, he was at Stone and Webster Engineering Corp. for 13 years.

Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements in this press release may be forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as "may," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," or other words of similar import. You should consider statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss TRC's future expectations, contain projections of the Company's future results of operations or of its financial condition, or state other "forward-looking" information. TRC believes that it is important to communicate its future expectations to its investors. However, there may be events in the future that the Company is not able to accurately predict or control and that may cause its actual results to differ materially from the expectations described in its forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from those discussed as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, the uncertainty of TRC's operational and growth strategies; circumstances which could create large cash outflows, such as contract losses, litigation, uncollectible receivables and income tax assessments; regulatory uncertainty; the availability of funding for government projects; the level of demand for TRC's services; product acceptance; industry-wide competitive factors; the ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel; the availability and adequacy of insurance; and general political or economic conditions. Furthermore, market trends are subject to changes, which could adversely affect future results. See the risk factors and additional discussion in TRC's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and other factors detailed from time to time in the Company's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
