This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

  The Board of Directors of Farmers & Merchants Bancorp (OTCQX:FMCB) declared a mid-year cash dividend of $6.75 per share, an increase over the $6.55 per share declared in May of 2016. The cash dividend will be paid on July 1, 2017, to shareholders of record on June 9, 2017. Kent A. Steinwert, Chairman, President and CEO noted, "The Board is pleased with the Company's record full year 2016 and first quarter 2017 financial results and unanimously approved the cash dividend. The Board believes our strong earnings performance allows for increasing the cash dividend while still providing a level of capital retention that supports the Company's expansion plans. This year marks the 82 nd consecutive year that Farmers & Merchants Bancorp has paid cash dividends and the 52 nd consecutive year we have increased dividends. As a result of the reliability of our cash dividends over many decades, we remain a member of a select group of only 19 publicly traded companies referred to as "Dividend Kings."

Steinwert, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Dave Zitterow, Executive Vice President and SF Bay Area Market Executive, in the Bank's new downtown Walnut Creek branch near Broadway Plaza. (Photo: Business Wire)   For the quarter ending March 31, 2017, Farmers & Merchants Bancorp reported net income of $7.8 million, or $9.68 per share, a 9.1% increase from net income of $7.2 million earned in the first quarter of 2016.
