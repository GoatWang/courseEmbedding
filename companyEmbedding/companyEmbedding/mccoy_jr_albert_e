a.      
	
	Special significance in terms of its history, architecture, and/or cultural 
	importance: The Commission judges that the property known as the Albert 
	McCoy Farm does possess special significance in terms of 
	Charlotte-Mecklenburg. The Commission bases its judgment on the following 
	considerations: 
	

***1.   The  
	Albert McCoy Farm is a physical reminder of the rural 
	landscape of Mecklenburg County in the late nineteenth and early twentieth 
	centuries.  With its simple two-story  farm house and modest collection of 
	outbuildings (log crib, a wellhouse, a 
	smokehouse and a privy) the 
	Albert McCoy Farm represents the many small farmsteads that 
	flourished in the county in the decades after the Civil War;  2.  

	The Albert McCoy House is a two-story, timber-frame, side-gable-and- wing 
	dwelling, representative of a type that was common throughout Mecklenburg 
	County in the late nineteenth century; 3.   The integrity of the 
	Albert McCoy House is excellent, no original material has been removed since 
	the house was constructed.
	

	 


b.     
	
	Integrity of design, workmanship, materials, feeling, and association.


The 
	Commission contends that the architectural description prepared by Mr.  
	William Huffman and Dr. Richard Mattson. demonstrates that the Albert McCoy 
	Farm meets this criterion. 

 

***9.     
	Ad 
	Valorem Tax Appraisal: 
	The Commission is aware that designation would allow the owner to apply for 
	an automatic deferral of 50% of the Ad Valorem taxes on all or any portion 
	of the property that becomes a designated �historic landmark.� The current 
	appraised value of the Albert McCoy Farm is 
	$145,600�$113,700 for the building, $7500 for other features, and $24,400 
	for the land. [Tax Assessment In Progress]

Physical Description





	         The Albert McCoy Farm is located 
	in the Long Creek section of northern Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, 
	about fifteen miles north of the city of Charlotte. Approximately five miles 
	from the center of the town of Huntersville, it has recently been annexed 
	into the rapidly- expanding town limits. The Albert McCoy Farm is entirely 
	rural in character, though it is in an area that is currently inundated by 
	rapid development, which is likely to increase even more when 1-485 
	(Charlotte�s outer beltway) is completed. 
	

	            The Long Creek section of Mecklenburg County is typical of the 
	southern piedmont region of North Carolina. It is characterized by 
	well-watered, gently-rolling topography that is well-suited for agricultural 
	purposes. Typical vegetation includes open spaces, pastures, cultivated 
	fields, mature hardwood trees, and piney woodlands. The built environment 
	reflects the traditional agricultural nature of the area in the scattered 
	farms that remain, but also exhibits the more current urban and suburban 
	development patterns in subdivisions and free-standing dwellings. 


	            The Albert McCoy Farm has been in the same family since 1770, 
	and has been in continuous agricultural use since at least 1880. It is a 
	rural historic landscape which retains the setting, characteristics, and 
	associations from the period of significance, c. 1886-1950. The centerpiece 
	of the seventy-six acre farm, which spans both sides of McCoy Road (SR 
	2120), is the c. 1886 Albert McCoy House. The house faces east; outbuildings 
	spread out on three sides (to the north, west and south) of the house, a 
	typical layout for nineteenth-century Mecklenburg County farms. The 
	significant outbuildings--a log crib, a wellhouse, a smokehouse and a 
	privy-- are contemporary with the house (only a pumphouse and a small animal 
	shelter are later). The house is surrounded by a manicured yard, shrubbery 
	and scattered hardwood trees (including oak, elm, sycamore, poplar and 
	walnut trees). An unpaved driveway runs from McCoy Road along the south side 
	of the house, and turns north into the back yard. A small kitchen garden is 
	beyond the driveway on the south side of the house. Pasture land and fields 
	surround the house and yard on all sides, and woodlands spread along the 
	east and west sides, and across the southwest corner of the tract. A large 
	man-made pond, installed in the 1930s for recreational use, sits adjacent to 
	the western edge of the property. It is fed by a spring near Gar Creek, 
	which traverses the southern edge of the Albert McCoy Farm. 

	 



	 




	           The Albert McCoy House is a two-story, timber frame, 
	side-gable-and-wing (sometimes called L-plan) dwelling on a stone pier 
	foundation. The roof has a shallow pitch, cross gables, and a standing-seam 
	metal covering. The house is sheathed with weatherboard siding, and has 
	large six-over-six sash windows. There are three brick chimneys--one 
	exterior end chimney and two interior chimneys. The porch spans the left 
	(south) two bays of the facade, and features a hipped roof, a cutwork 
	balustrade and sawn brackets. A one-story ell extends out from the rear of 
	the house on the south side. The handmade front door surround includes 
	sidelights and splays out at the top and bottom. The door surround is 
	distinctive and, along with the interior woodwork, identifies this house as 
	the product of local builder John Ellis McAuley (1861-1929). 

	 



Front Porch Detail

	 




	           On the interior, the Albert McCoy House has a center hall plan. 
	The open-string stair rises up from the back of the hall, and features 
	delicate turned balusters and thick turned newel posts. The first floor has 
	three large rooms in the main body of the house, and two smaller rooms in 
	the rear ell. Three large bedrooms are found on the second floor. Seven of 
	the eight rooms have fireplaces with handcarved mantels. Each mantel is 
	different from the others and all are recognizable as the work of John Ellis 
	McAuley.  McAuley favored flat pilasters or chamfered boards supporting a 
	plain shelf; but created unique architraves. He often used simple 
	hand-carved shapes, but executed them well, usually adding a deep bevel that 
	varied in angle along the curves he created. McAuley�s handiwork can also be 
	seen in the board-and-batten ceiling coverings, and his use of interior 
	closets. Each of the three upstairs bedrooms has a small closet in one 
	corner. Four panel doors with ornate Victorian rim locks are found 
	throughout the house. All interior wall finishes are plaster, and all floors 
	are wide heart-pine boards. 

	 



The Ephraim Alexander McAuley House, ca. 
	1881

The McAuley House was remodeled by John Ellis McAuley in 1914.


	           The integrity of the Albert 
	McCoy House is excellent. No 
	original material has been removed since the house was constructed. A 
	bathroom was added off the first floor hall in the mid-twentieth century. At 
	some point, plumbing was added to the rear first floor room, and it was 
	converted to kitchen use. 

 



Architectural 
	Description and Architectural Context

 

	             The Albert McCoy House, 
	a two-story, timber-frame, side-gable-and- wing dwelling is representative 
	of a type that was common throughout Mecklenburg County in the late 
	nineteenth century.   Its irregular massing identifies its origins 
	as Queen Anne, whether or not any Victorian trim was used in the house.  
	This particular house does not contain any mass-produced millwork or other 
	trip typically associated with the Queen Anne style.  Instead, it is a 
	showplace for the individual and highly skilled craftsmanship of local 
	builder, John Ellis McAuley.

	 


John Ellis McAuley 
 

                John Ellis McAuley 
	(1861-1929) is the only local builder in Mecklenburg County about whom 
	significant information is known.  He was from a local family and ultimately 
	inherited his father�s house and land on Alexandriana Road in the Long Creek 
	area of the county)3 McAuley displayed his carpentry skills as early as age 
	twelve, when he built a functioning miniature water mill that was widely 
	admired by those who saw it.  He had a special affection for tools, and took 
	pride in keeping them sharp. His four-foot-by-three-foot toolbox is said to 
	have weighed five hundred pounds when full.  He also repaired farm equipment 
	for his father and their neighbors.�4  McAuley is remembered locally as a 
	�country carpenter.�  In 1939, The History of Hopewell Presbyterian Church
	reminisced that he �had no speculative ability nor any thirst for gain; 
	his labor was solely for the art of his trade.�5 McAuley is listed in the 
	census records of 1900, 1910 and 1920 as a farmer.16   Ironically, he never 
	considered himself to be a builder by trade, and never built a house for
	himself.  He did, however, alter the house he inherited from his father 
	to such an extent that it bore his trademark woodwork.�7 


	              McAuley was still in his twenties when Albert McCoy asked him 
	to build this house. Though he had built an addition to another home, this 
	was his first commission for an entire building. His unusual splayed front 
	door surrounds and unique hand-carved mantels are considered his signature. 
	The door surround angles outward at both the top and the bottom. On 
	fireplace mantels, he created architraves adorned by distinctive curves with 
	deep bevels whose pitch changes throughout the curve.�8 No two of the seven 
	mantels in the Albert McCoy House are alike, and all of the woodwork is 
	finely executed. His skills as a carpenter are evident throughout the house.
	


	                The History of 
	Hopewell Presbyterian Church 
	documented at least ten houses in the immediate area built by McAuley, 
	though there were probably many more.�9   In addition to the Albert McCoy 
	House, four others that are still standing include: the Kerns House (1880s) 
	on Kems Road, the W. B. Parks House (c. 1901) on Beatties Ford Road, the 
	Parks-Jetton House (1905)(recently 
	demolished) on Neck Road, and the rectory at St. Mark�s 
	Episcopal Church (c. 1898) on Mt. Holly-Huntersville Road.  McAuley also 
	erected houses outside of the immediate Hopewell community.  Two such 
	examples are the 
William and Cora Osborne House (c. 1890) at 12445 
	Ramah Church Road and the Grey-Knox House (c. 1894) at 108 Gilead Road in 
	Huntersville.  

 

              McAuley�s work emphasizes 
	finely-crafted detail over the latest fashion. All of the houses he 

built 
	are either traditional I-house (Kerns House, Grey-Knox House, Osborne House 
	and Parks-Jetton

 House) or side-gable-and-wing forms (W.B. Parks House, 
	Albert McCoy House, and St. Mark�s rectory). 

All are of frame construction 
	and all feature hand-carved interior woodwork. Every example 

except the 
	Parks-Jetton House has his signature splayed front door surround. The Albert 
	McCoy 

House is especially significant, since it is known to have been McAuley�s first house-building 

project.  Although it is a common form, the 
	Albert McCoy House is extraordinarily uncommon in 

its well-executed craftsmanship and attention to detail.


	 

	 



	 

	             The Albert McCoy Farm, with its seventy-six acres of pasture 
	and woods and c. 1886 two-story, side-gable-and-wing house surrounded by a 
	complete collection of outbuildings, retains the integrity of a working farm 
	from the late-nineteenth through the first half of the twentieth century. 
	The McCoy Farm, eligible for listing in the National Register under 
	Criterion A for its significance in the area of agriculture, retains a 
	landscape of fields, pastures, and tree stands that is evocative of historic 
	rural Mecklenburg County, which is a landscape increasingly threatened with 
	development. The McCoy Farm is also eligible under Criterion C for 
	architecture for the well-preserved side-gable-and-wing farmhouse built by 
	skilled local craftsman John Ellis McAuley. The significance of the McCoy 
	Farm is discussed in �Historic and Architectural Resources of Rural 
	Mecklenburg County, North Carolina� National Register Multiple Property 
	Documentation Form in the context entitled �Post-Bellum and Late-Nineteenth 
	to Early- Twentieth Century Agriculture (1865-1939).� The property 
	meets the registration requirements for Property Type IC: Postbellum 
	Farmhouses and Property Type 2: Outbuildings. The significance statement 
	that follows provides additional context in order to extend the period of 
	significance to 1950. 
	 

	             Albert McCoy (1843-1925), a Civil War veteran and a founder of 
	St. Mark�s Church, the first Episcopal church in northern Mecklenburg 
	County, established the farm on the land he inherited from his father. The 
	property is a rare surviving example of a piedmont North Carolina farm that 
	has remained in the ownership of the same family, and has been farmed 
	continually, for nearly one hundred and fifteen years. The period of 
	significance is c. 1886 to 1950, a period during which the McCoy Farm held a 
	significant role in the process and technology of farming in Mecklenburg 
	County. 
	 


 

 Historical 
	Background & Agricultural Context
 





McCoy Family 


	            Mecklenburg County was populated in the mid eighteenth century 
	primarily by ScotchIrish settlers who supported themselves by farming. One 
	such settler was Ezekial Beaty McCoy, who had come to North Carolina from 
	Pennsylvania. In 1770, Beaty purchased farmland on Gar Creek in the Long 
	Creek section of the county, which ultimately was passed to his son John 
	McCoy. John�s son, Marshall Rudolphus McCoy (1807-1854) obtained several 
	hundred acres and built and resided in a log house nearby on Kerns Road 
	(still standing). In 1874, Marshall Rudoiphus McCoy�s son, Albert McCoy 
	(1843-1925) acquired 370 acres of his late father�s estate and was farming 
	on the land by 1880.1


	            Albert McCoy was educated at Statesville Military Institute. At 
	age eighteen, he enlisted in Company C, 37th Regiment (nicknamed 
	�Mecklenburg�s Wide Awakes�) of the Confederate States Army. He served as a 
	private during the Civil War until he was discharged in June 1862. He 
	returned to his native Mecklenburg County and married Catherine J. N. Potts 
	in 1866. Within five years, Catherine bad borne a child, Catherine Lura 
	McCoy, and then died. After Catherine�s death, Albert married a neighbor, 
	Mary Catherine Gluyas (1850-19 19). Mary was the daughter of Captain Thomas 
	Gluyas (1828-1912), who was a founding member of St. Mark�s Episcopal 
	Church, and was described at the time of his death as �one of the most 
	successful planters in the county.�2   

	 

	            Albert and Mary McCoy had twelve 
	children between 1871 and 1895. In 1874, Albert�s mother, Rebecca, deeded to 
	Albert 370 acres of McCoy land that had been owned by her husband, Marshall Rudolphus McCoy (1807-1854). By 1880, Albert and Mary had set up farming and 
	housekeeping on the land. It is thought that they initially lived in a house 
	somewhere near the present dwelling, which has long since perished. In or 
	around 1886, Albert commissioned local builder John Ellis MeAuley to 
	construct a new house for his growing family. 




Thomas and Latitia Gluyas House, ca. 1865



	 




             Family history states 
	that the eighth child, Joseph Bennet McCoy, who was born in November of 
	1886, was the first child born in the new house. The 1900 census finds 
	Albert, Mary and all twelve of their children living together at this 
	location. In addition, a ninety-year-old former slave, Lizzie, also lived 
	with the family. Later, Albert�s children would erect a stone marker in 
	honor of Lizzie and her husband Jim at the slave cemetery nearby where they 
	were interred. A fund was set up in 1949 for the perpetual care of the slave 
	cemetery, which is well maintained to this day.4 


	            St. Mark�s Episcopal Church, the first Episcopal church in north 
	Mecklenburg County, was formed in 1883 by Albert McCoy, his brother Columbus 
	W. McCoy, father-in-law Captain Thomas Gluyas, and others. The first 
	meetings were held on Albert�s land. The first Rector, Joseph Blount 
	Cheshire said of Albert McCoy �from the first to the last he was attached to 
	the church with an earnest devotion and enthusiasm which I have seldom seen 
	equaled.�5 

 
	          
	At the time of his death in 1925, Albert was �credited with being the 
	oldest member of the Masonic order in Charlotte or vicinity and is believed 
	by some to be the oldest Mason in the state.� He had joined the organization 
	in 1863. His obituary further stated that �he was a man of commanding 
	personality, irreproachable character and uprightness in his private life 
	and a citizen of the highest type.� Albert was known to his relatives as a 
	local historian and was proud to claim kinship with John McKnitt Alexander 
	and Major John Davidson, both local heroes of the Revolutionary War era.6
	
	 

            Albert McCoy supported his large 
	family off the land where he lived his entire life. Agricultural census 
	records, available only for 1880, provide insight into the farm activities 
	in the period just before the Albert McCoy House was built. They reveal that 
	seventy-five acres were tilled, seventy acres were in meadow, pasture, and 
	orchard or otherwise improved, and 150 acres were in woodland. Twenty-five 
	acres were planted in Indian corn, which yielded 400 bushels and was the 
	largest crop. Oats (thirty bushels), wheat (forty-five bushels) and cotton 
	(ten bales) were all produced in smaller amounts. One acre was devoted to 
	each an apple orchard (150 trees) and a peach orchard (50 trees). 
	There were eighty poultry animals, which laid seventy-five dozen eggs in 
	1879. Bees provided 100 pounds of honey in that year. Other animals around 
	the farm included nine horses, three mules, four cows, three sheep and seven 
	swine. 200 pounds of butter were processed on the farm. Four surviving 
	outbuildings--a smokehouse, a wellhouse, a privy, and a log crib--are 
	thought to have been built at the same time as the house, and are directly 
	related to the activities on the McCoy Farm during the period of 
	significance, c. 1886 to 1950. 

	 


             
	At 370 acres, Albert McCoy�s tract was considerably larger than the typical 
	farm in 


	Mecklenburg County, which averaged 111 acres in 1880. Spratt�s Map of 1911 
	illustrates that there 

were no 
	other farms on McCoy Road, or even in the immediate vicinity, at that time. 
	Statistics show 

that in 
	1920, only 1.3% of Mecklenburg County farms were between 250 and 499 acres 
	in size, and 

only .2% 
	were larger than 499 acres.8 Evaluated against the analysis done by Dr. 
	William Huffman 

for the 
	1990 �Historic and Architectural Resources of Rural Mecklenburg County� 
	National Register Multiple Property Documentation Form, the range of 
	production on Albert McCoy�s farm proves 

to have 
	been typical for Mecklenburg County during the late nineteenth and early 
	twentieth 


	centuries. Huffman says, �production was mainly grain and cotton, with 
	livestock being an 


	important, but secondary, activity.� He mentions cattle, sheep, swine, 
	poultry and eggs, and 

states 
	that �corn clearly dominated the cereal crops, with wheat and oats next.. 
	Compared to 

three 
	other National Register farms in the community, the Ephraim Alexander 
	McAuley Farm 

(NR, 
	1990), the Samuel J. McElroy House (NR, 1990), and the Dr. Walter Pharr 
	Craven House

(NR., 
	1990), the Albert McCoy Farm was very similar in output to its neighboring 
	farms. 

Though 
	smaller, these three nearby farms grew primarily corn, followed by wheat 
	and/or 

oats, and 
	cotton. They all had a few livestock, and two also had some egg-laying 
	poultry. 

Two farms 
	(McAuley and McElroy) had apple and peach orchards. Evidently, this mix of
	

grains, 
	fruit, cattle and dairy products was a successful combination in north 
	Mecklenburg 

County.
 

	             When Albert died in 1925, his holdings were divided among 
	several of his children, in accordance with the terms of his will. His 
	property was divided into thirteen lots, ten of which were between forty and 
	forty-seven acres in size. Lots four and five were combined into one 
	sixty-five acre tract, which included the house and outbuildings. This 
	homeplace tract ultimately went to the eldest daughter, Ella Letitia McCoy 
	Nisbet (1875-1946).�� 
	 

	            Ella married William Alexander Nisbet in 1900, and they had five 
	children together.� They lived in the house and actively farmed the land, 
	though no one cash crop dominated. The youngest son, Dr. Thomas Gluyas 
	Nisbet (1912-1995), recalled living in the house from the mid1920s through 
	1939. Ella died in 1946, and William died in 1953. The property 
	passed to the three surviving children, Thomas and his two sisters. Thomas 
	G. Nisbet leased the property from 1953 through the mid 1990s, during which 
	time cattle were maintained on the land.�2 Farming was thus continued on the 
	land throughout the period of significance, c. 1886 to 1950. 


	             In accordance with Thomas G. Nisbet�s wishes, the Albert McCoy 
	farm was sold to Dr. Thomas H. McCoy after Nisbet�s death. Thomas H. McCoy 
	is the son of Joseph Bennet McCoy, Jr., who is in turn the son of Joseph 
	Bennet McCoy, Sr., who was born in the house in 1886, and was the son of 
	Albert and Mary McCoy. Thomas H. McCoy is thus a direct descendant of Albert 
	McCoy.

Our History
	W.F. McCoy founded the company in 1928, and two generations of McCoys have followed in his footsteps. Today, his grandson, Albert E. McCoy Jr., runs a company that employs 14 people in the winter and maintains a fleet of eight tank trucks and six vans.

Our Commitment
	W.F. McCoy Petroleum performs the highest quality work and covers all the bases, because we want our customers to relax and never have to think about their heat or heating equipment. We are friendly, knowledgeable people who give each customer the individual attention they deserve.

Storage Facility
	An oil company's first job is to keep the customer supplied at all times. W.F. McCoy is an exceptionally reliable provider, because we own and operate a 500,000-gallon fuel terminal. Even in the worst winter weather, we have the supply you need, so you can enjoy peace of mind.

	Uninterrupted fuel supply is not something to take for granted. Many heating oil companies do not maintain terminals, and instead buy their fuel daily from a wholesaler's terminal. In an extended stretch of severe winter weather - when your need for reliable supply is greatest - some companies won't have oil, but W.F. McCoy will.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.
