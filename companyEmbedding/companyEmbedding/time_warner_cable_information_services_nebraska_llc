CSG International (CSGI) is a multinational corporation headquartered in Englewood, Colorado. It provides Business Support Systems (BSS) software and services, primarily to the telecommunications industry.
CSG was founded by Neal Hansen as a division of First Data in 1982. It became an independent corporation when it was acquired by CSG Holdings in 1994 for $137 million. A contract with Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI), the largest cable TV business at the time, was influential in the company's growth from $80 million in revenue in 1994 to $171 million by 1997. CSG went public in 1996. A dispute with TCI over pricing led to a $120 million arbitration settlement in 2002 with Comcast, who acquired the TCI business. The two continued to do business together and expanded their relationship in 2014. CSG made more than ten acquisitions in the 2000s, mostly of companies that sold billing, customer service and operations software.

Corporate history[edit]
Early history[edit]
CSG International was founded in 1982 by Neal Hansen under the name Cable Services Group (CSG) as a division of the payment processing company First Data Corporation.[2] At the time First Data was operated by American Express, which acquired a controlling interest in the company in 1980.[3] CSG became a part of the American Express Information Services Company, which was formed in 1989.[4] The CSG group's first large-scale billing statement processing center, which prints and mails bills to consumers, was established in Omaha in 1990.[5]
Hansen left the Cable Services Group one year after it was founded to become CEO of Applied Communications, where he met George Haddix.[2][6] Hansen and Haddix formed CSG Holdings with Morgan Stanley and Trident Investment Group in 1994, which acquired Cable Services Group that year for $137 million.[2][7] In November 1994, Cable Services Group was renamed to CSG Systems International.[6]
CSG was the second largest billing services provider for the US cable television industry by 1994,[8][9] serving 27 percent of cable TV subscribers.[7] However, according to The International Directory of Company Histories, its profit margins were small and the company was "still in need of a turnaround."[6] Broadcasting & Cable said CSG had lost direction and become complacent. Haddix and Hansen implemented changes at the company,[2] which prompted 350 out of 500 employees to leave the firm within a few months.[6]
The new CSG International grew quickly.[5][10] The convergence of phone, internet, on-demand movies, and other services created more complex billing arrangements between telecommunications companies and consumers, which led to more extensive use of billing services providers like CSG.[10] Professional services and international clients, which were previously not a significant portion of revenues, grew to 22 percent of revenues by the mid-1990s.[5][6]
Post IPO[edit]
In order to pay off debt and raise funding for acquisitions, CSG held an initial public offering in February 1996, which valued the firm at five-fold its original acquisition price.[6][11] CSG grew from $80 million in annual revenues when it was acquired, to $132.3 million when it went public in 1996 and $171.7 million by 1997.[5]
In the 1990s, Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI) and Time Warner scrapped efforts to create internal billing software and hired CSG International.[10] The 15-year agreement CSG signed with TCI on August 11, 1997[12] made CSG the largest vendor in the industry[5] and was the primary contributor to its growth in the '90s.[12] By 2001, the deal was responsible for 45 percent of CSG's revenue.[13] As part of the deal, CSG also acquired TCI's internally developed software, SummiTrack, for $106 million.[10][12] CSG's services to TCI included billing, customer management and payment processing for TCI customers.[14] In October 1997, CSG International signed its first deal with a utilities company, mc2.[10]
At the end of 1997, CSG co-founder George Haddix retired, and former EVP Jack Pogge was appointed President and Chief Operating Officer in his place.[15] In 1999 CSG began constructing a new bill processing center in Florida in a deal with local government, which expanded roads and provided other incentives.[16] In 2002, CSG acquired the billing software interests of Lucent Technologies for $260 million.[17][18] The deal was estimated to increase CSG's revenues by 38 percent and its headcount by 65 percent.[19] 200 Lucent employees were laid off as a result of the acquisition.[17] An additional 100 - 150 CSG employees were laid off later that year in response to poor economic conditions.[20]
Recent history[edit]
AT&T acquired TCI in 2000, inheriting its agreement with CSG.[13] AT&T alleged CSG was not abiding by the contract's terms to provide favorable rates. A legal dispute between the two companies began in 2001 in arbitration court. Before the dispute was resolved, AT&T Broadband was acquired by Comcast, who wanted to use its own billing and customer service vendor. In October 2002, a judge ruled that CSG owed Comcast a $120 million refund and that it had to reduce its prices.[21][22][23] The two companies disagreed over whether the ruling would allow Comcast to halt their agreement before the end of its term.[24] CSG and Comcast reached new agreements or extensions in March 2004[25] and in 2008.[26] In 2014 its work with Comcast was expanded to cover all of its customer support and billing for residential services.[27]
In March 2005, co-founder Neal Hansen retired at the age of 64. Ed Nafus, prior president of the broadband services division, took his place.[28] Nafus was replaced as CEO by Peter Kalan, at the end of 2007.[29] In November 2015, it was announced that Bret Griess would be succeeding Kalan as president and CEO.[30]
As of 2016, CSG International now has 33 offices in 22 countries across the world. This does not include minor 'satellite offices'.

Products, software and services[edit]
CSG International provides software and services for managing customer data, analyzing that data, billing and customer service. For example, customer service representatives may use CSG systems to lookup a consumer's records and add a new service, or business analysts may mine customer data for trends.[10] According to the company's website, its primary product areas are revenue management, content management & monetization, and customer interaction management.[47] CSG also prints and mails billing statements to consumers and provides call-center services.[2]
Product history[edit]
CSG International originally sold two versions of its billing process outsourcing services. Under new leadership in 1994, it began developing additional software and providing consulting to in-house billing departments.[6][9] During this period it developed CSG Workforce Express, a suite of software products that manage the dispatch of technicians and other logistics at customer sites. Workforce Express consists of three applications: CSG Workforce Management, CSG TechNet and CSG TechNet CE, which integrate with CSG's databases and billing systems.[6][48] It also developed CSG Care Express, which is for creating online self-service portals for consumers to view and pay their bills online.[6][49]
In the 1990s CSG introduced the ACSR (Advanced Customer Service Representative) system.[6] An extension to ACSR called ProfitNow! was introduced in 2003. ProfitNow! used a consumer's account data to advise customer service representatives on the likelihood of a caller cancelling their service or buying a new product.[50] It was later turned into an online system with a user interface similar to Microsoft Windows at CSG.net.[6] CSG purchased the Kenan FX software from Lucent Technologies in 2002. Kenan software managed billing and ordering and provided middle-ware to help various customer service and billing products integrate with each other.[51] CSG NextGen was introduced for international markets, with support for multiple languages.[6] In March 2014, CSG added a cybersecurity suite to its product portfolio, under the name CSG Invotas.[52] The company released CSG Ascendon, a digital platform for communications service providers, in March 2015. The platform uses content monetization and delivery systems without making excessive changes to existing infrastructure.[53] In November 2015 the Invotas unit was spun off into a separate entity.[54] Invotas was acquired by FireEye in a transaction that closed February 1, 2016.[55]
Organization[edit]
CSG International has three subsidiaries: CSG Systems, CSG Systems Software and CSG Services.[6] Its subsidiaries offer products and services, while the parent company, CSG Systems International Inc. is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange.[34] As of 2015, its largest clients were Comcast, DISH and Time Warner Cable, representing 24, 14 and 12 percent of its revenues respectively. CSG spends approximately 14 percent of its revenues on research and development. Its revenues are about 77 percent from payment processing and related services, 12 percent from software and the remainder for ongoing technical support. 85 percent of revenues are from the Americas.[56][10][57]

In October 2002, a judge ruled that CSG owed Comcast a $120 million refund and that it had to reduce its prices.[21][22][23] The two companies disagreed over whether the ruling would allow Comcast to halt their agreement before the end of its term.[24] CSG and Comcast reached new agreements or extensions in March 2004[25] and in 2008.[26] In 2014 its work with Comcast was expanded to cover all of its customer support and billing for residential services.[27]
In March 2005, co-founder Neal Hansen retired at the age of 64. Ed Nafus, prior president of the broadband services division, took his place.[28] Nafus was replaced as CEO by Peter Kalan, at the end of 2007.[29] In November 2015, it was announced that Bret Griess would be succeeding Kalan as president and CEO.[30]
As of 2016, CSG International now has 33 offices in 22 countries across the world. This does not include minor 'satellite offices'.

Products, software and services[edit]
CSG International provides software and services for managing customer data, analyzing that data, billing and customer service. For example, customer service representatives may use CSG systems to lookup a consumer's records and add a new service, or business analysts may mine customer data for trends.[10] According to the company's website, its primary product areas are revenue management, content management & monetization, and customer interaction management.[47] CSG also prints and mails billing statements to consumers and provides call-center services.[2]
Product history[edit]
CSG International originally sold two versions of its billing process outsourcing services. Under new leadership in 1994, it began developing additional software and providing consulting to in-house billing departments.[6][9] During this period it developed CSG Workforce Express, a suite of software products that manage the dispatch of technicians and other logistics at customer sites. Workforce Express consists of three applications: CSG Workforce Management, CSG TechNet and CSG TechNet CE, which integrate with CSG's databases and billing systems.[6][48] It also developed CSG Care Express, which is for creating online self-service portals for consumers to view and pay their bills online.[6][49]
In the 1990s CSG introduced the ACSR (Advanced Customer Service Representative) system.[6] An extension to ACSR called ProfitNow! was introduced in 2003. ProfitNow! used a consumer's account data to advise customer service representatives on the likelihood of a caller cancelling their service or buying a new product.[50] It was later turned into an online system with a user interface similar to Microsoft Windows at CSG.net.[6] CSG purchased the Kenan FX software from Lucent Technologies in 2002. Kenan software managed billing and ordering and provided middle-ware to help various customer service and billing products integrate with each other.[51] CSG NextGen was introduced for international markets, with support for multiple languages.[6] In March 2014, CSG added a cybersecurity suite to its product portfolio, under the name CSG Invotas.[52] The company released CSG Ascendon, a digital platform for communications service providers, in March 2015. The platform uses content monetization and delivery systems without making excessive changes to existing infrastructure.[53] In November 2015 the Invotas unit was spun off into a separate entity.[54] Invotas was acquired by FireEye in a transaction that closed February 1, 2016.[55]
Organization[edit]
CSG International has three subsidiaries: CSG Systems, CSG Systems Software and CSG Services.[6] Its subsidiaries offer products and services, while the parent company, CSG Systems International Inc. is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange.[34] As of 2015, its largest clients were Comcast, DISH and Time Warner Cable, representing 24, 14 and 12 percent of its revenues respectively. CSG spends approximately 14 percent of its revenues on research and development. Its revenues are about 77 percent from payment processing and related services, 12 percent from software and the remainder for ongoing technical support. 85 percent of revenues are from the Americas.[56][10][57]

Form 10-K
A 10-K is a comprehensive summary report of a company's performance that must be submitted annually to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Typically, the 10-K contains much more detail than the annual report. It includes information such as company history, organizational structure, equity, holdings, earnings per share, subsidiaries, etc. 

The 10-K must be filed within 60 days (it used to be 90 days) after the end of the fiscal year.
Form 10-K/A
Amended Form 10-K
Form 10-Q
The SEC form 10-Q is a comprehensive report of a company's performance that must be submitted quarterly by all public companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the 10-Q, firms are required to disclose relevant information regarding their financial position. The form must be submitted on time, and the information should be available to all interested parties. 

The 10-Q is due 35 days (it used to be 45 days) after each of the first three fiscal quarters. There is no filing after the fourth quarter because that is when the 10-K is filed.
Form 10-Q/A
Amended Form 10-Q
Form 3
A document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by an insider affiliated with a public company's operation or by any investor owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding shares

This document must be filed with the SEC no later than 10 days after an insider becomes affiliated with a company, and it must be filed for each company in which a person is an insider, regardless of whether or not the insider has an equity position in the company at that time.
Form 3/A
Amended Form 3
Form 4
A Form 4 is a document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) whenever there is a material change in the holdings of company insiders. Insiders required to submit a Form 4 include directors and officers of the company as well as any shareholders owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding stock.

This two-page document covers any buy-and-sell orders on the open market as well as the exercise of company stock options. A Form 4 is mandatory within two business days starting from the end of the day the material transaction occurred. This filing is related to Form 3 and the Form 5, which also cover changes to the company insider holdings.
Form 4/A
Amended Form 4
Form 5
The annual statement of beneficial ownership of securities.
Form 5/A
Amended Form 5
Form 8-K
An 8-K is a report of unscheduled material events or corporate changes at a company that could be of importance to the shareholders or the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Examples of events reported on an 8-K include acquisition, bankruptcy, resignation of directors, or a change in the fiscal year. Also known as Form 8k.
Form D
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required for companies that are selling securities in reliance on a Regulation D exemption or Section 4(6) exemption provisions. 

Form D is a brief notice of a company's executive officers and stock promoters, in lieu of the regular reports required when no exemption under Regulation D exists. 

Form D must be filed no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities.

Form D is also known as the Notice of Sale of Securities and is a requirement under Regulation D, Section 4(6) and/or the Uniform Limited Offering Exemption of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. 

This act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, providing essential facts, are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act - requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered and prohibiting fraud in the sale of the offered securities.
Form D/A
Amended Form D
Form DEF 14A
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that must be filed by or on behalf of a registrant when a shareholder vote is required. SEC Form DEF 14A is most commonly used in conjunction with an annual meeting proxy. The form should provide security holders with sufficient information to allow them to make an informed vote at an upcoming security holders' meeting or to authorize a proxy to vote on their behalf. It includes information about the date, time and place of the meeting of security holders; revocability of proxy; dissenter's right of appraisal; persons making the solicitation; direct or indirect interest of certain persons in matters to be acted upon; modification or exchange of securities; financial statements; voting procedures; and other details. 

All other filed by non-management definitive proxy statements - typically an annual meeting proxy.

Form DEF 14A, which is also known as "definitive proxy statement", is required under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This form is filed with the SEC when a definitive proxy statement is given to shareholders and helps the SEC ensure that shareholders' rights are upheld.
Form S-1
The SEC form S-1 is the initial registration form for new securities required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for public companies. Any security that meets the criteria must have an S-1 filing before shares can be listed on a national exchange. 

Form S-1 requires companies to provide information on the planned use of capital proceeds, detail the current business model and competition, as well provide a a brief prospectus of the planned security itself, offering price methodology, and any dilution that will occur to other listed securities. The SEC also requires the disclosure of any material business dealings between the company and its directors and outside counsel. 

Form S-1 is also known as the "Registration Statement Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933". 

Investors can view S-1 filings online to perform due diligence on new offerings prior to their issue. The form is sometimes amended as material information changes or general market conditions cause a delay in the offering. 

The Securities Exchange Act of 1933, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act, which is requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered, and to prohibit fraud in the sale of the offered securities. 

A less rigid registration form is the S-3, which is for companies that don't have the same ongoing reporting requirements.

CSG International (CSGI) is a multinational corporation headquartered in Englewood, Colorado. It provides Business Support Systems (BSS) software and services, primarily to the telecommunications industry.
CSG was founded by Neal Hansen as a division of First Data in 1982. It became an independent corporation when it was acquired by CSG Holdings in 1994 for $137 million. A contract with Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI), the largest cable TV business at the time, was influential in the company's growth from $80 million in revenue in 1994 to $171 million by 1997. CSG went public in 1996. A dispute with TCI over pricing led to a $120 million arbitration settlement in 2002 with Comcast, who acquired the TCI business. The two continued to do business together and expanded their relationship in 2014. CSG made more than ten acquisitions in the 2000s, mostly of companies that sold billing, customer service and operations software.

Corporate history[edit]
Early history[edit]
CSG International was founded in 1982 by Neal Hansen under the name Cable Services Group (CSG) as a division of the payment processing company First Data Corporation.[2] At the time First Data was operated by American Express, which acquired a controlling interest in the company in 1980.[3] CSG became a part of the American Express Information Services Company, which was formed in 1989.[4] The CSG group's first large-scale billing statement processing center, which prints and mails bills to consumers, was established in Omaha in 1990.[5]
Hansen left the Cable Services Group one year after it was founded to become CEO of Applied Communications, where he met George Haddix.[2][6] Hansen and Haddix formed CSG Holdings with Morgan Stanley and Trident Investment Group in 1994, which acquired Cable Services Group that year for $137 million.[2][7] In November 1994, Cable Services Group was renamed to CSG Systems International.[6]
CSG was the second largest billing services provider for the US cable television industry by 1994,[8][9] serving 27 percent of cable TV subscribers.[7] However, according to The International Directory of Company Histories, its profit margins were small and the company was "still in need of a turnaround."[6] Broadcasting & Cable said CSG had lost direction and become complacent. Haddix and Hansen implemented changes at the company,[2] which prompted 350 out of 500 employees to leave the firm within a few months.[6]
The new CSG International grew quickly.[5][10] The convergence of phone, internet, on-demand movies, and other services created more complex billing arrangements between telecommunications companies and consumers, which led to more extensive use of billing services providers like CSG.[10] Professional services and international clients, which were previously not a significant portion of revenues, grew to 22 percent of revenues by the mid-1990s.[5][6]
Post IPO[edit]
In order to pay off debt and raise funding for acquisitions, CSG held an initial public offering in February 1996, which valued the firm at five-fold its original acquisition price.[6][11] CSG grew from $80 million in annual revenues when it was acquired, to $132.3 million when it went public in 1996 and $171.7 million by 1997.[5]
In the 1990s, Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI) and Time Warner scrapped efforts to create internal billing software and hired CSG International.[10] The 15-year agreement CSG signed with TCI on August 11, 1997[12] made CSG the largest vendor in the industry[5] and was the primary contributor to its growth in the '90s.[12] By 2001, the deal was responsible for 45 percent of CSG's revenue.[13] As part of the deal, CSG also acquired TCI's internally developed software, SummiTrack, for $106 million.[10][12] CSG's services to TCI included billing, customer management and payment processing for TCI customers.[14] In October 1997, CSG International signed its first deal with a utilities company, mc2.[10]
At the end of 1997, CSG co-founder George Haddix retired, and former EVP Jack Pogge was appointed President and Chief Operating Officer in his place.[15] In 1999 CSG began constructing a new bill processing center in Florida in a deal with local government, which expanded roads and provided other incentives.[16] In 2002, CSG acquired the billing software interests of Lucent Technologies for $260 million.[17][18] The deal was estimated to increase CSG's revenues by 38 percent and its headcount by 65 percent.[19] 200 Lucent employees were laid off as a result of the acquisition.[17] An additional 100 - 150 CSG employees were laid off later that year in response to poor economic conditions.[20]
Recent history[edit]
AT&T acquired TCI in 2000, inheriting its agreement with CSG.[13] AT&T alleged CSG was not abiding by the contract's terms to provide favorable rates. A legal dispute between the two companies began in 2001 in arbitration court. Before the dispute was resolved, AT&T Broadband was acquired by Comcast, who wanted to use its own billing and customer service vendor. In October 2002, a judge ruled that CSG owed Comcast a $120 million refund and that it had to reduce its prices.[21][22][23] The two companies disagreed over whether the ruling would allow Comcast to halt their agreement before the end of its term.[24] CSG and Comcast reached new agreements or extensions in March 2004[25] and in 2008.[26] In 2014 its work with Comcast was expanded to cover all of its customer support and billing for residential services.[27]
In March 2005, co-founder Neal Hansen retired at the age of 64. Ed Nafus, prior president of the broadband services division, took his place.[28] Nafus was replaced as CEO by Peter Kalan, at the end of 2007.[29] In November 2015, it was announced that Bret Griess would be succeeding Kalan as president and CEO.[30]
As of 2016, CSG International now has 33 offices in 22 countries across the world. This does not include minor 'satellite offices'.

Products, software and services[edit]
CSG International provides software and services for managing customer data, analyzing that data, billing and customer service. For example, customer service representatives may use CSG systems to lookup a consumer's records and add a new service, or business analysts may mine customer data for trends.[10] According to the company's website, its primary product areas are revenue management, content management & monetization, and customer interaction management.[47] CSG also prints and mails billing statements to consumers and provides call-center services.[2]
Product history[edit]
CSG International originally sold two versions of its billing process outsourcing services. Under new leadership in 1994, it began developing additional software and providing consulting to in-house billing departments.[6][9] During this period it developed CSG Workforce Express, a suite of software products that manage the dispatch of technicians and other logistics at customer sites. Workforce Express consists of three applications: CSG Workforce Management, CSG TechNet and CSG TechNet CE, which integrate with CSG's databases and billing systems.[6][48] It also developed CSG Care Express, which is for creating online self-service portals for consumers to view and pay their bills online.[6][49]
In the 1990s CSG introduced the ACSR (Advanced Customer Service Representative) system.[6] An extension to ACSR called ProfitNow! was introduced in 2003. ProfitNow! used a consumer's account data to advise customer service representatives on the likelihood of a caller cancelling their service or buying a new product.[50] It was later turned into an online system with a user interface similar to Microsoft Windows at CSG.net.[6] CSG purchased the Kenan FX software from Lucent Technologies in 2002. Kenan software managed billing and ordering and provided middle-ware to help various customer service and billing products integrate with each other.[51] CSG NextGen was introduced for international markets, with support for multiple languages.[6] In March 2014, CSG added a cybersecurity suite to its product portfolio, under the name CSG Invotas.[52] The company released CSG Ascendon, a digital platform for communications service providers, in March 2015. The platform uses content monetization and delivery systems without making excessive changes to existing infrastructure.[53] In November 2015 the Invotas unit was spun off into a separate entity.[54] Invotas was acquired by FireEye in a transaction that closed February 1, 2016.[55]
Organization[edit]
CSG International has three subsidiaries: CSG Systems, CSG Systems Software and CSG Services.[6] Its subsidiaries offer products and services, while the parent company, CSG Systems International Inc. is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange.[34] As of 2015, its largest clients were Comcast, DISH and Time Warner Cable, representing 24, 14 and 12 percent of its revenues respectively. CSG spends approximately 14 percent of its revenues on research and development. Its revenues are about 77 percent from payment processing and related services, 12 percent from software and the remainder for ongoing technical support. 85 percent of revenues are from the Americas.[56][10][57]

CSG International (CSGI) is a multinational corporation headquartered in Englewood, Colorado. It provides Business Support Systems (BSS) software and services, primarily to the telecommunications industry.
CSG was founded by Neal Hansen as a division of First Data in 1982. It became an independent corporation when it was acquired by CSG Holdings in 1994 for $137 million. A contract with Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI), the largest cable TV business at the time, was influential in the company's growth from $80 million in revenue in 1994 to $171 million by 1997. CSG went public in 1996. A dispute with TCI over pricing led to a $120 million arbitration settlement in 2002 with Comcast, who acquired the TCI business. The two continued to do business together and expanded their relationship in 2014. CSG made more than ten acquisitions in the 2000s, mostly of companies that sold billing, customer service and operations software.

Corporate history[edit]
Early history[edit]
CSG International was founded in 1982 by Neal Hansen under the name Cable Services Group (CSG) as a division of the payment processing company First Data Corporation.[2] At the time First Data was operated by American Express, which acquired a controlling interest in the company in 1980.[3] CSG became a part of the American Express Information Services Company, which was formed in 1989.[4] The CSG group's first large-scale billing statement processing center, which prints and mails bills to consumers, was established in Omaha in 1990.[5]
Hansen left the Cable Services Group one year after it was founded to become CEO of Applied Communications, where he met George Haddix.[2][6] Hansen and Haddix formed CSG Holdings with Morgan Stanley and Trident Investment Group in 1994, which acquired Cable Services Group that year for $137 million.[2][7] In November 1994, Cable Services Group was renamed to CSG Systems International.[6]
CSG was the second largest billing services provider for the US cable television industry by 1994,[8][9] serving 27 percent of cable TV subscribers.[7] However, according to The International Directory of Company Histories, its profit margins were small and the company was "still in need of a turnaround."[6] Broadcasting & Cable said CSG had lost direction and become complacent. Haddix and Hansen implemented changes at the company,[2] which prompted 350 out of 500 employees to leave the firm within a few months.[6]
The new CSG International grew quickly.[5][10] The convergence of phone, internet, on-demand movies, and other services created more complex billing arrangements between telecommunications companies and consumers, which led to more extensive use of billing services providers like CSG.[10] Professional services and international clients, which were previously not a significant portion of revenues, grew to 22 percent of revenues by the mid-1990s.[5][6]
Post IPO[edit]
In order to pay off debt and raise funding for acquisitions, CSG held an initial public offering in February 1996, which valued the firm at five-fold its original acquisition price.[6][11] CSG grew from $80 million in annual revenues when it was acquired, to $132.3 million when it went public in 1996 and $171.7 million by 1997.[5]
In the 1990s, Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI) and Time Warner scrapped efforts to create internal billing software and hired CSG International.[10] The 15-year agreement CSG signed with TCI on August 11, 1997[12] made CSG the largest vendor in the industry[5] and was the primary contributor to its growth in the '90s.[12] By 2001, the deal was responsible for 45 percent of CSG's revenue.[13] As part of the deal, CSG also acquired TCI's internally developed software, SummiTrack, for $106 million.[10][12] CSG's services to TCI included billing, customer management and payment processing for TCI customers.[14] In October 1997, CSG International signed its first deal with a utilities company, mc2.[10]
At the end of 1997, CSG co-founder George Haddix retired, and former EVP Jack Pogge was appointed President and Chief Operating Officer in his place.[15] In 1999 CSG began constructing a new bill processing center in Florida in a deal with local government, which expanded roads and provided other incentives.[16] In 2002, CSG acquired the billing software interests of Lucent Technologies for $260 million.[17][18] The deal was estimated to increase CSG's revenues by 38 percent and its headcount by 65 percent.[19] 200 Lucent employees were laid off as a result of the acquisition.[17] An additional 100 - 150 CSG employees were laid off later that year in response to poor economic conditions.[20]
Recent history[edit]
AT&T acquired TCI in 2000, inheriting its agreement with CSG.[13] AT&T alleged CSG was not abiding by the contract's terms to provide favorable rates. A legal dispute between the two companies began in 2001 in arbitration court. Before the dispute was resolved, AT&T Broadband was acquired by Comcast, who wanted to use its own billing and customer service vendor. In October 2002, a judge ruled that CSG owed Comcast a $120 million refund and that it had to reduce its prices.[21][22][23] The two companies disagreed over whether the ruling would allow Comcast to halt their agreement before the end of its term.[24] CSG and Comcast reached new agreements or extensions in March 2004[25] and in 2008.[26] In 2014 its work with Comcast was expanded to cover all of its customer support and billing for residential services.[27]
In March 2005, co-founder Neal Hansen retired at the age of 64. Ed Nafus, prior president of the broadband services division, took his place.[28] Nafus was replaced as CEO by Peter Kalan, at the end of 2007.[29] In November 2015, it was announced that Bret Griess would be succeeding Kalan as president and CEO.[30]
As of 2016, CSG International now has 33 offices in 22 countries across the world. This does not include minor 'satellite offices'.

CSG International (CSGI) is a multinational corporation headquartered in Englewood, Colorado. It provides Business Support Systems (BSS) software and services, primarily to the telecommunications industry.
CSG was founded by Neal Hansen as a division of First Data in 1982. It became an independent corporation when it was acquired by CSG Holdings in 1994 for $137 million. A contract with Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI), the largest cable TV business at the time, was influential in the company's growth from $80 million in revenue in 1994 to $171 million by 1997. CSG went public in 1996. A dispute with TCI over pricing led to a $120 million arbitration settlement in 2002 with Comcast, who acquired the TCI business. The two continued to do business together and expanded their relationship in 2014. CSG made more than ten acquisitions in the 2000s, mostly of companies that sold billing, customer service and operations software.

Corporate history[edit]
Early history[edit]
CSG International was founded in 1982 by Neal Hansen under the name Cable Services Group (CSG) as a division of the payment processing company First Data Corporation.[2] At the time First Data was operated by American Express, which acquired a controlling interest in the company in 1980.[3] CSG became a part of the American Express Information Services Company, which was formed in 1989.[4] The CSG group's first large-scale billing statement processing center, which prints and mails bills to consumers, was established in Omaha in 1990.[5]
Hansen left the Cable Services Group one year after it was founded to become CEO of Applied Communications, where he met George Haddix.[2][6] Hansen and Haddix formed CSG Holdings with Morgan Stanley and Trident Investment Group in 1994, which acquired Cable Services Group that year for $137 million.[2][7] In November 1994, Cable Services Group was renamed to CSG Systems International.[6]
CSG was the second largest billing services provider for the US cable television industry by 1994,[8][9] serving 27 percent of cable TV subscribers.[7] However, according to The International Directory of Company Histories, its profit margins were small and the company was "still in need of a turnaround."[6] Broadcasting & Cable said CSG had lost direction and become complacent. Haddix and Hansen implemented changes at the company,[2] which prompted 350 out of 500 employees to leave the firm within a few months.[6]
The new CSG International grew quickly.[5][10] The convergence of phone, internet, on-demand movies, and other services created more complex billing arrangements between telecommunications companies and consumers, which led to more extensive use of billing services providers like CSG.[10] Professional services and international clients, which were previously not a significant portion of revenues, grew to 22 percent of revenues by the mid-1990s.[5][6]
Post IPO[edit]
In order to pay off debt and raise funding for acquisitions, CSG held an initial public offering in February 1996, which valued the firm at five-fold its original acquisition price.[6][11] CSG grew from $80 million in annual revenues when it was acquired, to $132.3 million when it went public in 1996 and $171.7 million by 1997.[5]
In the 1990s, Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI) and Time Warner scrapped efforts to create internal billing software and hired CSG International.[10] The 15-year agreement CSG signed with TCI on August 11, 1997[12] made CSG the largest vendor in the industry[5] and was the primary contributor to its growth in the '90s.[12] By 2001, the deal was responsible for 45 percent of CSG's revenue.[13] As part of the deal, CSG also acquired TCI's internally developed software, SummiTrack, for $106 million.[10][12] CSG's services to TCI included billing, customer management and payment processing for TCI customers.[14] In October 1997, CSG International signed its first deal with a utilities company, mc2.[10]
At the end of 1997, CSG co-founder George Haddix retired, and former EVP Jack Pogge was appointed President and Chief Operating Officer in his place.[15] In 1999 CSG began constructing a new bill processing center in Florida in a deal with local government, which expanded roads and provided other incentives.[16] In 2002, CSG acquired the billing software interests of Lucent Technologies for $260 million.[17][18] The deal was estimated to increase CSG's revenues by 38 percent and its headcount by 65 percent.[19] 200 Lucent employees were laid off as a result of the acquisition.[17] An additional 100 - 150 CSG employees were laid off later that year in response to poor economic conditions.[20]
Recent history[edit]
AT&T acquired TCI in 2000, inheriting its agreement with CSG.[13] AT&T alleged CSG was not abiding by the contract's terms to provide favorable rates. A legal dispute between the two companies began in 2001 in arbitration court. Before the dispute was resolved, AT&T Broadband was acquired by Comcast, who wanted to use its own billing and customer service vendor. In October 2002, a judge ruled that CSG owed Comcast a $120 million refund and that it had to reduce its prices.[21][22][23] The two companies disagreed over whether the ruling would allow Comcast to halt their agreement before the end of its term.[24] CSG and Comcast reached new agreements or extensions in March 2004[25] and in 2008.[26] In 2014 its work with Comcast was expanded to cover all of its customer support and billing for residential services.[27]
In March 2005, co-founder Neal Hansen retired at the age of 64. Ed Nafus, prior president of the broadband services division, took his place.[28] Nafus was replaced as CEO by Peter Kalan, at the end of 2007.[29] In November 2015, it was announced that Bret Griess would be succeeding Kalan as president and CEO.[30]
As of 2016, CSG International now has 33 offices in 22 countries across the world. This does not include minor 'satellite offices'.

Products, software and services[edit]
CSG International provides software and services for managing customer data, analyzing that data, billing and customer service. For example, customer service representatives may use CSG systems to lookup a consumer's records and add a new service, or business analysts may mine customer data for trends.[10] According to the company's website, its primary product areas are revenue management, content management & monetization, and customer interaction management.[47] CSG also prints and mails billing statements to consumers and provides call-center services.[2]
Product history[edit]
CSG International originally sold two versions of its billing process outsourcing services. Under new leadership in 1994, it began developing additional software and providing consulting to in-house billing departments.[6][9] During this period it developed CSG Workforce Express, a suite of software products that manage the dispatch of technicians and other logistics at customer sites. Workforce Express consists of three applications: CSG Workforce Management, CSG TechNet and CSG TechNet CE, which integrate with CSG's databases and billing systems.[6][48] It also developed CSG Care Express, which is for creating online self-service portals for consumers to view and pay their bills online.[6][49]
In the 1990s CSG introduced the ACSR (Advanced Customer Service Representative) system.[6] An extension to ACSR called ProfitNow! was introduced in 2003. ProfitNow! used a consumer's account data to advise customer service representatives on the likelihood of a caller cancelling their service or buying a new product.[50] It was later turned into an online system with a user interface similar to Microsoft Windows at CSG.net.[6] CSG purchased the Kenan FX software from Lucent Technologies in 2002. Kenan software managed billing and ordering and provided middle-ware to help various customer service and billing products integrate with each other.[51] CSG NextGen was introduced for international markets, with support for multiple languages.[6] In March 2014, CSG added a cybersecurity suite to its product portfolio, under the name CSG Invotas.[52] The company released CSG Ascendon, a digital platform for communications service providers, in March 2015. The platform uses content monetization and delivery systems without making excessive changes to existing infrastructure.[53] In November 2015 the Invotas unit was spun off into a separate entity.[54] Invotas was acquired by FireEye in a transaction that closed February 1, 2016.[55]
Organization[edit]
CSG International has three subsidiaries: CSG Systems, CSG Systems Software and CSG Services.[6] Its subsidiaries offer products and services, while the parent company, CSG Systems International Inc. is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange.[34] As of 2015, its largest clients were Comcast, DISH and Time Warner Cable, representing 24, 14 and 12 percent of its revenues respectively. CSG spends approximately 14 percent of its revenues on research and development. Its revenues are about 77 percent from payment processing and related services, 12 percent from software and the remainder for ongoing technical support. 85 percent of revenues are from the Americas.[56][10][57]

Find the answers to questions our customers ask most often, such as:








Can I purchase my own internet modem?

How do I make a payment?

What is a Digital Adapter?





A Digital Adapter is a small converter that allows viewing of digital TV services on your television. An adapter is about the size of a deck of cards.
If you connect your TV set directly from the wall with a cable wire, you will need equipment, such as a Digital Adapter, for every TV in your home.
Digital Adapters are no longer available.  Customers who have them can contact us with questions.

*Digital Adapter is a device that provides digital-quality signals. It does not provide access to our on-screen channel guide, premium channels (such as HBO®, Showtime®, Starz®, etc.), Pay-Per-View or On Demand programming as well as video features such as Start Over® or Caller ID on TV. If you are interested in these digital services, you will need to lease a Digital Set-Top Box. Some services are not available to CableCARD™ customers or customers with Digital Adapters. As a condition of service, you may be required to have equipment for every TV in your home. Not all equipment supports all services. All services may not be available in all areas.

Billing & Payments





















                    Ask TWC - Virtual Assistant

Find the answers to questions our customers ask most often, such as:

Understand your bill and payment options





We’ve designed the billing statement with you in mind. The sample bill provided is designed to explain the information contained within your monthly billing statement.










Reasons your bill may change






There are various reasons why your bill may be more (or less) than usual:






We often offer promotional pricing when you sign up for services, and that pricing is available only for a limited time (e.g. $49.99 per month for 12 months). Once a discount expires, there will be an increase to either a new promotional rate or to retail rates. Note: You’ll be notified on your bill when pricing changes.
If you’ve recently changed your service, pro-rated charges may be shown on your bill. Pro-rated charges are partial-month charges and ensure that you will be charged only for the number of days the services were used for that billing period.
If your service was just installed, you might see one-time fees included for installation or activation of services.
You or someone in your household may have purchased Pay-Per-View or On Demand programming. Please review your bill to view a list of the movies titles and live events and the date on which they were purchased.










Ways to pay your bill






You can pay your bill through a variety of options, including online through My Account or the My TWC® App, in person, by phone, by mail or via live chat on a computer.
Note: The following forms of payment are accepted regardless of how you choose to pay your bill:

Credit cards: American Express, Discover, MasterCard and Visa

Debit cards: MasterCard and Visa
 

Additional forms of eligible payment vary by option.






Making a payment online with My Account




Paying your bill online with My Account is free.
Making a one-time payment

Sign into My Account using your TWC ID (Don't have a TWC ID? Learn how to register for one.)
On the My Account tab, go to Billing.
Click Pay My Bill.
Choose One-Time for the Payment Frequency.
Select your payment method (credit card, debit card or bank account).







Watch video on how to make a one-time payment in My Account








 
Setting up a Recurring Payments Method

Sign into My Account using your TWC ID.
On the My Account tab, go to Billing.
Click Pay My Bill.
Choose Recurring for the Payment Frequency.

Select your payment method (credit card, debit card or bank account).







Watch video on how to sign up for recurring payments in My Account








 
In addition to the general forms of payment listed above, you may also pay by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) from your checking or savings account with My Account.










Making a payment with the My TWC® app




The first step is to download the My TWC® app from Google Play for your Android OS device or from the App Store for your iOS device.
Once the My TWC® app is installed:

Open and sign in to the My TWC® app with your TWC ID.
Select Pay Bill on the My Account tab.
Follow the on-screen instructions as they walk you through the process for making a one-time payment.

In addition to the general forms of payment listed above, you may also pay by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) from your checking or savings account with the My TWC® app.










Making a payment at a store location




You can make payments at any store location or designated payment center as long as it is within the same region from which the bill was generated. In other words, you cannot pay a bill for services in New York City at a Corpus Christi, Texas, store location/payment center because these are different regions.
Find a store location/payment center near you
In addition to the general forms of payment listed above , you may also pay by cash, check or money order when paying in person. Please note that a payment processing fee may apply for cash and check payments.










Making a payment by phone




Use your credit card or bank checking account to pay your bill at your convenience via phone. Tip: Have your printed bill and credit card handy.

Call 1-855-70-SPECTRUM.
Say "pay my bill" when asked why you are calling.
Follow the voice-activated prompts to complete the bill pay transaction.

Note: A fee of $5.00 is charged when an agent assists you in making a payment via phone.
In addition to the general forms of payment listed above, you may also pay by check by phone when paying by phone. Please note that a payment processing fee may apply if you reach a live agent.










Making a payment through the mail




In addition to the general forms of payment listed above, you may also pay by check or money order by mail.
Guidelines for paying by mail:

For prompt processing of your payment, mail it to the address listed on your bill and use the appropriate postage.
Include either your current billing statement in the return envelope and/or write your account number on your check or money order.
When paying by mail, we recommend that you use a check or money order, payable to Time Warner Cable. For your security, please avoid sending cash through the mail.











Making a payment via live chat




Payments made through live chat must be done from a computer. Note: Payments cannot be accepted via live chat on a smartphone or tablet at this time.
Tip: Have your printed bill and credit card or checkbook handy.

Let the chat agent know you are interested in making a payment.
The chat agent will send you a secure form through the chat.
Complete the form with the necessary payment details and click Submit to return it to the chat agent.
The chat agent will provide a confirmation number once the payment is processed.

Note: A fee of $5.00 is charged when an agent assists you in making a payment via live chat.

Nebraska Time Warner Cable Customers To Get New Theme-Based Lineup
New Digital Channel Lineup is Simpler and Easier to NavigateParental Control Settings Transition Automatically

Release Date: 05/26/2015



 Lincoln, Nebraska — Time Warner Cable (TWC) today launched a new, theme-based digital channel lineup to customers throughout TWC’s service areas in Nebraska including Lincoln effective June 2, 2015. The new lineup groups channels together intuitively, making it simpler and easier for customers to find the programming they want to view — and to discover other content.
 
  Channels are now grouped into themes like Entertainment, News & Info, Sports Music, Kids & Teens and Premiums. Likewise, On Demand content can be found on channels 1000 and above in categories like Primetime On Demand, Entertainment On Demand, Kids On Demand and Music On Demand.
“Our new, theme-based lineup makes it much simpler and easier for our customers to connect with their favorite content, on live TV and On Demand,” said Perry Watson, TWC Area Vice President of Operations. “And with the new lineup, customers with an HD box will automatically receive the HD feed of the corresponding standard-definition channel, providing the best picture available.”
 
  All parental controls will transition automatically, so customers don’t have to worry about reprogramming their parental control settings.
There is no change in channels 1-99, and no change in the channels that are part of a customer’s TWC TV package.
Customers can find out more about the new theme-based lineup at twc.com/mychannels and watch helpful videos on Time Warner Cable’s How-To On Demand channel 1999 or http://bit.ly/1zTC9ag.
 
  In addition to Lincoln, the new lineup is now available in the following TWC Nebraska service areas: Columbus, Fairbury City, Falls City, Freemont, Nebraska City, Crete, David City, Seward and York.
