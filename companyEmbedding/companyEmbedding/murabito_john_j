Direct Insite Appoints John J. Murabito Chairman of the Board of Directors

Dec 19, 2011, 17:54 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Direct Insite Corp. 











 
















































 

 




















 


SUNRISE, Fla., Dec. 19, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Direct Insite (OTC BB: DIRI), a leading provider of on-demand services for accounts payable, accounts receivable and payments automation, today announced that John J. Murabito has been appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, effective January 1, 2012.  
Mr. Murabito was elected to the Board of Directors on May 25, 2011.  Throughout his 30-year career, Mr. Murabito has held several senior executive positions in the securities industry, including Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Information Officer of U.S. broker-dealers.  Mr. Murabito served as Chief Executive Officer of Hapoalim Securities USA., Inc., and its predecessor companies, including Investec (U.S.) Inc., an affiliate of the Investec Group, an international banking group.  He also was Chief Executive Officer of subsidiaries of publicly-traded companies in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Israel, as well as Managing Director in Information Technology at the National Securities Clearing Corporation. 
Mr. Murabito replaces current Chairman of the Board, Michael Levin, who handed over his position as Chairman due to his relocation and professional commitments outside of the United States.  Mr. Levin has been a dedicated member of the Board since 2005 and will continue to serve as a director.  He was instrumental in the nomination of four new directors to the Board and served as Chairman following their election on May 25, 2011.  During his tenure, Mr. Levin helped the Company transition to a new management team, led by Matthew E. Oakes as Chief Executive Officer, and significantly expand its blue-chip roster of customers.
"Michael Levin's visionary leadership as Chairman, working closely with the Board and the Executive team to affect change and reposition the Company, has been an unqualified success.  During his term as Chairman, we worked successfully together to extend our product offerings, streamline and refine our financial and business operations, sign multiple new customer contracts, enhance the quality and frequency of communication with our shareholders, and make significant strides in providing increased shareholder value," said Mr. Oakes.
"We are proud to welcome John Murabito as Chairman of the Board of Directors.  During his time as Director, John's insights and guidance have had a significant impact on the Board of Directors and the Company's performance," said Mr. Oakes.  "John possesses a collaborative, performance-oriented leadership style, which will be very valuable as we enter this next stage of building our Company.  I look forward to working closely with John in his role as Chairman."

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"

From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."
