See your investments through a new lens


Goals first, financials second. On the
    surface, that seems obvious. But if
    you're like other wealthy individuals,
    you might be surprised at the gap
    between your goals and the wealth
    you've set aside to attain them. Having
    clearly defined goals is what anchors
    your investment decisions. Combine
    that with advice focused on achieving
    your desired outcomes, and you have
    the most complete picture of
    your wealth possible - and all the
    confidence that goes with it.




Manage your life not a benchmark
Align investment strategies to goals
Learn from a network of your peers




Answer the essential questions
This isn't about risk/return objectives - that's math. This is about identifying and articulating what you want, and how that matches (or doesn't) the wants of your family members. What's keeping you up at night may be what's keeping you from making decisions. When you're able get to the heart of what matters, you begin to understand how your answers impact your family, your community, and you.


Initiate a plan to get it done.


Your personal success is not defined
        by a portfolio or its benchmarks —
        it is defined by your ability to
        align your interests to your goals.
        We help you consider your wealth in the
        context of your life, then tether it to
        quantitative data — things like cash flow,
        assets, and liabilities. This approach brings
        organization, clarity and confidence
        to your decision-making. You know
        what success looks like because you've
        created a goals-based framework that
        structures your assets around your life.
        






Measure what's important
What you don't measure never gets done. Concise, customized, contextual reporting for each of your goals is critical to keep you on track and making the right decisions. It's the only way to make effective, impactful decisions around your wealth. Our tailored reporting aggregates your financials, and business and non-liquid assets, and aligns them to your goals — giving you the most informed view of progress towards your goals available anywhere.

SEI headquarters in Oaks, PA.


SEI Investments Company, formerly Simulated Environments Inc, is a financial services company headquartered in Oaks, Pennsylvania, United States. The company describes itself as "a global provider of investment processing, investment management, and investment operations solutions".[1] SEI provides products and services to institutions, private banks, investment advisors, investment managers, and private clients.[2] SEI manages, advises or administers $779 billion in hedge funds, private equity, mutual funds and other managed assets. This includes $297 billion in assets under management and $478 billion in client assets under administration.[1]
SEI has corporate headquarters in Oaks, Pennsylvania with offices in Toronto, London, Dublin, The Netherlands, Hong Kong, South Africa, and Dubai.[3]
History[edit]
SEI was founded as Simulated Environments Inc in 1968 by its current Chairman and CEO, Alfred P. West, Jr. (also known as Al West). West had created the first computer-simulated training technology for loan officers.[citation needed] In the 1970s SEI developed an automated trust and investment accounting system for bank trust departments. In the 1990s SEI launched a wealth management operating platform for independent, fee-based investment advisors.[citation needed]
In 2012 SEI was sued by investors in connection with the financial crimes committed by Allen Stanford. Stanford had sold investors bogus Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and the investors alleged that SEI, as well as other companies, had promoted and misrepresented the CDs as safe investments without performing appropriate due diligence.[4][5] SEI responded that it merely provided a Stanford affiliate with back office services.[6] As of September 2015 the case was still ongoing.[5]

The London Company and SEI Trust Company Launch The Master Collective Investment Trust | The London Company















































News & Events












The London Company, LLC is pleased to announce that they will sub-advise a newly created equity collective investment trust (CIT) implemented by the SEI Trust Company, a subsidiary of SEI.
A $9-trillion dollar industry according to Morningstar, collective investment trust has gained significant acceptance in the retirement industry due to its flexible investment strategies and speed to market, among other benefits. The London Company’s partnership with SEI Trust Company aims to satisfy the market’s demand by offering a daily valued CIT product call The London Company Small-Mid Equity Collective Trust.
“CITs are a simplified and low-cost investment vehicle for an increasingly sophisticated institutional market,” said Stephen Goddard, Founder and Managing Principal, The London Company. “Our partnership with the SEI Trust Company will help us efficiently cater to the market’s demand for CIT products by leveraging SEI’s proven comprehensive, and fully integrated CIT solution.”
Since its inception in 1994, The London Company has acquired $11.2 billion in assets under management ($21.2 billion in total entity assets). The SEI Trust Company serves as trustee and a 3(38) ERISA fiduciary, as well as provides accounting and administration functions for the CIT.
“The London Company’s growth potential coupled with SEI Trust Company’s expertise in CIT is an attractive proposition for retirement investor,” said John Alshefski, Senior Vice President and Managing Director of SEI’s Investment Manager Services division. “SEI’s fully scalable infrastructure enables investment managers to focus on expanding into new territory, while remaining flexible, to cater to specific investor demands in today’s more complex business environment.”

You can and are asked to step outside of your comfort zone for stretch projects. Rarely work overtime so you can say it is life and family-friendly. Opportunity to be creative in your work. Benefits are pretty good.ConsDownside is there are a lot of obstinate and not worldly employees. Haven't experienced so many difficult/rude people working in one company. Daily struggles and you constantly need to justify every suggestion you make. Expertise is not always welcomed, which make you question regularly why did you hire me then? People just want you to do projects their way and don't want you to ask questions or give suggestions for improvement or innovation. Many inexperienced employees and lack of resources.

Lots of "amenities" at the Oaks Office: Hair Cuts, Shoe Shine, Dry Cleaning, Food Truck Thursdays. Management was flexible, open to new ideas, questions, and advice. I liked my supervisor and manager while I worked there but (see below).ConsI worked for SEI through a temp agency. From all indications that I had everything was going well and they were interested in hiring me on full time. I was told 5:15 on a friday before a holiday weekend that my temporary employment assignment was ended. I was told that "I would be bored in the role and they thought I was destined for bigger things."Career Opportunities:None. I was hired looking at this as a career opportunity to move into another position. I offered innovative new ways to save time and money in my role. While in my position I gave 110%, I showed up early, stayed late. But no it really wasn't an opportunity.Compensation and Benefits$15/ hr and no benefits because I was a temp. It was a get my foot in the door opportunity to advance. I was supposed to be provided access to the education website... over 3 months and multiple request later, I never received it.Work Life Balance:They were flexible with work life balance. I had to stay home to watch my sick kid afew days while I worked there, I had no problems.Senior ManagementI have to rate them low. I was never even in a meeting with them in the 3 months while I was there. No new employee orientation or anything (again I was a temp), but I expected something.Culture & Values:Culture is great but their values are aweful as evidenced by how they let me go.Advice to Management1. If you don't intend to hire a temp employee on give some indication of this. Don't lead them to believe otherwise.2. I was "overqualified for the role" are you looking for unqualified candidates?3. Don't tell someone you're ending their employment 5:15 on Friday. You can forget about me enjoying my holiday weekend. There was no job searching that I could do...it was a weekend and a holiday. This was a pretty insensitive low move... whoever made this decision should have had the common sense to extend me courtesy to wait until after the weekend to tell me.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (3) SEI Investments Response seconds agoEdit • Delete SEI Investments 2017-05-05 10:31 PDT May 27, 2017 Helpful (3)"Stay Away, Uncontrollable Sinking Ship"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Fund Accountant in Oaks, PAFormer Employee - Fund Accountant in Oaks, PADoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookDisapproves of CEOProsNone, the disorganization alone makes it impossible to get anything done. High School like corporate culture. Everything they tell you in the pre-employment process about inclusiveness is a lie.ConsA fee based Investment Manager Services company that will ultimately fail because of lack of effective organization, talent, and inability to see the future of their industry. They use outdated tech, outdated HR, and have an inability to introspectively assess their flaws as a corporation. SEI will not be a company in 10-20 years, and I am glad I left when I did. Al West is also a selfish CEO who redeems stock options like candy and wouldnt be surprised if he just took the money and ran on this 30 year venture.

There are very few opportunities for career advancement and no career paths. When they do come up management often selects the wrong candidate for the job.
