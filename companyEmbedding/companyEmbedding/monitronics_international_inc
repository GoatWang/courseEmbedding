History[edit]
MONI was founded in Dallas in 1994 to provide alarm monitoring services to U.S. customers and businesses, as well as financing, technical training and product solutions to dealers within the industry. Investment firm ABRY Partners owned more than half of MONI[5] until it was sold to Ascent Media Corporation in December 2010.[7]
Acquisition of Security Networks[edit]
In 2013, MONI purchased Security Networks, a network of over 225 security dealers, for $507 million to diversify its service offerings and enter into the developing and complementary DIY home service category.
Acquisition of LiveWatch[edit]
To further this initiative, MONI acquired DIY home security company LiveWatch for and its ASAPer technology for $67 million in 2015. ASAPer alerts customers seconds after an alarm is triggered, allowing them to resolve the alarm from their smartphones or computers. If customers are unavailable, the MONI monitoring center dispatches police.
This combination of purchases resulted in dynamic growth for the company.[8][9] With revenues of more than $560 million, MONI has grown by 5 percent from 2015 to 2016.
In 2016, Monitronics International changed its name to MONI. Its logo, company colors and core brand pillars were changed.
Operations[edit]
MONI's national monitoring operations center is located at the headquarters office building in Farmers Branch, Texas. In 2015, the company moved into its current headquarters in the Dallas area of Texas. The new site has all departments under one roof. Previously, the organization was housed within three separate buildings.[10]
Authorized Dealer Network[edit]
There are more than 600 independent dealers in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico.[11]
MONI Partner Program[edit]
MONI has built a large partner program, including AARP, AAA, ADI, Alarm.com, Consolidated Communications, DSC, Honeywell, Icontrol Networks, Interlogix, Tri-Ed, 2-GIG, Kwikset and WAVE Electronics, keeping them at the forefront of product offerings and emerging technologies.[12][13][14]
Awards and recognition[edit]
MONI has received numerous awards for its security monitoring and solutions.
MONI has been named by SDM Magazine as a Top 100 company consistently since 2002, ranking it as one of the three largest security alarm monitoring companies in the United States.[15]
Frost & Sullivan awarded MONI the Frost & Sullivan North American Customer Value Leadership Award in Residential Security Services in 2008, 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2014,[16] recognizing operational skill and success attracting and retaining key dealer accounts.[17] It also named MONI the 2010 and 2016 Company of the Year.[18]
The company received the Consumers' Choice Award for excellence in business and customer service in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 for its alarm and sensor systems.[19]

History[edit]
MONI was founded in Dallas in 1994 to provide alarm monitoring services to U.S. customers and businesses, as well as financing, technical training and product solutions to dealers within the industry. Investment firm ABRY Partners owned more than half of MONI[5] until it was sold to Ascent Media Corporation in December 2010.[7]
Acquisition of Security Networks[edit]
In 2013, MONI purchased Security Networks, a network of over 225 security dealers, for $507 million to diversify its service offerings and enter into the developing and complementary DIY home service category.
Acquisition of LiveWatch[edit]
To further this initiative, MONI acquired DIY home security company LiveWatch for and its ASAPer technology for $67 million in 2015. ASAPer alerts customers seconds after an alarm is triggered, allowing them to resolve the alarm from their smartphones or computers. If customers are unavailable, the MONI monitoring center dispatches police.
This combination of purchases resulted in dynamic growth for the company.[8][9] With revenues of more than $560 million, MONI has grown by 5 percent from 2015 to 2016.
In 2016, Monitronics International changed its name to MONI. Its logo, company colors and core brand pillars were changed.
Operations[edit]
MONI's national monitoring operations center is located at the headquarters office building in Farmers Branch, Texas. In 2015, the company moved into its current headquarters in the Dallas area of Texas. The new site has all departments under one roof. Previously, the organization was housed within three separate buildings.[10]
Authorized Dealer Network[edit]
There are more than 600 independent dealers in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico.[11]
MONI Partner Program[edit]
MONI has built a large partner program, including AARP, AAA, ADI, Alarm.com, Consolidated Communications, DSC, Honeywell, Icontrol Networks, Interlogix, Tri-Ed, 2-GIG, Kwikset and WAVE Electronics, keeping them at the forefront of product offerings and emerging technologies.[12][13][14]
Awards and recognition[edit]
MONI has received numerous awards for its security monitoring and solutions.
MONI has been named by SDM Magazine as a Top 100 company consistently since 2002, ranking it as one of the three largest security alarm monitoring companies in the United States.[15]

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
