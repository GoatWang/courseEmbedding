CLEMENT R. HIPPLE v. THE ESTATE OF WILLIAM S. MAYER et al.

Annotate this Case






   NOT FOR PUBLICATION WITHOUT THE  APPROVAL OF THE APPELLATE DIVISION    SUPERIOR COURT OF NEW JERSEY  APPELLATE DIVISION  DOCKET NO. A-4003-05T54003-05T5      CLEMENT R. HIPPLE,    Plaintiff-Respondent/  Cross-Appellant,  v.    THE ESTATE OF WILLIAM S. MAYER  and CANDICE W. MAYER,    Defendants-Appellants/  Cross-Respondents.  ________________________________________________________________    Argued March 6, 2007 - Decided April 12, 2007    Before Judges Lisa and Holston, Jr.    On appeal from Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Gloucester County, L-1655-99.    William C. MacMillan argued the cause for appellants/cross-respondents (Igor Sturm, attorneys; Mr. MacMillan, on the brief).    Joseph F. Riga argued the cause for respondent/cross-appellant (McDowell Riga, attorneys; Mr. Riga, on the brief).    PER CURIAM    On September 20, 1999, plaintiff, Clement R. Hipple, filed a complaint against defendants, William A. Mayer and Candice W. Mayer, alleging defendants defaulted on a loan, evidenced by a promissory note, and were indebted to plaintiff in the amount of $20,000 plus interest in accordance with the terms of the note. Default judgment was entered against defendants on December 29, 1999 in the amount of $24,217.82. Plaintiff recorded the judgment as a lien on January 20, 2000.  On March 22, 2004, defendants filed a motion to vacate default judgment. A hearing on the motion to vacate default judgment was held on May 21, 2004. The trial judge in an oral decision granted defendants' motion. The decision was memorialized in an August 13, 2004 order vacating default judgment.  On September 2, 2004, defendants filed an answer and counterclaim. Plaintiff, thereafter, filed an answer to the counterclaim on June 23, 2005.  A jury trial on the complaint and counterclaim was conducted from February 6 to February 8, 2006. On February 8, 2006, the jury returned a verdict by special interrogatories. Based on the jury's verdict, the judge entered judgment in favor of plaintiff against the Estate of William S. Mayer for breach of the terms of the promissory note in the amount of $20,000 plus prejudgment interest of $18,753.98 at the rates reflected in the promissory note for a total judgment of $38,753.98. Judgment was entered in favor of plaintiff and against Candice Mayer based on a jury finding of unjust enrichment in the amount of $10,000 plus prejudgment interest at the legal rate in the amount of $2,485.14 for a total judgment of $12,485.14. Judgment was entered on the counterclaim of no cause for action.  On February 28, 2006, defendant filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or in the alternative for a new trial. The motion was denied by order dated March 17, 2006. Candice Mayer filed a notice of appeal on April 11, 2006 of the February 14, 2006 judgment entered against her. Plaintiff filed a notice of cross-appeal of the August 13, 2004 order vacating default judgment on April 27, 2006. We affirm the order vacating default judgment and reverse the judgment against Candice Mayer.  I.  In 1997, plaintiff and William Mayer started a company called Wholesale Seafood, Inc. (Wholesale Seafood), in which William Mayer controlled the daily operations, and plaintiff was the sole owner and shareholder. William Mayer was experienced in the seafood business, and plaintiff owned a janitorial business, which he continued to operate along with Wholesale Seafood. Wholesale Seafood also employed other sales persons, including Ralph Natale and Daniel Daidone, who, according to a certification signed by William Mayer, are members of the South Philadelphia and New Jersey mafia. Wholesale Seafood has since gone out of business.  According to plaintiff, he loaned William Mayer money on several occasions, in amounts ranging from $200 to $20,000. In December 1997, plaintiff testified that he wire transferred $25,000, payable to William Mayer, to defendants' joint bank account, $5,000 of which was for a Christmas bonus. The first transfer was made on December 1, 1997, for $15,000 and the second transfer was made on December 18, 1997, for $10,000. Both transfers were made from the bank account of plaintiff's company, J.C. Consulting and Leasing Corporation, located in the Grand Cayman Islands. Plaintiff explained that he opened the account for "investment purposes."  At trial, plaintiff testified that he prepared a promissory note memorializing the $20,000 loan, which was signed by William Mayer on January 7, 1998. He further testified that he prepared a second document, referred to as an "Addendum Personal Security Note," which he contended was signed by both defendants and notarized before a notary public on January 7, 1998.  Plaintiff testified he never spoke to Candice Mayer concerning any of the alleged loans he made to William Mayer or concerning the signing by her of a promissory note and mortgage. Plaintiff never asked Candice Mayer to guarantee any loan to William Mayer. Candice Mayer testified she never asked to borrow any money from plaintiff or J.C. Consulting and Leasing Corporation. She never told plaintiff that she would sign a promissory note, or mortgage or any other loan document from plaintiff to her husband. Candice Mayer further stated that she has never spoken to plaintiff, except briefly at a few social functions.  After the two wire transfers were made, plaintiff testified he requested William Mayer to ask Candice Mayer to guarantee the payment of $20,000 of the $25,000 in wire transfers and that he prepared a second note for William and Candice Mayers' signatures to provide him security for the loans he made to William Mayer.  Candice Mayer testified that she never signed the second note captioned "Addendum Personal Security Note" nor did she give her husband or anyone else permission to sign her name to the note. According to the certification of William Mayer, which was read to the jury, he forged his wife's signature on the note as a result of being threatened with bodily harm by an agent of plaintiff if he failed to obtain his wife's signature on the note and mortgage. Candice Mayer was unaware at the time the Addendum Personal Security Note was signed by William Mayer that her husband had signed her name to that document.  Michele Devery, a notary public, who plaintiff contended notarized the signatures of both William and Candice Mayer on the addendum in January 1998, testified that while working at PNC Bank she notarized the security agreement. She stated that defendants signed the agreement while in her presence. However, when the court asked Devery if she recognized Candice Mayer as the woman who came into the bank and signed the document, Devery responded, "I couldn't tell you."  The promissory note, which was admitted into evidence, was dated September 1, 1997. However, it was signed on January 7, 1998. The note reflects that the first payment was to be made on October 1, 1997. During cross-examination, plaintiff explained that the note pre-dated the December 1997 loans because the promissory note was originally drafted for a previous $10,000 loan that was paid by William Mayer prior to his signing of the note. Plaintiff stated that he used the old note and handwrote the changes for the subsequent $20,000 loan.  On December 16, 1997, a payment in the amount of $10,000 was made to plaintiff by a check signed by William Mayer. Plaintiff testified that the $10,000 was for repayment of a September 1997 loan and not the $20,  000 December 1997 loan.  Peter Meltzer testified that he assisted plaintiff in attempting to collect the $20,000 debt owed by William Mayer. Meltzer stated that he discussed the note and its payment with William Mayer, who never asserted any defenses against the collection of the debt. He also testified he never discussed with William Mayer the signatures on the note. On cross-examination, Meltzer stated that he had no notations from any conversations he had with William Mayer concerning his debt collection efforts. Plaintiff's counsel introduced a debt collection letter from Meltzer, dated August 23, 1999, addressed to William and Candice Mayer, which demands the payment of the loan. Candice Mayer denied receiving this letter.  Joseph Riga, plaintiff's attorney, also testified as to his efforts in collecting the debt from defendants. Riga testified that he filed the initial lawsuit in September 1999 as an attempt to collect the $20,000 debt. He stated that William Mayer never asserted any defenses against the collection of the debt. During cross-examination, Riga testified that in December 2003, once execution efforts against the defendants' home were commenced, Candice Mayer contacted him explaining that her purported signature on the security agreement was not her signature. He stated that she implied her signature on the security agreement was a forgery.  Candice Mayer submitted exemplars of her actual signature on various official documents. Candice Mayer admitted that $25,000 in two checks was deposited into the Mayers' joint checking account in December 1997. She testified that when she became aware of the transfers her husband explained that it was his Christmas bonus from plaintiff. Immediately, after the funds were deposited, Candice Mayer began writing checks to pay various credit card bills. However, a few days later, she was informed by her husband that the money was not a Christmas bonus and that plaintiff was upset that defendants were spending the money. William Mayer then wrote a check for $10,000 to plaintiff from the wire transfer money. Five or six days later he wrote a second check for $10,000, but the check bounced. She testified that she spent approximately $5,000 of the wire transfer money for household expenses. She believed the $5,000 was her husband's Christmas bonus.  Candice Mayer also testified that her husband told her he signed the promissory note. However, she never signed it. She also denied that she appeared before Devery to have her signature notarized. She stated that she only knew Devery because Devery's husband was an employee of Wholesale Seafood. She also stated that she refused to sign the $20,000 note when asked by her husband to sign it, because plaintiff had already been paid a check for $10,000.  At the close of defendants' case, the trial judge ruled that those paragraphs of William Mayer's certification that complied with N.J.R.E. 803(b)(4) and 804(b)(6) would be permitted to be read to the jury by defense counsel. Defense counsel read the following redacted certification:  I, William Mayer, do hereby certify as follows. Then, I had inadvertently become indebted to Clement R. Hipple in the amount of $15,000.    The way that happened was that Wholesale Seafood, Inc., had initially been profitable and had just completed the successful Christmas and New Years. Most of the key employees at Wholesale Seafood, Inc., had received cash bonuses.    I did not receive a cash bonus. However, plaintiff, Hipple did state to me that he was very happy with the job I was doing for the company and that he would see to it that I was quote, 'taken care of', end quote, or words to that effect.    Shortly thereafter plaintiff Hipple wired the sum of $15,000 into my bank account from an account which he had, I believe, in the Cayman Islands. . . .    Based upon the cash bonuses which the other employees had received and my previous discussions with plaintiff, Hipple, I assumed that the money was my overdue Christmas bonus.    I quickly spent the money only to find out a very short time later that plaintiff, Hipple, was using my account to send money to himself in order to avoid banking regulations and the Internal Revenue Service scrutiny.    When plaintiff, Hipple, asked about the money he was -- he wired to my account I explained to him that I had assumed it was my Christmas bonus and that I had spent most of it.    Plaintiff, Hipple, was not very happy that I had spent a lot of the money that he had wired into my account. . . .    Eventually at some point plaintiff, Hipple, sent Ralph Natale's driver, Anthony Vesta, to see me.    . . . .    Ralph Natale was an employee of Wholesale Seafood. Therefore, at the insistence of Ralph Natale's driver, that would be Anthony Vesta, at the behest of plaintiff, Hipple, I agreed to sign a promissory note in the amount of $20,000 for the 15,000 which I had quote, 'borrowed from the plaintiff, Hipple'.    Ralph Natale's driver, Anthony Vesta, also indicated that plaintiff, Hipple, was insisting that my wife and I sign a mortgage on our home to secure the note. . . .    I subsequently met Ralph Natale's driver at the Denny's Restaurant where I signed the promissory note and mortgage. My wife, defendant Candice Mayer, was supposed to be there also, but she was not.    I told Ralph Natale's driver that she had refused to sign the mortgage. Actually, I had not told my wife the extent of my problems and about the danger that I thought it was -- that I was in because I did not want her to worry about me.    . . . .    When I told Ralph Natale's driver, that was Anthony Vesta, that my wife had refused to sign the mortgage he initially became very angry. Then he calmed down and seemed as if he were concerned for me.    He explained to me that he was looking out for me and trying to keep Hipple from turning in -- this into a quote, 'mob situation', end quote.    He explained to me that if my wife would not sign the mortgage I would have to sign her name in order that he could report back to Hipple that everything has been taken care of.    Initially I refused to sign my wife's name. However, when Ralph Natale's driver told me that if I were lucky they would just break my legs, I agreed to sign my . . . wife's name to the mortgage.    All right. On more than one occasion plaintiff, Hipple, sent me to meet with Ralph Natale at restaurant and this restaurant and that and I should call the people he had spoken with and arrange for delivery of seafood.    Sometime after Wholesale Seafood, Inc., closed, and after I had signed the $20,000 promissory note and mortgage, plaintiff, Hipple, stated to me that there was money missing from the business and that he thought that I was responsible.    In response to that I told Hipple that I never handled the money at any time and that if there was, in fact, money missing that he should take -- he should take a look at the people who handled the money at Wholesale Seafood, Inc. Those persons included Greg Johnson.    Plaintiff, Hipple, continued to accuse me of stealing money from Wholesale Seafood, Inc. Eventually plaintiff, Hipple, offered me a simple choice. I could either sign a promissory note in the amount of $65,000, which amount was to include the debt on the previous promissory note which Hipple had obtained, or I could have this turned into a quote 'mob situation', end quote.    I chose to sign the note rather than assume the risk that plaintiff would make good on his threat.    As respects the addendum, defense counsel read the following from William Mayer's certification:  In the document entitled 'Addendum Personal Security Note', which document, as I understand it and as it was intended by the plaintiff, is a mortgage on 41 Spring Mill Drive, Sewell, New Jersey, 08080.    The 41 Spring Mill Drive, Sewell, New Jersey, property is my residence and home, which I own together with my wife, defendant Candice Mayer.    As set forth hereinabove after signing the $20,000 note I was not able to make payments on it and plaintiff brought suit against me and my wife. Thereafter I paid the plaintiff the total of $18,250 toward the debt, and that's all.    The jury was charged as to each defendant separately. As to the Estate of William Mayer, the jury was asked whether William Mayer was liable to plaintiff on the loan and in what amount. As to Candice Mayer, the jury was asked whether she was liable on the $20,000 loan and if so in what amount. If the jury found she were not liable on the loan, the jury was asked whether Candice Mayer ratified the personal security note and in what amount, or in the alternative, whether she was unjustly enriched when she received the wire transfer sums in December 1997. Finally, the jury was instructed as to defendants' counterclaim for $13,250.  The questions of ratification and unjust enrichment were submitted to the jury as a result of the court granting plaintiff's motion at the end of all the evidence to amend the complaint to conform to the evidence by adding a claim for unjust enrichment. The court granted the amendment as to Candice Mayer over defendant's objection.  On February 8, 2006, the jury returned its verdict. The jury found that the Estate of William Mayer was liable to plaintiff for the original $20,000 loan, but that Candice Mayer was not liable on the loan. The jury, however, found that she ratified the loan, but no amount was awarded to plaintiff on this claim. However, the jury found unjust enrichment as to Candice Mayer and awarded plaintiff $10,000 as damages against her. Defendants' counterclaim was rejected by the jury.  Candice Mayer presents the following arguments for our consideration:      POINT I.  THE JURY RETURNED AN UNSUPPORTED INCONSISTENT AND UNSUSTAINABLE VERDICT WITH RESPECT TO DEFENDANT CANDICE MAYER.    A. THE TRIAL COURT SHOULD NOT HAVE PERMITTED AN AMENDMENT TO THE COMPLAINT TO ASSERT A CLAIM FOR UNJUST ENRICHMENT AND PLAINTIFF FAILED TO MAKE OUT A PRIMA FACIE CASE FOR THAT CLAIM AND IT SHOULD NOT HAVE GONE TO THE JURY.    B. THE VERDICT AGAINST DEFENDANT, WILLIAM MAYER ON THE CONTRACT CLAIM REQUIRES THAT JUDGMENT AGAINST DEFENDANT CANDICE MAYER ON THE CLAIM FOR UNJUST ENRICHMENT BE REVERSED.    Plaintiff presents the following argument for our consideration:  THE TRIAL COURT SHOULD NOT HAVE VACATED HIPPLE'S 1999 JUDGMENT NEARLY FOUR AND ONE-HALF YEARS LATER.    II.  We will first address the issue raised by plaintiff on his cross-appeal. Plaintiff contends the trial court erred in vacating the 1999 default judgment entered against both defendants. Although defendants' March 22, 2004 motion to vacate default judgment did not refer to any specific subsection of Rule 4:50-1, the oral argument advanced by defendants' counsel suggested his application was brought under subsection "(c) fraud (whether . . . intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party." Defendants' motion was filed March 22, 2004, nearly four and one-half years after default judgment was entered on December 29, 1999 and served on defendants on January 3, 2000. Plaintiff contends the motion brought under subsection (c) of Rule 4:50-1 was time barred by Rule 4:50-2 because it was brought more than one year after the judgment was entered. Plaintiff claims the trial court lacked the discretion to modify or ignore the specific time limitation set forth in Rule 4:50-2.  Defendants' counsel filed the detailed certification of William Mayer, which we have recited in this opinion, in support of defendants' motion to vacate default judgment against them. Additionally, the judge heard testimony from William Mayer in support of the motion. William Mayer asserted that the note upon which plaintiff obtained default judgment was obtained by extortion, i.e., he was coerced by a threat of physical violence directed against him from an agent of plaintiff, with ties to the mafia, into signing the note sued upon by plaintiff and in forging his wife's signature on the addendum note. See  N.J.S.A. 2C:20-5. Only the jailing of the agent of plaintiff who extorted his signature and his forgery of his wife's signature and plaintiff's obtaining of a writ of execution on defendants' home caused defendants belatedly to move to vacate default judgment.  The judge, without reference to a specific subsection of Rule 4:50-1, implicitly determined that defendants had shown excusable neglect and a potential meritorious defense and granted defendants' motion to vacate for reasons of "justice," conditioned on defendants' payment of a $2,500 counsel fee to plaintiff's counsel.  We are convinced from our review of the record that the judge construed defendants' motion as being brought under Rule 4:50-1(f), any other reason justifying relief from the . . . judgment, based on a finding of "exceptional circumstances" or under Rule 4:50-3, based upon a finding of fraud on the court. The judge specifically required the testimony of William Mayer as "back ground information" as to why [defendants] "think there's been a fraud created on the court[.]" The court in granting defendants' motion, rhetorically asked, "[w]hy wouldn't I allow him to reopen, if the alleged [constitutes a] meritorious defense. He's alleging he was threatened, . . . your saying that your signature was forged. . . . The issue here is under [Rule] 4:50-1 to do justice as I recollect that rule . . . I view that there is potentially meritorious defense . . . and in the interest of justice, that is how I see justice."  Although Rule 4:50-2 provides that a motion to set aside a judgment for reasons of "exceptional circumstances" under Rule 4:50-1(f) must be made within a "reasonable time," there is no time limit imposed by Rule 4:50-3 upon the power of a court to set aside a judgment for "fraud upon the court." See Tara Enters., Inc. v. Daribar Mgmt. Corp.,  369 N.J. Super. 45, 52 (App. Div. 2004); Hyland v. Kirkman,  157 N.J. Super. 565, 583-84 (Ch. Div. 1978).  An application to vacate a default judgment is "viewed with great liberality, and every reasonable ground for indulgence is tolerated to the end that a just result is reached." Marder v. Realty Constr. Co.,  84 N.J. Super. 313, 319 (App. Div.), aff'd,  43 N.J. 508 (1964); see also Rule 4:50-1. "Nevertheless a default judgment will not be disturbed unless the failure to answer or otherwise appear and defend was excusable under the circumstances and unless the defendant has a meritorious defense; either to the cause of action itself, or, if liability is not disputed, to the quantum of damages assessed." Pressler, Current N.J. Court Rules, comment 4.1 on R. 4:50-1 (2007). In Marder, supra, 84 N.J. Super. at 319, we held that "a reopening of the judgment for purposes of assessing damages is proper where the defendant provides a reasonable assertion to the effect that it is not liable for the amount of damages claimed by the plaintiff."  In this case, defendants' motion was filed to vacate a default judgment that was entered on December 29, 1999. The trial court granted defendants' motion pursuant to Rule 4:50-1. We review the trial court's granting of a motion to vacate default judgment on abuse of discretion grounds. We are satisfied, based on the reasons set forth by the judge on the record, that the court's decision was in accord with Marder, supra, 84 N.J. Super. at 319, and the court's broad discretion to grant relief under Rule 4:50-1. The judge was concerned with Candice Mayer's rights due to the testimony by William Mayer that he "was forced to forge [his] wife's signature." The judge explained, "I'm more concerned about the misses' rights. . . . I have no idea . . . whether he did or didn't forge her signature. That will have to be established by a [bona fide] process."  We are convinced that the certification of William Mayer in support of defendants' motion to vacate default judgment, which contained allegations of extortion to obtain signatures on a note, if true and if known to plaintiff when the default judgment was obtained, would qualify as constituting a fraud on the court. The assertions contained in William Mayer's certification would likewise support relief from the judgment under Rule 4:50-1(f). That subsection provides for relief in exceptional circumstances, "[a]nd in such exceptional cases its boundaries are as expansive as the need to achieve equity and justice." Court Invest. Co. v. Perillo,  48 N.J. 334, 341 (1966). We are satisfied, given the certification before the court, that the judge based upon his broad power in the exercise of discretion properly permitted the vacation of default judgment notwithstanding the defendant's four and one-half year delay in seeking relief from the judgment.  III.  Candice Mayer asserts that the trial court erred when it granted plaintiff's motion, made at the conclusion of all the evidence, to amend the pleadings to conform with the evidence by adding a count of unjust enrichment against her. Defendant acknowledges that a claim for unjust enrichment against Candice Mayer was not alleged in his complaint. He contends, however, that such a claim was not originally pleaded because Candice Mayer never disavowed her signature on the note or her obligation on the loan until several years after the collection suit was filed. Once Candice Mayer advanced her claim of forgery, her benefit from the use of the loan proceeds became an issue in the case.  A motion for leave to amend to conform to the evidence is to be liberally construed. R. 4:9-2. "It is generally a matter left to the trial judge's sound discretion in the interests of justice." New Mea Constr. Corp. v. Harper,  203 N.J. Super. 486, 492 (App. Div. 1985).  Our review of the record convinces us, however, that the court mistakenly exercised its discretion when it submitted the claim of unjust enrichment to the jury, because plaintiff failed to make out a prima facie case in support of the claim. One of the elements that a plaintiff must prove to make out a claim for unjust enrichment is that the "plaintiff expected remuneration from the defendant at the time plaintiff performed or conferred a benefit on defendant." VRG Corp. v. GKN Realty Corp.,  135 N.J. 539, 554 (1994). Additionally, "[t]he doctrine of unjust enrichment rests on the equitable principle that a person shall not be allowed to enrich himself unjustly at the expense of another." Associates Commercial Corp. v. Wallia,  211 N.J. Super. 231, 243 (App. Div. 1986). "To recover under this doctrine plaintiff must prove that the defendant 'received a benefit and that retention of that benefit without payment therefor would be unjust.'" Ibid. (quoting Callano v. Oakwood Park Homes Corp.,  91 N.J. Super. 105, 109 (App. Div. 1966)). A common thread running through the successful invocation of a claim of unjust enrichment is "that the plaintiff expected remuneration from the defendant, or if the true facts were known to plaintiff, he would have expected remuneration from defendant at the time the benefit was conferred." Id. at 244 (quoting Callano, supra, 91 N.J. Super. at 109).  There was no evidence adduced at the trial that would support a contention by plaintiff that he expected Candice Mayer to repay or guarantee the loan at the time it was made. Plaintiff did not testify that at the time of either wire transfer he expected Candice Mayer to repay or guarantee repayment of the loan. Indeed, the wire transfer was to the order of William Mayer alone. Nor is there any testimony or documentary evidence that would support such a contention. The wire transfers took place on December 1, 1997 and December 18, 1997. The promissory note that evidences the loan was not signed until January 7, 1998. The "Addendum Personal Security Note" was "signed" on the same date. According to the testimony of plaintiff, he did not give the promissory note and "Addendum Personal Security Note" to William Mayer until after the wire transfers. Thus, the very first time that the issue of Candice Mayer being responsible for repayment of, or guaranteeing, the loan was raised was after the loan had been made.  Moreover, even if plaintiff had testified that, at the time of the wire transfers, he had an expectation of Candice Mayer becoming obligated on the loan or guaranteeing it, the facts simply would not support any such expectation. The loan documents clearly show that any loan was made to William Mayer alone. By plaintiff's own account, William Mayer requested the alleged loan. By plaintiff's own testimony and the express terms of the "Addendum Personal Security Note," it was intended to secure the loan to William Mayer by creating a lien upon the home of the defendants. It is undisputed that Candice Mayer never asked to borrow any money from plaintiff or J.C. Consulting and Leasing Corporation. Nor did plaintiff ever ask Candice Mayer to guarantee any loans to her husband. Candice Mayer never told plaintiff that she would guarantee any loans made to her husband. There was no testimony that William Mayer ever told plaintiff that Candice Mayer had agreed to become obligated on, or to guarantee the loan either prior to or at the time it was made.  Since plaintiff never spoke to Candice Mayer concerning the alleged loan and since William Mayer had never represented to plaintiff that he had spoken to his wife about the alleged loan, plaintiff could not have had any expectation concerning the willingness of Candice Mayer to become obligated on, or to guarantee, the loan unless and until such time as she actually signed the Addendum Personal Security Note.  Another element that plaintiff was required to prove with respect to his claim of unjust enrichment was that Candice Mayer actually received a benefit and that retention of that benefit without payment would be unjust. VRG Corp., supra, 135 N.J. at 554. Those elements are largely indistinguishable from the question of to whom the loan was made. Since the undisputed evidence shows that the loan was made only to William Mayer, only William Mayer received the "benefit" of that loan. The fact that Candice Mayer had access to the defendants' joint checking account and spent some of the proceeds of the loan to reduce household credit card debt is not evidence that Candice Mayer was unjustly enriched. If plaintiff had known that Candice Mayer neither signed the note, nor authorized her signature, and that she had no knowledge of the forgery of her signature, he would not have expected remuneration from her when he made the loan to William Mayer via wire transfers payable to William Mayer.  Plaintiff's argument focuses upon the proceeds of the loan as opposed to the loan itself. However, even when the unjust enrichment claim is analyzed from this perspective, it is clear that there is no competent evidence that Candice Mayer was unjustly enriched. According to the testimony of plaintiff, the two wire transfers totaling $25,000 constituted a $20,000 loan to William Mayer with the remaining $5,000 being a Christmas bonus for William Mayer. On December 16, 1997, William Mayer paid back to plaintiff $10,000 of the $15,000 that plaintiff had just wired to him on December 1, 1997. According to plaintiff, the $10,000 payment represented the repayment of a previous loan that he had made to William Mayer in September 1997. Plaintiff testified: William Mayer was ". . . paying me back with my own money." Since the alleged September loan of $10,000 was only to William Mayer, no claim of unjust enrichment against Candice Mayer could attach to that $10,000. That left only a balance of $10,000 to which a claim of unjust enrichment could theoretically be asserted.  Candice Mayer testified that she continued to use the joint account after the proceeds of the loan were deposited into their joint account. She stated that she wrote checks totaling approximately $5,000 from the proceeds of the wire transfers. None of the checks that she wrote from the proceeds of the wire transfers were offered or admitted into evidence. Candice Mayer was never asked to identify who the payees were on any of the checks that she wrote. She was not asked if the checks represented payments of her debts, the debts of William Mayer, or joint debts. They were simply identified as household debts.  The doctrine of unjust enrichment requires plaintiff to prove that Candice Mayer received a benefit to which she was not entitled. Therefore, it was the burden of plaintiff to prove that a portion of the loan proceeds were used to pay obligations of Candice Mayer. She may well have written checks totaling approximately $5,000 to pay joint credit card debt, or to pay obligations of William Mayer. Whose obligations were satisfied by the checks written by Candice Mayer from the proceeds of the wire transfers simply cannot be determined based upon the evidence. Thus, plaintiff failed to meet his burden of proof.  We are convinced that accepting all of the testimony and evidence submitted by plaintiff, in the light most favorable to plaintiff, that the evidence adduced, did not support the submission to the jury of the doctrine of unjust enrichment. Plaintiff could not have expected, based on these facts, remuneration from the defendant. Any mistake by plaintiff as to the validity of the purported signature of Candice Mayer on the addendum note did not result from any action of Candice Mayer as she had no expectation that there was reliance by plaintiff on her signature when, in fact, it had been forged by her husband without her knowledge. The fact that loan proceeds are deposited into a joint checking account on which both spouses customarily write checks does not in and of itself in our view support a finding that the innocent spouse was unjustly enriched if the spouse does not fulfill an obligation that he or she knew nothing about. Because we are convinced that the elements necessary to support a claim for unjust enrichment were not supported by substantial credible evidence in the record, we reverse the judgment against Candice Mayer. Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investor's Ins. Co. of Am.,  65 N.J. 474, 483-84 (1974). Reversed on the appeal; affirmed on the cross-appeal.                William Mayer died prior to the start of trial. The pleadings were amended to the Estate of William S. Mayer.        (continued)    (continued)                  26  A-4003-05T5              April 12, 2007

William Innell Clement


Famous Person


William Innell Clement was an English newspaper proprietor. Though details of Clement's early years are unknown, it is likely that he was born in London. Starting as a newsagent at a young age, he soon became one of the leading vendors in London. In 1814, Clement moved into the newspaper publishing business by purchasing The Observer, at that time a comparatively obscure Sunday paper.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
