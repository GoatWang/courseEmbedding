Unless we specify otherwise in any prospectus supplement, we will use the
net proceeds (after the payment of offering expenses and underwriting discounts
and commissions) from our sale of securities for general corporate purposes,
which may include, among other things:

• paying or refinancing all or a portion of our indebtedness outstanding at the
  time; and

• funding working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions (which may
  consist of acquisitions of discrete assets or businesses).

The actual application of proceeds from the sale of any particular offering of
securities using this prospectus will be described in the applicable prospectus
supplement relating to such offering. The precise amount and timing of the 
application of these proceeds will depend upon our funding requirements and the
availability and cost of other funds.


The coal industry is highly competitive. We compete with other coal producers,
with traders and re-sellers of coal and with other energy producers throughout
the U.S. and, for our export sales, internationally. The most important factors
on which we compete with other coal producers and with traders and re-sellers of
coal are coal price, coal quality and characteristics, costs to transport the
coal, customer service and the reliability of supply. Demand for coal and the
prices that we will be able to obtain for our coal are closely linked to coal
consumption patterns of the domestic and foreign electric generation industries.
These coal consumption patterns are influenced by factors beyond our control,
including weather and economic conditions, the supply and demand for domestic
and foreign electricity, domestic and foreign governmental regulations and 
taxes, environmental and other regulatory changes, global climate change 
initiatives, technological developments, the price and availability of other 
fuels, such as natural gas and crude oil, the availability of subsidies, and
renewable mandates designed to encourage greater use of alternative energy 
sources, including hydroelectric, nuclear, wind and solar power, and currency
exchange rate fluctuations, all of which can decrease demand for thermal coal or
may decrease demand for PRB coal compared to other global coal basins.

Because most of the coal in the vicinity of our mines is owned by the U.S.
federal government, we compete with other coal producers operating in the PRB
for additional coal through the LBA process. This process is competitive and we
expect the competition for LBAs to remain strong.


Company Description
We are one of the largest producers of coal in the United States of America
("U.S.") and the Powder River Basin ("PRB"), based on our 2015 coal sales. We
operate some of the safest mines in the coal industry. According to the most
current Mine Safety and Health Administration ("MSHA") data, we have


 one of the
lowest employee all injury incident rates among the largest U.S. coal producing
companies. We currently operate solely in the PRB, the lowest cost region of the
major coal producing regions in the U.S., where we own and operate three surface
coal mines, the Antelope Mine, the Cordero Rojo Mine and the Spring Creek Mine.
We also have two major development projects, the Youngs Creek project and the
Crow project. Our Antelope and Cordero Rojo mines are located in Wyoming, and
our Spring Creek Mine is located in Montana. Our mines produce subbituminous
thermal coal with low sulfur content, and we sell our coal primarily to domestic
electric utilities. Thermal coal is primarily consumed by electric utilities and
industrial consumers as fuel for electricity generation. In 2015, the coal we
produced generated approximately 3% of the electricity produced in the U.S. We
do not produce any metallurgical coal. As of December 31, 2015, we controlled
approximately 1.1 billion tons of proven and probable reserves.
