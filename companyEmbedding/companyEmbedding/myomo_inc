Myomo, Inc. is a medical robotics company that offers expanded mobility for those suffering from neurological disorders and upper-limb paralysis. Based on patented technology developed at MIT, Harvard Medical School and by the Company, Myomo develops and markets the MyoPro® product line of lightweight, non-invasive, powered arm braces (orthoses) to restore function in the paralyzed or weakened arms and hands of individuals that have suffered a stroke, spinal cord or nerve injury such as brachial plexus injury, or other neuro-muscular disability such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or multiple sclerosis (MS).  It is the only device that, sensing a patient’s own neurological signals through non-invasive sensors on the arm, can restore their ability to use their arms and hands so that they can return to work, live independently and reduce their cost of care.  Published clinical research shows a clinically significant instantaneous reduction in upper extremity impairment through use of MyoPro.  MyoPro is referred for patients at leading rehabilitation facilities, including Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, Massachusetts General Hospital, Kennedy Krieger Institute, Loma Linda Medical Center and twenty VA hospitals, among others.  It is fitted and delivered through a nationwide network of orthotics and prosthetics practices, and over 600 have been used by patients.  Myomo is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with sales and clinical professionals across the U.S.

What is a MyoPro Orthosis? | Myomo


































































Partner Resource Center Connect with Us  


















 














What is a MyoPro Orthosis?





The MyoPro is a myoelectric elbow/wrist/hand orthosis (powered brace) that supports an impaired hand and arm while also enabling it to move again. Individuals use their own muscle signals to control movements of a paretic or weakened arm. When the user tries to bend their arm or open and close their hand, precision sensors in the brace detect the weak muscle signals which activates motors to move the hand and arm in the desired directions. The user is completely controlling their own hand and arm; the brace amplifies their weak muscle signal to help move the limb.
MyoPro is the only product of its kind for people who suffer from debilitating neurological disorders such as brachial plexus injury, spinal or brain cord injury, CVA stroke, multiple sclerosis or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).  It is recommended by top hospitals and is delivered through a growing network of established Orthotics & Prosthetics (O&P) professionals, with whom Myomo is working to make MyoPro the standard of care.

Process for getting a MyoPro | Myomo

Process for Getting a MyoPro


 
 






Evaluation
The MyoPro brace is ordered by physicians and provided solely by Orthotics & Prosthetics (O&P) professionals, who have been trained and qualified by Myomo Inc.  to evaluate, mold and fit the MyoPro. To find qualified providers near you, please contact us.
During the evaluation session, the Orthotist/Prosthetist will:

Discuss and demonstrate the MyoPro brace and provide education regarding aspects of use
Ensure the MyoPro is clinically and medically appropriate for the candidate by testing upper limb muscle strength and range of motion. Other assessment areas include EMG (electromyographic) signal strength in relevant muscle groups, upper limb sensation, pain levels and anatomical measurements
Discuss insurance benefits, coverage and potential cost. The MyoPro-certified O&P provider will work with you to see if your device will be reimbursed by your health insurance plan.  Many payers have covered the cost of the MyoPro, including national and regional health plans, worker's compensation for job-related injuries, and the VA for qualified veterans.
Discuss the role and importance of occupational/physical therapy for new MyoPro users
Complete all necessary evaluation paperwork

Myomo Inc. offers 3 models of the MyoPro myoelectric orthosis (Motion G, Motion W, Motion E). During the evaluation session, the clinician and the candidate will discuss the following options and determine the most beneficial model. Note the MyoPro orthosis may not be suitable for all candidates.
Molding
Each MyoPro brace is custom fitted to each patient for optimum performance.  During the fitting process a plaster molding of the patient's arm will be taken. This mold is sent off to a central fabrication facility for custom MyoPro construction.  The individual being fitted may be presented with a variety of MyoPro colors and patterns to choose from.
Fabrication
Custom fabrication typically takes 2-4 weeks. Once the MyoPro is received by the O&P practice, the patient will be brought back for a fitting.
Fitting
During this fitting, the device will be calibrated to the user's individual muscle signal profile and minor adjustments to the MyoPro can be made to optimize comfort.
Therapy and Training
When people learn a new skill such as riding a bike or playing an instrument, it takes practice, patience and dedication. The same is true for learning how to operate and use the MyoPro to complete functional tasks. It takes a new user - on average - several weeks to master his/her MyoPro, although this varies from person to person.
It is recommended that all new MyoPro users attend Occupational or Physical therapy to develop proficiency and independence with their MyoPro. Once a therapist is trained on the MyoPro system, they can assist the user by developing a customized treatment plan that will maximize their functionality and overall success. Therapy with a MyoPro can include functional task practice, improving muscle control and coordination, learning how to don/doff the MyoPro and how to care for it at home.
To discuss whether the MyoPro might be right for you, contact us.

History of Myoelectric Devices


 
 






The first myoelectric prosthesis was created between 1944-1948 by Reinhold Reiter, a physics student at Munich University. Reiter recog­nized that to work properly, the device needed to obtain maximum information from the myoelectric signal.  The technology has, over the past 50 years, moved from single muscle control of a single prosthesis function to more complex muscle group activity control of multifunction prostheses. Central to these changes have been developments in the means of extracting information from the myoelectric signal.
Later work expanded the concept of myoelectric control to orthoses for upper extremity impairment. By supporting research in 1990, the VA promoted and inspired development for a future myoelectric orthosis that could be of benefit to Veterans that have upper extremity impairment.  In 2006, work in myoelectric upper extremity orthoses at MIT was commercialized resulting in the development of the Myo­Pro myoelectric elbow-wrist-hand orthosis (EWHO).

Myomo, Inc. Launches MyoPro® 2




Powered Arm Orthosis Features Interchangeable, Extended-life 
      Rechargeable Batteries






June 13, 2017 08:10 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Myomo, Inc. (NYSE MKT: MYO) (“Myomo” or the “Company”), a commercial 
      stage medical robotics company, today announced the launch of its 
      next-generation MyoPro® myoelectric arm orthosis (powered brace), 
      the only lightweight wearable device that can restore function in the 
      paralyzed or weakened arms and hands of individuals who have suffered a 
      stroke, spinal cord or nerve injury, or other neuromuscular disability. 
      With the orthosis, a paralyzed individual can perform activities of 
      daily living including feeding themselves, carrying objects and doing 
      household tasks, and many are able to return to work. The product is 
      currently being shipped to customers nationwide.
    

      MyoPro 2 extends the capabilities of the previous device with 
      significant enhancements, including interchangeable, extended-life 
      rechargeable batteries for continuous daily use. Additional enhancements 
      include an upgraded user interface, improved sensors and improved 
      harness and finger grasp orthosis for more reliable and comfortable 
      long-term wear.
    

      MyoPro 2 is available in three models to match patient-specific needs:
    


        Motion E: powered elbow with static rigid wrist support;
      

        Motion W: powered elbow and a multi-articulating wrist with 
        flexion/extension and supination/pronation; and
      

        Motion G: powered elbow, a multi-articulating wrist and a powered 
        3-jaw-chuck grasp.
      


      “MyoPro 2 is the result of collaboration between our users, clinical 
      partners and engineering team to help patients restore their activities 
      of daily living,” said Paul R. Gudonis, Chairman and CEO of Myomo. 
      “Early in our rollout, feedback from patients, physicians and the 
      orthotics and prosthetics community has been very positive. We look 
      forward to addressing the large unmet need in upper limb paralysis as we 
      continue to bring MyoPro 2 to a larger market.”
    

      For more information on MyoPro 2, please visit myomo.com.
    

About MyomoMyomo, Inc. is a commercial stage medical 
      robotics Company that offers expanded mobility for those suffering from 
      neurological disorders and upper limb paralysis. Based on patented 
      technology developed at MIT and the Company, Myomo develops and markets 
      the MyoPro® product line of lightweight, non-invasive, powered arm 
      braces to restore function in the paralyzed or weakened arms and hands 
      of individuals that have suffered a stroke, spinal cord or nerve injury 
      such as brachial plexus injury, or other neuromuscular disability such 
      as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or multiple sclerosis (MS). It is 
      provided through clinical relationships with VA medical centers, leading 
      rehabilitation hospitals, and Orthotics and Prosthetics (“O&P”) 
      practices. Several hundred have been successfully used by patients. It 
      is the only device that, sensing a patient’s own neurological signals 
      through non-invasive sensors on the arm, can restore their ability to 
      use their arms and hands so that they can return to work, live 
      independently and reduce their cost of care. Myomo is headquartered in 
      Cambridge, Massachusetts, with sales and clinical professionals across 
      the U.S. For more information, please visit www.myomo.com.

Powered Arm Orthosis Features Interchangeable, Extended-life
      Rechargeable Batteries
CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Myomo, Inc. (NYSE MKT:MYO) ("Myomo" or the "Company"), a commercial
      stage medical robotics company, today announced the launch of its
      next-generation MyoPro® myoelectric arm orthosis (powered brace),
      the only lightweight wearable device that can restore function in the
      paralyzed or weakened arms and hands of individuals who have suffered a
      stroke, spinal cord or nerve injury, or other neuromuscular disability.
      With the orthosis, a paralyzed individual can perform activities of
      daily living including feeding themselves, carrying objects and doing
      household tasks, and many are able to return to work. The product is
      currently being shipped to customers nationwide.
    

      MyoPro 2 extends the capabilities of the previous device with
      significant enhancements, including interchangeable, extended-life
      rechargeable batteries for continuous daily use. Additional enhancements
      include an upgraded user interface, improved sensors and improved
      harness and finger grasp orthosis for more reliable and comfortable
      long-term wear.
    

      MyoPro 2 is available in three models to match patient-specific needs:
    


        Motion E: powered elbow with static rigid wrist support;
      

        Motion W: powered elbow and a multi-articulating wrist with
        flexion/extension and supination/pronation; and
      

        Motion G: powered elbow, a multi-articulating wrist and a powered
        3-jaw-chuck grasp.
      


      "MyoPro 2 is the result of collaboration between our users, clinical
      partners and engineering team to help patients restore their activities
      of daily living," said Paul R. Gudonis, Chairman and CEO of Myomo.
      "Early in our rollout, feedback from patients, physicians and the
      orthotics and prosthetics community has been very positive. We look
      forward to addressing the large unmet need in upper limb paralysis as we
      continue to bring MyoPro 2 to a larger market."
    

      For more information on MyoPro 2, please visit myomo.com.
    
About MyomoMyomo, Inc. is a commercial stage medical
      robotics Company that offers expanded mobility for those suffering from
      neurological disorders and upper limb paralysis. Based on patented
      technology developed at MIT and the Company, Myomo develops and markets
      the MyoPro® product line of lightweight, non-invasive, powered arm
      braces to restore function in the paralyzed or weakened arms and hands
      of individuals that have suffered a stroke, spinal cord or nerve injury
      such as brachial plexus injury, or other neuromuscular disability such
      as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or multiple sclerosis (MS). It is
      provided through clinical relationships with VA medical centers, leading
      rehabilitation hospitals, and Orthotics and Prosthetics ("O&P")
      practices. Several hundred have been successfully used by patients. It
      is the only device that, sensing a patient's own neurological signals
      through non-invasive sensors on the arm, can restore their ability to
      use their arms and hands so that they can return to work, live
      independently and reduce their cost of care. Myomo is headquartered in
      Cambridge, Massachusetts, with sales and clinical professionals across
      the U.S. For more information, please visit www.myomo.com.
