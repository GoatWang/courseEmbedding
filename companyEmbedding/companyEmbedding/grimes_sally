Executive profile: Sally Grimes, Hillshire Brands - tribunedigital-chicagotribune




 



Executive profile: Sally Grimes of Hillshire BrandsChief innovation officer combines expertise in food and marketingMay 25, 2014|By Jessica Wohl, Tribune reporterHillshire Brands’ Sally Grimes walks through Standard Market, which she helped persuade to carry the company’s Aidells sausage. (Zbigniew Bzdak, Chicago Tribune)A weekend visit to Costco often results in buying more than one planned. For Sally Grimes, putting an extra item into an oversized shopping cart led to Hillshire Brands Co. buying another company.As the chief innovation officer of Chicago-based Hillshire Brands, Grimes is constantly looking for unusual products and flavors — and determining if they are things Hillshire should try to develop or acquire.While at Costco, a display of Golden Island jerky caught her eye. She bought a bag, tasted it and took it to the office, where she shared it with colleagues, including Hillshire CEO Sean Connolly.Flavorful and tender, it was a hit and sparked Grimes' interest in learning more about the product."I said, 'Can I give them a call?'" Grimes recalled. She got the company's phone number from its website and left a message for its president, Anna Kan.They began talking and a relationship blossomed. In September 2013, Hillshire bought Golden Island.The idea of Hillshire swooping in to buy a company that makes a high-end product would have seemed ridiculous a few years ago for a company better known for budget-friendly staples like sausage biscuits and hot dogs. But these days, Hillshire is on an acquisition tear as it looks for ways to stand out in the U.S. packaged-food industry. It announced plans this month to buy Pinnacle Foods, the maker of Birds Eye frozen vegetables, Duncan Hines cake mix and Vlasic pickles, for about $4.3 billion.Along with pantry staples, Hillshire also is adding artisanal, upscale products to its lineup and aiming to add an innovative spark to familiar lines such as Jimmy Dean sausage, Ball Park franks and Hillshire Farm deli meat.Grimes, 43, is the person in charge of both efforts. Her role, which has expanded in the past year with the additional title of president of the gourmet food group, harnesses some 17 years in the food and consumer marketing worlds at Kraft and Newell Rubbermaid."If we use our imagination, the possibilities are endless," Grimes said.When Hillshire started out on its own in 2012 after decades under the Sara Lee umbrella, CEO Sean Connolly knew the company needed to focus on innovation to stand out in an increasingly crowded and slow-growing U.S. grocery market. Only 9 percent of its sales came from products introduced in the prior three years, while industry leaders have levels closer to the midteens. Hillshire set a goal of getting to 13 to 15 percent by fiscal 2015.Hillshire now has a roster of newer products in its lineup, such as Jimmy Dean Delights Flatbread sandwiches and Park's Finest by Ball Park hot dogs. Next month it will launch 16 Jimmy Dean items that push the brand beyond breakfast. Those include frozen ham and cheddar cheese sandwiches on pretzel buns and smoked bacon macaroni and cheese.Under Grimes, the innovation department has shaved about 10 weeks off the company's product creation process, bringing the average down to 35 weeks. The flatbreads came out in about one-third of that time, a company record.Hillshire's percentage of sales from new products hit 11 percent last year and is now closer to 12 percent.When Hillshire started on its own, it decided to appoint an executive in charge of innovation, a title that does not exist at major U.S. food companies."In a lot of companies, innovation is a mature process and where it is being executed it's not a necessary role," said Connolly. "We were a new company, we needed to make things happen quickly. I needed to send a clear message to the entire enterprise that innovation was an imperative at Hillshire."The question of who should take that job was answered when Connolly heard about Grimes through Andy Callahan, who had worked with her years before at Kraft Foods and is now president of Hillshire's retail business. Connolly called Grimes in June 2012, when she was working at Newell Rubbermaid, to talk about whether she would be interested in joining his company."When I met Sally it was clear to me that she just has a really good handle on our consumer base and what they're passionate about, what they struggle with and she's very creative" in acting on what the consumer needs, Connolly said.And Grimes, who had helped transform the image of Sharpie markers from a basic desk supply to a cool tool for creative expression, felt it was the right time for a change. She started at Hillshire that July."I was so inspired by his vision" to make Hillshire into the most innovative food company in the United States, she said. Plus, "I always thought I would find my way back into food."Immigrant parentsGrimes grew up in Bourbonnais, about an hour south of Chicago, raised by parents who emigrated from India in the 1960s to pursue their education. Her first name is Shobana, an Indian name that translates to "bright." Her middle name, Sally, was picked to honor her mother's first American friend after she arrived in the U.S.Her mother was a dietitian focused on the science of food.1 | 2 | 3 |  Next

 Sally Grimes
President and chief global growth officer, Tyson Foods

Sally Grimes has a knack for reimagining products you think you already know. At Kraft Foods, she made macaroni and cheese microwaveable. At Newell Rubbermaid, she elevated the Sharpie pen to a wand of artistic expression. Now, as president and global growth officer for Tyson Foods, she is working to do the same for meat.
“We have two key pillars to this growth strategy. One is sustaining innovation. This means packaging innovation, quality improvement, sustaining the growth of our core brands through new flavors and forms,” Grimes told Blue Sky. “The second part is about extending the reach of our brands and our business beyond the products and categories in which we serve today. It’s saying Jimmy Dean is not just about breakfast. Jimmy Dean is not just about sausage.”
Grimes earned a bachelor’s degree in finance from Valparaiso University and spent a few years at First Citizens Bank before heading to the University of Chicago for an MBA. She and her husband, real estate executive Steven Grimes, have a daughter and a son.

		Tyson's Sally Grimes spells out innovation

    NEW YORK — Describing Tyson Foods’ innovation team as “kids in a candy shop” following the company’s acquisition of Hillshire Brands, Sally Grimes, president and global growth officer for the company, outlined the insights driving innovation at the company and highlighted some of the new products on tap for 2015 during Tyson’s investor day, held Dec. 10 in New York. 

Grimes said four growth platforms the company is focusing on revolve around breakfast, convenience, snacking and “holistic wellness.” 

“The first is what we call breakfast reinvented,” she said. “Now over half of consumers want more options for frozen and refrigerated breakfast. So, this one is all about convenient, complete options to start the day right.” 

In 2015, Tyson Foods will introduce Jimmy Dean Simple Scrambler’s, which Grimes described as a “new category in refrigerated breakfast.” She added that the new product will offer a “fresh, complete breakfast made in minutes.” 

“The next one we call ‘smart shortcuts,’” she said. “Americans spend just 27 minutes per day total on meal prep. So this platform is all about delivering higher quality, more unique meals without all the prep. 

“The third one we call purposeful snacking. Twenty-five percent of consumers today are searching for protein on food labels and snacking has evolved from incidental to purposeful, to satisfy cravings, to keep going in between meals and support overall health. So this is our platform for portable protein.” 

To capitalize on the demand for portable protein, Tyson Foods will be introducing Ball Park branded jerky in 2015. 

“We are excited to build on our presence in the jerky category, leveraging the strong approachable equity of Ball Park to disrupt the fast-growing on trend jerky category,” Grimes said. “Now this is big, the Ball Park brand benefits from high awareness, a consumer base who likes dried snacks and equity around flame grilled taste. We are confident that Ball Park will grow the jerky category by broadening jerky appeal with flame grilled jerky because meat from the grill just tastes better.” 

Grimes added that the Hillshire Snacking line of products will roll out nationally in 2015. 

“It has been in test market for six months with strong performance,” Grimes said. “And it is ready to roll out nationally. Hillshire snacking has not only delivered incremental sales to the category, but it has exceeded the competition in test retailers for both incrementally of sales and overall size.” 

When it was test marketed, the Snacking line featured two varieties, one featuring Italian salami or hot Calabrese salami with cheese and crackers. The second variety featured grilled meats in such flavors as sweet chili, honey mustard or teriyaki. 

The final growth platform Tyson is focused on is holistic wellness, which Ms. Grimes said features “nutritious products for the most disciplined consumers across all day parts.” 

Next year Tyson Foods plans to expand its Aidells line of processed meats into the breakfast category with the launch of two new chicken sausages that feature such infusions as apple or maple. Ms. Grimes said the launch is designed to complement the Aidells line of chicken lunchmeat and meatballs that are currently in the marketplace. 

Grimes also took time in her presentation to delve into the macro market forces she said are shaping Tyson’s new product development strategy. 

“First, the changing face of the consumer,” she said. “Today, only 20% of U.S. households are a married couple with children. And millennials are 27% of the U.S. — this is the biggest demographic in our history. 

“Next, altered shopping habits — Spending is up but shoppers are making fewer trips spread across more stores, formats and channels.” 

She added that eating itself is evolving, specifically the “what, the when and the how consumers are eating is changing,” Ms. Grimes said. “Nearly one-third of dinners today are eaten alone. And long gone are three square meals a day. The average American actually eats 4.9 meals per day. And our on-the-go lifestyles, they are just leading us to fundamentally change the way we eat.” 

Finally, Grimes noted the continued economic challenges facing consumers are shaping Tyson Foods’ innovation strategies when she highlighted the fact that six in 10 households in the United States make less than $50,000 per year. 
“We actually don’t have one innovation pipeline at Tyson, we have many pipelines,” Ms. Grimes said. “One of the greatest assets of this company is our diverse portfolio of category leading brands. We won’t just deliver new products, but a strategic sustainable pipeline of innovation for each of our brands to drive growth.”

		Sneak Peek: Growth leader

Sally Grimes, president and chief global growth officer

CHICAGO – Sally Grimes’ career has evolved from successfully marketing and innovating macaroni, markers and now meat products. This past year, her career culminated when she was appointed to the executive leadership team at Tyson Foods Inc. by President and CEO Donnie Smith as part of the 2014 acquisition of The Hillshire Brands Company. As president and chief global growth officer, she oversees insights, innovation, R&D, retail sales, marketing services and international strategy with the goal of growing the company’s consumer and foodservice brands. 

Tyson Foods not only acquired legacy brands that included Ball Park, Hillshire Farm, Jimmy Dean, Aidells and recently acquired Golden Island gourmet jerky, but the people behind those brands. The corporate courtship to recruit Grimes and several other Hillshire Brands execs was led by Smith. 

“As excited as I am about our new brands, I’m equally excited about the combined talent of the two companies,” said Smith last August. 

“We all had the opportunity to connect with Tyson leadership during the acquisition,” says Grimes, adding that her decision to join the Tyson team was fueled by Chairman John Tyson’s inspiring vision for the company and Smith’s proven commitment to servant leadership. “Donnie is such an authentic, genuine leader,” she says. 

Grimes, 44, didn’t begin her career in marketing, but rather in the banking industry after earning a finance degree from Valparaiso Univ. She went on to earn a master’s degree in business from the Univ. of Chicago, “fully intending to stay on the finance route,” she says, but discovered brand management along the way and a light went on. “This was an opportunity to bring the art and science of business together.” At that time her goal was to run her own business or brand with the resources of a big company backing her. This led Grimes from the Univ. of Chicago to a brand management position at Kraft Foods. While working up through the ranks at Kraft for 10-plus years, she learned many of the skills and gained knowledge she applies every day in her current role at Tyson. Her first brand assignment at the diverse company was on its iconic Macaroni and Cheese product line. 
“Then I got a call to go global,” Grimes says, referring to the job offer to lead the marketing team at Newell Rubbermaid’s writing business, which included the Sharpie product line. “How fun was that,” she laughs. Under Grimes, Sharpie was rebranded from a permanent marker most associated with professional athletes signing autographs, to what she calls “an advocate of self-expression,” and took the marketing effort global, targeting Europe and Brazil. 

After more than five years at Newell Rubbermaid, Grimes realized what she learned marketing markers could apply to meat, a leap she never considered until receiving a phone call from Sean Connolly, then CEO of Hillshire Brands Company, in 2012. Grimes remembers Connolly saying, “‘Hey, we’re starting a $4 billion start-up. Do you want to be a part of the team?’” She had breakfast with him a few days later and after hearing his plan and vision for the “new” company, Grimes realized, “How many times in your career do you get to be a part of a $4 billion start-up?” Her decision was swift. “Literally within days I said, ‘I am in,’” says Grimes, who considered it a privilege to work with Connolly and the leadership team he assembled.

Q&A
Sally Grimes of Hillshire Brands aims to speed new products to market

Sally Grimes has a knack for reimagining products you think you already know. At Kraft Foods Inc., she made macaroni and cheese microwaveable. At Newell Rubbermaid Inc., she elevated the Sharpie pen to a wand of artistic expression. Now, as president of Hillshire Brands Gourmet Food Group and chief innovation officer of Hillshire Brands Co., Grimes is working to do the same for meat. Already, she has overseen the launch of a new product called Jimmy Dean Flatbread breakfast sandwiches in a company-record 12 weeks -- the time from initial concept to first shipment. She told us more about her approach to innovation. 
Q. Hillshire has said it wants to be the most innovative company in the meat business. What will that mean?
A. Historically, we have averaged about 45 weeks of getting an innovation into the marketplace. We set out a goal of hitting 35 weeks. Secondly, historically we’ve been able to look ahead and understand about a year’s worth of innovation. We set a goal of ensuring we had a three-year, sustainable pipeline at all times.
Lastly, and I would say most importantly, historically, we have averaged about 9 percent of our revenue from innovation, and we set a goal to deliver 13 [percent] to 15 percent of revenue from innovation by fiscal year 2015. And that third metric is really what I focus on.
Q. How will you make that happen?
A. We homed in on two key focus areas. First was getting deeper insights. In some cases in the past, we didn't go deep enough on understanding the consumer and, in turn, delivering a meaningful point of difference.
The second is all about stronger execution. One of the things that we have instituted is rapid prototyping. In the case of Jimmy Dean Flatbreads, we were able to leverage our innovation center where we have the ability to rapidly prototype products and get them in front of consumers quickly, get the feedback, make changes immediately, and get in front of consumers again. That’s one aspect of being more flexible and more nimble with this new process.
Q. How do you divide your efforts between incremental versus radical innovation?
A. We have two key pillars to this growth strategy. One is sustaining innovation. This means packaging innovation, quality improvement, sustaining the growth of our core brands through new flavors and forms. We’ve got some amazing, iconic bands that haven't been nurtured that much, so that is critically important right now because we need the foundation from which to grow.
The second part is about extending the reach of our brands and our business beyond the products and categories in which we serve today. It’s saying Jimmy Dean is not just about breakfast. Jimmy Dean is not just about sausage. Jimmy Dean is about hearty comfort food. So how can we take that amazing iconic trademark into new categories, new forms.
Q. How does innovation differ among the companies where you've worked?
A. To put it into simple terms, you ask three main questions: Will they want it, meaning the consumer; can we make it and can we make money at it? At a very basic level, I have followed that both at Kraft and Newell Rubbermaid.
What is different about Hillshire is a commitment from the top. When you put that word [innovation] in your vision statement, it means that innovation isn't just something that you’ll do. It means that innovation is something that defines you.
