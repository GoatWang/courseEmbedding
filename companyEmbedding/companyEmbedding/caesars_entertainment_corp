 I would recommend Tim for any large 
          social, charitable, or work functions. He has great energy, is very 
          humble, and is unbelievably talented as an artist. Our group raved about 
          Tim and his show for weeks. 



 Merrill Lynch




 He is amazing! 



 Marie Osmond




 The crowd loved you and your performance 
          was amazing! 



 Chick-Fil-A, Inc




 You do a fabulous job! 



 Dick Vitale
          Basketball Hall of Famer 



 The only problem with Tims performance 
          is that we dont know how we can possibly top it next year. 



 Construction Specialties 
          Inc., Pennsylvania




 Tim's performance was the "knock out" 
          we needed to make our 10th Anniversary year a huge success. As you know, 
          it's hard to come up with fresh ideas every year to engage the audience. 
          His performance was truly incredible. He is a terrific showman, and 
          our guests responded immediately with a resounding standing ovation! 
          Tim was SO very easy to work with, he did all he promised and then some.	
        



 George HW Bush Celebrity 
          Golf Classic, Maine




 Each year we find it more difficult 
          to choose a form of entertainment for our annual meeting. Tim made it 
          easy for us this year and we dont think we will be able to top it next 
          year. 



 Credit Union of America, 
          Kansas




 We were extremely pleased with the 
          entertainment Tim Decker provided at our recent employee appreciation 
          party. We would highly recommend him. His show is so unique, refreshing 
          and exactly the right length. Our employees loved it. Tim was very flexible 
          and gave us just the show we wanted. 



 Lower Valley Energy, 
          Wyoming




 You are one talented dude! 



 Comedian Sinbad




 Tim Decker brought so much fun and 
          excitement into our live auction! The crowd was just absolutely amazed 
          by his talent!

 The buzz is still going on about your

          our initial contact through the completion of the event. 



 Amdur Productions, 
          Chicago, IL




 his creative vision and on-stage presentation 
          were a delight and our attendees are continuing to talk about the event!

Connecting to our Colleagues
“I worked in Housekeeping for the day. It helped remind me of the hard work that our housekeeping team does each and every day. They take the time to greet our guests and deliver a world class experience.” Darrell Pilant, Vice President and Assistant General Manager
At Caesars Entertainment we embrace what makes us unique to inspire innovation and win together. We hire for diversity, compensate fairly and reward positive contribution and service. Our training programs are designed for all and our working environments are positive and open. With tens of thousands of employees across our organization, we try to create a workplace where we can collectively work, as one big team, toward one big ambition to create memorable experiences for our guests by serving them with passion.
Oversight
The head of the Diversity & Inclusion Department is responsible for managing all of the employee diversity, supplier diversity, customer diversity and community relations with diverse organizations strategies across the enterprise. The head of Diversity& Inclusion coordinates with the SVP of Human Resources to use agencies to recruit diverse candidates, ensure Caesars presence at diverse career fairs for historically black college and university candidates, veterans, women, LGBTQ candidates, and other diverse recruits, deploy mentorships to retain and promote diverse candidates, use of Human Resource Analytics data to evaluate the efficacy of our Equal Employment Opportunity progress, and all other Human Resource-related initiatives.
Women do well at Caesars
We have always celebrated women at Caesars and our open and gender-balanced culture is demonstrated by the  fact that 55% of our employees and 42% of our managers are women. We believe that women are good for business, and that a culture in which women (and men) can progress on merit enables us to best serve our guests and society in general. It’s also the right way to do business.
A Diverse Workplace
It’s not only gender that demonstrates our commitment to equality. We maintain an inclusive workforce, with 52% of our employees from minority groups. In 2016, for the 9th consecutive year, we earned a perfect rating from the Human Rights Campaign’s annual Corporate Equality Index. This Index scores businesses based on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) workplace policies and public engagement on LGBT rights issues.
For more on Caesars’ LGBT Policies: http://caesarscorporate.com/about-caesars/public-policy/

 
 
 


Training
Each year employees at all levels are required to complete mandatory training modules on various topics (Anti-Money Laundering, Responsible Gaming, etc.) and Diversity & Inclusion training is one of the compliance training requirements. Our Diversity & Inclusion training covers being sensitive to customers of diverse backgrounds, understanding the benefit of building diverse teams, understanding the difference between having diverse team members and actually including diverse team members into various job roles and social activities without unconscious bias.
Compliance
With regard to the implementation of processes to report and address discrimination issues, the Legal Department partners with an unbiased third-party vendor to monitor the Compliance & Ethics Hotline by which employees can by name or anonymously report any issues with discrimination or employee issues in general. The Human Resources department also outlines in their New Hire documentation and the employee handbook that discrimination of any type is not tolerated and provides contact details for employees to either reach out to the Compliance & Ethics hotline or reach out to Human Resources directly or reach out to their immediate supervisor  to immediately address allegations of discrimination.

CAESARS CITIZENSHIP BLOG SPOTLIGHT
Caesars Volunteers Honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in Las Vegas

The Caesars Centurion on the left stands between Steve Stevenson, founder and co-chair of CHORUS – Caesars’ African-American employee group, and Norris Hamilton – Director of Hotel Operations at the Flamingo – member of CHORUS.
“Life’s most persistent and urgent question is, ‘What are you doing for others?’” These are the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., whose legacy Caesars Entertainment and its affiliates celebrated by participating in the 2016 King Week Festivities in Las Vegas.
Dr. King’s question is one we ask ourselves a lot at Caesars. How can we run a sustainable business that has a positive social impact in the communities where we work, visit and play? One way we do that is by being active in community efforts such as King Week, where we honor civil rights heroes like Dr. King, reminding us why it’s critical to engage with our people and our local communities.

Community Involvement








Community
CONNECTING IN OUR #COMMUNITIES
Horseshoe Southern Indiana Senior Appreciation Month mini golf tournament event
At Caesars, we do not simply connect with our communities. We connect in our communities. We engage at all possible levels from within our organization to integrate seamlessly within our communities’ governing bodies, economic, social and environmental life. Our diverse employees are recruited from our local communities and they are motivated to connect through #citizenship. We are also known for the public stand we take on social and environmental issues that affect our guests, our employees and our communities. Our leaders are often in the public eye, or in the press, speaking out about issues that are close to our hearts.
 

OUR HEROS
Our HEROs program enables, encourages and empowers employees to be leaders in our communities. Our properties maintain regular community engagement initiatives and we are continuously overwhelmed by the passion, creativity, dedication and generosity of our employee HEROs. In 2015, we recorded a total of 260,000 hours of reported volunteering, once again beating all previous records.
HEROs participating in a Kids to Park Day at the Jean Lafitte National Historical Park
HERO SPOTLIGHT: New Orleans HEROs
Our HEROs at Harrah’s New Orleans had a great year in 2015 with almost 10,000 volunteering hours, which is an average of half a day of community involvement for each employee at the property. One of the highlights of these efforts  was our collaboration with the National Park Trust, the National Park Service, Chalmette Elementary School and Harrah’s New Orleans in a project called Planting the Future.
This multi-year project commemorates the bicentennial of the Battle of New Orleans at the Chalmette Battlefield at Jean Lafitte National Historical Park, engaging the local community and school children in the restoration and preservation of the historic grounds of the Chalmette Battlefield and National Cemetery. In 2015, our team at Harrah’s New Orleans donated hundreds of hours planting trees and restoring native plants in the area.


Caesars Foundation
Slots tournament participants enjoy the photo booth with a Harrah’s employee.
The Caesars Foundation  is a private foundation established in 2002 and funded by a portion of operating income from resorts owned or operated by Caesars Entertainment. The Foundation is the entity through which Caesars funds charitable programs and projects of $5,000 or more, including meeting non-profit giving requirements in certain operating jurisdictions. Caesars Foundation’s objective is to strengthen organizations and programs in the communities where our employees and their families live and work, and to include our employees in volunteer efforts associated with the causes we support.
The main areas of focus for Caesars Foundations strategic giving are:

Helping older individuals live longer, healthier, more fulfilling lives
Marshaling our financial resources and the commitment of our colleagues to promote a more sustainable world
Improving the quality of life in our operating communities


SUPPLIER DIVERSITY
We continue to diversify our supplier base and procurement spend with MWDBEs (minority and women-owned or disadvantaged business enterprises). Often, these companies require assistance to qualify as Caesars’ supplier or expand their business with us. We connect widely and deeply throughout the U.S. market to ensure MWDBE vendors know we welcome them and how to qualify for supplier status. We support a number of Chambers of Commerce that promote diverse suppliers, and we speak frequently at conferences and events designed to promote supplier diversity. We offer practical support to help diverse enterprises improve their overall and Caesars-related performance.

While Caesars’ support of the aging population is a year-round commitment, May is particularly special as it is officially Senior Appreciation Month. Each May, our employees celebrate seniors in our communities by creating unique opportunities to inspire healthy aging and enhance quality of life for seniors. Fueled by their passion for giving back, and a little healthy competition, our HERO volunteers at various properties competed to show local seniors how much we value them as neighbors and community members. With a total of 24 properties submitting entries in the Senior Appreciation Month challenge, it was hard to pick just three winners.
Read on to learn about how our HEROs showed care and appreciation for seniors through luncheons, game nights, food drives and more on the Caesars Citizenship Blog.

HERO STARS GRAND PRIZE WINNERS
In 2014, we launched a new recognition program for our HEROs, encouraging their managers and those they serve in the community to recommend their HERO Stars for recognition in a quarterly program. Recommendations are judged by an internal team that considers both the commitment to the causes supported and the tangible outcomes for society of the HEROs’ involvement. Through April 2016, after 9 quarters, the program has yielded 18 HERO Stars. Each Star receives  a $500 donation to contribute to a nonprofit organization of their choice and is profiled on our Caesars Citizenship BlogCaesars Citizenship Blog.
In May 2016, we announced our annual HERO Stars grand prize winners, selected from our 2015/2016 HERO Stars. Their selection was based on their commitment to the community, measurable impact on beneficiary charities and alignment with Caesars community involvement strategic impact areas (aging, health and wellness, environment, and education). Both winners received a $500 donation to their chosen charity and an invitation to participate in the centennial of stewardship of American parks volunteering event, hosted by long-time Caesars Foundation beneficiary, the National Park Trust, in August 2016 in Baltimore.
Todd volunteered more than 175 hours for the American Cancer Society in 2015 and raised funds by selling homemade cookies. Todd supported Meals on Wheels by packing hundreds of meals to feed the hungry and has shaved his head annually for the past four years to show his solidarity with the St.Baldrick’s Foundation.
Sandra volunteered 436 hours in 2015 at many HERO events. Each month, Sandra volunteers at the Harrah’s Hope Lodge and at the Ronald McDonald House, distributes food to families at the Tunica Food Pantry and visits patients at the Veterans Hospital of Memphis.

Responsible Gaming








Caesars Entertainment’s Commitment to Responsible Gaming
Caesars Entertainment’s commitment to responsible gaming led to the development of the industry’s first-ever broadcast advertising campaign focused specifically on responsible gaming.  Ads explain the importance of responsible gaming and how responsible gaming is an important part of our Code of Commitment.
Taking a Leadership Position
Promoting responsible gaming is part of the heritage and culture of Caesars. It’s the foundation of our Code of Commitment, which spells out the principles that govern the way we do business. Our company’s long-standing and continuing commitment to responsible gaming is something we take great pride in. Caesars position on this issue is clear: we want everyone who gambles at our casinos to be there for the right reasons – to simply have fun. We believe that all entities involved in legal wagering have an obligation to promote responsible gaming and address underage gambling.
Caesars, then named Harrah’s, pioneered the casino entertainment industry’s first responsible gaming efforts over a decade ago when a group of employees formed a task force to study the issue of problem gambling. After months of research, the task force developed the industry’s first initiative to help employees, guests, and the public understand the importance of responsible gaming and the prevention of underage gambling.
Caesars continues to be the casino industry’s chief advocate for promoting responsible gaming. We have implemented two responsible gaming programs, Operation Bet Smart® and Project 21®, as well as an Unattended Children Policy.
Additionally, Caesars works with the National Council on Problem Gambling, Inc., its local councils, and other service agencies in our markets on a continuing basis to promote a better understanding of responsible gaming and underage gambling. In fact, we provided the initial funding to establish the National Council’s twenty-four hour toll free helpline. We also support research on these issues through on-going financial contributions to the National Center for Responsible Gaming. Caesars launched the casino industry’s first broadcast advertising campaign to promote responsible gaming and increase awareness of toll free helpline numbers. We were awarded the National Council’s first corporate award, which recognized Caesars for its proactive efforts on responsible gaming. Caesars invites other members of the casino industry to join us in promoting responsible gaming.
Operation Bet Smart®
Operation Bet Smart®: Know When To Stop Before You Start® is a program designed to formally train employees about the importance of responsible gaming and the policies and procedures of Caesars responsible gaming programs. While we recognize our employees are not social service counselors, Caesars feels that encouraging employee awareness puts employees at a comfort level, helps them understand the company’s position on the issue, and supplies them with valuable information and direction to potentially help others.
At all our casinos, we provide responsible gaming signage on the casino floor and back-of-house so that employees always know where to refer customers requesting assistance. We also provide responsible gaming information in brochures, on hold messages, and Caesars responsible specific media campaign, as well as including helpline phone numbers on all marketing collateral, player cards, and hotel directories. These communication efforts serve to provide our customers an unobtrusive vehicle for obtaining more information about responsible gaming and seeking assistance.
Project 21® – We Care. We Card.®
This initiative teaches casino employees, minors, parents, and guardians about the consequences of gambling under the legal age. Casinos are not for our kids. We do not hesitate to uphold the laws concerning the legal gambling age in each state.
For more than a decade, Caesars has been the chief advocate of Project 21®, now an industry-wide program that encompasses employee training and public awareness about underage gambling. Caesars Entertainment is committed to keeping minors off the casino floor. Project 21® is now a licensed program for any casino in our industry to use, and any casino can contribute to Project 21® scholarship efforts. We are very proud that the success of Project 21®has let it outside our door and into the halls of high schools across the U.S.
Other Project 21® efforts include the front and back-of-house signage, detailed employee training on cues for identifying minors, and the on-going creation of materials to keep employees and players aware. Like Operation Bet Smart®, Project 21® also includes the creation of materials for public education, such as TV public service announcements.
All Caesars employees are trained to card individuals who appear to be below the age of 30, as well as ways to detect potentially invalid identification. If a minor is trying to gamble under false identification, our security officers will intervene and may contact outside law enforcement. We want all of our customers to have an enjoyable time at our properties, but we will not condone breaking the law. We Care. We Card.® And we will take action.
Looking Out for Kids
Another educational campaign and policy that Caesars has undertaken concerns the presence of unattended children on property. Our Unattended Children Policy is a communication effort that encourages parents not to leave children unattended at our properties, and trains employees on the proper approach to use upon discovering an unattended child. Seeking to urge parents not to leave their children without adult supervision, every Caesars casino has standard procedures to promote parental responsibility and protect the safety of children and minors. Parents are informed through signage and brochures about our policies and employees are asked to keep an eye out and call security for any child that has been left unattended.
National Helpline
In 1995, Caesars Entertainment helped fund the creation and start-up of the first national helpline (1-800-522-4700) for problem gambling – providing callers with counseling and direction to local assistance in any state. Our funding to assist local health service agencies, councils, and seminars continues yearly through funding efforts by our corporate office and casino properties. Knowing gambling problems can potentially reach the “other side” of the table, Caesars Entertainment provides confidential counseling assistance for employees through our Employee Assistance Program.
Self Restriction/Self-Exclusion
Our “self-restriction” program allows a person to request not to receive direct marketing by Caesars owned, managed, or operated properties, as well as be denied credit and check cashing privileges. Our “self-exclusion” program allows a guest to request to have all privileges, including play privileges denied at all Caesars owned, managed, or operated properties. Forms to request self-restriction or self-exclusion are available at all Caesars owned, managed, or operated properties or by calling 1-800-694-9960.
Other Resources
For self-help materials for problem gamblers, we encourage you to download Harvard Medical School’s “Gambling – Your First Step To Change” toolkit.
For additional information about problem gambling, visit the National Council on Problem Gambling’s website. If you or someone you know might have a gambling problem, call the National Council on Problem Gambling’s toll-free helpline at 1-800-522-4700.

History[edit]
William F. Harrah era (1937–1978)[edit]
The company's background can be traced to October 29, 1937, when Bill Harrah opened a small bingo parlor in Reno, Nevada, a predecessor to Harrah's Reno.[6][7] In 1955, he expanded to Stateline, Nevada, on the south shore of Lake Tahoe, where he would eventually open Harrah's Lake Tahoe.[8] Harrah's Inc. made its initial public offering in 1971.[9] Following that in 1972, it was listed on the American Stock Exchange and in 1973, Harrah's became the first casino company listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Bill Harrah died on June 30, 1978 of complications from aortic aneurysm and cardiac surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.
Under Holiday Inn[edit]
In February 1980, Holiday Inns acquired Harrah's, Inc. for $300 million. Liquidation of Harrah's collection of almost 7,000 antique automobiles reportedly returned the full purchase price of the company to Holiday Inn. Holiday Inn at the time had interests in two casinos: the under-construction Holiday Inn Marina Casino in Atlantic City, and a 40 percent stake in the Holiday Casino, adjacent to the Holiday Inn hotel on the Las Vegas Strip.[7]
In July 1987, Bill's Casino Lake Tahoe opened.[7] Harrah's Laughlin opened in August 1988.[7]
The Promus Companies[edit]
The company now known as Caesars Entertainment was formed in 1990 as The Promus Companies. To effect the sale of the Holiday Inn hotel business to Bass PLC, Promus was created as a corporate spin-off, holding Harrah's, Embassy Suites, Homewood Suites, and Hampton Inn; Bass then acquired Holiday Corp., which retained only the Holiday Inn assets.[10] The next year, the company's headquarters moved from Reno to Memphis, Tennessee[11]
In April 1992, the Holiday Casino was rebranded as Harrah's Las Vegas.[7]
The late 1980s and early 1990s saw a rapid increase in gambling markets with the growth of Indian gaming and legalization of riverboat casinos. In 1993 and 1994, the company opened Harrah's Joliet,[12] Harrah's Vicksburg,[13] Harrah's Tunica,[14] Harrah's Black Hawk,[15] Harrah's Central City,[15] Harrah's Shreveport,[16] Harrah's North Kansas City,[17] and Harrah's Ak-Chin.[18]
Renamed as Harrah's Entertainment, Inc.[edit]




Harrah's Entertainment logo (1995–2010)


In 1995, Promus decided to spin off its non-gaming hotel businesses, in part because they had been undervalued by investors due to perception of the company as a risky gaming stock.[19] Promus Hotel Corp. was established, holding Embassy Suites, Hampton Inn, and Homewood Suites, while the parent company, holding 16 casinos, was renamed as Harrah's Entertainment.[20]
Harrah's continued its expansion over the next ten years, opening Harrah's Skagit Valley,[21] Harrah's Sky City,[22] Harrah's St. Louis-Riverport,[23] Harrah's Cherokee,[24] Harrah's Prairie Band,[25] Harrah's New Orleans,[26] and Harrah's Rincon,[27] and acquiring the Southern Belle Casino,[28] Showboat, Inc.,[29] the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino,[30] Players International,[31] Harveys Casino Resorts,[32] Louisiana Downs,[33] Horseshoe Gaming,[34] and the World Series of Poker.[35]
In 1997, Harrah's launched its Total Gold loyalty program (renamed as Total Rewards in 2000[36]), developed at a cost of $20 million.[37] It was the first gaming company to offer a systemwide comps program, allowing points earned at one casino to be redeemed for goods and services at any of the company's other casinos.[38] The system would be credited as a major driver of Harrah's growth over the coming years.[39]
Harvard Business School professor Gary Loveman joined Harrah's as chief operating officer in 1998,[40] and would go on to serve as chief executive officer from 2003 to 2015.[39][41]
In 1999, the company moved its headquarters from Memphis to Las Vegas.[42]
Purchase of Caesars Entertainment[edit]
Harrah's made its largest single expansion in 2005, when it acquired Caesars Entertainment, Inc. for $10.4 billion.[43] Negotiations were spurred on by news of a merger agreement between MGM Mirage and Mandalay Resort Group.[44] The two companies sold several properties ahead of the merger to assuage antitrust concerns, including Harrah's East Chicago and Harrah's Tunica.[45] The acquisition increased Harrah's portfolio to 40 casinos, plus four cruise ship casinos.[46] The deal furthered Harrah's goal of gaining a larger presence on the Las Vegas Strip, where Caesars owned four casinos,[47] and improved its ability to market to high rollers.[48]
Harrah's began to push for a larger international presence in 2005, announcing joint venture agreements to build casinos in Spain, Slovenia, and the Bahamas, and applying for a license to build a major resort in Singapore,[49] though none of these projects would come to fruition. Harrah's also acquired London Clubs International in 2006,[50] and the Macau Orient Golf club in 2007.[51]
From 2005 to 2010, the company consolidated control of a long stretch of the east side of the Las Vegas Strip, acquiring the Bourbon Street,[52] Imperial Palace,[53] Barbary Coast,[54][55] and Planet Hollywood[56] casinos, along with large tracts of land behind the Strip properties.[57][58]
In 2005 and 2006, Harrah's closed its Lake Charles casino due to damage from Hurricane Rita, sold the Flamingo Laughlin, and sold Grand Casino Gulfport.
Company goes private[edit]
Loveman at some point sought advice from private equity tycoon David Bonderman about the possibility of spinning off ownership of Harrah's real estate as a separate real estate investment trust (REIT), hoping to attain the higher price-to-earnings ratios at which hotel companies traded, compared to gaming companies.[59] In 2006, the discussions evolved toward the idea of a leveraged buyout of Harrah's by Bonderman's company, TPG Capital.[59] Another private equity firm, Apollo Global Management, approached Loveman about a buyout, and he encouraged them to collaborate with TPG.[59] By the end of the year, an agreement was announced for the two companies to buy Harrah's for $17.1 billion in cash plus $10.7 billion in assumed debt.[60] The transaction closed in January 2008, leaving Harrah's with $25.1 billion in debt.[61]
The Linq[edit]
It was widely announced in previous years that the company planned to implode properties and build new ones from scratch, but after the market downturn the company conceded that it had little experience in building major resorts. Instead it developed Project LINQ in 2009, which calls for retaining and improving all existing buildings while adding a collection of about 20 restaurants and bars to be built along a winding corridor between the company's Imperial Palace, O'Sheas and Flamingo casinos, on the east side of the Strip. It is an attempt to create the kind of entertainment district that has developed organically in cities such as Los Angeles, Memphis and New Orleans yet is lacking on the Strip, with its enclosed, casino-centric zones.[62] If this new zone is successful it will provide competition for the Fremont Street Experience.
New Las Vegas Arena[edit]
The Anschutz Entertainment Group first tried to build an arena in Las Vegas in association with Harrah's Entertainment. In 2007, the joint venture announced they would build a 20,000 seat stadium behind the Bally's and Paris casino-hotels.[63] Caesars Entertainment, Inc. had previously envisioned using the location to build a baseball park, but the company's buyout by Harrah's cancelled the plans. Through the following year, Harrah's got uncertain on continuing with the project, not knowing if AEG would split the costs, and whether building a major league-ready stadium without a guaranteed franchise to play on it would be feasible given the enduring financial crisis.[64] The original plans were to break ground in June 2008 and finish the arena in 2010, but by 2009, it was revealed the stalled project had not even done a traffic study despite being located near a busy intersection.[65] In 2010, the plans were changed to use an area behind the Imperial Palace. However, given the financing would require a special taxation district, opposition from Clark County regarding using public money in the project stalled it even further.[66] AEG eventually backed out completely by 2012, once MGM Resorts International came up with their own project using a terrain behind the New York-New York and Monte Carlo resorts. This attracted AEG primarily for not relying on public funding.[67]
The acquisition of Planet Hollywood provided Harrah's with a contiguous 126-acre (51 ha) property bordering the strip. The vacant lots behind the casinos had been slated for a sports arena large enough to hold a professional basketball or hockey team. The three casinos will have over 8,000 rooms which can be directly connected to the arena.
It was announced in August 2010 that Harrah's would run casinos in Cincinnati, Ohio and Cleveland, Ohio when they open in 2012.
Rename to Caesars Entertainment Corp.[edit]
In November 2010 plans for an IPO were canceled, but a planned name change from Harrah's Entertainment Inc to Caesars Entertainment Corp did go forward as planned and was made official November 23, 2010. This change was intended to capitalize on the international name recognition enjoyed on the Caesars name brand. The Harrah's brand would remain one of the company's three primary casino brands.[68]
On February 8, 2012, an initial public offering took place, with the common stock trading on the NASDAQ under the symbol "CZR."[69]
Caesars Acquisition Company merger[edit]
On December 22, 2014, Caesars announced its intention to acquire Caesars Acquisition Company.[70] Under the terms of the transaction, shareholders of Caesars Acquisition Company will receive 0.664 share of Caesars Entertainment common stock for each share of Caesars Acquisition Company held.
Casino unit files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy[edit]
The casino operating unit of Caesars Entertainment filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on January 15, 2015.[71]
On November 2, 2015, the Rock Gaming announced it would begin assuming management of Horseshoe Casino Cleveland, Horseshoe Casino Cincinnati, and ThistleDown Racino from Caesars Entertainment, and complete the transition by June 2016.[72][73]
Playtika Company acquisition and sale[edit]
Caesars Entertainment Corporation (via its Harrah’s casino brand) acquired Playtika in May 2011 for an amount between $80 and $90 million.[74] Playtika, a social game developer company, was founded in 2010 by Robert Antokol and Uri Shahak and produced Facebook social gaming platforms (slotomania.com & caesarsgames.com).[citation needed] As of June 2016, a Chinese consortium, which includes Alibaba chief Jack Ma's Yunfeng Capital, agreed to purchase it in a buyout for $4.4 billion.[75]

History[edit]
William F. Harrah era (1937–1978)[edit]
The company's background can be traced to October 29, 1937, when Bill Harrah opened a small bingo parlor in Reno, Nevada, a predecessor to Harrah's Reno.[6][7] In 1955, he expanded to Stateline, Nevada, on the south shore of Lake Tahoe, where he would eventually open Harrah's Lake Tahoe.[8] Harrah's Inc. made its initial public offering in 1971.[9] Following that in 1972, it was listed on the American Stock Exchange and in 1973, Harrah's became the first casino company listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Bill Harrah died on June 30, 1978 of complications from aortic aneurysm and cardiac surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.
Under Holiday Inn[edit]
In February 1980, Holiday Inns acquired Harrah's, Inc. for $300 million. Liquidation of Harrah's collection of almost 7,000 antique automobiles reportedly returned the full purchase price of the company to Holiday Inn. Holiday Inn at the time had interests in two casinos: the under-construction Holiday Inn Marina Casino in Atlantic City, and a 40 percent stake in the Holiday Casino, adjacent to the Holiday Inn hotel on the Las Vegas Strip.[7]
In July 1987, Bill's Casino Lake Tahoe opened.[7] Harrah's Laughlin opened in August 1988.[7]
The Promus Companies[edit]
The company now known as Caesars Entertainment was formed in 1990 as The Promus Companies. To effect the sale of the Holiday Inn hotel business to Bass PLC, Promus was created as a corporate spin-off, holding Harrah's, Embassy Suites, Homewood Suites, and Hampton Inn; Bass then acquired Holiday Corp., which retained only the Holiday Inn assets.[10] The next year, the company's headquarters moved from Reno to Memphis, Tennessee[11]
In April 1992, the Holiday Casino was rebranded as Harrah's Las Vegas.[7]
The late 1980s and early 1990s saw a rapid increase in gambling markets with the growth of Indian gaming and legalization of riverboat casinos. In 1993 and 1994, the company opened Harrah's Joliet,[12] Harrah's Vicksburg,[13] Harrah's Tunica,[14] Harrah's Black Hawk,[15] Harrah's Central City,[15] Harrah's Shreveport,[16] Harrah's North Kansas City,[17] and Harrah's Ak-Chin.[18]
Renamed as Harrah's Entertainment, Inc.[edit]

In 1995, Promus decided to spin off its non-gaming hotel businesses, in part because they had been undervalued by investors due to perception of the company as a risky gaming stock.[19] Promus Hotel Corp. was established, holding Embassy Suites, Hampton Inn, and Homewood Suites, while the parent company, holding 16 casinos, was renamed as Harrah's Entertainment.[20]
Harrah's continued its expansion over the next ten years, opening Harrah's Skagit Valley,[21] Harrah's Sky City,[22] Harrah's St. Louis-Riverport,[23] Harrah's Cherokee,[24] Harrah's Prairie Band,[25] Harrah's New Orleans,[26] and Harrah's Rincon,[27] and acquiring the Southern Belle Casino,[28] Showboat, Inc.,[29] the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino,[30] Players International,[31] Harveys Casino Resorts,[32] Louisiana Downs,[33] Horseshoe Gaming,[34] and the World Series of Poker.[35]
In 1997, Harrah's launched its Total Gold loyalty program (renamed as Total Rewards in 2000[36]), developed at a cost of $20 million.[37] It was the first gaming company to offer a systemwide comps program, allowing points earned at one casino to be redeemed for goods and services at any of the company's other casinos.[38] The system would be credited as a major driver of Harrah's growth over the coming years.[39]
Harvard Business School professor Gary Loveman joined Harrah's as chief operating officer in 1998,[40] and would go on to serve as chief executive officer from 2003 to 2015.[39][41]
In 1999, the company moved its headquarters from Memphis to Las Vegas.[42]
Purchase of Caesars Entertainment[edit]
Harrah's made its largest single expansion in 2005, when it acquired Caesars Entertainment, Inc. for $10.4 billion.[43] Negotiations were spurred on by news of a merger agreement between MGM Mirage and Mandalay Resort Group.[44] The two companies sold several properties ahead of the merger to assuage antitrust concerns, including Harrah's East Chicago and Harrah's Tunica.[45] The acquisition increased Harrah's portfolio to 40 casinos, plus four cruise ship casinos.[46] The deal furthered Harrah's goal of gaining a larger presence on the Las Vegas Strip, where Caesars owned four casinos,[47] and improved its ability to market to high rollers.[48]
Harrah's began to push for a larger international presence in 2005, announcing joint venture agreements to build casinos in Spain, Slovenia, and the Bahamas, and applying for a license to build a major resort in Singapore,[49] though none of these projects would come to fruition. Harrah's also acquired London Clubs International in 2006,[50] and the Macau Orient Golf club in 2007.[51]
From 2005 to 2010, the company consolidated control of a long stretch of the east side of the Las Vegas Strip, acquiring the Bourbon Street,[52] Imperial Palace,[53] Barbary Coast,[54][55] and Planet Hollywood[56] casinos, along with large tracts of land behind the Strip properties.[57][58]
In 2005 and 2006, Harrah's closed its Lake Charles casino due to damage from Hurricane Rita, sold the Flamingo Laughlin, and sold Grand Casino Gulfport.
Company goes private[edit]
Loveman at some point sought advice from private equity tycoon David Bonderman about the possibility of spinning off ownership of Harrah's real estate as a separate real estate investment trust (REIT), hoping to attain the higher price-to-earnings ratios at which hotel companies traded, compared to gaming companies.[59] In 2006, the discussions evolved toward the idea of a leveraged buyout of Harrah's by Bonderman's company, TPG Capital.[59] Another private equity firm, Apollo Global Management, approached Loveman about a buyout, and he encouraged them to collaborate with TPG.[59] By the end of the year, an agreement was announced for the two companies to buy Harrah's for $17.1 billion in cash plus $10.7 billion in assumed debt.[60] The transaction closed in January 2008, leaving Harrah's with $25.1 billion in debt.[61]
The Linq[edit]
It was widely announced in previous years that the company planned to implode properties and build new ones from scratch, but after the market downturn the company conceded that it had little experience in building major resorts. Instead it developed Project LINQ in 2009, which calls for retaining and improving all existing buildings while adding a collection of about 20 restaurants and bars to be built along a winding corridor between the company's Imperial Palace, O'Sheas and Flamingo casinos, on the east side of the Strip. It is an attempt to create the kind of entertainment district that has developed organically in cities such as Los Angeles, Memphis and New Orleans yet is lacking on the Strip, with its enclosed, casino-centric zones.[62] If this new zone is successful it will provide competition for the Fremont Street Experience.
New Las Vegas Arena[edit]
The Anschutz Entertainment Group first tried to build an arena in Las Vegas in association with Harrah's Entertainment. In 2007, the joint venture announced they would build a 20,000 seat stadium behind the Bally's and Paris casino-hotels.[63] Caesars Entertainment, Inc. had previously envisioned using the location to build a baseball park, but the company's buyout by Harrah's cancelled the plans. Through the following year, Harrah's got uncertain on continuing with the project, not knowing if AEG would split the costs, and whether building a major league-ready stadium without a guaranteed franchise to play on it would be feasible given the enduring financial crisis.[64] The original plans were to break ground in June 2008 and finish the arena in 2010, but by 2009, it was revealed the stalled project had not even done a traffic study despite being located near a busy intersection.[65] In 2010, the plans were changed to use an area behind the Imperial Palace. However, given the financing would require a special taxation district, opposition from Clark County regarding using public money in the project stalled it even further.[66] AEG eventually backed out completely by 2012, once MGM Resorts International came up with their own project using a terrain behind the New York-New York and Monte Carlo resorts. This attracted AEG primarily for not relying on public funding.[67]
The acquisition of Planet Hollywood provided Harrah's with a contiguous 126-acre (51 ha) property bordering the strip. The vacant lots behind the casinos had been slated for a sports arena large enough to hold a professional basketball or hockey team. The three casinos will have over 8,000 rooms which can be directly connected to the arena.
It was announced in August 2010 that Harrah's would run casinos in Cincinnati, Ohio and Cleveland, Ohio when they open in 2012.
Rename to Caesars Entertainment Corp.[edit]
In November 2010 plans for an IPO were canceled, but a planned name change from Harrah's Entertainment Inc to Caesars Entertainment Corp did go forward as planned and was made official November 23, 2010. This change was intended to capitalize on the international name recognition enjoyed on the Caesars name brand. The Harrah's brand would remain one of the company's three primary casino brands.[68]
On February 8, 2012, an initial public offering took place, with the common stock trading on the NASDAQ under the symbol "CZR."[69]
Caesars Acquisition Company merger[edit]
On December 22, 2014, Caesars announced its intention to acquire Caesars Acquisition Company.[70] Under the terms of the transaction, shareholders of Caesars Acquisition Company will receive 0.664 share of Caesars Entertainment common stock for each share of Caesars Acquisition Company held.
Casino unit files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy[edit]
The casino operating unit of Caesars Entertainment filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on January 15, 2015.[71]
On November 2, 2015, the Rock Gaming announced it would begin assuming management of Horseshoe Casino Cleveland, Horseshoe Casino Cincinnati, and ThistleDown Racino from Caesars Entertainment, and complete the transition by June 2016.[72][73]
Playtika Company acquisition and sale[edit]
Caesars Entertainment Corporation (via its Harrah’s casino brand) acquired Playtika in May 2011 for an amount between $80 and $90 million.[74] Playtika, a social game developer company, was founded in 2010 by Robert Antokol and Uri Shahak and produced Facebook social gaming platforms (slotomania.com & caesarsgames.com).[citation needed] As of June 2016, a Chinese consortium, which includes Alibaba chief Jack Ma's Yunfeng Capital, agreed to purchase it in a buyout for $4.4 billion.[75]

History[edit]
William F. Harrah era (1937–1978)[edit]
The company's background can be traced to October 29, 1937, when Bill Harrah opened a small bingo parlor in Reno, Nevada, a predecessor to Harrah's Reno.[6][7] In 1955, he expanded to Stateline, Nevada, on the south shore of Lake Tahoe, where he would eventually open Harrah's Lake Tahoe.[8] Harrah's Inc. made its initial public offering in 1971.[9] Following that in 1972, it was listed on the American Stock Exchange and in 1973, Harrah's became the first casino company listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Bill Harrah died on June 30, 1978 of complications from aortic aneurysm and cardiac surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.
Under Holiday Inn[edit]
In February 1980, Holiday Inns acquired Harrah's, Inc. for $300 million. Liquidation of Harrah's collection of almost 7,000 antique automobiles reportedly returned the full purchase price of the company to Holiday Inn. Holiday Inn at the time had interests in two casinos: the under-construction Holiday Inn Marina Casino in Atlantic City, and a 40 percent stake in the Holiday Casino, adjacent to the Holiday Inn hotel on the Las Vegas Strip.[7]
In July 1987, Bill's Casino Lake Tahoe opened.[7] Harrah's Laughlin opened in August 1988.[7]
The Promus Companies[edit]
The company now known as Caesars Entertainment was formed in 1990 as The Promus Companies. To effect the sale of the Holiday Inn hotel business to Bass PLC, Promus was created as a corporate spin-off, holding Harrah's, Embassy Suites, Homewood Suites, and Hampton Inn; Bass then acquired Holiday Corp., which retained only the Holiday Inn assets.[10] The next year, the company's headquarters moved from Reno to Memphis, Tennessee[11]
In April 1992, the Holiday Casino was rebranded as Harrah's Las Vegas.[7]
The late 1980s and early 1990s saw a rapid increase in gambling markets with the growth of Indian gaming and legalization of riverboat casinos. In 1993 and 1994, the company opened Harrah's Joliet,[12] Harrah's Vicksburg,[13] Harrah's Tunica,[14] Harrah's Black Hawk,[15] Harrah's Central City,[15] Harrah's Shreveport,[16] Harrah's North Kansas City,[17] and Harrah's Ak-Chin.[18]
Renamed as Harrah's Entertainment, Inc.[edit]

In 1995, Promus decided to spin off its non-gaming hotel businesses, in part because they had been undervalued by investors due to perception of the company as a risky gaming stock.[19] Promus Hotel Corp. was established, holding Embassy Suites, Hampton Inn, and Homewood Suites, while the parent company, holding 16 casinos, was renamed as Harrah's Entertainment.[20]
Harrah's continued its expansion over the next ten years, opening Harrah's Skagit Valley,[21] Harrah's Sky City,[22] Harrah's St. Louis-Riverport,[23] Harrah's Cherokee,[24] Harrah's Prairie Band,[25] Harrah's New Orleans,[26] and Harrah's Rincon,[27] and acquiring the Southern Belle Casino,[28] Showboat, Inc.,[29] the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino,[30] Players International,[31] Harveys Casino Resorts,[32] Louisiana Downs,[33] Horseshoe Gaming,[34] and the World Series of Poker.[35]
In 1997, Harrah's launched its Total Gold loyalty program (renamed as Total Rewards in 2000[36]), developed at a cost of $20 million.[37] It was the first gaming company to offer a systemwide comps program, allowing points earned at one casino to be redeemed for goods and services at any of the company's other casinos.[38] The system would be credited as a major driver of Harrah's growth over the coming years.[39]
Harvard Business School professor Gary Loveman joined Harrah's as chief operating officer in 1998,[40] and would go on to serve as chief executive officer from 2003 to 2015.[39][41]
In 1999, the company moved its headquarters from Memphis to Las Vegas.[42]
Purchase of Caesars Entertainment[edit]
Harrah's made its largest single expansion in 2005, when it acquired Caesars Entertainment, Inc. for $10.4 billion.[43] Negotiations were spurred on by news of a merger agreement between MGM Mirage and Mandalay Resort Group.[44] The two companies sold several properties ahead of the merger to assuage antitrust concerns, including Harrah's East Chicago and Harrah's Tunica.[45] The acquisition increased Harrah's portfolio to 40 casinos, plus four cruise ship casinos.[46] The deal furthered Harrah's goal of gaining a larger presence on the Las Vegas Strip, where Caesars owned four casinos,[47] and improved its ability to market to high rollers.[48]
Harrah's began to push for a larger international presence in 2005, announcing joint venture agreements to build casinos in Spain, Slovenia, and the Bahamas, and applying for a license to build a major resort in Singapore,[49] though none of these projects would come to fruition. Harrah's also acquired London Clubs International in 2006,[50] and the Macau Orient Golf club in 2007.[51]
From 2005 to 2010, the company consolidated control of a long stretch of the east side of the Las Vegas Strip, acquiring the Bourbon Street,[52] Imperial Palace,[53] Barbary Coast,[54][55] and Planet Hollywood[56] casinos, along with large tracts of land behind the Strip properties.[57][58]
In 2005 and 2006, Harrah's closed its Lake Charles casino due to damage from Hurricane Rita, sold the Flamingo Laughlin, and sold Grand Casino Gulfport.
Company goes private[edit]
Loveman at some point sought advice from private equity tycoon David Bonderman about the possibility of spinning off ownership of Harrah's real estate as a separate real estate investment trust (REIT), hoping to attain the higher price-to-earnings ratios at which hotel companies traded, compared to gaming companies.[59] In 2006, the discussions evolved toward the idea of a leveraged buyout of Harrah's by Bonderman's company, TPG Capital.[59] Another private equity firm, Apollo Global Management, approached Loveman about a buyout, and he encouraged them to collaborate with TPG.[59] By the end of the year, an agreement was announced for the two companies to buy Harrah's for $17.1 billion in cash plus $10.7 billion in assumed debt.[60] The transaction closed in January 2008, leaving Harrah's with $25.1 billion in debt.[61]
The Linq[edit]
It was widely announced in previous years that the company planned to implode properties and build new ones from scratch, but after the market downturn the company conceded that it had little experience in building major resorts. Instead it developed Project LINQ in 2009, which calls for retaining and improving all existing buildings while adding a collection of about 20 restaurants and bars to be built along a winding corridor between the company's Imperial Palace, O'Sheas and Flamingo casinos, on the east side of the Strip. It is an attempt to create the kind of entertainment district that has developed organically in cities such as Los Angeles, Memphis and New Orleans yet is lacking on the Strip, with its enclosed, casino-centric zones.[62] If this new zone is successful it will provide competition for the Fremont Street Experience.
New Las Vegas Arena[edit]
The Anschutz Entertainment Group first tried to build an arena in Las Vegas in association with Harrah's Entertainment. In 2007, the joint venture announced they would build a 20,000 seat stadium behind the Bally's and Paris casino-hotels.[63] Caesars Entertainment, Inc. had previously envisioned using the location to build a baseball park, but the company's buyout by Harrah's cancelled the plans. Through the following year, Harrah's got uncertain on continuing with the project, not knowing if AEG would split the costs, and whether building a major league-ready stadium without a guaranteed franchise to play on it would be feasible given the enduring financial crisis.[64] The original plans were to break ground in June 2008 and finish the arena in 2010, but by 2009, it was revealed the stalled project had not even done a traffic study despite being located near a busy intersection.[65] In 2010, the plans were changed to use an area behind the Imperial Palace. However, given the financing would require a special taxation district, opposition from Clark County regarding using public money in the project stalled it even further.[66] AEG eventually backed out completely by 2012, once MGM Resorts International came up with their own project using a terrain behind the New York-New York and Monte Carlo resorts. This attracted AEG primarily for not relying on public funding.[67]
The acquisition of Planet Hollywood provided Harrah's with a contiguous 126-acre (51 ha) property bordering the strip. The vacant lots behind the casinos had been slated for a sports arena large enough to hold a professional basketball or hockey team. The three casinos will have over 8,000 rooms which can be directly connected to the arena.
It was announced in August 2010 that Harrah's would run casinos in Cincinnati, Ohio and Cleveland, Ohio when they open in 2012.
Rename to Caesars Entertainment Corp.[edit]
In November 2010 plans for an IPO were canceled, but a planned name change from Harrah's Entertainment Inc to Caesars Entertainment Corp did go forward as planned and was made official November 23, 2010. This change was intended to capitalize on the international name recognition enjoyed on the Caesars name brand. The Harrah's brand would remain one of the company's three primary casino brands.[68]
On February 8, 2012, an initial public offering took place, with the common stock trading on the NASDAQ under the symbol "CZR."[69]
Caesars Acquisition Company merger[edit]
On December 22, 2014, Caesars announced its intention to acquire Caesars Acquisition Company.[70] Under the terms of the transaction, shareholders of Caesars Acquisition Company will receive 0.664 share of Caesars Entertainment common stock for each share of Caesars Acquisition Company held.
Casino unit files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy[edit]
The casino operating unit of Caesars Entertainment filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on January 15, 2015.[71]
On November 2, 2015, the Rock Gaming announced it would begin assuming management of Horseshoe Casino Cleveland, Horseshoe Casino Cincinnati, and ThistleDown Racino from Caesars Entertainment, and complete the transition by June 2016.[72][73]
Playtika Company acquisition and sale[edit]
Caesars Entertainment Corporation (via its Harrah’s casino brand) acquired Playtika in May 2011 for an amount between $80 and $90 million.[74] Playtika, a social game developer company, was founded in 2010 by Robert Antokol and Uri Shahak and produced Facebook social gaming platforms (slotomania.com & caesarsgames.com).[citation needed] As of June 2016, a Chinese consortium, which includes Alibaba chief Jack Ma's Yunfeng Capital, agreed to purchase it in a buyout for $4.4 billion.[75]

Caesars Entertainment and Caesars Acquisition also announced today that they have individually scheduled special meetings of Caesars Entertainment and Caesars Acquisition stockholders in connection with the pending Merger.

Caesars Entertainment and Caesars Acquisition expect to begin mailing the joint proxy statement/prospectus to their respective stockholders in the coming days that will contain information for stockholders of both companies, as well as instructions for voting.
Caesars Entertainment and Caesars Acquisition continue to engage with regulators in jurisdictions where approvals are required for the Merger and other aspects of CEOC's restructuring. In addition to regulatory approvals and approval by stockholders at the special meetings, the Merger is subject to the completion of CEOC's restructuring and other customary closing conditions.  CEOC's restructuring is subject to the completion of the Merger, certain financing activities, continuing oversight by the United States Bankruptcy Court, and other customary closing conditions.

 The crowd loved you and your performance 
          was amazing!

 The only problem with Tims performance 
          is that we dont know how we can possibly top it next year. 



 Construction Specialties 
          Inc., Pennsylvania




 Tim's performance was the "knock out" 
          we needed to make our 10th Anniversary year a huge success. As you know, 
          it's hard to come up with fresh ideas every year to engage the audience. 
          His performance was truly incredible. He is a terrific showman, and 
          our guests responded immediately with a resounding standing ovation! 
          Tim was SO very easy to work with, he did all he promised and then some.	
        



 George HW Bush Celebrity 
          Golf Classic, Maine




 Each year we find it more difficult 
          to choose a form of entertainment for our annual meeting. Tim made it 
          easy for us this year and we dont think we will be able to top it next 
          year.

          Kansas




 We were extremely pleased with the 
          entertainment Tim Decker provided at our recent employee appreciation 
          party. We would highly recommend him. His show is so unique, refreshing 
          and exactly the right length. Our employees loved it. Tim was very flexible 
          and gave us just the show we wanted.
