What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

3 Home Care Population Health Lessons from the Dutch

                                Posted by

I always found "the Dutch" confusing... If we're talking about "the Spanish," the country is called Spain, the language is Spanish, and the people are either called "the Spanish" or Spaniards. It all makes sense.  By contrast, the Dutch people are from the country sometimes referred to as the Netherlands and other times referred to as Holland. It's all quite confusing...
Nonetheless, the Dutch have come up with an interesting "neighborhood care model" that I learned about in this article.
Neighborhood Care Model
In summary, the neighborhood care model in the Netherlands works as follows:



There is a self-managed team of nurses providing the care


Rather than only providing the nursing portion of the services, the nurses are performing all needed home care tasks related to Activities of Daily Living (ADLs).


A team of about 10 nurses is able to manage the care needs for a town of around 10,000 people. Of course only a small number of residents need care.


On average a nurse sees 4 patients per day


One factor that makes this model possible is that all citizens have the same government provided insurance, so the nurses can collaborate easily with the associated physicians and don't have the burden of marketing and sales.


What Can Home Care in the US learn from This Dutch Model?
At Ankota, we focus on the "next generation of home care" and a big aspect of that is driven by demographics. Most importantly, the population of Americans over 80 (a good indicator for the home care market size) will triple in the next 20 years. We believe that, by necessity, the US model will need to change to a home care model where caregivers are providing services for multiple care recipients in a neighborhood model. 
Here are some specific points to ponder and items we can learn from the Dutch model:

The care focuses on a community and embraces "population health" (which we don't seem to be embracing here in the US as explained in this article about The Triple Aim).
Today in the US model, there are multiple visits to the home by specialists (nurse, aide, etc.) whereas in this Dutch model one person (a nurse) is doing all of the services. We believe in this model but don't think we'll have enough nurses and will instead want a model where home health aides are providing the care (and doing more med related tasks like loading pill-boxes under the training and direction of nurses)
We further believe that by having a caregiver provide services to multiple proximate care recipients instead of the current norm of seeing one care recipient per day, that we'll be able to pay caregivers a living wage with benefits.


Next Generation Home Care from Ankota

5 Finance Tips for Healthcare Administrators

Today's guest post comes from Dixie Somers, a freelance writer from Arizona. Please enjoy Dixie's article.
To operate a successful medical institution, healthcare administrators are required to keep accurate and meticulous financial records. However, economic challenges often make it harder for healthcare administrators to effectively meet the hospitals financial obligations. The following tips can assist a healthcare administrator in effectively operating a health center.
Have Clear Guidelines
Healthcare administrators should advise the hospital staff to be keen on checking the patients’ insurance eligibility before each visit. While hospitals have different policies on evaluating their patients’ insurance, it is advisable to make sure that a patient’s insurance information is always updated. Furthermore, you can ensure that non-insured patients are advised to always have a form of payment when coming for their appointment. Make certain that all the financial policies are communicated clearly to the patients so that they are not caught off guard.
Updated Records
In a busy medical establishment, it is easy to overlook some minor details in the records. For instance, medical equipment that is no longer in use should be removed from the hospital and also clearly indicated on the records to avoid paying unnecessary insurance. Thankfully, electronic records are much easier to manage than they used to be.
Staff Turnover
Those with a PhD in nursing know that staff turnover can have negative impact on a medical institution. It takes a lot of resources and time to train new employees. Therefore, it is better to address underlying issues within the organization and seek effective solutions.
Easy Payment
To efficiently operate a healthcare center, you must adopt various forms of payment methods. For instance, patients should have the option of using credit, debit, or cash payments for their appointment. To avoid delays and inconveniences, make sure that the medical facility accommodates variety forms of payment methods. Patients will opt to go an institution that has no limitations in terms of payment methods. The payment options can be communicated to the patients prior to their appointment.
Avoid Outstanding Balances
For a healthcare to operate smoothly, there has to be sufficient cash flow. In most cases, the major cause of limited or inadequate cash flow is unpaid patient fees. For this reason, it is important to ensure that your patients’ insurance premiums are fully paid. In case of outstanding balances, you can give the patients a grace period of a few days to clear he debt. Most importantly, communicate to the patients the importance of paying up their medical insurance.
Conclusion
As a healthcare administrator, you should ensure that you clearly communicate the hospitals financial policies to all the relevant parties. Perhaps the most important policy is financial regulations. It is important for the staff of the hospital to understand the financial policies so that they can clearly communicate it to the patients.

Today's article is by Jason Chagnon from Providentia Marketing.  Jason and Providentia's goals are to help to drive client referrals and attract caregivers to your agency.  In today's blog, he offers an introduction on how to improve your SEO, your website performance, and ultimately, how to improve your marketing.  Enjoy his post (below) and feel free to leave a comment!
Your home care website is responsive. Fast. Secure. And delivers an amazing user experience.
What else should you be doing to ensure it generates solid leads and attracts more qualified clients?
You need a plan – for content and backlinks, that is. In this final installment of our SEO in 2017 post series, we’ll explain why an ongoing content plan and a plan for obtaining relevant backlinks are critical to your home care website’s ongoing SEO.
Missed the first two posts in this series? Read them here:
SEO in 2017: A Checklist for Your Home Care Firm
SEO in 2017: Boost Website Rankings and Conversions with Speed, Security & UX
Part 3: You Need a Plan
Well, two plans, actually, if you want to rank well with Google:
Do You Have an Ongoing Content Plan?
Back in 2011, Google made a core algorithm change to reward websites that were regularly providing fresh and relevant content. Not only is fresh content seen as a plus by search engines, it tells humans you’re alive and well.
Every home care agency should have a long-term content plan in mind based on specific goals. Do you need more clients or do you need more caregivers? If you need more clients, are you creating content that appeals to those in need of care? If you need more caregivers, are you writing information that is helpful to job seekers?
For ongoing SEO, content creation is key to your survival. Your content is an asset, and the best way to get people started down the sales funnel.
Do You Have a Plan to Obtain Backlinks from Niche-Relevant Websites?
Backlinks are, and will continue to be, a core part of Google’s algorithm. It’s the one thing that cannot be easily manipulated, but it’s perhaps the most powerful ranking signal.
Not all backlinks are created equal. Obtaining links from irrelevant nameless blogs may not do anything for your rankings. In fact, low-quality links may actually harm your ability to rank well. The real movement happens when you obtain quality backlinks from authoritative, niche-relevant websites. There are many ways to obtain high-quality backlinks legitimately, but manual outreach and custom content creation is still the most effective approach. Please note, this post isn’t meant to be a comprehensive approach for link building. It’s simply intended to highlight the importance of having a backlink outreach strategy within your ongoing SEO plan.
Final Thoughts for 2017
As Google becomes more sophisticated in its ranking criteria, so does the job of an SEO expert. Building a home care website for both search engines and humans can be a challenge if you don’t have the proper experience. At Providentia Marketing, we can guide you through the process of building a modern and engaging website that leads to conversions. Contact us today and let’s talk about your goals!

Homes of the Future - Home Care Ready

 One of the industry experts I learn from every time we speak is Ginny Kenyon, principal at Kenyon Home Care Consulting.  Ginny helps open home care agencies and has given Ankota great inputs on our software.  We at Ankota strongly believe that keeping elderly people healthy and comfortable in their homes (and out of the hospital) is an important step in the evolution of healthcare.  Ginny is one of the pioneers driving moves in home health delivery.  Enjoy her post (below).

The Universal Homes Of The Future
I am hearing more and more about Universal homes these days and it is beginning to appear in home health related news. “Universal design, also called barrier-free design, focuses on making the house safe and accessible for everyone, regardless of age, physical ability, or stature. True aging in place!
When thinking of home design for disabilities, most of us think immediately of ramps and grab bars when we think of accessible housing, but universal design goes far beyond that while remaining largely invisible to the casual observer. In fact, applying universal design concepts such as wider doors and hallways makes a house feel more spacious.”
As Fred Astaire said, “Old age is like everything else,”. “To make a success of it, you’ve got to start young.” These same principles apply to home design: Plan for all stages of life when remodeling or building, even if you are in perfect health now. You never know what life may throw your way, be it be a minor mishap (breaking your leg) or something more serious (being confined to a wheelchair)”
The most important aspect of Universal Design is flexibility. Remember that technologies are always evolving and your lifestyle is similarly inclined to change at a moment’s notice. Universal Design allows your home to transition with you as life happens rather than forcing you to work around frustrating barriers.
So, what will the home of the future look like?  The following is just a beginning of what I am seeing architects begin to incorporate into home designs:


There will be limited use of stairs,


lighting systems will be automatic, coming on when someone enters a space and turn off when they leave [motion sensors]


large windows, French doors, placed throughout the house to maximize natural lighting. Additionally, the use of skylights and solar tubes to bring in natural light


Curbless showers, grab bars designed to look like part of the feature not like an addition, towel and robe hooks next to the shower, recessed storage in the shower for soap, shampoo and conditioner


Faucets throughout the house that works with touch or movement


Levered handles on doors


Soft slide cabinet and drawers that require little effort to open and close


Slip resistant floors


Cabinets that sit on the counter space for easy access


Increased space between areas especially in the kitchen that accommodate a wheelchair or a walker


These are a few of the elements that we will be seeing in all home designs and remodels.

3 Tips for Homecare Agency to Improve Website Rankings and Conversions

Today's article is by Jason Chagnon from Providentia Marketing.  Jason and Providentia's goals are to help to drive client referrals and attract caregivers to your agency.  In today's blog, he offers an introduction on how to improve your SEO, your website performance, and ultimately, how to improve your marketing.  Enjoy his post (below) and feel free to leave a comment!

Want your home care website to rank better, generate more leads and attract more qualified candidates? Then this series of posts on SEO is a must-read! In our first installment, we explained how responsive design and AMP technology make both Google and your site visitors happy.Today, we’ll explain three more factors which dramatically impact your home care website’s SEO and overall effectiveness as a marketing engine.
Speed, Security and UX Matter.
Is your home care website fast?
Here are some facts about website speed that will surprise you about the behavior of your fellow humans.


47% of consumers expect a web page to load in 2 seconds or less.


A 1-second delay in page response can result in a 7% reduction in conversions.


40% of people abandon a website that takes more than 3 seconds to load.


Now consider this…


If an e-commerce site is making $100,000 per day, a 1-second page delay could potentially cost you $2.5 million in lost sales every year.


If the customer is always right, then most of us have a lot of work to do. Building a fast website starts with a solid framework. You can always optimize an old site to make it faster, but that’s like putting a turbo on an old Civic. The fastest cars (Ferrari and Lamborghini) are built from the ground up with performance in mind. To get the most out of your website, consider the following:


Do you have fast web hosting?


Do you have proper caching implemented?


Did you minify JavaScript and CSS files?


Do you utilize a CDN (Content Delivery Network)?


Are your images properly compressed?


Does the website use clean code with lightweight plugins?


Is your website secure with SSL?
In 2014, Google encouraged webmasters to use SSL encryption on their websites to improve data security. Google’s initiative to create a secure web prompted them to provide slight boosts to SSL compliant websites within the search results. In 2016, Google told webmasters that unencrypted sites would soon be marked as “unsafe” by displaying a red “x” over a padlock in the Chrome browser. Although this has not officially been rolled out yet, it’s on Google’s timeline. Many consider this to be a form of shaming for unencrypted websites, but the truth of the matter is, HTTP is not secure, and HTTPS is secure. If you are not utilizing SSL encryption, you’re two years late to the party, and this should be at the top of your list for 2017.
Is it built with user experience in mind?
The ultimate goal of your website should be to drive new business. This means conversions should be the main priority. Each page should be designed with user intent in mind. For example, ask yourself, “If a user looking for home care services lands on this page, will they find what they are looking for?” If the answer is no, you have two choices:


Fix the page, so the answer is yes.


Optimize the page using different terms that are more relevant to the page’s content.


With user engagement slowly becoming a core part of Google’s algorithm, gone are the days of keyword stuffing to rank. Your website must offer value to the user and answer their query. It’s that simple. Of course, keyword optimization is still a large part of whether a page can “stick” for a query. But more weight should be given to the following items:


Encouraging users to stay on your website


Encouraging users to visit more pages on your site


Encourage users to contact you


Keep in mind that Google will not be a paying customer. It’s the humans that find you through Google will want to do business with you!

Jane Anderson is a person who loves to write an article on various topics such as health, gardening, lawn care etc. He spends his time doing things that make him feel happy like gardening. He believes yard is an important part of the house. For more information visit yardday.com
There’s no doubt gardening can refresh your mind and spirit. Digging the soil, planting flowers and vegetables and watering them are an instant mood-booster. Your day looks brighter when you see your plants greeting you a pleasant morning.
But aside from the mental and emotional benefits that gardening provides, did you know that it has a positive effect on your health as well?
Yes. Gardening doesn’t just improve your surroundings but also your health as well.
Reduces Stress and Anxiety
Stress and anxiety, if not managed property, can bring harm not just to your mental and emotional state but to your physical health as well. It can lead to eating and sleep disorder as well as conditions such as hyperacidity, hypertension, heart disease and a lot more.
Spending time doing lawn care at the end of a crazy day can lower your stress and anxiety. Having some fresh air and the physical activity required in gardening are an instant mood-booster.
A study conducted where participants went through a stressful activity and then asked to spend 30 minutes gardening while the others were asked to spend 30 minutes reading afterwards showed some interesting results. Both activities reduced stress, but those participants who spent gardening had a bigger impact.
Improves Mental Health
Humans have always found healing and tranquility in nature. Gardening is not only a good physical activity but it also has a positive effect in our mental health.
Just like yoga and meditation, gardening gives us the opportunity to think and focus clearly. It can also lower your risk of Alzheimer’s one study shows. Other research finds that gardening is a good activity for patients with dementia and improves their overall wellbeing.
Improves Sleep
Spending time mending your garden every day can improve your quality of sleep.
The physical activity required in gardening can tire you out and when you’re tired, you get knocked out earlier. Digging, planting, watering and cutting dried leaves are no easy job. Even Samson would need to get some rest after spending some time in the garden. Since it’s a good form of exercise, you will get better sleep as a result.
Another reason why gardening improves your quality of sleep is its ability to reduce stress. When you’re calm and at peace, you will have no trouble going to the dreamland.
Keeps Your Mind Sharp
Sure, brain exercises will keep your mind sharp. Spending time answering mathematical problems will harness your brain’s capacity.
Gardening, on the other hand, offers a sweet alternative way of keeping your mind sharp. It improves your brain health and provides significant stimulation for your brain. According to Huffington Post, gardening improves your mental clarity as well as promotes learning, problem solving and sensory awareness.
Garden fanatics noticed an improved concentration and ability to recover from a mental fatigue. That’s because gardening requires brain stimulation as you have to plan what to plant and schedule gardening tasks and activities.
Promotes Good Nutrition
Gardening is not just a fun physical activity but it also helps you with choosing healthier food choices. 
It’s easy to prepare meals that are healthy and good for the body when you have vegetables in your garden. When you grow your own food, good nutrition follows as it helps you eat more fresh fruits and vegetables. You appreciate and savor the food more because you know how much effort you took to get them to the table.
Start developing a green thumb now and learn the habit of gardening. You’re not just helping Mother Earth through gardening but you’re also helping yourself to become healthier. Plant your first flower or vegetable now and live a happier and longer life.

What Does the Over 80 Population Indicate About the Future of Home Care?

One statistic that is a strong indicator of the future size of the US home care market is the population of Americans over 80. For those of you who have read this blog and downloaded eBooks from Ankota before, you'll recognize the graphic below (courtesy of AARP). What it indicates is that today there are roughly 13 million Americans over 80, but that in the next 20-25 years, that population will more than triple to roughly 40 million people.


Why is the Population Over 80 a Strong Indicator of Home Care Market Size?
In general, there are two large markets for non-medical home care, one made up of the wealthiest population and one made up by the poorest. The wealthy prefer to age in their own homes where they can have the comforts and privacy that they've had throughout their lives. In many cases, the ultra wealthy will have live in care or at least will have in home care for many hours per day.  Surveys of private pay non-medical home care agencies indicate that their average client age is generally in the low 80s, so for this market the growth in the over 80 population is clearly a direct indicator of market growth.  
Similarly, Medicaid programs that service the poor such as the "Aging and Disabled Home Care Waiver Programs" in many of the 50 states have recognized that home care can be less expensive than institutionalized care. There are many varieties of programs including in-home-care and consumer directed services (CDS) programs that subsidize care for the elderly poor. Sadly the average home care recipient age on the Medicaid side is in the 70s as opposed to the 80s for the wealthy.
Another big difference is that the Medicaid programs generally provide fewer hours of care and base the need assessment on the specific personal care and chore activities that are needed to keep the individual at home.  The programs generally pay under $20/hour and average 90 hours of care per recipient per month (for an average cost of $1,800 per month plus management fees). In many cases, this turns out to be significantly more cost effective than institutionalized care and in many of the CDS programs the consumer receiving care is able to select a family member such as a daughter or granddaughter as a care provider.
Despite the difference in the average age of recipients, looking at the growth curve of Americans over 80 gives a strong indication that the home care market will triple in the next 20 years.
What Must We do to Prepare for the Next Generation of Home Care?
The growing elderly population is a strong indicator of what the next generation will bring, but there are other factors as well including a shrinking caregiver pool, a shift in healthcare reimbursement that rewards prevention of hospitalizations, and opportunities offered by digital disruption and transformation.

The US is Only Focusing on Two of the Three Aspects of The Triple Aim

                                Posted by

We've spoken a lot in this blog about The Triple Aim, a mantra defined by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement that prescribes 1) a better care experience, 2) lower costs, and 3) increased population health. You can learn more about The Triple Aim here.


According to this article in the New England Journal of Medicine, this 3rd aim of increasing population health seems to be a "Ghost Aim" that's not being focused on or achieved. We highly encourage you to read the full article (and please note that even though it's in a medical journal it's easy to read).
Why is Population Health "The Ghost Aim?"
In summary, population health seems to be elusive among the three aims of The Triple Aim. The medical journal article astutely points out that only 10% of health outcomes are affected by medical care, whereas 60% are rooted in social and environmental factors and associated behaviors. Plus, smart people like Doctors like to focus on what's in their control, so they are able to make improvements in care experience and able to lower cost, but notable to individually change the health of the population. So the bottom line is that the healthcare community can only have a 10% influence on population health. In order to solve the problem of population health, social factors such as food, electricity, heat, housing and community must be accounted for.
Why Does this Matter to Home Care?
Even NEJM admits that population health has much more to do with what goes on in the home than with what happens in doctor's offices and the hospital. This is where home care comes into play. We in the home care industry have the ability to be the arms and legs of the population health movement. Although we can't solve poverty, we can provide nutrition, cleanliness and some measure of community to at risk people. As more waiver programs for the elderly and disabled embrace the importance of population health, there will be more opportunity for home care agencies to have an impact. The bottom line is that if you're reading this you're in a good industry that fulfills a need growing both in demand and in importance. Thanks for what you do!
But Nobody Said it Was Going to Be Easy...
Home care is growing in size and importance, but unfortunately it's also growing in complexity. Being successful in this business will increasingly require technology that takes the complexities of managed care (managing within authorizations, complying with complex care plans, reassessing on acuity-based timelines with service level agreements, EDI billing and more). Ankota's mission is to take all of this complexity out of the equation for you so you can put your focus on outstanding client care. To learn more, please contact us.

Ankota provides software to improve the delivery of care outside the hospital, focusing on efficiency and care coordination. Ankota's primary focus is on Care Transitions for Readmission avoidance and on management of Private Duty non-medical home care. To learn more, please visit www.ankota.com or contact us.

Tim Rowen and his Home Care Technology Report are fantastic resources for folks in the home care and health care space.  Here on the Ankota blog, we have written a number of articles surrounding his work, including these three select past articles.  Just click the title to be taken to the article:
National Association of Home Care (NAHC) Proposes New Positioning "Healthcare at Home"  
Bundles of Joy? How Bundled Payments will Effect Home Care
Home Health Administrator's Handbook is a Must-Read per Tim Rowan
New Book from Tim and Roger McManus
Along with the above articles and HCTR itself, Tim and Roger McManus have a new book availble on entrepreneur and home care that we feel our readers will be interested in as well.    
Here's a short write-up of the book as well as a link to purchase it.
Summary of the Book from Tim and Roger
The title hits home to those who "walk the walk"; Entrepreneurial Insanity in the Home Care Industry.  It may feel familiar.
The book challenges the owners of home care agencies to look at whether they are limiting their scope to that of a "small business" or they have expanded their view to be that of an entrepreneur.
Arising from the experience of the co-authors, Tim Rowan and Roger McManus, the 180-page book is packed with insights that will have both Private Duty and Home Health agency owners nodding in recognition of their own journey.  Entrepreneurial Insanity combine Roger’s lifetime in business development with Tim’s half a lifetime in Healthcare at Home.   McManus, supplied the brilliant, experienced-based lessons for business owners while Rowan adapted his concepts to specifically target the needs and concerns of Healthcare at Home businesses.
The book defines the question and describes how an agency owner can tell the difference between small business ownership and entrepreneurism.  And, surprisingly, the analysis is less about money than it is about attitude.
"What we have tried to do is get the owner of a healthcare at home business to examine his or her role in the business", Rowan says.  "Interestingly, the owner who is vital to the daily operation of the business – the person the employees know has all the answers – probably owns a business worth far less than the owner who is virtually invisible."
The book was conceived as the co-authors were engineering programs that fully manage the social media programs for agencies, including a special in-home system for publishing positive impressions of patients and their families on review sites like Google, Yelp and Facebook. 
The book is available at the following link:  http://bit.ly/hc-book.

Ankota for HME is built specifically for HME, DME, and Respiratory Therapy businesses with input from world class organizations like yours. It's the only HME software technology with Advanced Optimization, which makes planning schedules and delivery more efficient than any other technology available in the market - guaranteed.
 








Key Features


Use tablets and mobile devices for mobile delivery tracking and point of care documentation


Give your drivers the same level of sophisticated GPS turn-by-turn routing used by FedEx and UPS


Push the routes to mobile devices, an in-unit GPS, or use printed routes


Reschedule deliveries when emergency orders come in or a signature is required but the patient isn't home


Ankota integrates with existing order-entry and billing systems

Special features developed for delivery planners include the simple import of delivery orders from other systems, and the ability to spot-check schedules to find occasions where multiple drivers are going to the same address






 









Key Benefits


Reduce expenses by $600-1200 per vehicle, per month


Drive 25% fewer miles


Support more deliveries with fewer staff


Eliminate Paper Processes


Invoice the same day


 










































In addition to scheduling deliveries, you can schedule a series of different visits:  
Let's say you are a respiratory therapy company with a new oxygen patient.  Depending on your customized template, you can use Ankota to schedule the initial delivery, a follow-up phone call to ensure client satisfaction, a monthly resupply visit, and an equipment inspection and maintenance visit 8 months after initiation.  You can apply this "protocol" on the date you specify and Ankota will schedule all the follow-up calls and visits automatically.  
In addition, those visits will be scheduled to maximize efficiency by minimizing miles.  You are also able to set appointment windows based on the type of service that you are delivering and to set priorities between services.  
 
If winning the business for a new oxygen or apnea patient entails getting there first, Ankota can give you the competitive advantage with minimal effort from your staff.

Ankota's Care Coordination System
For Hospitals, Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs)and Post-Acute Care Providers






















Ankota Technology helps manage Care Transitions, Community-based Care, Population Health, Accountable Care, Transplantation, and Patient-Centered Medical Homes (PCMH)

 

Healthcare Provider Ecosystem
$25 billion spent annually on Avoidable Readmissions; the alarming Rise of Chronic Diseases—which accounts for $3 out of every $4 spent on healthcare; and the Aging of the Population, where 1 out of every 6 Americans will be 65+ by 2030. These trends are giving rise to new programs that employ innovative care delivery models aimed at improving outcomes and reducing overall costs. The rise of Accountability and health care reform assure that more care will be delivered outside of hospital settings and the complexity of that care continues to increase. Providers must collaborate to Plan, Coordinate and Deliver care, requiring new processes and new technologies to support them. Providers are forming collaboratives that will rapidly emerge as “ecosystems,” which will be responsible for managing workflows among providers.
Ankota’s technology is already helping the nation’s top health care providers address these problems head on. By organizing providers into ecosystems, collaborations of providers can operate in fully integrated service models that are patient-centered, well-defined and well-managed. They Cooperate on Transitions, Care Plans, and Delivery of Care. Providers deliver better care with better results and Reduced Readmissions. Patients with chronic conditions are managed in community-based or Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) models, which keeps them healthier and out of the hospital for longer.  The elderly are better supported so that they can remain in their homes longer and live healthier, happier lives. All of this improves lives and lowers the overall cost of care.

From Hospital to Home, Ankota’s technology provides the infrastructure and workflow tools to manage transitions and optimize delivery models – coordinating providers and automating complex scheduling requirements, care planning and real-time tracking of patient visits and health status. Paperless trails for supervision and compliance are integral. Ankota integrates with existing EMRs such as EPIC and Cerner, and leading Care Management Systems (CMS) to leverage the best that technology has to offer.  Ankota’s software is available by subscription and delivered via a hyper-efficient and highly secure Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model. Secure, reliableand fully mobile, Ankota's internet-based products deliver state-of-the-art optimization of staff and resources that reduce operating costs and improve patients' lives.
Are you ready to Plan, Coordinate, and Deliver better care?  Contact Ankota and we'll show you how.

The Ankota NameOur company name is derived from the etymology of the word Ankota.  Native Americans use the word Ankota to describe a healing tree with a complex root structure.  From the medicinal qualities of the tree we derive our connection to health care.  From the root structure and the literal translation of Ankota to mean "many paths" we make the connection to our mission of improving the delivery and coordination of care outside of the hospital setting.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.
