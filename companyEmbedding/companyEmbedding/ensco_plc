Current operations[edit]
Ensco is the world's second-largest offshore drilling and well drilling company, and owns 41 offshore jack-ups, 8 drillships, and 12 semi-submersible drilling rigs.[2][3]
In 2016, 13% of its revenues came from BP and 12% of its revenues came from Total S.A..[2]
The company provides quarterly updates on the status of each rig in its fleet on its website.[3]
History[edit]
ENSCO's predecessor company, Blocker Energy Corporation, was incorporated in 1975 by longtime oilman John R. Blocker.
After graduating from Texas A&M in 1948, Blocker worked on a Gulf of Mexico oil rig for several years. In 1954, he established a South Texas drilling company with his father. When an oversupply of oil on the market crippled the contract drilling business, the company was dissolved. In 1958 Blocker went to work for Dresser Industries as operations manager for the oil equipment division in Argentina and Venezuela, a natural fit because he had grown up in South America, learning Spanish before English. In 1965, he moved to Dresser's Houston office and ultimately rose to the level of a senior vice-president.
In 1975, after the 1973 oil crisis, John Blocker bought Choya Energy, a six-rig contract drilling company based in Alice, Texas, and renamed the company Blocker Energy.[4]
Blocker took advantage of his South American experience to position the company in the international market, believing it was less risky than the United States market, which had 800 to 900 competitors. Blocker Energy took on $44 million in debt to expand rapidly. To fund expansion and pay down debt, the company became a public company via an initial public offering.
By 1980, the company had 1,700 employees worldwide, including 211 at its Texas headquarters. In the early 1980s, Blocker, along with many other oil-related companies, thought the price of oil could only go higher. In 1981 and early 1982, the company borrowed heavily to expand its rig fleet to 54 rigs. However, in late 1982, the price of oil plunged and, to avoid bankruptcy, Blocker Energy restructured, giving 64% of the company to its banks in exchange for $240 million in debt forgiveness. By 1983, the company was only operating 6 rigs, although that number increased to 24 in 1984. By 1985, the worldwide employee count of the company was down to 500.[4]
Blocker Energy lost nearly $3 million in 1985 and needed capital. Richard Rainwater's BEC Ventures made an investment in the company in 1986 and chose Carl F. Thorne to run the company, which he did until his retirement 20 years later.[5]
In 1988, the company acquired Golden Gulf Offshore Inc. and its ten boats that supplied offshore oil rigs and another four vessels that moved the rigs' massive anchors for $64 million in cash and stock.[6]
In 1990, the company bought Penrod Holding Corporation out of bankruptcy and adding 19 rigs to its fleet. Penrod was owned by the Hunt family.[7] The deal was orchestrated by Richard Rainwater who owned 21% of Ensco at that time.[8]
In 2011, Ensco acquired Pride International for $7.3 billion.[9] The acquisition provided Ensco access to the Brazil and West African markets, and diversified its asset base from being largely jack-up rigs to include drillship and semi-submersible rigs. As a result of the acquisition, Ensco closed its Dallas office and consolidated into its Houston office.[10]
In 2010, Ensco moved its headquarters to London and become a UK-registered company.[11]
In 2013, the company was added to the S&P 500 index[12] but it was removed from the index in 2016.[13]
In 2015, Petrobras alleged bribery in the negotiations of the DS-5 rig contract with Pride International in 2008 before its acquisition by Ensco. In 2016, Petrobras terminated the contract for the rig.[14]
In 2017, Ensco agreed to acquire Atwood Oceanics.[15]
Legal issues[edit]
Environmental matters[edit]
In 2009, a Spanish government authority initiated proceedings seeking $3 million in damages for an alleged environmental spill originating from the ENSCO 5006 rig.[2] Ensco expects to be indemnified from any damages by the customer of the rig.[2]

In 1965, he moved to Dresser's Houston office and ultimately rose to the level of a senior vice-president.
In 1975, after the 1973 oil crisis, John Blocker bought Choya Energy, a six-rig contract drilling company based in Alice, Texas, and renamed the company Blocker Energy.[4]
Blocker took advantage of his South American experience to position the company in the international market, believing it was less risky than the United States market, which had 800 to 900 competitors. Blocker Energy took on $44 million in debt to expand rapidly. To fund expansion and pay down debt, the company became a public company via an initial public offering.
By 1980, the company had 1,700 employees worldwide, including 211 at its Texas headquarters. In the early 1980s, Blocker, along with many other oil-related companies, thought the price of oil could only go higher. In 1981 and early 1982, the company borrowed heavily to expand its rig fleet to 54 rigs. However, in late 1982, the price of oil plunged and, to avoid bankruptcy, Blocker Energy restructured, giving 64% of the company to its banks in exchange for $240 million in debt forgiveness. By 1983, the company was only operating 6 rigs, although that number increased to 24 in 1984. By 1985, the worldwide employee count of the company was down to 500.[4]
Blocker Energy lost nearly $3 million in 1985 and needed capital. Richard Rainwater's BEC Ventures made an investment in the company in 1986 and chose Carl F. Thorne to run the company, which he did until his retirement 20 years later.[5]
In 1988, the company acquired Golden Gulf Offshore Inc. and its ten boats that supplied offshore oil rigs and another four vessels that moved the rigs' massive anchors for $64 million in cash and stock.[6]
In 1990, the company bought Penrod Holding Corporation out of bankruptcy and adding 19 rigs to its fleet. Penrod was owned by the Hunt family.[7] The deal was orchestrated by Richard Rainwater who owned 21% of Ensco at that time.[8]
In 2011, Ensco acquired Pride International for $7.3 billion.[9] The acquisition provided Ensco access to the Brazil and West African markets, and diversified its asset base from being largely jack-up rigs to include drillship and semi-submersible rigs. As a result of the acquisition, Ensco closed its Dallas office and consolidated into its Houston office.[10]
In 2010, Ensco moved its headquarters to London and become a UK-registered company.[11]
In 2013, the company was added to the S&P 500 index[12] but it was removed from the index in 2016.[13]
In 2015, Petrobras alleged bribery in the negotiations of the DS-5 rig contract with Pride International in 2008 before its acquisition by Ensco. In 2016, Petrobras terminated the contract for the rig.[14]
In 2017, Ensco agreed to acquire Atwood Oceanics.[15]
Legal issues[edit]
Environmental matters[edit]
In 2009, a Spanish government authority initiated proceedings seeking $3 million in damages for an alleged environmental spill originating from the ENSCO 5006 rig.[2] Ensco expects to be indemnified from any damages by the customer of the rig.[2]

Current operations[edit]
Ensco is the world's second-largest offshore drilling and well drilling company, and owns 41 offshore jack-ups, 8 drillships, and 12 semi-submersible drilling rigs.[2][3]
In 2016, 13% of its revenues came from BP and 12% of its revenues came from Total S.A..[2]
The company provides quarterly updates on the status of each rig in its fleet on its website.[3]
History[edit]
ENSCO's predecessor company, Blocker Energy Corporation, was incorporated in 1975 by longtime oilman John R. Blocker.
After graduating from Texas A&M in 1948, Blocker worked on a Gulf of Mexico oil rig for several years. In 1954, he established a South Texas drilling company with his father. When an oversupply of oil on the market crippled the contract drilling business, the company was dissolved. In 1958 Blocker went to work for Dresser Industries as operations manager for the oil equipment division in Argentina and Venezuela, a natural fit because he had grown up in South America, learning Spanish before English. In 1965, he moved to Dresser's Houston office and ultimately rose to the level of a senior vice-president.
In 1975, after the 1973 oil crisis, John Blocker bought Choya Energy, a six-rig contract drilling company based in Alice, Texas, and renamed the company Blocker Energy.[4]
Blocker took advantage of his South American experience to position the company in the international market, believing it was less risky than the United States market, which had 800 to 900 competitors. Blocker Energy took on $44 million in debt to expand rapidly. To fund expansion and pay down debt, the company became a public company via an initial public offering.
By 1980, the company had 1,700 employees worldwide, including 211 at its Texas headquarters. In the early 1980s, Blocker, along with many other oil-related companies, thought the price of oil could only go higher. In 1981 and early 1982, the company borrowed heavily to expand its rig fleet to 54 rigs. However, in late 1982, the price of oil plunged and, to avoid bankruptcy, Blocker Energy restructured, giving 64% of the company to its banks in exchange for $240 million in debt forgiveness. By 1983, the company was only operating 6 rigs, although that number increased to 24 in 1984. By 1985, the worldwide employee count of the company was down to 500.[4]
Blocker Energy lost nearly $3 million in 1985 and needed capital. Richard Rainwater's BEC Ventures made an investment in the company in 1986 and chose Carl F. Thorne to run the company, which he did until his retirement 20 years later.[5]
In 1988, the company acquired Golden Gulf Offshore Inc. and its ten boats that supplied offshore oil rigs and another four vessels that moved the rigs' massive anchors for $64 million in cash and stock.[6]
In 1990, the company bought Penrod Holding Corporation out of bankruptcy and adding 19 rigs to its fleet. Penrod was owned by the Hunt family.[7] The deal was orchestrated by Richard Rainwater who owned 21% of Ensco at that time.[8]
In 2011, Ensco acquired Pride International for $7.3 billion.[9] The acquisition provided Ensco access to the Brazil and West African markets, and diversified its asset base from being largely jack-up rigs to include drillship and semi-submersible rigs. As a result of the acquisition, Ensco closed its Dallas office and consolidated into its Houston office.[10]
In 2010, Ensco moved its headquarters to London and become a UK-registered company.[11]
In 2013, the company was added to the S&P 500 index[12] but it was removed from the index in 2016.[13]
In 2015, Petrobras alleged bribery in the negotiations of the DS-5 rig contract with Pride International in 2008 before its acquisition by Ensco. In 2016, Petrobras terminated the contract for the rig.[14]
In 2017, Ensco agreed to acquire Atwood Oceanics.[15]
Legal issues[edit]
Environmental matters[edit]
In 2009, a Spanish government authority initiated proceedings seeking $3 million in damages for an alleged environmental spill originating from the ENSCO 5006 rig.[2] Ensco expects to be indemnified from any damages by the customer of the rig.[2]

Current operations[edit]
Ensco is the world's second-largest offshore drilling and well drilling company, and owns 41 offshore jack-ups, 8 drillships, and 12 semi-submersible drilling rigs.[2][3]
In 2016, 13% of its revenues came from BP and 12% of its revenues came from Total S.A..[2]
The company provides quarterly updates on the status of each rig in its fleet on its website.[3]
History[edit]
ENSCO's predecessor company, Blocker Energy Corporation, was incorporated in 1975 by longtime oilman John R. Blocker.
After graduating from Texas A&M in 1948, Blocker worked on a Gulf of Mexico oil rig for several years. In 1954, he established a South Texas drilling company with his father. When an oversupply of oil on the market crippled the contract drilling business, the company was dissolved. In 1958 Blocker went to work for Dresser Industries as operations manager for the oil equipment division in Argentina and Venezuela, a natural fit because he had grown up in South America, learning Spanish before English. In 1965, he moved to Dresser's Houston office and ultimately rose to the level of a senior vice-president.
In 1975, after the 1973 oil crisis, John Blocker bought Choya Energy, a six-rig contract drilling company based in Alice, Texas, and renamed the company Blocker Energy.[4]
Blocker took advantage of his South American experience to position the company in the international market, believing it was less risky than the United States market, which had 800 to 900 competitors. Blocker Energy took on $44 million in debt to expand rapidly. To fund expansion and pay down debt, the company became a public company via an initial public offering.
By 1980, the company had 1,700 employees worldwide, including 211 at its Texas headquarters. In the early 1980s, Blocker, along with many other oil-related companies, thought the price of oil could only go higher. In 1981 and early 1982, the company borrowed heavily to expand its rig fleet to 54 rigs. However, in late 1982, the price of oil plunged and, to avoid bankruptcy, Blocker Energy restructured, giving 64% of the company to its banks in exchange for $240 million in debt forgiveness. By 1983, the company was only operating 6 rigs, although that number increased to 24 in 1984. By 1985, the worldwide employee count of the company was down to 500.[4]
Blocker Energy lost nearly $3 million in 1985 and needed capital. Richard Rainwater's BEC Ventures made an investment in the company in 1986 and chose Carl F. Thorne to run the company, which he did until his retirement 20 years later.[5]
In 1988, the company acquired Golden Gulf Offshore Inc. and its ten boats that supplied offshore oil rigs and another four vessels that moved the rigs' massive anchors for $64 million in cash and stock.[6]
In 1990, the company bought Penrod Holding Corporation out of bankruptcy and adding 19 rigs to its fleet. Penrod was owned by the Hunt family.[7] The deal was orchestrated by Richard Rainwater who owned 21% of Ensco at that time.[8]
In 2011, Ensco acquired Pride International for $7.3 billion.[9] The acquisition provided Ensco access to the Brazil and West African markets, and diversified its asset base from being largely jack-up rigs to include drillship and semi-submersible rigs. As a result of the acquisition, Ensco closed its Dallas office and consolidated into its Houston office.[10]
In 2010, Ensco moved its headquarters to London and become a UK-registered company.[11]
In 2013, the company was added to the S&P 500 index[12] but it was removed from the index in 2016.[13]
In 2015, Petrobras alleged bribery in the negotiations of the DS-5 rig contract with Pride International in 2008 before its acquisition by Ensco. In 2016, Petrobras terminated the contract for the rig.[14]
In 2017, Ensco agreed to acquire Atwood Oceanics.[15]
Legal issues[edit]
Environmental matters[edit]
In 2009, a Spanish government authority initiated proceedings seeking $3 million in damages for an alleged environmental spill originating from the ENSCO 5006 rig.[2] Ensco expects to be indemnified from any damages by the customer of the rig.[2]

Current operations[edit]
Ensco is the world's second-largest offshore drilling and well drilling company, and owns 41 offshore jack-ups, 8 drillships, and 12 semi-submersible drilling rigs.[2][3]
In 2016, 13% of its revenues came from BP and 12% of its revenues came from Total S.A..[2]
The company provides quarterly updates on the status of each rig in its fleet on its website.[3]
History[edit]
ENSCO's predecessor company, Blocker Energy Corporation, was incorporated in 1975 by longtime oilman John R. Blocker.
After graduating from Texas A&M in 1948, Blocker worked on a Gulf of Mexico oil rig for several years. In 1954, he established a South Texas drilling company with his father. When an oversupply of oil on the market crippled the contract drilling business, the company was dissolved. In 1958 Blocker went to work for Dresser Industries as operations manager for the oil equipment division in Argentina and Venezuela, a natural fit because he had grown up in South America, learning Spanish before English. In 1965, he moved to Dresser's Houston office and ultimately rose to the level of a senior vice-president.
In 1975, after the 1973 oil crisis, John Blocker bought Choya Energy, a six-rig contract drilling company based in Alice, Texas, and renamed the company Blocker Energy.[4]
Blocker took advantage of his South American experience to position the company in the international market, believing it was less risky than the United States market, which had 800 to 900 competitors. Blocker Energy took on $44 million in debt to expand rapidly. To fund expansion and pay down debt, the company became a public company via an initial public offering.

In 2013, the company was added to the S&P 500 index[12] but it was removed from the index in 2016.[13]
In 2015, Petrobras alleged bribery in the negotiations of the DS-5 rig contract with Pride International in 2008 before its acquisition by Ensco. In 2016, Petrobras terminated the contract for the rig.[14]

Current operations[edit]
Ensco is the world's second-largest offshore drilling and well drilling company, and owns 41 offshore jack-ups, 8 drillships, and 12 semi-submersible drilling rigs.[2][3]
In 2016, 13% of its revenues came from BP and 12% of its revenues came from Total S.A..[2]
The company provides quarterly updates on the status of each rig in its fleet on its website.[3]
History[edit]
ENSCO's predecessor company, Blocker Energy Corporation, was incorporated in 1975 by longtime oilman John R. Blocker.
After graduating from Texas A&M in 1948, Blocker worked on a Gulf of Mexico oil rig for several years. In 1954, he established a South Texas drilling company with his father. When an oversupply of oil on the market crippled the contract drilling business, the company was dissolved. In 1958 Blocker went to work for Dresser Industries as operations manager for the oil equipment division in Argentina and Venezuela, a natural fit because he had grown up in South America, learning Spanish before English. In 1965, he moved to Dresser's Houston office and ultimately rose to the level of a senior vice-president.
In 1975, after the 1973 oil crisis, John Blocker bought Choya Energy, a six-rig contract drilling company based in Alice, Texas, and renamed the company Blocker Energy.[4]
Blocker took advantage of his South American experience to position the company in the international market, believing it was less risky than the United States market, which had 800 to 900 competitors. Blocker Energy took on $44 million in debt to expand rapidly. To fund expansion and pay down debt, the company became a public company via an initial public offering.
By 1980, the company had 1,700 employees worldwide, including 211 at its Texas headquarters. In the early 1980s, Blocker, along with many other oil-related companies, thought the price of oil could only go higher. In 1981 and early 1982, the company borrowed heavily to expand its rig fleet to 54 rigs. However, in late 1982, the price of oil plunged and, to avoid bankruptcy, Blocker Energy restructured, giving 64% of the company to its banks in exchange for $240 million in debt forgiveness. By 1983, the company was only operating 6 rigs, although that number increased to 24 in 1984. By 1985, the worldwide employee count of the company was down to 500.[4]
Blocker Energy lost nearly $3 million in 1985 and needed capital. Richard Rainwater's BEC Ventures made an investment in the company in 1986 and chose Carl F. Thorne to run the company, which he did until his retirement 20 years later.[5]
In 1988, the company acquired Golden Gulf Offshore Inc. and its ten boats that supplied offshore oil rigs and another four vessels that moved the rigs' massive anchors for $64 million in cash and stock.[6]
In 1990, the company bought Penrod Holding Corporation out of bankruptcy and adding 19 rigs to its fleet. Penrod was owned by the Hunt family.[7] The deal was orchestrated by Richard Rainwater who owned 21% of Ensco at that time.[8]
In 2011, Ensco acquired Pride International for $7.3 billion.[9] The acquisition provided Ensco access to the Brazil and West African markets, and diversified its asset base from being largely jack-up rigs to include drillship and semi-submersible rigs. As a result of the acquisition, Ensco closed its Dallas office and consolidated into its Houston office.[10]
In 2010, Ensco moved its headquarters to London and become a UK-registered company.[11]
In 2013, the company was added to the S&P 500 index[12] but it was removed from the index in 2016.[13]
In 2015, Petrobras alleged bribery in the negotiations of the DS-5 rig contract with Pride International in 2008 before its acquisition by Ensco. In 2016, Petrobras terminated the contract for the rig.[14]
In 2017, Ensco agreed to acquire Atwood Oceanics.[15]
Legal issues[edit]
Environmental matters[edit]
In 2009, a Spanish government authority initiated proceedings seeking $3 million in damages for an alleged environmental spill originating from the ENSCO 5006 rig.[2] Ensco expects to be indemnified from any damages by the customer of the rig.[2]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

S&P 500, Nasdaq snap win streak even as tech giants set records

Ensco to buy Atwood Oceanics in all-stock deal; combined company valued at $6.9 bln
Ensco PLC  shares dropped 5% in pre-market trade Tuesday after the company said that it plans to buy Atwood Oceanics Inc.  in an all-stock deal, with the combined company valued at $6.9 billion. Atwood Oceanics shares skyrocketed 21% in pre-market trade. Under the deal, which could close as soon as the third quarter, Atwood shareholders will receive 1.6 shares of Ensco, valued at $10.72 per Atwood share. Both companies are offshore drillers, and the deal will "strengthen Ensco's position as the leading offshore driller with exposure to deep- and shallow-water markets that span six continents," Ensco said. Ensco expects annual expense savings of $65 million in full year 2019 and beyond, and 2018 cost synergies are expected to be more than $45 million. Ensco shares have plummeted 31.2% over the last three months, and Atwood Oceanics shares have dropped 23.1%, compared with a 2.2% rise in the S&P 500 .

Current operations[edit]
Ensco is the world's second-largest offshore drilling and well drilling company, and owns 41 offshore jack-ups, 8 drillships, and 12 semi-submersible drilling rigs.[2][3]
In 2016, 13% of its revenues came from BP and 12% of its revenues came from Total S.A..[2]
The company provides quarterly updates on the status of each rig in its fleet on its website.[3]
History[edit]
ENSCO's predecessor company, Blocker Energy Corporation, was incorporated in 1975 by longtime oilman John R. Blocker.
After graduating from Texas A&M in 1948, Blocker worked on a Gulf of Mexico oil rig for several years. In 1954, he established a South Texas drilling company with his father. When an oversupply of oil on the market crippled the contract drilling business, the company was dissolved. In 1958 Blocker went to work for Dresser Industries as operations manager for the oil equipment division in Argentina and Venezuela, a natural fit because he had grown up in South America, learning Spanish before English. In 1965, he moved to Dresser's Houston office and ultimately rose to the level of a senior vice-president.
In 1975, after the 1973 oil crisis, John Blocker bought Choya Energy, a six-rig contract drilling company based in Alice, Texas, and renamed the company Blocker Energy.[4]
Blocker took advantage of his South American experience to position the company in the international market, believing it was less risky than the United States market, which had 800 to 900 competitors. Blocker Energy took on $44 million in debt to expand rapidly. To fund expansion and pay down debt, the company became a public company via an initial public offering.
By 1980, the company had 1,700 employees worldwide, including 211 at its Texas headquarters. In the early 1980s, Blocker, along with many other oil-related companies, thought the price of oil could only go higher. In 1981 and early 1982, the company borrowed heavily to expand its rig fleet to 54 rigs. However, in late 1982, the price of oil plunged and, to avoid bankruptcy, Blocker Energy restructured, giving 64% of the company to its banks in exchange for $240 million in debt forgiveness. By 1983, the company was only operating 6 rigs, although that number increased to 24 in 1984. By 1985, the worldwide employee count of the company was down to 500.[4]
Blocker Energy lost nearly $3 million in 1985 and needed capital. Richard Rainwater's BEC Ventures made an investment in the company in 1986 and chose Carl F. Thorne to run the company, which he did until his retirement 20 years later.[5]
In 1988, the company acquired Golden Gulf Offshore Inc. and its ten boats that supplied offshore oil rigs and another four vessels that moved the rigs' massive anchors for $64 million in cash and stock.[6]
In 1990, the company bought Penrod Holding Corporation out of bankruptcy and adding 19 rigs to its fleet. Penrod was owned by the Hunt family.[7] The deal was orchestrated by Richard Rainwater who owned 21% of Ensco at that time.[8]
In 2011, Ensco acquired Pride International for $7.3 billion.[9] The acquisition provided Ensco access to the Brazil and West African markets, and diversified its asset base from being largely jack-up rigs to include drillship and semi-submersible rigs. As a result of the acquisition, Ensco closed its Dallas office and consolidated into its Houston office.[10]
In 2010, Ensco moved its headquarters to London and become a UK-registered company.[11]
In 2013, the company was added to the S&P 500 index[12] but it was removed from the index in 2016.[13]
In 2015, Petrobras alleged bribery in the negotiations of the DS-5 rig contract with Pride International in 2008 before its acquisition by Ensco. In 2016, Petrobras terminated the contract for the rig.[14]
In 2017, Ensco agreed to acquire Atwood Oceanics.[15]
Legal issues[edit]
Environmental matters[edit]
In 2009, a Spanish government authority initiated proceedings seeking $3 million in damages for an alleged environmental spill originating from the ENSCO 5006 rig.[2] Ensco expects to be indemnified from any damages by the customer of the rig.[2]

					Simulators



					Simulate Inputs to aid development!

 

					2 Reasons to Use Simulators

					1) Work on software before connecting to your Sensors and Actuators.

					Don’t have all your sensors and actuators yet?

					Can’t afford to take system offline for long?

					Prove it works before connecting to the real thing.

					Want to connect sensors and actuators one piece at a time?

					With the External Port option, connect as many Digital IO sensors and actuators as you’d like
					and simulate all the rest.  
					Switches let you select pin-by-pin which Analog Inputs you want to simulate using knobs
					and which you want to use real signals from input ports.

					2) Learn to use PLCs.

					They’re a great training tool.  All IO can be simulated.

					Compatible with most Embedded PLC we sell

					With a Simulator, an Embedded Branch Main and Embedded Expansions,
					you can simulate an entire Branch System.

					Simulators can be set up to work with 5volt and 10volt analog ranges. 

 

					Simulator - top and side views

					Terminal Boards




					Ace PLCs come with small, high quality spring-cage capture connectors.
					They’re made for 20-26 AWG wire.

					These connectors along with built in protected inputs and transistor outputs work great 
					for many cases, but sometime you need something more.  We’ve got you covered.




					Larger Screw-Type

					Relay

					Opto-Coupled

					Using a Cable we’ll provide you, wire these Terminal boards to Ace or Branch’s IO ports.
					All Terminal Boards have a built in mount for 15mm DIN Rail or #8 Bolts.
					All Terminal Boards connect to IO with screw-type terminals (30-16 AWG stranded or solid wire.)

					Data Sheets:

					Programming cable




					All Ace and Branch PLCs use a standard USB to Mini-USB cable 
					for programming (like the one in the picture to the left).
					If you’ve already got one, great, it’ll work fine.
					Be careful, this isn't the USB to Micro-USB that comes with many cell phones.
					If not, be sure to add one to your cart.

					DIN Rail Mount

					All Ace and Branch PLCs come standard with a super-strong, 2-sided adhesive strip.
					It bonds well with painted metals, plastics and glass. 
					This stuff is used to attach Sky-Scraper windows to their frames.  We've been impressed with it's strength.




					Adhesive

					(Underside of Ace and Branch PLCs)

					But, what if I want to attach it to a DIN rail, screws, or bolts? You’re in Luck!  

					We’ve got a great add-on that helps you attach your PLC to a 35mm Din rail, or #8 screws or bolts.  




					vMount  

					same thing, just upside down  

					it's got these 2 hooks  

					Ace or Branch underside  

					notice these slots 

					Ace and Branch have four of the slots shown in the image above, to the right. (two aren’t visible). 
					Twist vMount onto your Ace or Branch to attach.  Pick which of the 4 orientations works best for your project.  




					Once attached to your Ace or Branch, rest the topside on your DIN rail. 
					Then press the bottom side down.  It'll snap in place, providing a secure mount.  

					If you'd prefer to mount using #8 screws or bolts, just place you holes 1" apart.
