 YORK Steven K. "Steve" Young, 65, passed away Sunday, May 19, 2013, at Memorial Hospital, York. Mr. Young was born in York on July 8, 1947, son of the late Donald E. and Geraldine D. (Yohe) Young. Steve graduated from Central High School, Class of 1965. After high school, he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and was fortunate to be a member of the United States Air Force Pipe Band as a drummer. This elite unit provided music for State Department and Presidential functions, and toured Europe and U.S. He served his country for three and a half years, after which he attended York Junior College and the University of Illinois, where he eared his Master's Degree in Museum Administration. Upon graduation, Steve worked as a curator for the Historical Society of York for several years and then moved to the Corning Glass Museum, where he was the Director of Education. About ten years later, Steve became the Director of the Fairfield Historic Society, which rehabilitated and maintained historic buildings and artifacts in the area. He retired and returned to York to care for his mother until her death in December, 2011. Steve maintained a close association with the Air Force Pipe Band Alumni Assoc., and the North American Rudimental Drummer's Assoc. Memberships include Mt. Zion United Church of Christ, York, Pleasureville American Legion Post 799, the Hawk Gunning Club, and various national museum organizations. He is survived by his brother, D. Scott Young and his wife, Debra, and his niece, Heather A. Young. Steve was a wonderful, generous person, and he will be greatly missed. A memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. Friday, May 24, 2013, at Mt. Zion United Church of Christ, 1054 Ridgewood Road, York. Officiating will be his pastor, the Rev. Cathy H. Sherry. Burial will be private at the convenience of the family. Following the service, family and friends are invited to attend a reception located at the American Legion Post 799, 2490 Willow St., Pleasureville. In lieu of flowers, Steve would encourage donations to the Mt. Zion United Church of Christ, Endowment Fund, 1054 Ridgewood Road, York, PA 17406. Arrangements were entrusted to the Koller Funeral Home & Cremation Center, York.

FDA Goes 3-D

Posted on August 15, 2013  by  FDA Voice 


By Steven K. Pollack, Ph.D., and James Coburn, M.S.
Dr. Steven Pollack (left) holds a 3D-printed RoboHand, a prosthetic for children with amnionic banding syndrome, an illness that can prevent fingers from developing in children. Research engineer James Coburn (right) uses the 3-D printer (background) in his work in the FDA lab.
The Snap-Together RoboHand prosthetic was invented by South African carpenter Richard van As and made available for free on the Internet. Before printing, the hand can be individually sized, and all connecting pieces are also printed. The device can now be printed for less than $100.
A hospital in Michigan implants a 3-D printed medical device into a 3-month-old boy with a rare bronchial condition and saves a young life.
A man has 75 percent of his skull replaced with a 3-D printed implant.
3-D printing—the process of making a three-dimensional solid object of virtually any shape from a digital model—is making headlines these days, and the technology, once considered the wave of the future, is rapidly becoming part of the present.
It’s spurring innovation in manufacturing, dramatically reducing the time required to design new products and allowing designs to be built that were not possible before.
Here at FDA, we’re using it to expand our research efforts and expand our capabilities to review innovative medical products. In fact, 3-D printing is fast becoming a focus in our practice of regulatory science—that is, the science of developing new tools, standards and approaches to assess the safety, effectiveness, quality and performance of FDA-regulated products.
With 3-D printing, the conversion from a virtual computer model to a physical object can occur almost in real time. The printer translates virtual models into digital cross-sections for use as a blueprint for printing, laying down successive layers in different shapes.
James Coburn adjusts the tension on the feed mechanism for the ABS plastic filament that is the raw material for the RapMan kit 3D printer.
Two laboratories in the FDA’s Office of Science and Engineering Laboratories (OSEL) are investigating how the technology may affect the manufacturing of medical devices in the future.
At our Functional Performance and Device Use Laboratory we’ve developed and adapted computer-modeling methods to help us determine the effect of design changes on the safety and performance of devices when used in different patient populations. The 3-D technology enables us to tweak the design in ways large and small, and to see precisely how those tweaks will change both fit and functionality. In an era of increasingly personalized medicine, which involves the development of treatments that are tailored to an individual patient or a group that shares certain characteristics, including anatomical features, it helps us to fine-tune our evaluation of patient-fitted products.
At our Laboratory for Solid Mechanics we’re investigating how different printing techniques and processes affect the strength and durability of the materials used in medical devices. What we’re discovering will be valuable to our reviews of devices down the road; it will help us to develop standards and set parameters for scale, materials, and other critical aspects that contribute to product safety and innovation.
In August 2012, President Obama launched the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute (NAMII), a national effort bringing together industry, universities and the federal government to provide innovation infrastructure to support new technologies and products created with additive manufacturing, the formal term for 3-D printing.
FDA has a long history of researching and regulating innovative technological practices. Regulators regularly review some of the newest technologies coming onto the market and, through our research, FDA has first-hand knowledge of these advanced techniques so we can evaluate advanced technology at an early stage—a crucial step in facilitating innovation and protecting the public health. We will continue to facilitate device innovation and keep on the cutting edge of technology and regulatory science to help ensure that the products we regulate are safe and effective.

Publisher's Description▼▲
What Happens When You Immerse Your Life in the Words of Jesus? "Jesus words can replace stress with peace, sadness with joy, confusion with guidance, and fear with faith. Thats why Jesus Speaks will not only change your day, but it can also change your life, your relationships, and your eternity!" Christine Caine, best-selling author of Undaunted  "Im certain readers&hellip;will grow in their intimate relationship with the Father as they focus on Jesus words daily through Mr. Scotts profound and encouraging writing." Dr. Charles Stanley, senior pastor of First Baptist Church, Atlanta "I absolutely love Jesus Speaks! I am coming to love Jesus more and more as I gain a deeper understanding of who He is through what He says in His own words!"  Sandi Patty, Grammy Awardwinning Christian artist "Jesus promised that if we abide in Him and His words abide in us, our prayers will be answered, and we will bear much fruit. Jesus Speaks provides an amazing springboard for any believer to abide in His words as never before."  Tommy Barnett, senior pastor of Phoenix First Assembly of God "True intimacy with Christ is achievable. Jesus Speaks can be your first step every morning into His presence." Dr. Ed Young, senior pastor of Second Baptist Church, Houston  "Jesus Speaks is like reading a daily love letter from our Lord and Savior. Steve Scott has focused on the spoken words of Christ in one of the most powerful, clarifying ways possible." Chris Hodges, senior pastor of Church of the Highlands, Alabama "With Jesus Speaks you can immerse your mind, heart, and soul in His words every day!" Josh D. McDowell, author and speaker   "The words I have spoken to youthey are full of the Spirit and life." John 6:63   When Jesus walked this earth, He gave His followers more than one hundred life-changing promises. He also gave more than one hundred teachings for living in line with Gods prioritiescommands that lift us up rather than weigh us down!   This 365-day devotional invites you to let Jesus speak directly into your life. Each reading begins with a red-lettered statement of Jesus, directly from Scripture, followed by a powerful reflection on how He wants us to apply His truths to our daily lives.   No problem you face today is beyond the help of Jesus. No question you ask is beyond the answers of Jesus. The more you get to know this loving Savior, the more you will love Him! So come, immerse yourself in His words. He is speaking to you.

            I love the way this book is written. A friend of mine bought this for me and I believe it is one of the greatest gifts other than my bible that I have received so far in life. Now I buy copies all of the time and give them as gifts. This will help give direction, correction and encouragement to anyone who wants to grow up and be a mature God pleasing Christian.
