Habib K Skaff's Experience
Title: Chief Executive Officer
               Company: Intezyne Technologies, LLC
Job Details
               Company Size: $1 mil to less than $5 mil - Employee Range: Less than 25. Intezyne is dedicated to treating cancer better. Intezyne's breakthrough nanotechnology platform, the IVECT(TM) Method, was invented by the Company's co-founders, Habib Skaff, PhD, and Kevin Sill, PhD, synthetic chemists specializing in nanotechnology and polymer chemistry. IVECT-derived nanoparticles can be generated around a broad array of drugs, from small molecules to peptides/proteins to nucleic acids, making the platform highly versatile in its applicability and scope. These nanoparticles can be enhanced further by adding a desired targeting ligand/receptor to the surface of the nanoparticle. The IVECT-based nanoparticles, therefore, not only dramatically increase the effectiveness of certain anti-cancer therapies, the technology platform also makes possible the creation of completely new therapies. Preclinical work conducted by Intezyne has shown the IVECT-derived anti-cancer nanoparticles preferentially accumulate in tumor cells, thereby sparing the normal healthy cells, and have shown positive preclinical efficacy and safety profiles in multiple cancer models versus best-in-class chemotherapeutic agents. Intezyne currently has three IVECT-based product candidates in development and has conducted numerous product development projects for global pharmaceutical companies.
