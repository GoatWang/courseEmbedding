Steven B. Green













                    
                    Steven B. Green - Green is an experienced actor/screenwriter/improv comedian, and  several more slashes that shall remain nameless.   He has appeared in musicals and plays Off-Broadway, TV Shows and commercials, countless industrial shows, and for many years with the Gotham City Improv Company in NYC.  Currently, he performs improvisational comedy at the L.A. Connection and teaches improv to kids and animals.   Green lives at home in Los Angeles with his wife, three children, two dogs, and too many freaking cats.  However, after reading the final draft of Dennis and his, "Assholeology", Green realized that he had lost his own assholiness quotient sometime after college and now lies somewhere in the middle between a**hole and douche-bag.  Green is hoping, that with the royalties from this book and by applying it's lessons to his own self, that he can reclaim his place amongst the great a**holes of our time.

Work & Playlist: Justin Jay, ShockOne, Tim Green, Steven B.C and More

Aug 10, 2016
 / Insomniac Editorial Team



We've got a pretty eclectic group of music lovers working the controls here, so each week, we put together a batch of our favorite tunes for your listening enjoyment. We do this on the regular, so keep hitting up the Work & Playlist tag to see the latest sounds we love.
 
Dillon Francis & NGHTMRE “Need You” (ShockOne remix)

Hit the deck when you hear this one coming in, as ShockOne ain’t holding nothing back! Released as part of a larger “Need You” remix EP on Mad Decent, featuring the likes of Champagne Drip, Brillz, Trav Piper, A Boy & a Girl, Popsikl and Kooz, it’s this synapse-twisting dubstep relick from ShockOne that has us head-banging the office speakers. Bringing on the cinematic feels with an epic intro that gradually brings on the pressure, the vocal hook and stuttering beats wind it up proper before unleashing the full nature of the beast at the core of this one. Time to wild out and get rowdy with our favorite Aussie in floor-killer mode! —Chris Muniz

Dirt Monkey ft. Clinton Sly ”Work It”

Dirt Monkey has been on my radar for a hot minute, ever since I heard his tune “Move Yo Butt” in a Stanton Warriors mix back in 2012. He released a steady stream of knockout releases spanning all genres of bass music on respected labels, as well as his own Kairos Audio imprint. His self-released album Chroma is coming out soon, and he’s dropped this monster preview track to get you ready for the onslaught of bass-heavy jams that are sure to be heard on stages far and wide for the next year. “Work It” centers itself around a twerkin’ Eastern-inspired riff that dominates the high-end while a booty bass kick rocks the lows. The tune breaks down into some dirty bassline glitch business. If this is a taste of things to come, his album is going to be a solid heater. —Alexander Dias

Tim Green “For a Memory”

This is, like, totally the desert house banger of the summer. “For a Memory” is an intoxicating 11-minute journey, the kind of tune that’ll have you dancing on your tiptoes to the delicacy of its flow. It’s entirely something Lee Burridge would whip out of his stockpile (no shock there—it was released on his label Get Weird), and I wouldn’t be at all surprised to hear this owning the dancefloor at parties like City Hearts or All Day I Dream in the near future. —David Matthews
Follow Tim Green on Facebook | Twitter
 
Justin Jay & Friends ft. Sacha Robotti, Josh Taylor & Henry Was “Broke the Law”

The post-college Justin Jay is going through quite the metamorphosis. Just check out dude’s shaggy new look—beard and moptop and all. The hippy aesthetic matches perfectly with the fresh and funky sound he’s adopting via his latest Justin Jay & Friends project, a live collective composed of some of his musical college buddies. “Broke the Law”—a team-up with homies Sacha Robotti, Josh Taylor and Henry Was—is the stuff you’ll hear at the perfect house party. There’s a futuristic, robotic bassline, playful vocoders, some much-needed cowbell, and enough good vibes to fill a fantastic voyage to the moon and back. “Broke the Law” finds a fitting home with Dirtybird, dance music’s merry pranksters, and it keeps summer alive just a bit longer. —John Ochoa
Follow Justin Jay on Facebook | Twitter
 
Steven B.C “Functionz”

The exponential increase in recording quality over the years, while vastly impressive, has left many listeners craving that close-to-the-heart vintage sound from the olden times. It’s led to a rising demand for saturation plugins, which serve to mimic the analog characteristics that have gotten lost along the way to today’s digitally driven standard. Stephen Be Calm, the side project of Stephane 1993, banks off this burning desire for more authentic practices with his newest Split EP, which sees him sharing release space with VRRS. On his track “Functionz,” B.C throws on the tape saturation thick enough to tickle even the most nostalgic of audiophiles. Stretching the ghetto house vibes over a knockin’ lo-fi rhythm, the tune sounds fresh to death while still delivering the sort of rush you get when gigging to a certifiable throwback. —Sam Yu
