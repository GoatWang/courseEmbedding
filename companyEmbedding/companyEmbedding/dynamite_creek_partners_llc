 HERE IS MORE DETAIL ON SETTING UP  YOUR 
Smoke ShopLLC BUSINESS IN  Cave Creek : 







✔ 1



 To start your LLC business, first, Set up an LLC which you can do here online.
 Otherwise, you will need to select a structure other than the LLC business structure. For example,
 
Selecting a business structure determines how 
  the government will tax you.  For example, an LLC has a more favorable tax treatment compared to a sole owner.
Regardless of legal structure, all businesses need a Business License and an EIN but also need to select a legal stucture choosing from Sole Propritor, 
 Partnership, LLC, or Corproration. 
...more about selecting a structure...





✔ 2



 Thus, file a DBA if you don't file an LLC.  You are required to file a DBA if you are a partneship or a sole owner and you don't form an LLC. If you form an LLC, you need an LLC Certificate if you select the LLC structure etc.
 
A DBA, LLC or Corporation Certificate is Issued by The State.   A DBA  Doing Business As is the registration
of your businesss name. (A DBA is also called a Fictitious /Assumed Business Name or Trade Name. IMPORTANT: YOU DON'T NEED TO FILE A DBA IF YOU FORM AN LLC!

you don't need to file a DBA. ...more about selecting a structure... 




✔ 3



So, all businesses need to select a legal structure, in this case an LLC, and obtain a
Business License 
and   A Federal LLC(EIN) 
(While all businesses must obtain a business license, the EIN is for  Employers, Independent Contractors, LLCs, Partnerships, and Corporations that 
 are required to obtain a federal EIN.  If you are a sole owner independent contractor or an employer, you will need an EIN or you can nevertheless obtain it
 and use it instead of your social sec #. 




✔ 4



Finally, your LLC may need a  Smoke Shop 
Seller's Permit. 
IF... IF,  you want to buy/sell/lease wholesale or sell retail as an LLC (in small amounts) items or materials, You will Need a Seller's Permit 
/ Wholesale Resale State ID,  (You can obtain and use this sales tax ID LLC if you will sell/lease retail or wholesale or buy wholesale any

What is a hookah bar exception license.
                               This is hard to explain for all states, but in some states, they may let you serve food, alcohol, and let people smoke tobacco.  However, in most states, if there is a smoking ban in your state it is just means hookah bars cannot sell food and or have liquor together with the smoke and tobacco services.   In some states, if you are already a hookah bar, you need to apply for a special license. That is you will have to choose whether to sell food or allow tobacco in your establishment.   In  states where there is a tobacco ban, it is prohibited to smoke in most public establishments and food-service environments, including public lounges, restaurants and private clubs. Hookah bars  are no exception, though they can apply for an exemption so long as in most cases, the bar has to stop service food and or alcohol as well in order to maintain the status of a smoke shop. If you are just starting, just make  sure you do not serve food and alcohol in addition to allowing smoking on your premises.  Otherwise, for other head shop and soft drinks and coffee, you can serve it and allow smoking.   A hookah bar may submit an application for a specialty license to qualify as a tobacco specialty retail store, and thus become exempt from the ban. However, in most states, such hookah bars may not have either a food service license or a liquor license. This means, in some states, hookah bars that currently serve food or alcohol must now decide whether they want to be in the restaurant or tobacco business.  How can I have a hookah bar and apply for an exception license if you do not serve food or alcohol.  On the other hand, some states, they will let you apply for an exception to the tobacco ban and have a smoke shop, if it is not in a public place that hurts anyone around your shop.

          LLC (Limited Liability Company) FAQs: 
Q: Would an LLC be better than filing a fictitious business name?     
A: Regadless you will need to register the name. Instead just form an LLC or an S corporation though LLCs are preferred these days.  For example if  the assumed business name is .  
deas XYZtch Dymamite Vapor ProductsCo.    
this name as well as any other name is an assumed business name and it must be recorded as a DBA Doing Business As name which also requires a fee to be recorded.    
Just recording an assumed business name does nothing to keep the name exclusive nor does it avoid personal liability for the business owners.  Only  setting up a limited liability company (LLC) will protect the name at the state level and also protect the owners of personal liability.     
   It is  perhaps a better choice to just incorporate for the same or a little higher fee because you will also have corporate protection for the business name and personal vs business liabilities.    
    E.g. if your business has debts the lender can sue you personally to obtain a judgment vs your personal assets as opposed in the case you were a corporation where the lender could only sue the corporation directly and if the limited liability company (LLC) had no assets the lender could get nothing.  
A limited liability company (LLC) affords more prestige and it helps you obtain business loans.   

Q: What state should I form an LLC  in? 
A: Though you hear Delaware to be a good state to form your llc stay with your state.  
Q: How can I find a good name for my business?  
A: Do some research on he web and then find a name that makes sense. 
Q:     Is there a minimum amount of money I have to have before I set up an LLC? 
A:     No you don't need money to start an LLC. 
Q: Can I set up my LLC alone or do I need a lawyer? 
A: Even if you needed a lawyer to set up your LLC we could do it for you because we have lawyers on our payroll. 
Q: Do I need to obtain a federal  or state LLC number before forming a limited liability company (LLC)  or getting other licenses?
A: 
Q: What is a DUNS Number? 
A: Dun & Bradstreet is a business credit rating company and they use your info to inform lenders about how credit worthy you are.  
Q:   Do I need to pay sales tax to the state as an LLC?
A:   Paying sales tax depends on your state. For example in Oregon you dont need to pay sales tax but you still need a resale certificate to buy from other states wholesale  products.
