Kush Bottles Announces Expansion into Alaska
SANTA ANA, Calif., July 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Kush Bottles, Inc. (OTCQB: KSHB), a dynamic sales platform that provides unique products and services for both businesses and consumers in the cannabis industry, announced today it has entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with JKD Brands to effectively penetrate the Alaska market. JKD Brands, an established distribution leader in the state of Alaska, will now be providing the cannabis market with Kush Bottles’ premier products including child-resistant containers and bags, as well as all other packaging, labeling, and accessory options.
Alaska was the fourth state to commence legal adult-use cannabis sales. Ranked by CNBC as one of the top 10 most visited states in the U.S., Alaska has seen a surge of tourism recently, including an estimated 1.9 million out-of-state visitors coming to the state between May and September in 2016 – the highest visitor volume on record, according to the Alaska Department of Commerce, Community, & Economic Development.
Given its geography, Alaska presents logistical challenges for most U.S. distribution companies. This new partnership enables both Kush Bottles (KSHB) and JKD Brands to remain dedicated to providing exceptional customer service, the highest quality products, innovative custom design solutions, and competitive prices while better servicing Alaska’s burgeoning cannabis market.
We are delighted to partner with Kush Bottles as we grow market share in Alaska’s underserved cannabis market. Kush Bottles is the nation’s most respected provider of packaging, supplies and accessories to the cannabis industry and it brings nationwide strength and industry expertise to our collaboration.
Jim Dyer, Co-Founder of JKD Brands
Furthermore, Kush Bottles’ recent additions of CMP Wellness and Trinity Terpenes give JKD Brands access to a wider array of top quality products. We are excited to launch this partnership and provide premium quality cannabis products to the state of Alaska.
Nicholas Kovacevich, Chief Executive Officer of Kush Bottles, said, “We chose to partner with JKD Brands because their knowledge of the local Alaska regulatory, logistics, and market conditions is second to none. JKD’s management team brings substantial local and state knowledge, with the support, capabilities and know-how of an established national partner. We are confident they are the right partners to extend Kush Bottles’ reach into the Alaska market.”

SANTA ANA, Calif., July 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Kush Bottles, Inc. (OTCQB: KSHB), a dynamic sales platform that provides unique products and services for both businesses and consumers in the cannabis industry, will be featured in an investor-focused webinar, hosted by New Cannabis Ventures. The webinar will be held on July 19, 2017 at 1pm Eastern. 
Nicholas Kovacevich, Co-Founder and CEO of Kush Bottles, will discuss the company's recent performance and will answer questions from attendees. 








New Cannabis Ventures, a leading cannabis industry investment publication, has been instrumental in promoting higher standards and transparency within the sector. 
New Cannabis Ventures wrote that Kush Bottles "recently completed a transformational acquisition and is a leading revenue generator in the publicly-traded cannabis sector." The publication also stated, "One of the themes we have been discussing this year is revenue, something that was largely absent from the publicly-traded stocks several years ago, but is becoming much more visible in 2017. Gone are the days when public company investors had to invest in pre-revenue companies, and this change applies to both direct and ancillary cannabis companies. One of the leading public-company revenue generators is Kush Bottles."
Kovacevich said that he is looking forward to the webinar and having an opportunity to address questions, particularly from investors. "We are proud of our accomplishments and I always enjoy being able to talk about our growth, as well as discuss the opportunities that lay ahead," he said. 
Registrants to the webinar will also receive a free recording after the meeting concludes.

Marijuana industry packaging company Kush Bottles buys web domain Roll-uh-Bowl.com
Kush Bottles Inc.  said on Tuesday it has acquired the web domain name Roll-uh-Bowl.com, a week after completing the acquisition of the platform. Kush Bottles provides packaging, supplies, accessories and branding to the regulated cannabis industry. Roll-uh-Bowl.com, which sees an average of 39,500 monthly users, is an online distribution platform for the retail sale of medical-grade silicone water pipes. "With purchasing patterns shifting from head shops to dispensaries and with constant price pressure being put on cannabis itself, dispensaries will need to offer ancillary products to continue the growth of their business," said Douglas Leighton of Altar Rock Capital, which was spun off of investment firm Dutchess Capital. "I believe they are well positioned to take advantage of the booming cannabis industry over the next five years." Shares of Kush Bottles, which are traded over the counter, have gained nearly 12% in the year to date and more than 121% in the last 12 months.

Marijuana industry packaging company Kush Bottles buys web domain Roll-uh-Bowl.com
Kush Bottles Inc.  said on Tuesday it has acquired the web domain name Roll-uh-Bowl.com, a week after completing the acquisition of the platform. Kush Bottles provides packaging, supplies, accessories and branding to the regulated cannabis industry. Roll-uh-Bowl.com, which sees an average of 39,500 monthly users, is an online distribution platform for the retail sale of medical-grade silicone water pipes. "With purchasing patterns shifting from head shops to dispensaries and with constant price pressure being put on cannabis itself, dispensaries will need to offer ancillary products to continue the growth of their business," said Douglas Leighton of Altar Rock Capital, which was spun off of investment firm Dutchess Capital. "I believe they are well positioned to take advantage of the booming cannabis industry over the next five years." Shares of Kush Bottles, which are traded over the counter, have gained nearly 12% in the year to date and more than 121% in the last 12 months.

      Glass Bottles








Our glass bottles are categorized by style and color. Every collection has its own shape, character and use. Choose from French Squares, glass jugs, sauce bottles, canning jars, mason jars, and more. These bottles are fragile (mazel tof!) and should be ordered in full case quantities whenever possible.





Loading Catalog Results



HistoryThe history of glass bottles is older than dirt. What I mean to say is that they've been around for a long time. And speaking of dirt, they're made of dirt! Well, sand ... and soda. And boron oxide and other various additives to give them color and super-human resistance to thermal shock.Glass molding has been around for centuries, and carries a certain je ne sais quoi that lends it an air of mystery, quality, and ... heft. These are all things that you should consider when making a packaging decision for your product.Although fragile (notwithstanding it's thermal shock tempering additives), glass is practically immune and non-reactive to most things that you put in it (DISCLAIMER: MOST things; you'll definitely want to test your product and your filling process before buying 2 truckloads).

      Glass Jars








Our glass jars are categorized by style, color and capacity. They come in many different styles, shapes, sizes and colors. We will gladly sell in small quantities, however, the best price breaks will occur when you buy in wholesale quantities. We carry traditional Mason jars, canning-style jars, paragons, hex-shaped jars, as well as our most popular item, the facet jar.

History and UsageMore can been done to a glass jar than any other container. Over the years it has been filled with lotions, creams, olives, peaches, pears, moonshine, brews, pickles, Dijon mustard with little bits of jalapenos, and jams and displayed on grocery store shelves, refrigerators and home pantries across the globe.They can be drilled, filled with sparkling lights or candles, and hung from trees or patio furniture. They're filled with loose change, nuts and bolts, stuffed with chocolate chips and covered with fabric and a bow and given to friends. They allow for pristine and beautiful product presentation and are used for everything from cosmetics and personal care to food storage and wedding favors. For wholesale pricing and shipping considerations, they should be ordered in full case quantities whenever possible.

Encore Glass - Services



























Services

Our friendly and knowledgeable sales team offers no-obligation bottling consultations.
If you choose to work with us, you'll have a dedicated sales representative and support person, ensuring that all the pieces come together in a timely and stress-free manner.
We also offer custom repacking, custom mold design and a discreet decanting service.


No Obligation
Bottling Consultation

Our aim is to understand and serve your needs. In your bottling consultation, we'll discuss:

Your existing stock of corks, capsules, closures or labels that you need to utilize.
The varietals you’re bottling and what style you have in mind.
Timeline and quantity (both short term and longer term needs, if any)
Your plans for packaging: content vs custom printed box
Together we'll consider some bottle possibilities. and if you're interested, we'll send or bring you samples to review. 









Need to match an existing bottle?  
We have the equipment and know-how to make that happen.
Need to use up your stock of capsules?
We'll find you an appealing and compatible bottle.
Have an idea for custom bottle design or packaging?
We can help you explore options and secure pricing. If we can’t accomplish your vision at our manufacturing facility, we likely know a vendor who can.


 
Repacking
Receive your Bottles Ready-to-Fill
Automated repacking equipment simply can’t compare.
When needed, our team of steady hands will repack your glass from bulk pallets into cartons at our Fairfield headquarters or at the manufacturing facility. When in transit, our bulk glass is shipped with protective sleeves over every bottle to protect against scratches, scuffing or chipping. Even so, each bottle is efficiently inspected for:

glass defects
color imperfections
chips and shards
each lot is verified for dimensions and Prop 65 compliance. 





 
Discrete Decanting
When Wine and Bottles Must Go Their Separate Ways
 
Our Mobile Decanting Rig efficiently and non-destructively retrieves wine from sealed bottles. We’ve discreetly processed millions of cases at hundreds of different wineries.
Learn More

 
Field Support
We'll Troubleshoot Your Bottling Operation
We know that bottling doesn't always go as planned. That’s why we always test capsules, closures and labels before ordering your bottles. But sometimes you might still need the on-site expertise of one of our seasoned field technicians. We'll even come out and help you with bottles you procured elsewhere.
