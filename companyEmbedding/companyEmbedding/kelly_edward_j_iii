Edward J. "Ned" Kelly III

Lecturer
J.D., University of Virginia School of Law, 1981
A.B., Princeton University, 1975


Edward J. "Ned" Kelly III was chairman of Citigroup Inc.’s Institutional Clients Group from January 2011 until his retirement in July 2014.  He served as chairman of Global Banking from April 2010 to January 2011, and as vice chairman of Citigroup from July 2009 to April 2010.  Kelly also served as Citi’s chief financial officer from March through July 2009. Prior to his work as CFO, Kelly was head of Global Banking and before that president and chief executive officer of Citi Alternative Investments. He is currently a director of CSX Corporation, XL Group and MetLife.
Kelly joined Citi in February 2008 from The Carlyle Group, a private investment firm, where he was a managing director. Prior to joining Carlyle in July 2007, he was a vice chairman at PNC Financial Services Group following PNC's acquisition of Mercantile Bankshares Corporation in March 2007.
He was chairman, chief executive and president of Mercantile from March 2003 through March 2007 and chief executive and president from March 2001 to March 2003. Before Mercantile, Kelly was at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. where he was managing director and head of Global Financial Institutions and co-head of Investment Banking Client Management. He joined J.P. Morgan in 1994 as its general counsel and secretary. In 1996, he became a managing director and subsequently ran various parts of J.P. Morgan's investment banking business, including Global Financial Institutions and Latin America. Prior to joining J.P. Morgan, Kelly was a partner at the law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell, where he specialized in matters related to financial institutions. Early in his career, he served as a law clerk to Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. and U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Clement F. Haynsworth, Jr. 
Prior to law school, Kelly served as a legislative assistant and, later, press secretary to U.S. Senator Richard S. Schweiker.
