You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Title: Board Member
               Company: AmCOMP Incorporated
Job Details
               AMCOMP® has established an education program to raise professional standards in the field of workers compensation. Each of us is able to detail the need to improve the industry in our own business histories, almost always concluding that a common body of knowledge and measurement would benefit all participants in the field: insurers, reinsurers, insureds, self-insureds, regulators, agents, brokers and most importantly, claimants. The formation of AMCOMP® and the commitment by its board and membership to do something about this universally perceived need set the AMCOMP® Education Committee on a course that has spanned several years and produced quality results. In the summer of 1999, AMCOMP® began to develop a comprehensive education program, involving individuals associated with well-established, educational institutions who could help AMCOMP® achieve the educational goals the Association set forth. After a period of refining and fine-tuning the program, the Association achieved its goal of completing a comprehensive, three-part certification program. The AMCOMP® Certification program, leading to the certified Workers Compensation Professional ("WCP") designation, consists of three parts, each consisting of ten chapters. The program utilized multiple reading sources and was designed in a fashion similar to a regular college course, building on material covered in the preceding chapters. Efforts were continued to identify ways to improve the program. Most recently, the various reading sources were consolidated into a single text and the Board of Directors did away with the three part program. This text, entitled Workers Compensation: The First One Hundred Years, provides a comprehensive base of information regarding the various aspects of workers compensation. With the completion of the AMCOMP® text book and course guide, the format of the course was changed to include only these materials through this text. Those who have taken the course of study will have a better understanding and appreciation for how the multiple pieces of the workers compensation program (e.g., claims, risk management, pricing, etc.) work together to make the greater whole. The following serves to highlight the material covered in each of the twelve chapters:Chapter One - The early development of workmen's compensation (later to become workers compensation) in Europe is traced along with its subsequent development in the United States. With the passage of time, certain shortcomings of the program were recognized, and in 1972, a national commission was created to study the program and make recommendations for improvement. In response to these recommendations, states enacted substantial reforms in sub-sequent years. The chapter concludes with an examination of the subject of coverage including those employers who must be covered along with a review of those employees who are covered. Chapter Two-The almost universal test for compensability of a workplace injury or death is that it must "arise out of and in the course of the employment. While the two phrases "arising out of" and "in the course of" the employment appear fairly straight-forward in actual terminology, these phrases have been the subject of extensive litigation and expansion since their first enactment. A review of statutory provisions along with case law serves to depict how the subject has evolved over time and how it is being addressed legislatively in a number of jurisdictions. Chapter Three- Many states modeled their original compensation laws after the English Workmen's Compensation Act of 1897 which included reference to "personal injury by accident. This language was designed to ensure that employers were only responsible for unintended injuries stemming from a workplace incident. With the passage of time, this limited definition evolved and today, the workers compensation program includes not only an expanded scope of covered injuries, but also a broad array of occupational diseases. These conditions continue to be the subject of controversy and litigation today. Chapter Four - The fundamental concept behindworkers compensation is that the employer is responsible for certain benefits to an employee injured on the job without consideration for the issue of fault. These mandated benefits include the furnishing of medical care necessary for recovery and the payment of a portion of lost income in the instance of injury or death resulting from a work-related cause. This chapter examines the various types of benefits afforded through the workers compensation program along with the different forms of income replacement benefits that may be available to a worker who receives a work-related injury. Certain prescribed benefits are also payable to surviving dependents in the event of a work-related death. Chapter Five - Benefit security, and the various forms of that security, is examined in Chapter Five. Benefit security takes the form of insurance or individual or group self-insurance. Within the insurance mechanism, one finds private insurance, competitive or monopolistic state funds, and the residual market or assigned risk pools. While benefit security is a critical component of the program, responsible employers focus on workplace safety as the primary approach for purposes of reducing work-place injuries. The chapter concludes with a look at various employer loss control techniques along with the role played at the federal and state level by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Chapter Six- Following an examination of the forms of benefit security available to employers in the preceding chapter, this chapter shifts to an examination of the standard Workers Compensation and Employers Liability policy. Each section of the policy is reviewed with a copy of the policy available for purposes of perusal. The chapter includes a review of some of the more frequently used policy endorsements, along with an explanation of the particular situations in which the endorsements should be included with the policy. The chapter concludes with an examination of some of the various federal compensation programs involving the payment of benefits. Chapter Seven -The method for determining workers' compensation rates - the manual rating system - and an examination of the subjects of experience rating and retrospective rating are covered in this chapter. The method of classification of risks is studied in some detail inasmuch as the classification system is the cornerstone of the rating process. Both experience rating and retrospective rating are programs available to employers of a certain size and are designed to make the cost for insurance more reflective of the employers actual experience. Chapter Eight -Thischapter reviews the claims administration process performed at the state level through a board, bureau, commission or some other similar agency. Functions performed by these agencies include the promulgation of forms and regulations, the development of a dispute resolution process, along with other functions designed to expedite and ensure the accuracy of benefit payments by insurers. This chapter also examines the role of state second injury funds and special funds in terms of their original purposes(s) and the impact these funds have on overall program costs. Chapter Nine - The discussion of mandated benefits under the workers compensation program is continued in this chapter with a focus on the factors influencing current medical cost increases. To address those increases, a number of cost containment strategies have been developed which include legislation regarding the choice of medical provider; the application of physician and hospital fee schedules; the development of treatment protocols; and the introduction of utilization review.
