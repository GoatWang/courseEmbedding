Medicare Advantage: How You Can Differentiate Yourself Throughout Open Enrollment
In 2014, the Medicare population was estimated to be 55.5 million individuals. By 2030, this population is expected to exceed 69 million; in 2050, the population is estimated to grow by almost 50% to 82 million individuals. It comes as no surprise that Medicare Managed Care enrollment is at all time high of 34%, and, with an estimated 10,000 baby boomers aging into Medicare daily, enrollment for Medicare will continue to rise.

An Evidence-Based Approach to Population Health
Pursuant Health partners with world-renowned behavioral change experts from Cleveland Clinic Wellness who specialize in developing evidence-based wellness programs. Pursuant Health conducts population level health screenings that follow United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) Guidelines. Under these guidelines, kiosks are utilized for non-invasive biometric screenings that determine risk based on age, gender and biometric data. Based on the risk level indicated by the screening results, a user may be directed to seek out additional testing in the form of blood work, home test kits or other lab procedures.









Immediate Risk Targeting Technology
Core to our population health offering is the ability to target individuals, in real time, based on their specific health risks and behaviors. With our adaptive logic algorithms, health programs such as hypertension management are targeted to individuals with high risk blood pressure readings. Pursuant Health’s targeted messaging and personalized recommendations have resulted in enrollment rates 4x – 5x higher than traditional methods.









A Unique Engagement Platform
With a national health kiosk network located within 10 minutes of 79% of the American public, keeping individuals engaged is more convenient than ever. Created with a continuous improvement process model, the Pursuant Health kiosk is a self-service engagement tool that is easily accessible for the majority of the US population. Program participants can conveniently manage their health through this broad network.









A Financially Sound Approach to Population Health Screenings
By utilizing an existing national retail network, Pursuant Health provides a cost-effective solution for population health screenings that is available 24/7 (in select locations). Participants do not need to pay a copay or schedule appointments. Data collected from the Pursuant Health platform is 100% secure and connected. Additionally, real-time risk targeting and interventions provides increased enrollment into health management programs with proven ROI.

SoloHealth, now Pursuant Health, raises $2.4M, partners with Cleveland ClinicBy Jonah ComstockMay 18, 2015

Share






 
Health kiosk company SoloHealth has changed its name to Pursuant Health and raised $2.4 million in equity and securities, according to an SEC filing. Per the company's website, the name change reflects a new partnership with Cleveland Clinic Wellness, which the company embarked on at the end of March. This will add a workplace wellness business to the company's existing public kiosk business.
"We have changed our brand and partnered with Cleveland Clinic Wellness as part of our process of becoming a new kind of health and wellness company," the company wrote. "Over the course of 2015, we will announce a new suite of innovative, convenient, and clinically-valid products that make it easier for individuals to understand their health status and self-manage chronic conditions. While our name may change, our focus remains on the millions of individuals who use our services each month."
The new funding brings the company's total funding to at least $28.2 million. As SoloHealth, the company raised $4.3 million last December. Previous investors include WellPoint, Novartis, Dell, Coinstar, and Walter Huff, founder and former chairman of a medical information systems firm acquired by McKesson.

“We are excited to partner with Cleveland Clinic Wellness to bring our collective health and wellness programs to market, with new offerings for employers and health systems, in addition to our traditional focus on consumers," Larry Gerdes, CEO of Pursuant Health (formerly SoloHealth), said in a statement in March. "Cleveland Clinic Wellness offers industry-leading coaching and behavioral change expertise that, coupled with the national SoloHealth engagement network, creates a unique health and wellness offering that is already used by over 3 million people per month. Many health and wellness programs struggle with low engagement rates and a lack of clinical validity. Our engagement platform, in partnership with Cleveland Clinic Wellness, provides a highly-effective solution.”
SoloHealth’s FDA-cleared kiosks offers health screenings for blood pressure, vision, weight, and BMI. Users can also use the kiosk to take health risk assessments or use a symptom checker. After users are finished with their screenings, they receive a customized report with health scores and data. The data is stored on SoloHealth’s platform so when users visit in the future, they can track their progression. Health data gathered during visits can also be accessed through an online SoloHealth member account. The kiosks are located in select Walmart, Sam’s Club, Safeway, and Schnuck Markets locations.
According to Pursuant Health, it has 3,600 retail locations and that its kiosks have seen more than 73 million health screenings. Last year, the company said that nationwide its kiosks were seeing 130,000 users per day and the average time users spent at the kiosk was 4.5 minutes. Pursuant health has kiosks within 10 miles of 79 percent of the US population.
The slight pivot for Pursuant Health comes with an uptick in competition for the health kiosk business. Last year, competitors higi and StayHealthy merged, creating a 6,000-kiosk business with contracts for 4,000 more. Another competitor, HealthSpot, has been raising money lately, including an undisclosed investment from Xerox last fall.

2010Pursuant acquired KMA Communications whose direct response fundraising and data analytics allowed us to help nonprofits reach donors across every communications channel and all levels of the donor pyramid.
2013Pursuant named to Inc. 5000 Honor Roll after being ranked as one of the nation’s fastest growing private companies for five consecutive years.
2014Pursuant invests in advanced proprietary data analytics and donor lead generation systems. Hires top talent to lead ongoing development and expands team to provide world-class business intelligence services.

How do I Buy Health Insurance?
For some, buying health insurance can be a confusing and overwhelming process. First, you have to find a health insurance plan within your budget. Then you have to contact the company or an insurance agent in order to get a quote. Once you have all of that information, you can evaluate your options. It is a very personal and complicated process, but there are ways to simplify it.
Now that the Affordable Care Act (sometimes referred to as "Obamacare") is in place, it is much easier to find a health insurance plan based on your income and personal health needs. In most states, you may even qualify for financial subsidies. You can quickly and easily apply for coverage through the new Healthcare Marketplace.
Before you settle on a plan, you should first get a quote, find a price, and discover any out-of-pocket expenses your plan will expect you to pay (such as deductibles, co-insurance, and copay charges). Once you have all of this information together, it will be easier to find coverage which fits your needs.


What is the Healthcare Marketplace?
The passage of the Affordable Care Act established the Healthcare Marketplace. There are two distinct divisions - a state level, and a federal level. 37 states are members of the federal exchange, and 14 are limited to a state exchange. Unfortunately, not all insurance companies are required to provide information about their plans and prices to the Healthcare Marketplace, so be prepared to do some local searching for affordable plans in your area.
The Healthcare Marketplace may also be referred to as the Health Insurance Marketplace. It is a website managed by the federal government. When you visit, you can enter a few personal details about yourself and start shopping for plans in a matter of minutes.


What's the "Health Insurance Exchange"?
The Health Insurance Exchange is the pool of health care plans and providers which are cooperating with the federal government in order to provide affordable health insurance to Americans in many states. 37 states are members of the Exchange on the federal level: AL, AK, AZ, AK, DE, FL, GA, HI, IL, IN, IA, KS, LA, ME, MI, MS, MO, MT, NE, NV, NH, NJ, NM, NC, ND, OH, OK, PA, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VA, WV, WI, and WY.
To see if you qualify for a tax subsidy, you need to enroll on the Healthcare Marketplace website (either the federal one, or your state’s website). If you do not qualify for a subsidy for whatever reason, you have the option of shopping through the Exchange or in your state’s private marketplace.


When Can I Sign Up for Health Insurance?
Keep the following terms in mind, as they will help make the search for insurance easier:

Obamacare - a nickname (sometimes considered derogatory) for the Affordable Care Act. Its full name is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It was signed into law by President Barack Obama in March of 2010. 
Healthcare Marketplace - a resource for those without health insurance to find affordable coverage through either a state or federal exchange. 
Subsidized Health Insurance - The passing of the Affordable Care Act began the process of subsidizing (offering at a lower cost) health insurance plans for those who cannot otherwise afford health insurance and medical care. 
Medical Insurance - another term for health insurance. Also synonymous with healthcare plans and medical coverage.
Health Insurance Companies - companies which underwrite (provide) health insurance plans. They are responsible for paying out claims when their beneficiaries (customers) receive medical care. 
Health Insurance Quotes - most health insurance companies are required to give you an accurate estimate of what you should expect to pay as well as the terms of your health insurance plan, should you decide to do business with them. These estimates are commonly referred to as a “quote”. 
Premium - the monthly cost you must pay to maintain your health insurance coverage. Also sometimes referred to as a “monthly premium”. 
Deductible - a fixed dollar amount your insurance company will require you to pay out-of-pocket for your medical care before they will pay out any claims. The deductible and monthly premium are inversely related: the higher the premium, the lower the deductible, and vice versa.



How Can I Find the Best Health Insurance Company?
Right now, there are hundreds of different health insurance companies participating in the Exchange offering thousands of different plans. These companies are rated on a letter grading scale (A, B, C, etc.) based on their performance. Their grade is calculated by attributes such as financial stability, claim payments, and customer service. You might also want to ask around among friends, family members, and colleagues. If their plans are working for them, they could work for you too.
You might also want to ask around among friends, family members, and colleagues. If their plans are working for them, they could work for you too. Here is list of some companies that our partners work with: Aetna, UnitedHealthCare, Humana, BCBS, Cigna, Anthem, AARP, and many others.


What Happens if I Still Can’t Afford to Buy Health Insurance?
If you cannot purchase insurance, the government will charge you a fine when you file your yearly income taxes. For 2015, the fine will be either $325 or 2% of your income (the higher of the two will be your fee). This fee will increase to $695 or 2.5% of your yearly income in 2016. To avoid the penalty, you have to be carrying a health insurance plan for at least 9 months of the year.

Medical Insurance - another term for health insurance. Also synonymous with healthcare plans and medical coverage.
Health Insurance Companies - companies which underwrite (provide) health insurance plans. They are responsible for paying out claims when their beneficiaries (customers) receive medical care.
Health Insurance Quotes - most health insurance companies are required to give you an accurate estimate of what you should expect to pay as well as the terms of your health insurance plan, should you decide to do business with them. These estimates are commonly referred to as a “quote”.
Premium - the monthly cost you must pay to maintain your health insurance coverage. Also sometimes referred to as a “monthly premium”.
Deductible - a fixed dollar amount your insurance company will require you to pay out-of-pocket for your medical care before they will pay out any claims. The deductible and monthly premium are inversely related: the higher the premium, the lower the deductible, and vice versa.



How Can I Find the Best Health Insurance Company?
Right now, there are hundreds of different health insurance companies participating in the Exchange offering thousands of different plans. These companies are rated on a letter grading scale (A, B, C, etc.) based on their performance. Their grade is calculated by attributes such as financial stability, claim payments, and customer service. You might also want to ask around among friends, family members, and colleagues. If their plans are working for them, they could work for you too.

What Happens if I Still Can’t Afford to Buy Health Insurance?
If you cannot purchase insurance, the government will charge you a fine when you file your yearly income taxes. For 2015, the fine will be either $325 or 2% of your income (the higher of the two will be your fee). This fee will increase to $695 or 2.5% of your yearly income in 2016. To avoid the penalty, you have to be carrying a health insurance plan for at least 9 months of the year.

How do I Buy Health Insurance?
For some, buying health insurance can be a confusing and overwhelming process. First, you have to find a health insurance plan within your budget. Then you have to contact the company or an insurance agent in order to get a quote. Once you have all of that information, you can evaluate your options. It is a very personal and complicated process, but there are ways to simplify it.
Now that the Affordable Care Act (sometimes referred to as “Obamacare”) is in place, it is much easier to find a health insurance plan based on your income and personal health needs. In most states, you may even qualify for financial subsidies. You can quickly and easily apply for coverage through the new Healthcare Marketplace.
Before you settle on a plan, you should first get a quote, find a price, and discover any out-of-pocket expenses your plan will expect you to pay (such as deductibles, co-insurance, and copay charges). Once you have all of this information together, it will be easier to find coverage which fits your needs.


What is the Healthcare Marketplace?
The passage of the Affordable Care Act established the Healthcare Marketplace. There are two distinct divisions - a state level, and a federal level. 37 states are members of the federal exchange, and 14 are limited to a state exchange. Unfortunately, not all insurance companies are required to provide information about their plans and prices to the Healthcare Marketplace, so be prepared to do some local searching for affordable plans in your area.
The Healthcare Marketplace may also be referred to as the Health Insurance Marketplace. It is a website managed by the federal government. When you visit, you can enter a few personal details about yourself and start shopping for plans in a matter of minutes.


What’s the "Health Insurance Exchange"?
The Health Insurance Exchange is the pool of health care plans and providers which are cooperating with the federal government in order to provide affordable health insurance to Americans in many states. 37 states are members of the Exchange on the federal level: AL, AK, AZ, AK, DE, FL, GA, HI, IL, IN, IA, KS, LA, ME, MI, MS, MO, MT, NE, NV, NH, NJ, NM, NC, ND, OH, OK, PA, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VA, WV, WI, and WY.
To see if you qualify for a tax subsidy, you need to enroll on the Healthcare Marketplace website (either the federal one, or your state’s website). If you do not qualify for a subsidy for whatever reason, you have the option of shopping through the Exchange or in your state’s private marketplace.


When Can I Sign Up for Health Insurance?
Keep the following terms in mind, as they will help make the search for insurance easier:

In September 2016, Pursuant Health ran a four-month digital advertising campaign for a Chronic Dry Eye product (Product X) on the Company’s national kiosk network. For this campaign, Product X sought to create awareness for Chronic Dry Eye (CDE) and encourage individuals experiencing CDE to talk to their eye doctor or pharmacist about their symptoms.

Medicare Advantage: How You Can Differentiate Yourself Throughout Open Enrollment
In 2014, the Medicare population was estimated to be 55.5 million individuals. By 2030, this population is expected to exceed 69 million; in 2050, the population is estimated to grow by almost 50% to 82 million individuals. It comes as no surprise that Medicare Managed Care enrollment is at all time high of 34%, and, with an estimated 10,000 baby boomers aging into Medicare daily, enrollment for Medicare will continue to rise.

Why Pursuant?









An Evidence-Based Approach to Population Health
Pursuant Health partners with world-renowned behavioral change experts from Cleveland Clinic Wellness who specialize in developing evidence-based wellness programs. Pursuant Health conducts population level health screenings that follow United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) Guidelines. Under these guidelines, kiosks are utilized for non-invasive biometric screenings that determine risk based on age, gender and biometric data. Based on the risk level indicated by the screening results, a user may be directed to seek out additional testing in the form of blood work, home test kits or other lab procedures.









Immediate Risk Targeting Technology
Core to our population health offering is the ability to target individuals, in real time, based on their specific health risks and behaviors. With our adaptive logic algorithms, health programs such as hypertension management are targeted to individuals with high risk blood pressure readings. Pursuant Health’s targeted messaging and personalized recommendations have resulted in enrollment rates 4x – 5x higher than traditional methods.









A Unique Engagement Platform
With a national health kiosk network located within 10 minutes of 79% of the American public, keeping individuals engaged is more convenient than ever. Created with a continuous improvement process model, the Pursuant Health kiosk is a self-service engagement tool that is easily accessible for the majority of the US population. Program participants can conveniently manage their health through this broad network.









A Financially Sound Approach to Population Health Screenings
By utilizing an existing national retail network, Pursuant Health provides a cost-effective solution for population health screenings that is available 24/7 (in select locations). Participants do not need to pay a copay or schedule appointments. Data collected from the Pursuant Health platform is 100% secure and connected. Additionally, real-time risk targeting and interventions provides increased enrollment into health management programs with proven ROI.
