United Natural Foods, Incorporated, also known as UNFI, is a distributor of natural and organic foods, specialty foods, and related products in the United States and Canada.[1] The company distributes to grocery and natural food stores and is the primary distributor to Whole Foods Market.[2] UNFI offers dry, refrigerated and frozen groceries, personal care products, supplements, fresh produce, perishables, and non-food items such as household cleaning products. It made the Fortune 500 list in 2016.[3]
UNFI has a focus on corporate social responsibility. Examples include construction and renovation projects that achieve LEED certification.[4] In 2016, UNFI was named to Food Logistics' 2016 Top Green Providers list.[5] The corporation supports the Just Label It! movement that calls for the labeling of genetically modified and engineered foods.[6] The UNFI Foundation is UNFI's charitable arm, which supports healthy and organic food systems.[7]

History[edit]
UNFI was founded in 1996 by the merger of two regional distributors, Mountain People's Warehouse (founded in 1976, serving the Western U.S.) and Cornucopia Natural Foods (founded in 1977, serving the Eastern U.S.), forming the first natural products distributorship with national scope.[8] Since 1996, other regional distributors have merged with UNFI, filling in the distribution footprint and making UNFI the largest distributor of natural products.[9] In 2007 UNFI added specialty products distribution through the acquisition of Millbrook Distribution Services.[10] In 2011, UNFI signed a distribution agreement with Safeway Inc. for the distribution of non-proprietary natural, organic and specialty products, making Safeway their second largest customer after Whole Foods.[11] This agreement was terminated by Safeway in July, 2015,[12] leading to a drop in share price and two rounds of layoffs, their first in the history of the company. In 2012 UNFI partnered with Buyer's Best Friend to create a unified reordering system.[13] In 2016, the company announced the acquisition of Nor-Cal produce, Inc.[14] It also completed the acquisition of Haddon House Food Products, Inc. in 2016.[15] That same year, it announced the acquisition of Gourmet Guru, Inc.[16] In early 2016, UNFI worried investors by disclosing that it missed Wall Street's expectations.[17]
Organization[edit]
In addition to distribution operations, UNFI also operates the following divisions:

Woodstock Farms Manufacturing
Albert's Organics
Select Nutrition
UNFI Canada
Honest Green
Tony's Fine Foods
Blue Marble Brands
Gourmet Guru
Haddon House Specialty Foods
Nor-Cal Produce

History[edit]
UNFI was founded in 1996 by the merger of two regional distributors, Mountain People's Warehouse (founded in 1976, serving the Western U.S.) and Cornucopia Natural Foods (founded in 1977, serving the Eastern U.S.), forming the first natural products distributorship with national scope.[8] Since 1996, other regional distributors have merged with UNFI, filling in the distribution footprint and making UNFI the largest distributor of natural products.[9] In 2007 UNFI added specialty products distribution through the acquisition of Millbrook Distribution Services.[10] In 2011, UNFI signed a distribution agreement with Safeway Inc. for the distribution of non-proprietary natural, organic and specialty products, making Safeway their second largest customer after Whole Foods.[11] This agreement was terminated by Safeway in July, 2015,[12] leading to a drop in share price and two rounds of layoffs, their first in the history of the company. In 2012 UNFI partnered with Buyer's Best Friend to create a unified reordering system.[13] In 2016, the company announced the acquisition of Nor-Cal produce, Inc.[14] It also completed the acquisition of Haddon House Food Products, Inc. in 2016.[15] That same year, it announced the acquisition of Gourmet Guru, Inc.[16] In early 2016, UNFI worried investors by disclosing that it missed Wall Street's expectations.[17]
Organization[edit]
In addition to distribution operations, UNFI also operates the following divisions:

Woodstock Farms Manufacturing

United Natural Foods, Incorporated, also known as UNFI, is a distributor of natural and organic foods, specialty foods, and related products in the United States and Canada.[1] The company distributes to grocery and natural food stores and is the primary distributor to Whole Foods Market.[2] UNFI offers dry, refrigerated and frozen groceries, personal care products, supplements, fresh produce, perishables, and non-food items such as household cleaning products. It made the Fortune 500 list in 2016.[3]
UNFI has a focus on corporate social responsibility. Examples include construction and renovation projects that achieve LEED certification.[4] In 2016, UNFI was named to Food Logistics' 2016 Top Green Providers list.[5] The corporation supports the Just Label It! movement that calls for the labeling of genetically modified and engineered foods.[6] The UNFI Foundation is UNFI's charitable arm, which supports healthy and organic food systems.[7]

History[edit]
UNFI was founded in 1996 by the merger of two regional distributors, Mountain People's Warehouse (founded in 1976, serving the Western U.S.) and Cornucopia Natural Foods (founded in 1977, serving the Eastern U.S.), forming the first natural products distributorship with national scope.[8] Since 1996, other regional distributors have merged with UNFI, filling in the distribution footprint and making UNFI the largest distributor of natural products.[9] In 2007 UNFI added specialty products distribution through the acquisition of Millbrook Distribution Services.[10] In 2011, UNFI signed a distribution agreement with Safeway Inc. for the distribution of non-proprietary natural, organic and specialty products, making Safeway their second largest customer after Whole Foods.[11] This agreement was terminated by Safeway in July, 2015,[12] leading to a drop in share price and two rounds of layoffs, their first in the history of the company. In 2012 UNFI partnered with Buyer's Best Friend to create a unified reordering system.[13] In 2016, the company announced the acquisition of Nor-Cal produce, Inc.[14] It also completed the acquisition of Haddon House Food Products, Inc. in 2016.[15] That same year, it announced the acquisition of Gourmet Guru, Inc.[16] In early 2016, UNFI worried investors by disclosing that it missed Wall Street's expectations.[17]
Organization[edit]
In addition to distribution operations, UNFI also operates the following divisions:

Woodstock Farms Manufacturing
Albert's Organics
Select Nutrition
UNFI Canada
Honest Green
Tony's Fine Foods
Blue Marble Brands
Gourmet Guru
Haddon House Specialty Foods
Nor-Cal Produce

United Natural Foods, Incorporated, also known as UNFI, is a distributor of natural and organic foods, specialty foods, and related products in the United States and Canada.[1] The company distributes to grocery and natural food stores and is the primary distributor to Whole Foods Market.[2] UNFI offers dry, refrigerated and frozen groceries, personal care products, supplements, fresh produce, perishables, and non-food items such as household cleaning products. It made the Fortune 500 list in 2016.[3]
UNFI has a focus on corporate social responsibility. Examples include construction and renovation projects that achieve LEED certification.[4] In 2016, UNFI was named to Food Logistics' 2016 Top Green Providers list.[5] The corporation supports the Just Label It! movement that calls for the labeling of genetically modified and engineered foods.[6] The UNFI Foundation is UNFI's charitable arm, which supports healthy and organic food systems.[7]

History[edit]
UNFI was founded in 1996 by the merger of two regional distributors, Mountain People's Warehouse (founded in 1976, serving the Western U.S.) and Cornucopia Natural Foods (founded in 1977, serving the Eastern U.S.), forming the first natural products distributorship with national scope.[8] Since 1996, other regional distributors have merged with UNFI, filling in the distribution footprint and making UNFI the largest distributor of natural products.[9] In 2007 UNFI added specialty products distribution through the acquisition of Millbrook Distribution Services.[10] In 2011, UNFI signed a distribution agreement with Safeway Inc. for the distribution of non-proprietary natural, organic and specialty products, making Safeway their second largest customer after Whole Foods.[11] This agreement was terminated by Safeway in July, 2015,[12] leading to a drop in share price and two rounds of layoffs, their first in the history of the company. In 2012 UNFI partnered with Buyer's Best Friend to create a unified reordering system.[13] In 2016, the company announced the acquisition of Nor-Cal produce, Inc.[14] It also completed the acquisition of Haddon House Food Products, Inc. in 2016.[15] That same year, it announced the acquisition of Gourmet Guru, Inc.[16] In early 2016, UNFI worried investors by disclosing that it missed Wall Street's expectations.[17]
Organization[edit]
In addition to distribution operations, UNFI also operates the following divisions:

Woodstock Farms Manufacturing
Albert's Organics
Select Nutrition
UNFI Canada
Honest Green
Tony's Fine Foods
Blue Marble Brands
Gourmet Guru
Haddon House Specialty Foods
Nor-Cal Produce

United Natural Foods, Incorporated, also known as UNFI, is a distributor of natural and organic foods, specialty foods, and related products in the United States and Canada.[1] The company distributes to grocery and natural food stores and is the primary distributor to Whole Foods Market.[2] UNFI offers dry, refrigerated and frozen groceries, personal care products, supplements, fresh produce, perishables, and non-food items such as household cleaning products. It made the Fortune 500 list in 2016.[3]
UNFI has a focus on corporate social responsibility. Examples include construction and renovation projects that achieve LEED certification.[4] In 2016, UNFI was named to Food Logistics' 2016 Top Green Providers list.[5] The corporation supports the Just Label It! movement that calls for the labeling of genetically modified and engineered foods.[6] The UNFI Foundation is UNFI's charitable arm, which supports healthy and organic food systems.[7]

History[edit]
UNFI was founded in 1996 by the merger of two regional distributors, Mountain People's Warehouse (founded in 1976, serving the Western U.S.) and Cornucopia Natural Foods (founded in 1977, serving the Eastern U.S.), forming the first natural products distributorship with national scope.[8] Since 1996, other regional distributors have merged with UNFI, filling in the distribution footprint and making UNFI the largest distributor of natural products.[9] In 2007 UNFI added specialty products distribution through the acquisition of Millbrook Distribution Services.[10] In 2011, UNFI signed a distribution agreement with Safeway Inc. for the distribution of non-proprietary natural, organic and specialty products, making Safeway their second largest customer after Whole Foods.[11] This agreement was terminated by Safeway in July, 2015,[12] leading to a drop in share price and two rounds of layoffs, their first in the history of the company. In 2012 UNFI partnered with Buyer's Best Friend to create a unified reordering system.[13] In 2016, the company announced the acquisition of Nor-Cal produce, Inc.[14] It also completed the acquisition of Haddon House Food Products, Inc. in 2016.[15] That same year, it announced the acquisition of Gourmet Guru, Inc.[16] In early 2016, UNFI worried investors by disclosing that it missed Wall Street's expectations.[17]
Organization[edit]
In addition to distribution operations, UNFI also operates the following divisions:

Woodstock Farms Manufacturing
Albert's Organics
Select Nutrition
UNFI Canada
Honest Green
Tony's Fine Foods
Blue Marble Brands
Gourmet Guru
Haddon House Specialty Foods
Nor-Cal Produce

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
