Overview
Our investment objective is to maximize our total return to stockholders primarily in the form of current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation. We intend to pursue our investment objective by relying on a core investment philosophy described as the "Four Rs." The Four Rs stand for:

Relationships—We seek to develop and maintain deep, longstanding and mutually beneficial relationships with our Sponsor's select group of leading venture capital investors, borrowers and entrepreneurs.
Reputation—We seek to preserve and extend the strong reputation of our Sponsor's brand and franchise as a creative, flexible and dependable financing partner with a focus on efficiency, responsiveness and customer service when interacting with venture capital investors, borrowers and entrepreneurs and when originating, structuring, underwriting and monitoring our investments.
References—We seek to make every venture capital investor, borrower and entrepreneur with whom we work a reference so that they not only work with us again but encourage others to work with us also. We believe that receiving referrals from our Sponsor's select group of leading venture capital investors, borrowers and entrepreneurs will be a critical part of our investment origination process and will differentiate us from other lenders.
Returns—We expect that by focusing on relationships, reputation and references, in addition to utilizing our specialized and established credit and monitoring process, we will generate attractive risk-adjusted returns over the long-term.

This Stock Has A 13.40% Yield, Sells For Less Than Book, and Insiders Have Been Buying
In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.

					Full Description



TriplePoint Venture Growth BDC Corp., incorporated on June 28, 2013, is a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. The Company's investment objective is to maximize its total return to stockholders primarily in the form of current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by primarily lending with warrants to venture growth stage companies focused in technology, life sciences and other high growth industries, which are backed by TriplePoint Capital LLC's (TPC) select group of venture capital investors. The Company targets investment opportunities in venture growth stage companies backed by venture capital investors. The Company is managed by TPVG Advisers LLC. Its subsidiaries include TPVG Variable Funding Company LLC (the financing subsidiary), and TPVG Investment LLC, an entity established for holding certain of the Company's investments.The Company originates and invests primarily in loans that have a secured collateral position and are used by venture growth stage companies to finance their continued expansion and growth, equipment financings and, on a select basis, revolving loans, together with, in many cases, attached equity kickers in the form of warrants, and direct equity investments. The Company underwrites its investments seeking an unlevered yield-to-maturity on growth capital loans and equipment financings generally ranging from 10% to 18% and on revolving loans generally ranging from 1% above the applicable prime rate to 10%, in each case, with potential for higher returns in the event the Company is able to exercise warrants and realize gains or sell its related equity investments at a profit. It also generally underwrites secured loans seeking a loan-to-enterprise value of approximately 25%.The Company offers a range of creative, flexible and customized secured financing products, which may include a combination of an initial facility fee, interest and principal payments, end-of-term payments, warrants and/or equity investment rights. Its debt financing products are typically structured as lines of credit, whereby a prospective borrower may be required to draw some of the commitment amount at close but may have approximately 18 months from document execution to access the debt financing capital and in limited cases future advances may be subject to certain predetermined performance milestones.The Company specializes in subsectors, such as technology, including big data, cloud computing, communications, consumer, data storage, electronics, energy efficiency, hardware, information services, Internet and media, networking, semiconductors, software, software as a service, wireless communications and other technology related subsectors, and life sciences, including biotechnology, diagnostic testing and bioinformatics, drug delivery, drug discovery, healthcare information systems, healthcare services, medical, surgical and therapeutic devices, pharmaceuticals and other life science related subsectors.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity.

TriplePoint Ventures targets quality management teams with great ideas, cutting edge technology and science, and the potential for developing and sustaining differentiated value propositions and competitive advantages.
Institutionalized Seed Investing:  We invest alongside and in partnership with angel investors and early stage venture capital firms in seed-stage “start-up” companies where we can provide value add through our extensive network of industry relationships, serve as a potential partner or customer, assist in fundraising and venture capital efforts, or take an active role in the company. 
Strategic Lead Investing: We lead or co-lead investments in venture-stage companies where we can provide value add to both our venture capital partners and their portfolio companies through our extensive network of industry relationships, act as a catalyst for strategic corporate investment partners, serve as a potential partner or customer, complement TriplePoint Capital’s current or future debt capital investment efforts, or take an active role in the company. 
Partner-Based Complementary Investing: We invest in existing TriplePoint Capital customers alongside venture capital and strategic corporate investors where we can provide value add through our extensive network of industry relationships, serve as a potential partner or customer, complement our current or future debt capital investment efforts, or take an active role in the company.

The Company had prepayments of $53.3 million during the quarter, resulting in a weighted average annualized portfolio yield on debt investments for the first quarter of 16.8%. The Company calculates weighted average portfolio yield as the annualized rate of the interest income recognized during the period divided by the average amortized cost of debt investments in the portfolio at the beginning of each month in the period.1As of March 31, 2017, the Company had 51 debt investments with 18 companies and 38 warrant and equity investments with 33 companies. The total cost and fair value of these investments were $326.7 million and $328.4 million, respectively. Total portfolio investment activity for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was as follows:        For the Three Months Ended March 31,     (dollars in thousands)         2017               2016         Beginning portfolio at fair value     $   374,311       $   271,717       New debt investments       11,762         55,363       Scheduled principal payments and sale proceeds received from investments       (1,926   )       (2,621   )     Early principal prepayments       (53,274   )       (29,817   )     Accretion of debt investment fees       (1,197   )       795       New warrants       157         660       New equity investments       2,400         —       Payment-in-kind coupon       317         640       Net realized gains (losses) on investments       (1,681   )       (651   )     Net unrealized gains (losses) on investments         (2,461   )         (13,329   )     Ending portfolio at fair value     $   328,408         $   282,757                    Signed Term SheetsDuring the first quarter of 2017, TriplePoint Capital LLC (“TPC”) entered into $48.8 million of non-binding term sheets to venture growth stage companies. All of these opportunities are subject to a number of conditions including completion of due diligence, negotiation of definitive documentation, and investment committee approval, as well as compliance with TPC’s allocation policy. Accordingly, there is no assurance that any or all of these transactions will be completed or assigned to the Company even though the Company is the primary vehicle through which TPC focuses its venture growth stage business.Debt Investment CommitmentsAs of March 31, 2017, the Company’s unfunded commitments totaled $117.4 million of which $50.0 million is dependent upon customers reaching certain milestones.

Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, unfunded commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements or future earning assets for the Company.Results of OperationsFor the first quarter of 2017 the Company’s total investment and other income was $14.3 million, as compared to $11.1 million for the first quarter of 2016, representing a weighted average annualized portfolio yield on its debt investments of 16.8% during the first quarter of 2017 as compared to 15.7% for the first quarter of 2016.Operating expenses for the first quarter of 2017 were $6.4 million as compared to $4.4 million for the first quarter of 2016.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
