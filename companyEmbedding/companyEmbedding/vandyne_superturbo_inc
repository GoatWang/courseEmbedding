LOVELAND, Colo. and INDIANAPOLIS, Oct. 11, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- VanDyne SuperTurbo Inc. and Allison Transmission Inc. have announced a collaboration to co-develop a vehicle demonstrator. The companies plan to leverage the unique performance benefits of VanDyne's mechanically driven turbocharger in combination with Allison's TC10® transmission in a Class 8 tractor.

Through the deployment of advanced control techniques, the two technologies will maximize the benefits of engine downspeeding, efficient supercharging and turbo compounding. The primary objective of the collaboration is to demonstrate how these two products, when paired with an intelligently controlled vehicle, can reduce carbon dioxide emissions and improve fuel efficiency without sacrificing performance.  
With an innovative design, the fully automatic TC10 combines Allison's torque converter with a unique twin countershaft gear scheme. This combination provides both full power shifts and cruising fuel economy for greater productivity and efficiency. The transmission is ideal for tractor applications and is extremely well-suited for distribution applications where the tractor-trailer splits its work cycle between city and highway conditions.  
The SuperTurbo™ utilizes a continuously variable transmission coupled with a high speed traction drive to control turbocharger speed and allow for bidirectional torque transfer. Key to the combination with the TC10 is the SuperTurbo's ability to supply on-demand boost pressure which allows the transmission to execute efficient shifts while maintaining beneficial air fuel ratios and high power levels.  
The SuperTurbo acts as a supercharger through transients, using a combination of turbine power and engine power to allow faster rises in engine torque and minimizing the need to run higher engine RPM. These capabilities are further enhanced with the benefits provided by the fully automatic TC10. Additionally, the new control strategy will incorporate predictive shifting with a more responsive engine due to the addition of the SuperTurbo.
Unlocking the full potential of engine downspeeding to maximize vehicle efficiency requires a systems approach. Allison and VanDyne launched the evaluation of this unique systems approach to engine downspeeding in 2015 and this first vehicle demonstrator is the next step in the process. The potential applications being evaluated include long haul, regional haul and city driving conditions.

VanDyne SuperTurbo™ specializes in the design, development and commercialization of SuperTurbos™ for the global automotive and truck markets.  Founded in 2009, the company is headquartered in Loveland, Colorado and is a leader in the application of advanced driven-turbo technology.   VanDyne's proprietary SuperTurbo system enables engines and vehicles to achieve important emission reduction, realize fuel savings and increase overall performance.  For more information, visit www.vandynesuperturbo.com.

VanDyne SuperTurbo™ Raises $8 Million in Series C Equity Financing

FT. COLLINS, Colo., Feb. 14, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- VanDyne SuperTurbo™ Inc. has raised $8 million in Series C equity financing round. The round was led by Northwater Capital's Intellectual Property Fund with participation by existing investors. Proceeds from the financing will help drive the company's growth initiatives and speed up the commercialization of the SuperTurbo™ technology. 
"Thanks to Northwater we are going to be able to take the SuperTurbo from a prototype to a product in the next two years," said Ed VanDyne, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. "This round of funding will allow the company to put the SuperTurbo through the rigorous durability testing required by the automotive industry." 
The VanDyne SuperTurbo technology integrates the functions of supercharging and turbocharging into a single device, by combining turbomachinery with a transmission. This combination allows a third function called turbocompounding, which increases the efficiency of an engine from the collection of waste heat energy. The SuperTurbo promises to deliver up to 6% efficiency gains in trucks. A SuperTurbo can make a half size engine deliver the same torque as a normal engine today. Using a half size engine with a SuperTurbo in a car will give it 36% better mileage. 
"The SuperTurbo is really breakthrough technology," said David Patterson, Northwater Capital's Chief Executive Officer. "The market for enabling technologies allowing for engine downsizing, efficiency improvement and emission reduction is rapidly expanding and this technology is perfectly suited to fulfill the needs of automotive and truck manufacturers." 
About VanDyne SuperTurbo, Inc. - VanDyne SuperTurbo™, headquartered in Fort Collins, Colorado, specializes in the design, development and production of SuperTurbochargers for the global automotive and truck markets. A SuperTurbo™ offers the most cost effective solution to meeting fuel efficiency regulations and reducing green house gas emissions. For more information please go to www.VanDyneSuperTurbo.com
