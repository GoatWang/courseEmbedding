Paradise and Pennant Candied Fruit
Candied Cherry Pineapple Crispies
Crisp rice cereal gives this cookie its name, as well as an amazing crunchy texture. Combined with a pound of candied cherry pineapple mix, lots of pecans and a little cinnamon you have a sweet and salty cookie that is big on flavor and loaded with goodness. This tasty cookie is great for lunch boxes, cookie jars, picnics and more, and it is sure to become a household favorite.


Ingredients:

3 cups crisp rice cereal crushed to 3/4 cup
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
16 oz. chopped candied cherry pineapple mix
1-1/2 cup chopped pecans
1 egg
3 tablespoons light corn syrup

Preheat oven to 350º
Combined cereal, flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon, set aside. Beat together butter and sugar until light and fluffy, add egg, beat well, add to cereal mixture, mix until combined, stir in fruit and pecans.

About Paradise, Inc.

Paradise Brands Brings You a Rich Tradition of Delectable Confections…. For nearly three-quarters of a century, Paradise, Inc., has produced, packed and distributed its brands of Candied Fruit, which have been the favorites of homemakers and commercial bakers throughout North America.
The company, Paradise; began as a subsidiary of a diversified corporation soon after WW II, but shortly thereafter, Candied Fruit became the focus of its business and other operations were either sold or closed. In 1961, current ownership purchased the company, and the name Paradise Fruit Company was adopted and later incorporated in 1965 as Paradise Fruit Company, Inc. Through ever increasing diversification and a number of acquisitions of related entities, the company’s name was changed in 1993, to Paradise, Inc.
The Paradise Brands include PARADISE™, PENNANT™, SUNRIPE™, MOR-FRUIT™, DIXIE BRAND™, and WHITE SWAN™. In addition, some of America’s leading grocery retailers like; The Kroger Companies, Safeway Stores, Inc., Food Lion, LLC and Bi-Lo, LLC have such confidence in Paradise quality, that they offer it for sale, under their own labels. Today, these brands make Paradise, Inc. the largest manufacturer and supplier of consumer packaged Candied Fruit in the world. Now you can enjoy creating mouth watering Holiday Recipes and other traditional and non-traditional confections year-round.
We are very happy to offer you our NEW Paradise Interactive web-site, www.paradisefruitco.com , to search for your favorite recipes, join our new Paradise Recipe Club, submit your own secret family recipes, and purchase Paradise Candied Fruit year-round………….
