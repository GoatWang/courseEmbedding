A Community for Professionals in Private Capital



































Tom Renyi Joins CVC Capital Partners


January 26, 2010
By PEHub Administrator






Tom Renyi has joined CVC Capital Partners as a senior advisor. He recently retired as chairman of The Bank of New York Mellon Corp., after also having served as its chief executive.
PRESS RELEASE
CVC Capital Partners (“CVC”), a leading global private equity firm, is pleased to announce the appointment of Thomas (“Tom”) Renyi as a senior advisor to CVC. Mr. Renyi will become a member of CVC’s U.S. Advisory Board and Global Financial Institutions Advisory Board to support CVC’s activities in the financial services sector.
Mr. Renyi has had a distinguished career in the financial services industry and recently retired as Executive Chairman and Director of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation. Previously, Mr. Renyi served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation and its predecessor institution, The Bank of New York, from 1997 to 2007. In addition to successfully growing the Company through numerous strategic initiatives, Mr. Renyi played an essential role in initiating, leading, executing and integrating the merger of The Bank of New York and Mellon Financial, one of the industry’s most successful and transformational transactions.
Mr. Renyi’s career at the Bank of New York began in 1971 and included key leadership roles in securities servicing, credit policy and capital markets. In 1989, Mr. Renyi led the transition team responsible for integrating the Irving Trust Company into The Bank of New York, which was the largest merger in the U.S. Banking industry at the time and set the stage for the next chapter in The Bank of New York’s global growth.
Mr. Renyi currently serves on the Board of Directors of Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated and RiskMetrics Group. He is a past chairman of The Financial Services Roundtable.
Kamil Salame, CVC Partner and Head of the U.S. Financial Institutions Group, said: “We are delighted to welcome Tom to CVC. He is a tremendously successful executive who is held in the highest regard in our industry. Tom has played an important role in shaping and transforming the financial services sector and we are confident Tom’s experience will be extraordinarily valuable to CVC as we assess opportunities at this particularly dynamic time.”
With 19 offices throughout Europe, Asia, and the United States, CVC has an industry-leading global presence. CVC currently has approximately $20 billion of uninvested equity capital, making the firm one of the top five sources of available private equity funds in the world. CVC has significant experience in financial services investments, and its dedicated Global Financial Institutions Group focuses on investing in leading financial businesses across Europe, North America and Asia.

Thomas A. Renyi
 






 





                    BA ‘67, MBA ‘68        





Retired Executive Chairman; The Bank of New York Mellon




Bio: 


Thomas A. Renyi served as Chairman of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation and its predecessor institution, The Bank of New York Company, Inc., during more than a decade of unprecedented growth and transformation.
At the time of his retirement in July 2008, he was Executive Chairman of The Bank of New York Mellon, overseeing the global integration of the people, technology, and capabilities of two major organizations, The Bank of New York and Mellon Financial, which merged in July 2007. Prior to the merger, Mr. Renyi served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for The Bank of New York, which traces its roots to 1784 and was the first company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Renyi followed a line of leaders that began with the bank’s founder, Alexander Hamilton.
Mr. Renyi’s career at the bank began in 1971 and spanned almost four decades. In 1989, he headed the transition team responsible for integrating the Irving Trust Company into The Bank of New York. It was the largest merger in the U.S. banking industry at the time. In 1992, Mr. Renyi was named President of The Bank of New York and elected to its Board of Directors. In 1997, he was appointed Chief Executive Officer and the following year was elected Chairman of the Board. During his 10 years as CEO, he successfully led The Bank of New York’s transformation from a traditional commercial bank to a global leader in securities servicing. He accelerated the bank’s strategic evolution through more than 80 acquisitions.
Mr. Renyi graduated from Rutgers College in 1967 with a B.A. in Business Administration and earned an M.B.A. in 1968 from Rutgers Business School–Newark and New Brunswick, then known as the Graduate School of Management. He served as a first lieutenant in military intelligence with the U.S. Army in Vietnam.
Mr. Renyi is a member of the Board of Overseers of the Rutgers University Foundation and serves on the Board of Directors of Public Service Enterprise Group and Risk Metrics. He is also a member of the Board of Directors of the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and the boards of trustees of the Healthcare Chaplaincy and the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York.
Recognized: May 10, 2001

Katharine Hart Eden, the daughter of Jane and Michael Eden of Hanover, Mass., was married yesterday to Christopher Todd Renyi, a son of Elizabeth and Thomas A. Renyi of Wyckoff, N.J. The Rev. Donald Remick officiated at the Second Congregational Church in Cohasset, Mass., with Msgr. Thomas M. O'Leary taking part.The bride, 26, will take her husband's name. She works in San Francisco as the public relations manager for Business 2.0, a Time Inc. magazine. She graduated from Denison University. Her father, who is retired, was the manager of manufacturing development at Polaroid in Cambridge, Mass. Her mother, also retired, taught the first grade at the Center School in Hanover.The bridegroom, 27, is a freelance Internet research consultant in San Francisco. He graduated from Bates College. His father is the chairman and chief executive of the Bank of New York Company in New York. The bridegroom's mother is a coordinator of the bereavement ministry at St. Elizabeth Roman Catholic Church in Wyckoff, currently assisting families of victims of the World Trade Center attacks.Ms. Eden and Mr. Renyi were living and working in Boston in June 1998 when a mutual friend introduced them at a party. Although the encounter was brief, Ms. Eden made an impression on Mr. Renyi, who enjoys hiking, mountain climbing and other outdoor sports.

''She was training for the New York marathon and arrived at the party right after completing a run,'' Mr. Renyi recalled. ''I was impressed, because it takes so much dedication and training.'' Continue reading the main story

Four months later, in October, Ms. Eden and a few friends held a party at a Boston bar to raise money for the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, to which they had dedicated their forthcoming New York marathon run. When the friend who had invited Mr. Renyi to the first party invited him to this one, he was quick to say yes.

''However Kate, as one of the hosts, was busy most of the party,'' Mr. Renyi said. ''After about an hour and a half, I decided to leave.''But he left with a bang: he walked up to Ms. Eden and kissed her on the cheek.''I thought, 'Why not just go for it -- what do you have to lose?' '' Mr. Renyi said. The kiss, Ms. Eden said, ''definitely piqued my interest.''It was still on her mind six weeks later, when she and her roommates gave a Christmas party. Aware that one roommate had invited Mr. Renyi, Ms. Eden kept a close eye on the door. ''Because of the kiss on the cheek, I had been waiting for the chance to be at an event with him,'' she said.When he arrived, Ms. Eden didn't know when she would see him again, so she decided to ask him out on a date -- sort of.''I invited him to go mountain biking,'' Ms. Eden said.
