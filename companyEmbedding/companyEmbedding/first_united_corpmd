(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2014, which are included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report.  Overview  First United Corporation is a bank holding company that, through the Bank and its non-bank subsidiaries, provides an array of financial products and services primarily to customers in four Western Maryland counties and two Northeastern West Virginia counties. Its principal operating subsidiary is the Bank, which consists of a community banking network of 25 branch offices located throughout its market areas. Our primary sources of revenue are interest income earned from our loan and investment securities portfolios and fees earned from financial services provided to customers.  Consolidated net income available to common shareholders was $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $4.7 million for 2013. Basic and diluted net income per common share for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $.48, compared to basic and diluted net income per common share of $.76 for 2013. The decrease in earnings for 2014 was due to a decrease of $3.5 million in interest income, primarily interest on loans, and an increase in provision expense of $2.1 million, offset by an increase of $.8 million in other operating income, a decrease of $.9 million in interest expense, and a $2.2 million decrease in other operating expenses. The increase in other operating income was attributable to an increase of $.8 million in gains on sales of securities, a $.3 million increase in Trust department income, and a $.4 million increase in Bank Owned Life Insurance ("BOLI") income. These increases were offset by a $.5 million decrease in service charges, primarily NSF fees, and a $.2 million decrease in other income. The decrease in other operating expenses was due to a decrease of $.4 million in salaries and benefits, a decrease of $.6 million in Other Real Estate Owned ("OREO") expenses and a decrease of $.7 million in other miscellaneous expenses. The increase of $.8 million on the Series A Preferred Stock dividends in 2014 also contributed to the decrease in net income available to common shareholders due to an increase in the contractual rate paid in 2014. The net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2014, on a fully tax equivalent ("FTE") basis, decreased to 3.00% from 3.25% for the year ended December 31, 2013.  The provision for loan losses increased to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was driven by rolling historical loss rates, management's consideration of the qualitative factors that are likely to cause losses, and an $.8 million recovery on a large commercial real estate credit during the third quarter of 2013. Specific allocations have been made for impaired loans where management has determined that the collateral supporting the loans is not adequate to cover the loan balance, and the qualitative factors affecting the allowance for loan losses (the "ALL") have been adjusted based on the current economic environment and the characteristics of the loan portfolio.  Interest expense on our interest-bearing liabilities decreased $.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to 2013 due to a decrease of $25.2 million in average interest-bearing deposits and a decrease of 21 basis points on the average rate paid on long-term borrowings. During 2014, we continued to focus on shifting our deposit mix away from higher cost certificates of deposit and toward lower cost money market and transaction accounts.  Other operating income increased $.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to 2013. This increase was primarily attributable to $1.1 million in gains on the sale of securities for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a $.3 million increase in Trust department income, and a $.4 million increase in BOLI income. The increase in BOLI income was attributable to a one-time death benefit of $.4 million received in December 2014.  Operating expenses decreased $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to the same period of 2013. This decrease was due to decreases of $.4 million in salaries and benefits, $.6 million in OREO expenses and $.7 million in other expenses. Declines in other expenses were due primarily to reduced personnel related expenses such as in house training, a decline in telephone expenses, and reduced fraud expenses related to debit cards.  Comparing December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2013, outstanding loans increased $29.8 million (3.7%). CRE loans decreased $11.9 million as a result of the payoff of two large loans of approximately $15 million during the third quarter of 2014. Acquisition and development ("A&D") loans decreased $7.9 million due to regularly scheduled principal payments and payoffs. Commercial and industrial ("C&I") loans increased $33.5 million due to new loan relationships, primarily one large relationship in the first quarter of 2014. Residential mortgage loans increased $16.7 million due to increased production of loans primarily in our 10/1 and 7/1 adjustable rate mortgage program. The Bank continues to use Fannie Mae for the majority of new, longer-term, fixed-rate residential loan originations. The consumer loan portfolio decreased slightly by $.6 million due to repayment activity in the indirect auto portfolio offsetting new production. At December 31, 2014, approximately 44% of the commercial loan portfolio was collateralized by real estate, compared to approximately 57% at December 31, 2013.  [25]  Interest income on loans decreased by $4.7 million (on a FTE basis) in 2014 when compared to 2013 due to the continued low rate environment. Interest income on our investment securities increased by $1.2 million (on a FTE basis) in 2014 when compared to 2013 due to purchases during 2014. (Additional information on the composition of interest income is available in Table 1 that appears on page 31).  Total deposits at December 31, 2014 increased $3.9 million when compared to December 31, 2013. We recorded increases in core deposits and reductions in certificates of deposit due to our continued focus on shifting the mix of our deposit portfolio from higher cost certificates of deposit to lower cost money market and transaction accounts. Non-interest bearing deposits increased $25.3 million. Traditional savings accounts increased $13.0 million due to continued growth in our Prime Saver product. Total demand deposits decreased $8.4 million and total money market accounts increased $8.9 million. Time deposits less than $100,000 declined $22.4 million and time deposits greater than $100,000 decreased $12.5 million.  Interest expense decreased $.9 million in 2014 when compared to 2013. The decline was primarily due to our continued focus on shifting our deposit mix from higher cost certificates of deposit to core deposits.  Other Operating Income/Other Operating Expense  Other operating income, exclusive of gains, decreased $.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to 2013. Service charge income decreased $.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to 2013 due to reduced insufficient funds fees ("NSF fees"). The reduction in NSF fees was due to the increased regulations on fees. Other income declined by $.3 million due to a decline in fair values on deferred compensation plans. These decreases were offset by an increase of $.3 million in Trust department income and $.4 million in BOLI income.  Net gains of $1.1 million were reported through other income for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to net gains of $.2 million for 2013. The increase in net gains for 2014 over 2013 was due to a net gain of $1.1 million realized on sales of investment securities.  Operating expenses decreased $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to the same period of 2013. This decrease was due to decreases of $.4 million in salaries and benefits, $.6 million in OREO expenses and $.7 million in other expenses. Declines in other expenses were due primarily to reduced personnel related expenses such as in house training, a decline in telephone expenses, and reduced fraud expenses related to debit cards.  Dividends - The Corporation's Board of Directors suspended the payment of dividends on outstanding shares of common stock in December 2010 when it approved the deferral cash of dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock, and this suspension remains in effect.  Looking Forward - We will continue to face risks and challenges in the future, including, without limitation, changes in local economic conditions in our core geographic markets, potential yield compression on loan and deposit products from existing competitors and potential new entrants in our markets, fluctuations in interest rates, and changes to existing federal and state laws and regulations that apply to banks and financial holding companies. For a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors, see Item 1A of Part I of this annual report.  Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies  This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) On an on-going basis, management evaluates estimates and bases those estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Allowance for Loan Losses, or ALL  One of our most important accounting policies is that related to the monitoring of the loan portfolio. A variety of estimates impact the carrying value of the loan portfolio, including the calculation of the ALL, the valuation of underlying collateral, the timing of loan charge-offs and the placement of loans on non-accrual status. The ALL is established and maintained at a level that management believes is adequate to cover losses resulting from the inability of borrowers to make required payment on loans. Estimates for loan losses are arrived at by analyzing risks associated with specific loans and the loan portfolio, current and historical trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, and changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio. The analysis also requires consideration of the economic climate and direction, changes in lending rates, political conditions, legislation impacting the banking industry and economic conditions specific to Western Maryland and Northeastern West Virginia. Because the calculation of the ALL relies on management's estimates and judgments relating to inherently uncertain events, actual results may differ from management's estimates.  [26]  The ALL is also discussed below in Item 7 under the heading "Allowance for Loan Losses" and in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Goodwill  ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, establishes standards for the amortization of acquired intangible assets and impairment assessment of goodwill. At December 31, 2014, we had $11.0 million in recorded goodwill that is related to the 2003 acquisition of Huntington National Bank and is not subject to periodic amortization.  Goodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Impairment testing requires that the fair value of each of the Corporation's reporting units be compared to the carrying amount of its net assets, including goodwill. If the estimated current fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no additional testing is required and an impairment loss is not recorded. Otherwise, additional testing is performed, and to the extent such additional testing results in a conclusion that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized.  Our goodwill relates to the value inherent in the banking business, and that value is dependent upon our ability to provide quality, cost effective services in a highly competitive local market. This ability relies upon continuing investments in processing systems, the development of value-added service features and the ease of use of our services. As such, goodwill value is supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted. A decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill, which could adversely impact earnings in future periods. ASC Topic 350 requires an annual evaluation of goodwill for impairment. The determination of whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments and estimates.  During 2014, shares of the Corporation's common stock traded at prices that were below the common stock's book value and, at December 31, 2014, the sales price was below the common stock's tangible book value. Management believed that these circumstances could indicate the possibility of impairment. Accordingly, management consulted a third party valuation specialist to assist it with the determination of the fair value of the Corporation, considering both the market approach (guideline public company method) and the income approach (discounted future benefits method). Due to the illiquidity in the common stock and the adverse conditions surrounding the banking industry, reliance was placed on the income approach in determining the fair value of the Corporation. The income approach is a discounted cash flow analysis that is determined by adding (i) the present value, which is a representation of the current value of a sum that is to be received some time in the future, of the estimated net income, net of dividends paid out, that the Corporation could generate over the next five years and (ii) the present value of a terminal value, which is a representation of the current value of an entity at a specified time in the future. The terminal value was calculated using both a price to tangible book multiple method and a capitalization method and the more conservative of the two was utilized in the fair value calculation.  Significant assumptions used in the above methods include:  · Net income from our forward five-year operating budget, incorporating conservative growth and mix assumptions;  · A discount rate of 14.15% based on an internally derived cost of equity capital determined using the "build-up" method;  · A price to tangible book multiple of 1.18x, which was the median multiple of non-assisted transactions for non-assisted commercial bank acquisitions during the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 for selling companies headquartered in the Eastern regional area as compiled by Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.; and  · A capitalization rate of 8.15% (discount rate of 14.15% adjusted for a conservative growth rate of 6.0%).  The resulting fair value of the income approach resulted in the fair value of the Corporation exceeding the carrying value by 52%. Management stressed the assumptions used in the analysis to provide additional support for the derived value. This stress testing showed that (i) the discount rate could increase to 27% before the excess would be eliminated in the tangible multiple method, and  Accounting for Income Taxes  We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, "Income Taxes". Under this guidance, deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date.  [27]  We regularly review the carrying amount of our net deferred tax assets to determine if the establishment of a valuation allowance is necessary. If based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our net deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods, then a deferred tax valuation allowance must be established. Consideration is given to various positive and negative factors that could affect the realization of the deferred tax assets. In evaluating this available evidence, management considers, among other things, historical performance, expectations of future earnings, the ability to carry back losses to recoup taxes previously paid, length of statutory carry forward periods, experience with utilization of operating loss and tax credit carry forwards not expiring, tax planning strategies and timing of reversals of temporary differences. Significant judgment is required in assessing future earnings trends and the timing of reversals of temporary differences. Our evaluation is based on current tax laws as well as management's expectations of future performance.  Management expects that the Corporation's adherence to the required accounting guidance may result in increased volatility in quarterly and annual effective income tax rates because of changes in judgment or measurement including changes in actual and forecasted income before taxes, tax laws and regulations, and tax planning strategies.  Other-Than-Temporary Impairment of Investment Securities  Management systematically evaluates the securities in our investment portfolio for impairment on a quarterly basis. Based upon the application of accounting guidance for subsequent measurement in ASC Topic 320 (Section 320-10-35), management assesses whether (i) we have the intent to sell a security being evaluated and (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to its anticipated recovery. If neither applies, then declines in the fair values of securities below their cost that are considered other-than-temporary declines are split into two components. The first is the loss attributable to declining credit quality. Credit losses are recognized in earnings as realized losses in the period in which the impairment determination is made. The second component consists of all other losses, which are recognized in other comprehensive loss. In estimating other-than-temporary impairment ("OTTI") losses, management considers (a) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (b) adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry, or a geographic area, (c) the historic and implied volatility of the fair value of the security, (d) changes in the rating of the security by a rating agency, (e) recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date, (f) failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments, and (g) the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future. Management also monitors cash flow projections for securities that are considered beneficial interests under the guidance of ASC Subtopic 325-40, Investments - Other - Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets, (ASC Section 325-40-35). This process is described more fully in the section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review entitled "Investment Securities".  Fair Value of Investments  We have determined the fair value of our investment securities in accordance with the requirements of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements. We measure the fair market values of our investments based on the fair value hierarchy established in Topic 820. The determination of fair value of investments and other assets is discussed further in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Pension Plan Assumptions  Our pension plan costs are calculated using actuarial concepts, as discussed within the requirements of ASC Topic 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits. Pension expense and the determination of our projected pension liability are based upon two critical assumptions: the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. We evaluate each of these critical assumptions annually. Other assumptions impact the determination of pension expense and the projected liability including the primary employee demographics, such as retirement patterns, employee turnover, mortality rates, and estimated employer compensation increases. These factors, along with the critical assumptions, are carefully reviewed by management each year in consultation with our pension plan consultants and actuaries. Further information about our pension plan assumptions, the plan's funded status, and other plan information is included in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Other than as discussed above, management does not believe that any material changes in our critical accounting policies have occurred since December 31, 2014.  [28]  Adoption of New Accounting Standards and Effects of New Accounting Pronouncements  Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements discusses new accounting  CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME REVIEW  Net Interest Income  Net interest income is our largest source of operating revenue. Net interest income is the difference between the interest that we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense we incur on our interest-bearing liabilities. For analytical and discussion purposes, net interest income is adjusted to an FTE basis to facilitate performance comparisons between taxable and tax-exempt assets by increasing tax-exempt income by an amount equal to the federal income taxes that would have been paid if this income were taxable at the statutorily applicable rate.  The table below summarizes net interest income (on an FTE basis) for 2014 and 2013.  (Dollars in thousands) 2014 2013 Interest income $ 47,350 $ 50,893 Interest expense 10,870 11,732 Net interest income $ 36,480 $ 39,161 Net interest margin % 3.00 % 3.25 %  Net interest income on an FTE basis decreased $2.7 million (6.8%) for the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to 2013 due to a $3.5 million (7.0%) decrease in interest income, which was partially offset by a $.8 million (7.3%) decrease in interest expense. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to the $23.9 million (2.8%) reduction in the average balance of loans and a decrease of 43 basis points on yields when comparing the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. The reduction in loan yields was attributable to loans repricing at lower rates and new loans booked at lower rates. The decline in interest income was partially offset by a decline in interest expense due to the reduction in the average balances of interest-bearing deposits and a decrease of 21 basis points on long-term borrowings. We saw a decrease in the net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 3.00% when compared to 3.25% for the year ended December 31, 2013 and 3.30% for the year ended December 31, 2012.  When comparing the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2013, there was an overall $9.6 million increase in average interest-earning assets, driven by an increase of $57.1 million in investment securities, offset by a $23.9 million reduction in loans and a $23.6 million decrease in other interest-earning assets, primarily cash.  Interest expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 due primarily to an overall decrease of $27.1 million on our average interest-bearing liabilities. The overall effect was a 6 basis point decrease in the average rate paid from 1.13% for 2013 to 1.07% for 2014. This decrease was due to a reduction of $47.2 million in certificates of deposit and a decrease of $1.9 million in borrowings, offset by an increase of $22.0 million in demand deposits, savings and money market accounts.  As shown below, the composition of total interest income between 2014 and 2013 remained relatively stable between interest and fees on loans and investment securities with a slight decline in interest and fees on loans offset by an increase in interest on investment securities.   % of Total Interest Income 2014 2013 Interest and fees on loans 81 % 85 % Interest on investment securities 18 % 14 % Other 1 % 1 %  [29]  Table 1 sets forth the average balances, net interest income and expense, and average yields and rates for our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for 2014, 2013 and 2012. Table 2 sets forth an analysis of volume and rate changes in interest income and interest expense of our average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities for 2014, 2013 and 2012. Table 2 distinguishes between the changes related to average outstanding balances (changes in volume created by holding the interest rate constant) and the changes related to average interest rates (changes in interest income or expense attributed to average rates created by holding the outstanding balance constant).

	FIRST UNITED
	CORPORATION ANNOUNCES 3rd QUARTER 2016 EARNINGS






	 





	OAKLAND, MARYLAND—November
	7, 2016: First United Corporation (NASDAQ: FUNC), a bank holding company and the parent company of First United Bank & Trust,
	announces that consolidated net income available to common shareholders was $4.3 million for the first nine months of 2016, compared
	to $2.5 million for the same period of 2015. Basic and diluted net income per common share for the first nine months of 2016 were
	both $.68, compared to basic and diluted net income per common share of $.39 for the same period of 2015. The increase in earnings
	was due to an increase in net interest income of $1.4 million, offset by an increase of $1.6 million in provision for loan losses,
	an increase of $1.4 million in other operating income, and a decrease of $1.0 million in other operating expenses, offset by an
	increase of $.9 million in provision for income taxes. The net interest margin for the first nine months of 2016, the year ended
	December 31, 2015 and the first nine months of 2015, on a fully tax equivalent (“FTE”) basis, was 3.21%, 3.04% and
	3.07%, respectively. The increase in interest income on earning assets and a reduction in interest expense contributed to the
	increase in the net interest margin for the first nine months of 2016 when compared to the margin recorded for the year ended
	December 31, 2015.




	 




	Consolidated
	net income available to common shareholders was $1.8 million, or $.29 per common share, for the third quarter of 2016, compared
	to $1.3 million, or $.20 per common share, for the same period of 2015. The increase in earnings for the third quarter of 2016
	when compared to the third quarter of 2015 was attributable to an increase in net interest income of $.3 million, an increase
	in other operating income of $.3 million and a decline in provision for loan losses of $.2 million, partially offset by increases
	in other operating expenses of approximately $.1 million and an increase of $.4 million in provision for income taxes. The net
	interest margin for the third quarter of 2016, on an FTE basis, was 3.22% compared to 3.13% for the same period of 2015.




	 






	Financial
	Highlights Comparing the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:






	 








	·




	Provision
	expense for the first nine months of 2016 increased by $1.6 million when compared to
	the first nine months of 2015. The increase was driven by a specific allocation on a
	large participation loan in Pennsylvania.






	 








	·




	Other
	operating income increased $.3 million during the third quarter of 2016 when compared
	to the same period of 2015. This increase was due to a $.2 million increase on net gains
	on sales of investment securities as well as increased service charge income related
	to paper statement fees and account analysis fees.






	 








	·




	Operating
	expenses increased $.1 million in the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the same
	period of 2015. This increase was due to an increase of $.5 million in other real estate
	owned (“OREO”) expense relating to valuation write-downs in the third quarter
	2016 compared to gains on sales of OREO properties in the third quarter of 2015, an increase
	of $.4 million in miscellaneous expenses due to increased marketing and printed supplies
	relating to our new branding initiative, and increased contract labor expenses and miscellaneous
	loan fees, offset by a decrease in FDIC premiums of $.4 million and a $.2 million decrease
	in salaries and employee benefits primarily related to reduced health insurance costs.





	 






	 





	 





	 




	“During this quarter, we unveiled
	our new brand which has received a very positive response from our associates, customers and communities.  We believe our
	new look and feel positions us well for future success as it better aligns the bank and our value system with our customer preferences
	as we strive to be relevant to our changing market demographics.  We are pleased that we were able to rebrand with little
	additional cost to our existing marketing and operational budgets.  Our third quarter core earnings continue to show a positive
	trend as we remain focused on increasing our margin and controlling costs.” stated Carissa L. Rodeheaver, Chairman of the
	Board, Chief Executive Officer and President.




	 






	Balance
	Sheet Overview






	 




	Total assets
	at September 30, 2016 remained stable at $1.3 billion when compared to December 31, 2015. During the first nine months of 2016,
	cash and interest-bearing deposits in other banks increased $13.9 million, the investment portfolio decreased $29.4 million, and
	gross loans increased $23.5 million. Total liabilities increased by $20.7 million during the first nine months of 2016 due primarily
	to an increase in deposits of $20.4 million. Comparing September 30, 2016 to December 31, 2015, shareholders’ equity decreased
	$6.0 million as a result of First United Corporation’s redemption of $10.0 million of its outstanding shares of Fixed Rate
	Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, in February 2016, offset partially by $4.3 million in earnings during the first
	nine months of 2016.




	 




	Total
	investment securities available-for-sale decreased $22.2 million since December 31, 2015. This decline during the first nine months
	was due to sales of investments for loan funding as well as calls on investments. At September 30, 2016, the securities classified
	as available-for-sale included a net unrealized loss of $3.3 million, which represents the difference between the fair value and
	amortized cost of securities in the portfolio.




	 




	Comparing September
	30, 2016 to December 31, 2015, outstanding loans increased by $23.5 million (2.67%), commercial real estate (“CRE”)
	loans increased $12.0 million due to several new large relationships booked during the first nine months, acquisition and development
	(“A&D”) loans increased $.6 million, commercial and industrial (“C&I”) loans increased $1.7 million,
	residential mortgages increased by $9.7 million primarily due to new loans booked in our 5/1 and 7/1 adjustable rate mortgage
	programs, and the consumer portfolio decreased by $.7 million. Approximately 37% of the commercial loan portfolio was collateralized
	by real estate at September 30, 2016, compared to 39% at December 31, 2015.




	 




	Total
	deposits increased $20.4 million during the first nine months of 2016 when compared to deposits at December 31, 2015. With the
	continued focus of our retail staff to change the mix of the deposit portfolio, we have seen increases in core deposits and reductions
	in certificates of deposit. Non-interest bearing deposits increased $17.1 million. Traditional savings accounts increased $10.2
	million due to continued growth in our Prime Saver product. Total demand deposits decreased $.2 million and total money market
	accounts increased $6.0 million due to increased balances in our Insured Cash Sweep (“ICS”) money market account due
	primarily to a shift of trust department balances to the ICS product. Time deposits less than $100,000 declined $9.5 million and
	time deposits greater than $100,000 decreased $3.2 million.




	 









	 





	 





	 




	The
	book value of the Corporation’s common stock was $15.12 per share at September 30, 2016, compared to $14.51 per share at
	December 31, 2015.




	 




	At September
	30, 2016, there were 6,269,004 outstanding shares of the Corporation’s common stock and 20,000 outstanding shares of the
	Series A Preferred Stock.




	 






	Net-
	Interest Income (Tax-Equivalent Basis)






	 




	Net interest
	income, on an FTE basis, increased $1.2 million (4.37%) during the first nine months of 2016 over the same period in 2015 due
	to a $1.1 million (15.08%) decrease in interest expense; and $.1 million (.30%) increase in interest income. The net interest
	margin for the first nine months of 2016 was 3.21%, compared to 3.07% for the first nine months of 2015.




	 




	Comparing the
	first nine months of 2016 to the same period of 2015, the slight increase in interest income was due to an increase of $1.7 million
	in interest income on loans. This increase was due primarily to the increase in average loan balances of $61.9 million. This increase
	was offset by a decrease in interest income on investments due to a decline in average investments of $68.9 million.




	 




	Interest expense
	decreased during the first nine months of 2016 when compared to the same period of 2015 due primarily to a decrease of $12.3 million
	on our average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. This decrease was primarily due to the continued shift of higher cost
	certificates of deposit to lower cost core deposits. The effect of this shift was a decrease in average balances in certificates
	of deposit of $34.6 million and a decrease of 24 basis points in the average rate paid and an increase of $52.0 million in average
	balances in core deposits and a decrease of 13 basis points in the average rate paid. Although the average balance in long-term
	borrowings decreased $23.3 million due primarily to the payoff of a $30 million FHLB advance in July 2015, the effective rate
	paid on long-term borrowings increased 12 basis points due to the increase in rates paid on off-balance sheet interest rate swaps
	compared to the prior period. The effect on the average rate paid was a 14 basis point decrease from .98% for the nine months
	ended September 30, 2015 to .84% for the same period of 2016.




	 




	Net interest
	income, on an FTE basis, increased $.2 million (2.36%) during the third quarter of 2016 over the same period in 2015 due to a
	slight increase in interest income as well as a $.2 million (8.09%) decrease in interest expense. The net interest margin in the
	third quarter of 2016 was 3.22%, compared to 3.13% for third quarter of 2015.




	 




	Comparing the
	third quarter of 2016 to the same period of 2015, the slight increase in interest income was due to the increase in average loans
	of $68.9 million offset by a reduction in average investment balances of $64.6 million. The overall rate earned on earning assets
	for the third quarter of 2016 increased 4 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2015.




	 




	Interest expense
	decreased during the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the same period of 2015 due to a decrease on the average rate paid
	of 6 basis points from .91% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to .85% for the same period of 2016 due primarily to
	the shift in balances from higher cost certificates of deposit to lower cost core deposits.

	The allowance
	for loan losses (“ALL”) increased slightly to $12.0 million at September 30, 2016, from $11.9 million at December
	31, 2015. The provision for loan losses increased to $2.2 million for the first nine months of 2016, compared to $.6 million for
	the same period of 2015. Net charge-offs increased to $2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $.5
	million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The ratio of the ALL to loans outstanding was 1.33% at September 30, 2016,
	1.36% at December 31, 2015, and 1.45% at September 30, 2015.




	 




	The ratio of
	net charge-offs to average loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was an annualized .31%, compared to an annualized
	.08% for the same period in 2015 and .14% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The CRE portfolio had an annualized net charge-off
	rate as of September 30, 2016 of 1.24%, compared to an annualized net charge-off rate of .05% as of December 31, 2015. This increase
	in charge-offs is related to a $1.7 million charge-off on one loan due to reduced appraised value on the property. The A&D
	loans improved to an annualized net recovery rate as of September 30, 2016 of 1.52%, compared to an annualized net charge-off
	rate of .79% as of December 31, 2015. This improvement was due primarily to obtaining new appraisals on properties that secure
	a large loan relationship. The ratio for C&I loans had a net charge-off rate of .75% as of September 30, 2016, compared to
	no charge-offs as of December 31, 2015. The residential mortgage ratios were a net charge-off rate of .05% as of September 30,
	2016 and a net charge-off rate of .02% as of December 31, 2015, and the consumer loan ratios were net charge-off rates of .68%
	and .40% as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.




	 




	Non-accrual
	loans totaled $18.1 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $15.5 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in non-accrual
	balances at September 30, 2016 is primarily due to one large participation loan moved to non-accrual during the third quarter
	offset by one large relationship moving to OREO. Non-accrual loans which have been subject to a partial charge-off totaled $5.2
	million at September 30, 2016, compared to $4.1 million at December 31, 2015. Loans secured by 1-4 family residential real estate
	properties in the process of foreclosure were $1.2 million at September 30, 2016 and $1.8 million at December 31, 2015.




	 




	Accruing loans
	past due 30 days or more decreased to .69% of the loan portfolio at September 30, 2016, compared to .76% at December 31, 2015.
	The decrease for the first nine months of 2016 was due primarily to improvements in the non-owner occupied commercial real-estate,
	offset by an increase in the residential home equity portfolio.




	 






	Non-Interest
	Income and Non-Interest Expense






	 




	Other operating
	income, exclusive of gains, increased $1.0 million during the first nine months of 2016 when compared to the same period of 2015.
	This increase was primarily attributable to increases in service charge income relating to the implementation of paper statement
	fees in late 2015, trust and brokerage income, debit card income, and bank owned life insurance income due to a one-time death
	benefit of $.2 million received during the second quarter of 2016.



	 






	 





	 





	 




	Net gains of
	$.5 million were reported in other income in the first nine months of 2016, compared to net gains of $.1 million during the same
	period of 2015. The increase resulted from gains on sales of investment securities used for loan funding during the first half
	of 2016.




	 




	Other operating
	income, exclusive of gains, increased $.2 million during the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the same period of 2015. This
	increase was due increased service charge income relating to a paper statement fee implemented in late 2015, account analysis
	fees, and an increase in other miscellaneous income.




	 




	Net gains of
	$.2 million were reported in other income in the third quarter of 2016, compared to $.1 million in the same period of 2015. This
	increase was due to gains realized on sales of investment securities.




	 




	Operating expenses
	decreased $1.0 million in the first nine months of 2016 when compared to the same period of 2015. This was due primarily to a
	$.3 million decrease in OREO expenses, a $.7 million decrease in FDIC premiums, a $.3 million decrease in professional services
	and a $.4 million decrease in data processing expenses due to reduced expenses related to our core processor. These decreases
	were offset by an increase of $.8 million in other miscellaneous expenses due to a reserve for a pending loan claim, increased
	marketing and printed supplies relating to our new branding initiative and increased miscellaneous loan fees.




	 




	Operating expenses
	increased $.1 million in the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the same period of 2015. This increase was due to an increase
	of $.5 million in OREO expenses due to valuation write-downs in the third quarter of 2016 compared to gains on sales of properties
	in the third quarter of 2015 and a $.4 million increase in other miscellaneous expenses discussed above, offset by a decrease
	of $.4 million in FDIC premiums and a $.2 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits primarily related to reduced health
	insurance costs.

OAKLAND, Md., Aug. 10, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- First United Corporation (NASDAQ:   FUNC), a bank holding company and the parent company of First United Bank & Trust, announces consolidated net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 million for the first six months of 2015, compared to $1.3 million for the same period of 2014.  Basic and diluted net income per common share for the first six months of 2015 was $.19, compared to basic and diluted net income per common share of $.22 for the same period of 2014. The slight decrease in earnings was due primarily to decreases of $.2 million in net interest income and $.7 million in other operating income due to a decline in net gains.  These decreases in income were offset by an $.8 million decrease in provision expense.  The net interest margin for the first six months of 2015, the year ended December 31, 2014 and the first six months of 2014, on a fully tax equivalent ("FTE") basis, was 3.04%, 3.00% and 3.06%, respectively.  The increase in the net interest margin for the first six months of 2015 when compared to the margin recorded for the year ended December 31, 2014 was due primarily to the Bank's cash receipt of $.3 million of deferred interest on one bond in the Collateralized Debt Obligation ("CDO") portfolio during the first six months of 2015.
Consolidated net income available to common shareholders was $.5 million, or $.08 per common share, for the second quarter of 2015, compared to $.4 million, or $.07 per common share, for the same period of 2014.  The increase in earnings for the second quarter of 2015 when compared to the second quarter of 2014 was due to a $.5 million decrease in provision expense, a decrease of $.7 million in OREO expenses and a decrease of $.1 million in dividends attributable to the Series A Preferred Stock.  These items were offset by a $.9 million decrease in securities gains and a $.3 million increase in salaries and benefits.  The net interest margin for the second quarter of 2015, on a FTE basis, decreased to 3.00% when compared to 3.04% for the same period of 2014.
 Financial Highlights Comparing the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2015 and 2014:

Provision expense for the second quarter of 2015 decreased by $.5 million when compared to the second quarter of 2014. The decrease was driven by lower historical loss factors and lower charge-offs. 
Allowance for loan losses (the "ALL") to loans outstanding was 1.40% as of June 30, 2015 compared to 1.44% as of December 31, 2014 and 1.51% as of June 30, 2014 as a result of improving asset quality. 
Other operating income decreased $.9 million during the second quarter of 2015 when compared to the same period of 2014. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $.9 million decrease in gains on the sale of investment securities held-for-trading relating to four CDOs that had been written down through impairment charges in prior years. 
Operating expenses remained constant in the first six months of 2015 when compared to the same period of 2014. This was due to a $.6 million decrease in OREO expenses primarily as a result of a reduction in valuation allowances offset by a $.6 million increase in salaries and employee benefits due to increased costs related to the administration of the pension plan and personnel costs. 
Operating expenses decreased $.4 million in the second quarter of 2015 when compared to the same period of 2014. This decrease was due to a decrease of $.7 million in OREO expenses relating to a reduction in valuation allowances offset by a $.3 million increase in salaries and benefits due primarily to increased pension costs and health care costs.
"During this quarter, First United Corporation successfully repurchased and retired the common stock warrant owned by the U.S. Treasury.  While this caused a slight increase in expense for the quarter, our board believes it will be beneficial to our shareholders.  We continue to be encouraged by the improving asset quality, the increased loan demand in our market areas and the successful shift in our deposit base.  These items will contribute to lower provision expense, higher interest income and lower cost of deposits in future quarters.  Additionally, our trust and investments and brokerage income continues to grow, offsetting reduced service charge income," stated William B. Grant, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.
Balance Sheet Overview
Total assets remained stable at $1.3 billion at June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014.  During the first six months of 2015, cash and interest-bearing deposits in other banks increased $22.5 million, the investment portfolio decreased $17.5 million, Bank Owned Life Insurance increased $6.1 million due to purchases of new general account contracts during the second quarter, and gross loans increased $5.1 million.  Total liabilities increased by $6.6 million during the first six months of 2015 due primarily to an increase of $21.8 million in total deposits offset primarily by reductions of $11.5 million in short-term borrowings and $5.0 million in long-term borrowings due to the repayment of First United Corporation's junior subordinated debentures that matured in March of 2015.  
Total investment securities available-for-sale decreased $15.9 million since December 31, 2014.  At June 30, 2015, the securities classified as available-for-sale included a net unrealized loss of $4.8 million, which represents the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of securities in the portfolio.
Comparing June 30, 2015 to December 31, 2014, outstanding loans increased by $5.1 million (.61%), commercial real estate ("CRE") loans increased $5.1 million, acquisition and development ("A&D") loans decreased $4.4 million, commercial and industrial ("C&I") loans increased $.3 million, residential mortgages increased by $3.3 million, and the consumer portfolio increased by $.8 million. Approximately 43% of the commercial loan portfolio was collateralized by real estate at June 30, 2015, compared to 44% at December 31, 2014.
Total deposits increased $21.8 million during the first six months of 2015 when compared to deposits at December 31, 2014.  With the continued focus of our retail staff to change the mix of the deposit portfolio, we have seen increases in core deposits and reductions in certificates of deposit.  Non-interest bearing deposits increased $10.7 million, traditional savings accounts increased $9.5 million due to continued growth in our Prime Saver product, total demand deposits increased $22.3 million, total money market accounts decreased $6.0 million, time deposits less than $100,000 declined $8.8 million and time deposits greater than $100,000 decreased $5.9 million.  
Comparing June 30, 2015 to December 31, 2014, shareholders' equity increased $4.2 million as a result of decreases of $2.9 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss and $1.2 million in earnings during the first six months of 2015.
The book value of the Corporation's common stock was $13.29 per share at June 30, 2015, compared to $12.68 per share at December 31, 2014.  
At June 30, 2014, there were approximately 6,254,620 outstanding shares of the Corporation's common stock and 30,000 outstanding shares of the Corporation's Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A.  On May 26, 2015, the Corporation repurchased an outstanding warrant to purchase 326,323 shares of the Corporation's common stock that was issued in 2009 in connection with the Corporation's participation in the United States Department of the Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program Capital Purchase Program.  The purchase price was $120,786.  The warrant, which was canceled upon its repurchase, had a term of 10 years and an exercise price of $13.79 per share.  As a result of the repurchase, the Treasury has no remaining equity investment in the Corporation.  
Net- Interest Income (Tax-Equivalent Basis)
Net interest income on an FTE basis decreased $.3 million (1.5%) during the first six months of 2015 over the same period in 2014 due to a $.8 million (3.4%) decrease in interest income, which was partially offset by a $.5 million (9.7%) decrease in interest expense.  The net interest margin in the first six months of 2015 was 3.04% compared to 3.06% for the first six months of 2014.
The decrease in interest income was due to a $10.6 million decrease in average earning asset balances; however, the ten basis point reduction in the rates earned was the largest contributor when comparing the first six months of 2015 to the same period of 2014.  The decline was due to the loan portfolio repricing and new loans booked at lower rates.  The decrease was offset by an increase in the investment portfolio, primarily related to the cash receipt of $.3 million of deferred interest in the CDO portfolio.  The decrease in average earning assets was due to a $27.3 million reduction in investment securities and a $7.3 million decrease in fed funds sold, partially offset by a $27.4 million increase in loans.  
Interest expense decreased during the first six months of 2015 when compared to the same period of 2014 due to an overall reduction in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities and a decrease of $22.3 million on our average interest-bearing liabilities.  The effect on the average rate paid was an eight basis point decrease from 1.09% for the six months ended June 30, 2014 to 1.01% for the same period of 2015. 
Net interest income on an FTE basis decreased $.2 million during the second quarter of 2015 over the same period in 2014 due to a $.4 million (3.7%) decrease in interest income, offset by a decrease of $.2 million (8.6%) in interest expense.  The decrease in interest income was primarily due to the decrease in the average rate of loans when comparing the two periods.  The net interest margin in the second quarter of 2015 decreased to 3.00% when compared to 3.04% for the three months ended June 30, 2014.
Interest expense decreased during the second quarter of 2015 when compared to the same period of 2014 due to the overall reduction in average interest-bearing liabilities of $20.1 million and the reduction in the average rate paid on long-term borrowings and time deposits over $100,000.  The reduction in balances was due to the reduction of $4.1 million in interest-bearing deposits as management continued to focus on shifting the deposit mix and reducing certificates of deposit, a $5.1 million decrease in long-term borrowings and a $10.9 million decrease in short-term borrowings.  The overall effect was a seven basis point decrease in the average rate paid on our average interest-bearing liabilities, from 1.07% for the three months ended June 30, 2014 to 1.00% for the same period of 2015.  
Asset Quality
The ALL decreased to $11.8 million at June 30, 2015, from $12.1 million at December 31, 2014 and $12.5 million at June 30, 2014.  The provision for loan losses decreased to $.1 million for the first six months of 2015 compared to $.9 million for the same period of 2014.   Net charge-offs decreased to $.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, compared to $2.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014. The ratio of the ALL to loans outstanding as of June 30, 2015 was 1.40%, which was less than the 1.51% recorded for the same period last year, due primarily to declines in specific allocations of impaired loans.
The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was an annualized .09%, compared to an annualized .51% for the same period in 2014 and .49% for the year ended December 31, 2014.  The CRE portfolio had an annualized net charge-off rate as of June 30, 2015 of .17% compared to an annualized net charge-off rate of .18% as of December 31, 2014.  The annualized net charge-off rate for A&D loans as of June 30, 2015 was .87% compared to an annualized net charge-off rate of 2.46% as of December 31, 2014.  The ratio for C&I loans improved to a net recovery rate of .04% as of June 30, 2015 compared to a net charge-off rate of .31% as of December 31, 2014.  The residential mortgage ratios were a net recovery rate of .05% as of June 30, 2015 and a net charge-off rate of .17% as of December 31, 2014, and the consumer loan ratios were net charge-off rates of .51% and .71% as of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.  
Accruing loans past due 30 days or more decreased to .86% of the loan portfolio at June 30, 2015, compared to 1.62% at December 31, 2014.  The decrease for the first six months of 2015 was primarily due to a $7.3 million decrease in past-due accruing residential mortgage term loans. 
Comparing the six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014, total non-accrual loan balances have declined.  Non-accrual loans totaled $11.9 million at June 30, 2015, compared to $11.6 million at December 31, 2014 and $15.2 million at June 30, 2014.  Non-accrual loans which have been subject to a partial charge-off totaled $5.0 million at June 30, 2015, compared to $4.6 million at December 31, 2014.  
Non-Interest Income and Non-Interest Expense
Other operating income, exclusive of gains, increased $.3 million during the first six months of 2015 when compared to the same period of 2014.   This increase was attributable to increases in trust and brokerage income and earnings on Bank Owned Life Insurance offset by declines in service charge income, primarily NSF income.
Net gains of $5,000 were reported in other income in the first six months of 2015, compared to net gains of $1.0 million during the same period of 2014.  The decrease resulted from a reduction in gains on sales of investment securities held-for-trading relating to four CDOs that had been written down through impairment charges in prior years. 
Other operating income, exclusive of gains, remained stable during the second quarter of 2015 when compared to the same period of 2014.   We saw increases in trust and brokerage income and earnings on Bank Owned Life Insurance.  These increases were offset by decreases in service charges, primarily NSF income, and other income.
Net gains of $.1 million were reported in other income in the second quarter of 2015, compared to net gains of $1.0 million during the same period of 2014.  The decrease resulted from a reduction in gains on sales of investment securities held-for-trading relating to four CDOs that had been written down through impairment charges in prior years. 
Operating expenses remained constant in the first six months of 2015 when compared to the same period of 2014.  Comparing the first half of 2015 to the first half of 2014, we recorded a $.6 million decrease in OREO expenses due to reduced valuation allowances offset by a $.6 million increase in salaries and employee benefits due to increased costs related to the administration of the pension plan and health care costs.
Operating expenses decreased $.4 million in the second quarter of 2015 when compared to the same period of 2014.  This decrease was due to a decrease of $.7 million in OREO expenses due to decreases in the valuation allowance offset by a $.3 million increase in salaries and benefits due primarily to increased pension costs and health care costs.

OAKLAND, Md., March 6, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- First United Corporation (NASDAQ:   FUNC), a bank holding company and the parent company of First United Bank & Trust, announces consolidated net income available to common shareholders was $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $4.7 million for 2013.  Basic and diluted net income per common share for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $.48, compared to basic and diluted net income per common share of $.76 for 2013. The decrease in earnings for 2014 was due to a decrease of $3.5 million in interest income, primarily interest on loans, and an increase in provision expense of $2.1 million, offset by an increase of $.8 million in other operating income, a decrease of $.9 million in interest expense, and a $2.2 million decrease in other operating expenses.  The increase in other operating income was attributable to an increase of $.8 million in gains on sales of securities, a $.3 million increase in Trust department income, and a $.4 million increase in Bank Owned Life Insurance ("BOLI") income.  These increases were offset by a $.5 million decrease in service charges, primarily NSF fees, and a $.2 million decrease in other income.  The decrease in other operating expenses was due to a decrease of $.4 million in salaries and benefits, a decrease of $.6 million in Other Real Estate Owned ("OREO") expenses and a decrease of $.7 million in other miscellaneous expenses. The increase of $.8 million in dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock also attributed to the decrease in net income available to common shareholders due to an increase in contractual rate in 2014. The net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2014, on a fully tax equivalent ("FTE") basis, decreased to 3.00% from 3.25% for the year ended December 31, 2013. 
According to William B. Grant, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, "The Company posted positive earnings once again in 2014. While not as robust as we would have liked, income continued to be hampered by slower loan growth, the reduced interest rate environment, lower service charge income and higher provision expense due to our timely recognition of declining collateral values.  We successfully offset the reduced income through increased trust and investment earnings and reduced expenses.  We look forward to a rise in interest rates as your Company is structured to see increased income in a rising rate environment."
"Asset quality continued to improve in 2014, as demonstrated in lower non-accrual loans, improved delinquency ratios and lower levels of other real estate owned, all contributing to lower risk in our balance sheet.  At the same time, we experienced an increase in all capital ratios, strengthening the balance sheet of your Company." 
Consolidated net income available to common shareholders was $1.0 million, or $.16 per common share, for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to consolidated net income available to common shareholders of $.4 million, or $.06 per common share, for the same period of 2013.  The increase in earnings for the fourth quarter of 2014 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 was primarily due to a $.4 million increase in BOLI income from a one-time death benefit received in December 2014 and a decrease in salaries and benefits and other expenses.  
Financial Highlights Comparing the Three and Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013:

Total loans increased $29.8 million comparing December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2013.  This increase is primarily in C&I due to new relationships, particularly one large relationship in the first quarter of 2014.  
Provision expense increased by $2.1 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2014 driven by rolling historical loss rates, management's consideration of the qualitative factors that are likely to cause losses, and an $.8 million recovery on a large commercial real estate credit during the third quarter of 2013. 
Net interest margin, on an FTE basis, decreased to 3.00% for the year ended 2014 compared to 3.25% for the year ended 2013. 
Other operating income, exclusive of gains, decreased $.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to 2013.  Service charge income decreased $.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to 2013 due to reduced insufficient funds fees ("NSF fees").  The reduction in NSF fees was due to the increased regulations on fees.  These decreases were offset by an increase of $.3 million in Trust department income and a $.4 million increase in BOLI income. 
Operating expenses decreased $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to the same period of 2013.  This decrease was due to decreases of $.4 million in salaries and benefits, $.6 million in OREO expenses and $.7 million in other expenses.  Declines in other expenses were due primarily to reduced personnel related expenses such as in house training, a decline in telephone expenses, and reduced fraud expenses related to debit cards.  
Balance Sheet Overview
Total assets remained stable at $1.3 billion at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. When comparing 2014 to 2013, cash and interest-bearing deposits in other banks decreased $7.6 million, the investment portfolio decreased $9.9 million, and gross loans increased $29.8 million.  We sold investments during 2014 in order to reduce interest rate volatility and to provide funding for higher yielding loans.  OREO balances decreased $4.1 million due to sales of properties.  Total liabilities decreased by $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to 2013 due primarily to a decrease of $9.8 million in accrued interest payable and other liabilities.  Other liabilities decreased as a result of cash payments of accrued interest on the Corporation's trust preferred debentures and accrued cash dividends on the outstanding shares of the Corporation's Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the "Series A Preferred Stock").  Comparing December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2013, shareholders' equity increased $7.1 million as a result of a decrease of $4.0 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
Total fair value of investment securities at December 31, 2014 decreased $8.3 million when compared to the balance at December 31, 2013.  At December 31, 2014, the securities classified as available-for-sale included a net unrealized loss of $10.6 million, which represents the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of securities in the portfolio and is primarily attributable to our collateralized debt obligations.  On June 1, 2014, management reclassified an amortized cost basis of $107.6 million of available-for-sale securities to held to maturity.  The unrealized loss of approximately $4.0 million, at the date of transfer, will continue to be reported in a separate component of shareholders' equity as accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized over the remaining life of the securities as an adjustment of yield in a manner consistent with the amortization of any premium or discount.
Comparing December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2013, outstanding loans increased $29.8 million (3.7%).  Commercial real estate ("CRE") loans decreased $11.9 million as a result of the payoff of two large loans of approximately $15 million during the third quarter of 2014.  Acquisition and development ("A&D") loans decreased $7.9 million due to regularly scheduled principal payments and payoffs.  Commercial and industrial ("C&I") loans increased $33.5 million due to new loan relationships, primarily one large relationship in the first quarter of 2014.  Residential mortgage loans increased $16.7 million due to increased production of loans primarily in our 10/1 and 7/1 adjustable rate mortgage program.  The Bank continues to use Fannie Mae for the majority of new, longer-term, fixed-rate residential loan originations.  The consumer loan portfolio decreased slightly by $.6 million due to repayment activity in the indirect auto portfolio offsetting new production. At December 31, 2014, approximately 44% of the commercial loan portfolio was collateralized by real estate, compared to approximately 57% at December 31, 2013.
Total deposits at December 31, 2014 increased $3.9 million when compared to December 31, 2013.  We recorded increases in core deposits and reductions in certificates of deposit due to our continued focus on shifting the mix of our deposit portfolio from higher cost certificates of deposit to lower cost money market and transaction accounts.  Non-interest bearing deposits increased $25.3 million.  Traditional savings accounts increased $13.0 million due to continued growth in our Prime Saver product.  Total demand deposits decreased $8.4 million and total money market accounts increased $8.9 million.  Time deposits less than $100,000 declined $22.4 million and time deposits greater than $100,000 decreased $12.5 million.  
The book value of the Corporation's common stock was $12.68 per share at December 31, 2014, compared to $11.49 per share at December 31, 2013.  
At December 31, 2014, there were approximately 6,228,366 outstanding shares of the Corporation's common stock, an outstanding immediately exercisable warrant to purchase 326,323 shares of the Corporation's common stock, and 30,000 outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock.
Net- Interest Income (Tax-Equivalent Basis)
Net interest income on an FTE basis decreased $2.7 million (6.8%) for the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to 2013 due to a $3.5 million (7.0%) decrease in interest income, which was partially offset by a $.8 million (7.3%) decrease in interest expense.  The decrease in interest income was primarily due to the $23.9 million (2.8%) reduction in the average balance of loans and a decrease of 43 basis points on yields when comparing the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.  The reduction in loan yields was attributable to loans repricing at lower rates and new loans booked at lower rates.  The decline in interest income was partially offset by a decline in interest expense due to the reduction in the average balances of interest-bearing deposits and a decrease of 21 basis points on long-term borrowings.  We saw a decrease in the net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 3.00% when compared to 3.25% for the year ended December 31, 2013 and 3.30% for the year ended December 31, 2012.
When comparing the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2013, there was an overall $9.6 million increase in average interest-earning assets, driven by an increase of $57.1 million in investment securities, offset by a $23.9 million reduction in loans and a $23.6 million decrease in other interest-earning assets, primarily cash.
Interest expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 due primarily to an overall decrease of $27.1 million on our average interest-bearing liabilities.  The overall effect was a 6 basis point decrease in the average rate paid from 1.13% for 2013 to 1.07% for 2014.  
Asset Quality
The allowance for loan losses (the "ALL") decreased to $12.1 million at December 31, 2014, compared to $13.6 million at December 31, 2013.  The provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased to $2.5 million from $.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.  The higher provision expense was primarily due to higher net charge-offs of $4.0 million in 2014, compared to net charge-offs of $2.8 million in 2013, as well as the impact of higher loan balances in 2014.  The ratio of the ALL to loans outstanding as of December 31, 2014 was 1.44%, which was lower than the 1.68% at December 31, 2013 due to the charge-off or removal of specific allocations as a result of changing circumstances, as well as the overall higher quality of the loan portfolio in 2014.
The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans for the year ended December 31, 2014 was .49%, compared to .34% for the year ended December 31, 2013. Relative to December 31, 2013, two segments of loans, C&I and consumer, showed improvement.  The CRE portfolio had an annualized net charge-off rate of .18% as of December 31, 2014, compared to an annualized net recovery rate of .27% as of December 31, 2013, which was driven by a $.8 million partial recovery on a non-owner occupied CRE loan that was repaid during 2013.  The annualized net charge-off rate for A&D loans as of December 31, 2014 was 2.46% compared to an annualized net charge-off rate of 1.78% as of December 31, 2013, due to partial charge-offs on several projects and individual loans due to declining appraisal values.  The ratios for C&I loans were .31% and 1.53% for December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.  The residential mortgage loan ratios were .17% and .08% for December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively, and the consumer loan ratios were .71% and .83% for December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. 
Accruing loans past due 30 days or more declined to 1.62% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2014, compared to 2.10% at December 31, 2013.  The decrease for 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in past-due accruing residential mortgage term loans and all other A&D loans.  Other improvements in the levels of past-due loans were attributable to a combination of a slowly improving economy and vigorous collection efforts by the Bank.
Non-accrual loans totaled $11.6 million at December 31, 2014, compared to $17.4 million at December 31, 2013.  Non-accrual loans which have been subject to a partial charge-off totaled $4.6 million at December 31, 2014, compared to $1.9 million at December 31, 2013.  
Non-Interest Income and Non-Interest Expense
Other operating income, exclusive of gains, increased slightly by approximately $71,000 during 2014 when compared to 2013.  The increase was attributable to the increase in BOLI income from a one-time death benefit of $.4 million received in December 2014.  Trust department income increased $.3 million and debit card income increased $.1 million when comparing 2014 to 2013.  These increases were offset by decreases in service charges on deposit accounts of $.4 million and other service charges of $.2 million and a decrease in other income of $.3 million.  Trust assets under management were $702 million at December 31, 2014 and $675 million at December 31, 2013.
Net gains of $1.0 million were reported through other income during 2014, compared to net gains of $.2 million during 2013.  The increase was due to increased gains on sales of investment securities when comparing 2014 to 2013.
Operating expenses decreased $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 when compared to the same period of 2013.  This decrease was due to decreases of $.4 million in salaries and benefits, $.6 million in OREO expenses and $.7 million in other expenses.  Declines in other expenses were due primarily to reduced personnel related expenses such as in house training, a decline in telephone expenses, and reduced fraud expenses related to debit cards.

	326,323 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK


	 


	 


	This Prospectus
	Supplement No. 5 supplements and amends our Prospectus dated April 16, 2012, as amended and supplemented to date, and includes
	our attached Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2013 that was filed with the Securities and Exchange

	The Prospectus,
	as previously amended and supplemented, and this Prospectus Supplement No. 5 relate to the potential resale from time to time by
	selling security holders of some or all of the shares of our Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, which we
	refer to as the “Series A Preferred Stock”, a warrant to purchase 326,323 shares of common stock, which we refer to
	as the “warrant”, and any shares of common stock issuable from time to time upon exercise of the warrant. We are not

	we will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the securities by the selling security holders.


	 


	The Series A Preferred Stock is not listed
	on an exchange and, unless requested by the initial selling security holder, we do not intend to list the Series A Preferred Stock
	on any exchange. The warrant is not listed on an exchange and we do not intend to list the warrant on any exchange. Our common
	stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “FUNC”. On August 13, 2013, the closing price of

	Supplement No. 5 should be read in conjunction with the Prospectus, as previously amended and supplemented. Any statement contained
	in the Prospectus, as previously amended and supplemented, shall be deemed to be modified or superseded to the extent that information
	in this Prospectus Supplement No. 5 modifies or supersedes such statement. Any statement that is modified or superseded shall not
	be deemed to constitute a part of the Prospectus except as modified or superseded by this Prospectus Supplement No. 5.


	 




	Investing
	in our securities involves certain risks.



	You should review carefully the risks described under “Risk Factors”
	beginning on page 5 of the Prospectus and under similar headings in any amendments or supplements to the Prospectus.



	 






	 





	 




	NEITHER THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
	NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED OF THESE SECURITIES OR PASSED UPON THE ACCURACY OR ADEQUACY OF

	FIRST UNITED CORPORATION






	NoteS
	to Consolidated Financial Statements (UNAUDITED)




	for
	the quarter ended JUNE 30, 2013



	 



	Note 1 – Basis of Presentation



	 


	The accompanying unaudited
	consolidated financial statements of First United Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, including First United Bank &
	Trust (the “Bank”), have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)
	for interim financial information, as required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards
	Codification (“ASC”) Topic 270,

	Interim Reporting

	, and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of
	Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required for annual financial statements. In
	the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation, consisting of normal recurring items,
	have been included. Operating results for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 are not necessarily indicative
	of the results that may be expected for the full year or for any future interim period. These consolidated financial statements
	should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in First United Corporation’s
	Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. For purposes of comparability, certain prior period amounts have
	been reclassified to conform to the 2013 presentation. Such reclassifications had no impact on net income or equity.


	 


	First United Corporation
	has evaluated events and transactions occurring subsequent to the statement of financial condition date of June 30, 2013 for items
	that should potentially be recognized or disclosed in these financial statements as prescribed by ASC Topic 855,

	Subsequent
	Events

	.


	 


	As used in these notes
	to consolidated financial statements, First United Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries are sometimes collectively referred
	to as the “Corporation”.


	 



	Note 2 – Earnings/(Loss) Per Common Share



	 


	Basic earnings/(loss)
	per common share is derived by dividing net income available to/loss attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average
	number of common shares outstanding during the period and does not include the effect of any potentially dilutive common stock
	equivalents. Diluted earnings/(loss) per share is derived by dividing net income available to/loss attributable to common shareholders
	by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding, adjusted for the dilutive effect of outstanding common stock equivalents.
	There is no dilutive effect on earnings per share during loss periods. There were no common stock equivalents during the three
	and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012.


	 


	The following table sets forth the calculation
	of basic and diluted earnings/(loss) per common share for the six- and three-month periods ended June 30, 2013 and 2012:

	Note 5 – Investments




	 



	The investment portfolio
	is classified and accounted for based on the guidance of ASC Topic 320,

	Investments – Debt and Equity Securities

	.


	 



	The
	amortized cost of debt securities classified as available-for-sale is adjusted for the amortization of premiums to the first call
	date, if applicable, or

	to

	maturity, and for the accretion of discounts to maturity, or, in
	the case of mortgage-backed securities, over the estimated life of the security. Such amortization and accretion is included in
	interest income from investments. Interest and dividends are included in interest income from investments. Gains and losses on
	the sale of securities are recorded using the specific identification method.



	 


	The following table shows a comparison
	of amortized cost and fair values of investment securities at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012:

	Management
	systematically evaluates securities for impairment on a quarterly basis. Management assesses whether (a) the Corporation
	has the intent to sell a security being evaluated and (b) it is more likely than not that the Corporation will be required to
	sell the security prior to its anticipated recovery. If neither applies, then declines in the fair values of securities below
	their cost that are considered other-than-temporary declines are split into two components. The first is the loss attributable
	to declining credit quality. Credit losses are recognized in earnings as realized losses in the period in which the impairment
	determination is made. The second component consists of all other losses, which are recognized in other comprehensive loss. In
	estimating other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) losses, management considers (1) the length of time and the extent
	to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry, or
	a geographic area, (3) the historic and implied volatility of the fair value of the security, (4) changes in the rating of the
	security by a rating agency, (5) recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date, (6) failure
	of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments, and (7) the payment structure of the debt security
	and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future. Management also monitors cash flow projections
	for

	securities that are considered beneficial interests under the guidance of ASC Subtopic 325-40,

	Investments –
	Other – Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets

	, (ASC Section 325-40-35). Further discussion about the
	evaluation of securities for impairment can be found in Item 2 of Part I of this report under the heading “

	Investment
	Securities

	”.

	Management believes
	that the valuation of certain securities is a critical accounting policy that requires significant estimates in preparation of
	its consolidated financial statements. Management utilizes an independent third party to prepare both the impairment valuations
	and fair value determinations for its collateralized debt obligation (“CDO”) portfolio consisting of pooled trust
	preferred securities. Based on management’s review of the assumptions and results of the third-party review, it does not
	believe that there were any material differences in the valuations between December 31, 2012 and June 30, 2013.


	 



	U.S. Government
	Agencies

	- Thirteen U.S. government agencies have been in an unrealized loss position for less than 12 months as of June 30,
	2013. There were no U.S. government agencies in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or more. The securities are of the highest
	investment grade and the Corporation does not intend to sell them, and it is not more likely than not that the Corporation will
	be required to sell them before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. Accordingly, management does
	not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at June 30, 2013.


	 



	Residential Mortgage-Backed
	Agencies

	- Twenty-two residential mortgage-backed agencies have been in an unrealized loss position for less than 12 months
	as of June 30, 2013. There were no residential mortgage-backed agency securities in an unrealized loss position for 12 months
	or more. The securities are of the highest investment grade and the Corporation does not intend to sell them, and it is not more
	likely than not that the Corporation will be required to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which
	may be at maturity. Accordingly, management does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at June
	30, 2013.


	 



	Commercial Mortgage-Backed
	Agencies

	- Ten commercial mortgage-backed agencies have been in an unrealized loss position for less than 12 months as of
	June 30, 2013. There were no commercial mortgage-backed agency securities in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or more.
	The securities are of the highest investment grade and the Corporation does not intend to sell them, and it is not more likely
	than not that the Corporation will be required to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may
	be at maturity. Accordingly, management does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at June 30,
	2013.


	 



	Collateralized
	Mortgage Obligations

	- One collateralized mortgage obligation security at June 30, 2013 was in an unrealized loss position
	for 12 months or more. There were two collateralized mortgage obligation securities in an unrealized loss position for less than
	12 months. The securities are of the highest investment grade and the Corporation does not intend to sell them, and it is not
	more likely than not that the Corporation will be required to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis.
	Accordingly, management does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at June 30, 2013.


	 



	Obligations of
	State and Political Subdivisions

	- Seven securities have been in an unrealized loss position for less than 12 months. There
	are no securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or more. These investments are of investment grade
	as determined by the major rating agencies and management reviews the ratings of the underlying issuers. Management believes that
	this portfolio is well-diversified throughout the United States, and all bonds continue to perform according to their contractual
	terms. The Corporation does not intend to sell these investments and it is not more likely than not that the Corporation will
	be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. Accordingly, management
	does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at June 30, 2013.


	 



	Collateralized
	Debt Obligations

	- The $22.2 million in unrealized losses greater than 12 months at June 30, 2013 relates to 17 pooled trust
	preferred securities that are included in the CDO portfolio. See Note 8 for a discussion of the methodology used by management
	to determine the fair values of these securities. Based upon a review of credit quality and the cash flow tests performed by the
	independent third party, management determined that there were no securities that had credit-related non-cash OTTI charges during
	the first six months of 2013. The unrealized losses on the remaining securities in the portfolio are primarily attributable to
	continued depression in market interest rates, marketability, liquidity and the current economic environment.

	The following tables
	present a cumulative roll-forward of the amount of non-cash OTTI charges related to credit losses which have been recognized in

	Note 6 - Restricted Investment in Bank
	Stock




	 



	Restricted stock,
	which represents required investments in the common stock of the FHLB of Atlanta, Atlantic Central Bankers Bank (“ACBB”)
	and CBB, is carried at cost

	and is considered a long-term investment

	.


	 


	Management evaluates
	the restricted stock for impairment in accordance with ASC Industry Topic 942,

	Financial Services – Depository and Lending

	,
	(ASC

	Section 942-325-35). Management’s evaluation of potential
	impairment is based on management’s a

	ssessment of the ultimate recoverability of the cost of the restricted stock
	rather than by recognizing temporary declines in value.

	The determination
	of whether a decline affects the ultimate recoverability is influenced by criteria such as (a) the significance of the decline
	in net assets of the issuing bank as compared to the capital stock amount for that bank and the length of time this situation
	has persisted, (b) commitments by the issuing bank to make payments required by law or regulation and the level of such payments
	in relation to the operating performance of that bank, and (c) the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on institutions
	and, accordingly, on the customer base of the issuing bank.

	Management has evaluated the restricted stock for impairment
	and believes that no impairment charge is necessary as of June 30, 2013.


	 


	The Corporation recognizes
	dividends on a cash basis. For the six months ended June 30, 2013, dividends of $96,734 were recognized in earnings. For the comparable
	period of 2012, dividends of $73,867 were recognized in earnings.

	The segments of the
	Bank’s loan portfolio are disaggregated to a level that allows management to monitor risk and performance. The commercial
	real estate (“CRE”) loan segment is then segregated into two classes. Non-owner occupied CRE loans, which include
	loans secured by non-owner occupied, nonfarm, and nonresidential properties, generally have a greater risk profile than all other
	CRE loans, which include loans secured by farmland, multifamily structures and owner-occupied commercial structures. The acquisition
	and development (“A&D”) loan segment is segregated into two classes. One-to-four family residential construction
	loans are generally made to individuals for the acquisition of and/or construction on a lot or lots on which a residential dwelling
	is to be built. All other A&D loans are generally made to developers or investors for the purpose of acquiring, developing
	and constructing residential or commercial structures. A&D loans have a higher risk profile because the ultimate buyer, once
	development is completed, is generally not known at the time of the loan is made. The commercial and industrial (“C&I”)
	loan segment consists of loans made for the purpose of financing the activities of commercial customers. The residential mortgage
	loan segment is segregated into two classes. Amortizing term loans are primarily first lien loans. Home equity lines of credit
	are generally second lien loans. The consumer loan segment consists primarily of installment loans (direct and indirect) and overdraft
	lines of credit connected with customer deposit accounts.


	 


	Management uses a
	10-point internal risk rating system to monitor the credit quality of the overall loan portfolio. The first six categories are
	considered not criticized, and are aggregated as “Pass” rated. The criticized rating categories utilized by management
	generally follow bank regulatory definitions. The Special Mention category includes assets that are currently protected but are
	potentially weak, resulting in an undue and unwarranted credit risk, but not to the point of justifying a Substandard classification.
	Loans in the Substandard category have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt, and have a distinct
	possibility that some loss will be sustained if the weaknesses are not corrected. All loans greater than 90 days past due are
	considered Substandard. The portion of a specific allocation of the allowance for loan losses that management believes is associated
	with a pending event that could trigger loss in the short-term will be classified in the Doubtful category. Any portion of a loan
	that has been charged off is placed in the Loss category.


	 







	16










	 






	 


	To help ensure that
	risk ratings are accurate and reflect the present and future capacity of borrowers to repay a loan as agreed, the Bank has a structured
	loan rating process with several layers of internal and external oversight. Generally, consumer and residential mortgage loans
	are included in the Pass categories unless a specific action, such as bankruptcy, repossession, or death occurs to raise awareness
	of a possible credit event. The Bank’s Commercial Loan Officers are responsible for the timely and accurate risk rating
	of the loans in the commercial segments at origination and on an ongoing basis. The Bank’s experienced Credit Quality and
	Loan Review Department performs an annual review of all commercial relationships of $500,000 or greater. Confirmation of the appropriate
	risk grade is included as part of the review process on an ongoing basis. The Credit Quality and Loan Review Department continually
	reviews and assesses loans within the portfolio. In addition, the Bank engages an external consultant to conduct loan reviews
	on at least an annual basis. Generally, the external consultant reviews commercial relationships greater than $750,000 and/or
	criticized relationships greater than $500,000. Detailed reviews, including plans for resolution, are performed on loans classified
	as Substandard on a quarterly basis. Loans in the Special Mention and Substandard categories that are collectively evaluated for
	impairment are given separate consideration in the determination of the allowance.


	 


	The following table
	presents the classes of the loan portfolio summarized by the aggregate Pass and the criticized categories of Special Mention,
	Substandard and Doubtful within the internal risk rating system as of June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012:

	Management further
	monitors the performance and credit quality of the loan portfolio by analyzing the age of the portfolio as determined by the length
	of time a recorded payment is past due. A loan is considered to be past due when a payment has not been received for 30 days past
	its contractual due date. For all loan segments, the accrual of interest is discontinued when principal or interest is delinquent
	for 90 days or more unless the loan is well-secured and in the process of collection. All non-accrual loans are considered to
	be impaired. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans are applied as a reduction of the loan principal balance. Loans are
	returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are
	reasonably assured. The Corporation’s policy for recognizing interest income on impaired loans does not differ from its
	overall policy for interest recognition.


	 


	The following table
	presents the classes of the loan portfolio summarized by the aging categories of performing loans and non-accrual loans as of
	June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012:

	Non-accrual loans
	which have been subject to a partial charge-off totaled $7.4 million as of June 30, 2013, compared to $6.7 million as of December
	31, 2012.


	 


	An allowance for loan
	losses (“ALL”) is maintained to absorb losses from the loan portfolio. The ALL is based on management’s continuing
	evaluation of the risk characteristics and credit quality of the loan portfolio, assessment of current economic conditions, diversification
	and size of the portfolio, adequacy of collateral, past and anticipated loss experience, and the amount of non-performing loans.


	 







	18










	 






	 


	The Bank’s methodology
	for determining the ALL is based on the requirements of ASC Section 310-10-35,

	Receivables-Overall-Subsequent Measurement

	,
	for loans individually evaluated for impairment and ASC Subtopic 450-20,

	Contingencies

	-

	Loss Contingencies

	, for loans
	collectively evaluated for impairment, as well as the Interagency Policy Statement on the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses
	and other bank regulatory guidance. The total of the two components represents the Bank’s ALL.


	 


	The following table
	summarizes the primary segments of the ALL, segregated by the amount required for loans individually evaluated for impairment
	and the amount required for loans collectively evaluated for impairment as of June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012.

	Management evaluates
	individual loans in all of the commercial segments for possible impairment, if the loan (a) is greater than $500,000 or (b) is
	part of a relationship that is greater than $750,000 and is either (i) in nonaccrual status or (ii) risk-rated Substandard and
	greater than 60 days past due. Loans are considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable
	that the Bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual
	terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in evaluating impairment include payment status, collateral value,
	and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Management determines the significance of
	payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding
	the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record,
	and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. The Bank does not separately evaluate individual
	consumer and residential mortgage loans for impairment, unless such loans are part of a larger relationship that is impaired;
	otherwise loans in these segments are considered impaired when they are classified as non-accrual.


	 


	Once the determination
	has been made that a loan is impaired, the determination of whether a specific allocation of the allowance is necessary is measured
	by comparing the recorded investment in the loan to the fair value of the loan using one of three methods: (a) the present value
	of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate; (b) the loan’s observable market price;
	or (c) the fair value of the collateral less selling costs. The method is selected on a loan-by-loan basis, with management primarily
	utilizing the fair value of collateral method. If the fair value of the collateral less selling costs method is utilized for collateral
	securing loans in the commercial segments, then an updated external appraisal is ordered on the collateral supporting the loan
	if the loan balance is greater than $500,000 and the existing appraisal is greater than 18 months old. If an appraisal is less
	than 12 months old (the age at which the internal appraisal grid begins) and if management believes that general market conditions
	in that geographic market have changed considerably, the property has deteriorated or perhaps lost an income stream, or a recent
	appraisal for a similar property indicates a significant change, then management may adjust the fair value indicated by the existing
	appraisal until a new appraisal is obtained. If the most recent appraisal is greater than 12 months old or if an updated appraisal
	has not been received and reviewed in time for the determination of estimated fair value at quarter (or year) end, then the estimated
	fair value of the collateral is determined by adjusting the existing appraisal by the appropriate percentage from an internally
	prepared appraisal discount grid. This grid considers the age of a third party appraisal and the geographic region where the collateral
	is located in order to discount an appraisal that is greater than 12 months old. The discount rates in the appraisal discount
	grid are updated quarterly to reflect the most current knowledge that management has available, including the results of current
	appraisals. If there is a delay in receiving an updated appraisal or if the appraisal is found to be deficient in our internal
	appraisal review process and re-ordered, then the Bank continues to use a discount factor from the appraisal discount grid based
	on the collateral location and current appraisal age in order to determine the estimated fair value. A specific allocation of
	the ALL is recorded if there is any deficiency in collateral value determined by comparing the estimated fair value to the recorded
	investment of the loan. When updated appraisals are received and reviewed, adjustments are made to the specific allocation as
	needed.

	The evaluation of
	the need and amount of a specific allocation of the ALL and whether a loan can be removed from impairment status is made on a
	quarterly basis.


	 


	The following table
	presents impaired loans by class, segregated by those for which a specific allowance was required and those for which a specific

	Loans that are collectively
	evaluated for impairment are analyzed with general allowances being made as appropriate. For general allowances, historical loss
	trends are used in the estimation of losses in the current portfolio. These historical loss amounts are modified by other qualitative
	factors.


	 







	20










	 






	 


	The classes described
	above, which are based on the Federal call code assigned to each loan, provide the starting point for the ALL analysis. Management
	tracks the historical net charge-off activity (full and partial charge-offs, net of full and partial recoveries) at the call code
	level. A historical charge-off factor is calculated utilizing a defined number of consecutive historical quarters. Consumer pools
	currently utilize a rolling 12 quarters, while Commercial pools currently utilize a rolling eight quarters.


	 


	“Pass”
	rated credits are segregated from “Criticized” credits for the application of qualitative factors. The un-criticized
	(“pass”) pools for commercial and residential real estate are further segmented based upon the geographic location
	of the underlying collateral. There are seven geographic regions utilized – six that represent the Bank’s lending
	footprint and a seventh for all out-of-market credits. Different economic environments and resultant credit risks exist in each
	region that are acknowledged in the assignment of qualitative factors. Loans in the criticized pools, which possess certain qualities
	or characteristics that may lead to collection and loss issues, are closely monitored by management and subject to additional
	qualitative factors.


	 


	Management supplements
	the historical charge-off factor with a number of additional qualitative factors that are likely to cause estimated credit losses
	associated with the existing loan pools to differ from historical loss experience. The additional factors, which are evaluated
	quarterly and updated using information obtained from internal, regulatory, and governmental sources, are: (a) national and local
	economic trends and conditions; (b) levels of and trends in delinquency rates and non-accrual loans; (c) trends in volumes and
	terms of loans; (d) effects of changes in lending policies; (e) experience, ability, and depth of lending staff; (f) value of
	underlying collateral; and (g) concentrations of credit from a loan type, industry and/or geographic standpoint.


	 


	Management reviews
	the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis using a defined, consistently applied process in order to make appropriate and timely
	adjustments to the ALL. When information confirms all or part of specific loans to be uncollectible, these amounts are promptly
	charged off against the ALL. Residential mortgage and consumer loans are charged off after they are 120 days contractually past
	due. All other loans are charged off based on an evaluation of the facts and circumstances of each individual loan. When the Bank
	believes that its ability to collect is solely dependent on the liquidation of the collateral, a full or partial charge-off is
	recorded promptly to bring the recorded investment to an amount that the Bank believes is supported by an ability to collect on
	the collateral. The circumstances that may impact the Bank’s decision to charge-off all or a portion of a loan include default
	or non-payment by the borrower, scheduled foreclosure actions, and/or prioritization of the Bank’s claim in bankruptcy.
	There may be circumstances where, due to pending events, the Bank will place a specific allocation of the ALL on a loan for which
	a partial charge-off has been previously recognized. This specific allocation may be either charged off or removed depending upon
	the outcome of the pending event. Full or partial charge-offs are not recovered until full principal and interest on the loan
	have been collected, even if a subsequent appraisal supports a higher value. Loans with partial charge-offs remain in non-accrual
	status. Both full and partial charge-offs reduce the recorded investment of the loan and the ALL and are considered to be charge-offs
	for purposes of all credit loss metrics and trends, including the historical rolling charge-off rates used in the determination
	of the ALL.


	 


	Activity in the ALL
	is presented for the six- and three-months ended June 30, 2013 and June 30, 2012:

	The ALL is based on
	estimates, and actual losses may vary from current estimates. Management believes that the granularity of the homogeneous pools
	and the related historical loss ratios and other qualitative factors, as well as the consistency in the application of assumptions,
	result in an ALL that is representative of the risk found in the components of the portfolio at any given date.

	In the normal course
	of business, the Bank modifies loan terms for various reasons. These reasons may include as a retention strategy, remaining competitive
	in the current interest rate environment, and re-amortizing or extending a loan term to better match the loan’s payment
	stream with the borrower’s cash flows. A modified loan is considered to be a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”)
	when the Bank has determined that the borrower is troubled (i.e. experiencing financial difficulties). The Bank evaluates the
	probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of its debt obligations in the foreseeable future without modification.
	To make this determination, the Bank performs a global financial review of the borrower and loan guarantors to assess their current
	ability to meet their financial obligations.


	 


	When the Bank restructures
	a loan to a troubled borrower, the loan terms (i.e., interest rate, payment amount, amortization period, and/or maturity date)
	are modified in such a way as to enable the borrower to cover the modified debt service payments based on current financials and
	cash flow adequacy. If a borrower’s hardship is thought to be temporary, then modified terms are only offered for that time
	period. Where possible, the Bank obtains additional collateral and/or secondary payment sources at the time of the restructure
	in order to put the Bank in the best possible position if the borrower is not able to meet the modified terms. To date, the Bank
	has not forgiven any principal as a restructuring concession. The Bank will not offer modified terms if it believes that modifying
	the loan terms will only delay an inevitable permanent default.


	 


	All loans designated
	as TDRs are considered impaired loans and may be in either accruing or non-accruing status. The Corporation’s policy for
	recognizing interest income on impaired loans does not differ from its overall policy for interest recognition. Accordingly, the
	accrual of interest is discontinued when principal or interest is delinquent for 90 days or more unless the loan is well-secured
	and in the process of collection. If the loan was accruing at the time of the modification, then it continues to be in accruing
	status subsequent to the modification. Non-accrual TDRs may return to accruing status when there has been sufficient payment performance
	for a period of at least six months. Loans may be removed from TDR status in the calendar year following the modification if the
	interest rate at the time of modification was consistent with the interest rate for a loan with comparable credit risk and the
	loan has performed according to its modified terms for at least six months.


	 


	The volume and type
	of TDR activity is considered in the assessment of the local economic trends’ qualitative factor used in the determination
	of the ALL for loans that are evaluated collectively for impairment.

	During the six months
	ended June 30, 2013, there were three new TDRs. In addition, four existing TDRs which had reached their original modification
	maturity were re-modified. An $11,266 reduction of the ALL resulted from the movement of the three new loans being evaluated collectively
	for impairment to being evaluated individually for impairment. There was no impact to the recorded investment relating to the
	transfer of these loans. There was one new TDR with a temporary rate modification during the six months ended June 30, 2012 for
	which there was no impact to the recorded investment and a $4,300 reduction of the ALL resulting from the movement of the loan
	being evaluated collectively for impairment to being evaluated individually for impairment. During the three and six months ended
	June 30, 2013, there were two non-performing A&D loans totaling $.4 million that were transferred to OREO due to payment defaults.
	During the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, there were no receivables modified as troubled debt restructurings within
	the previous 12 months for which there was a payment default during the periods indicated.


	 



	Note 8 – Fair
	Value of Financial Instruments




	 




	The
	Corporation complies with the guidance of ASC Topic 820,

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

	,

	which defines
	fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under
	other accounting pronouncements

	. The Corporation also follows the guidance on matters relating to all
	financial instruments found in ASC Subtopic 825-10,

	Financial Instruments – Overall

	.



	 







	24










	 






	 


	Fair value is defined
	as the price to sell an asset or to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants as of the
	measurement date. Fair value is best determined by values quoted through active trading markets. Active trading markets are characterized
	by numerous transactions of similar financial instruments between willing buyers and willing sellers. Because no active trading
	market exists for various types of financial instruments, many of the fair values disclosed were derived using present value discounted
	cash flows or other valuation techniques described below. As a result, the Corporation’s ability to actually realize these
	derived values cannot be assumed.


	 


	T

	he
	Corporation measures fair values based on the fair value hierarchy established in ASC Paragraph 820-10-35-37. The hierarchy gives
	the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements)
	and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure
	fair value under the hierarchy are as follows:



	 



	Level 1:

	Unadjusted
	quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets and liabilities.
	This level is the most reliable source of valuation.


	 



	Level 2:

	Quoted prices
	that are not active, or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset
	or liability. Level 2 inputs include inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (for example,
	interest rates and yield curves at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks,
	and default rates). It also includes inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation
	or other means (market-corroborated inputs). Several sources are utilized for valuing these assets, including a contracted valuation
	service, Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) evaluations and pricing services, and other valuation matrices.


	 



	Level 3:

	Prices or valuation
	techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the valuation assumptions and not readily observable in the market
	(i.e. supported with little or no market activity). Level 3 instruments are valued based on the best available data, some of which
	is internally developed, and consider risk premiums that a market participant would require.


	 


	The level established
	within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.


	 


	The Corporation

	believes
	that its valuation techniques are appropriate and consistent with the techniques used by other market participants. However, the
	use of different methodologies and assumptions could result in a different estimate of fair values at the reporting date.

	T

	he
	valuation techniques used by the Corporation to measure, on a recurring and non-recurring basis, the fair value of assets as of
	June 30, 2013 are discussed in the paragraphs that follow.



	 




	Investments


	– The investment portfolio is classified and accounted for based on the guidance of ASC Topic 320,

	Investments
	– Debt and Equity Securities

	.


	 


	The fair value of
	investments available-for-sale is determined using a market approach. As of June 30, 2013, the U.S. Government agencies, residential
	and commercial mortgage-backed securities, and municipal bonds segments are classified as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy.
	Their fair values were determined based upon market-corroborated inputs and valuation matrices, which were obtained through third
	party data service providers or securities brokers through which the Corporation has historically transacted both purchases and
	sales of investment securities.


	 



	The
	CDO segment, which consists of pooled trust preferred securities issued by banks, thrifts and insurance companies, is classified
	as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy. At June 30, 2013, the Corporation owned 18 pooled trust preferred securities with an
	amortized cost of $3

	7.0

	million and a fair value of $1

	5.0

	million. The market for these securities at June 30, 2013 is not active and markets for similar securities are also not active.
	The inactivity was evidenced first by a significant widening of the bid-ask spread in the brokered markets in which these securities
	trade and then by a significant decrease in the volume of trades relative to historical levels. The new issue market is also inactive,
	as few CDOs have been issued since 2007. There are currently very few market participants who are willing to effect transactions
	in these securities. The market values for these securities or any securities other than those issued or guaranteed by the U.S.
	Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) are depressed relative to historical levels. Therefore, in the current
	market, a low market price for a particular bond may only provide evidence of stress in the credit markets in general rather than
	being an indicator of credit problems with a particular issue. Given the conditions in the current debt markets and the absence
	of observable transactions in the secondary and new issue markets, management has determined that (a) the few observable transactions
	and market quotations that are available are not reliable for the purpose of obtaining fair value at June 30, 2013, (b) an income
	valuation approach technique (i.e. present value) that maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizes the use of
	unobservable inputs will be equally or more representative of fair value than a market approach, and (c) the CDO segment is appropriately
	classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy because management determined that significant adjustments were required
	to determine fair value at the measurement date.

	Management utilizes
	an independent third party to prepare both the evaluations of OTTI as well as the fair value determinations for its CDO portfolio.
	Management does not believe that there were any material differences in the OTTI evaluations and pricing between June 30, 2013
	and December 31, 2012.


	 


	The approach used
	by the third party to determine fair value involves several steps, including detailed credit and structural evaluation of each
	piece of collateral in each bond, default, recovery and prepayment/amortization probabilities for each piece of collateral in
	the bond, and discounted cash flow modeling. The discount rate methodology used by the third party combines a baseline current
	market yield for comparable corporate and structured credit products with adjustments based on evaluations of the differences
	found in structure and risks associated with actual and projected credit performance of each CDO being valued. Currently, the
	only active and liquid trading market that exists is for stand-alone trust preferred securities. Therefore, adjustments to the
	baseline discount rate are also made to reflect the additional leverage found in structured instruments.


	 




	Derivative financial
	instruments (Cash flow hedge)





	–

	The Corporation’s open derivative
	positions are interest rate swaps that are classified as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy. Open derivative positions are
	valued using externally developed pricing models based on observable market inputs provided by a third party and validated by
	management. The Corporation has considered counterparty credit risk in the valuation of its interest rate swap assets.


	 




	Impaired loans


	– Loans included in the table below are those that are considered impaired with a specific allocation or with a
	partial charge-off, based upon the guidance of the loan impairment subsection of the

	Receivables

	Topic, ASC Section 310-10-35,
	under which the Corporation has measured impairment generally based on the fair value of the loan’s collateral. Fair value
	consists of the loan balance less its valuation allowance and is generally determined based on independent third-party appraisals
	of the collateral or discounted cash flows based upon the expected proceeds. These assets are included as Level 3 fair values
	based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements.


	 




	Other real estate
	owned


	– Other real estate owned included in the table below are considered impaired with specific write-downs. Fair
	value of other real estate owned is based on independent third-party appraisals of the properties. These values were determined
	based on the sales prices of similar properties in the approximate geographic area. These assets are included as Level 3 fair
	values based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements.

	Gains and losses (realized
	and unrealized) included in earnings for the periods above are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in Other Operating
	Income.


	 


	The disclosed fair
	values may vary significantly between institutions based on the estimates and assumptions used in the various

	valuation
	methodologies. The derived fair values are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and significant judgment. Therefore,
	they cannot be determined with precision. Changes in the assumptions could significantly impact the derived estimates of fair
	value. Disclosure of non-financial assets such as buildings as well as certain financial instruments such as leases is not required.
	Accordingly, the aggregate fair values presented do not represent the underlying value of the Corporation.



	 


	The following methods
	and assumptions were used by the Corporation to estimate its fair value disclosures for financial instruments:


	 




	Cash and due
	from banks:


	The carrying amounts as reported in the statement of financial condition for cash and due from banks approximate
	their fair values.


	 




	Interest bearing
	deposits in banks:


	The carrying amount of interest bearing deposits approximates their fair values.


	 







	30










	 






	 





	Securities
	held to maturity:





	Investments in debt securities classified as held to maturity are measured subsequently
	at amortized cost in the statement of financial position.

	These assets are included as Level 3 fair
	values based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements.



	 




	Restricted Investment
	in Bank stock:


	The carrying value of stock issued by the FHLB of Atlanta, ACBB and CBB approximates fair value based on
	the redemption provisions of the stock.


	 




	Loans (excluding
	impaired loans with specific loss allowances):


	For variable-rate loans that re-price frequently or “in one year
	or less”, and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values. Fair values for fixed-rate
	loans that do not re-price frequently are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies current market interest
	rates being offered on the various loan products.


	 




	Deposits:


	The fair values disclosed for demand deposits (e.g., interest and non-interest checking, savings, and certain types of money market
	accounts, etc.) are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amounts).
	Fair values for fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest
	rates currently being offered on the various certificates of deposit to the cash flow stream.


	 





	Borrowed
	funds:


	The fair value of the Bank’s FHLB borrowings and junior subordinated debt is calculated based on the discounted
	value of contractual cash flows, using rates currently existing for borrowings

	with

	similar
	remaining maturities. The carrying amounts of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase approximate
	their fair values.



	 




	Accrued Interest:


	The carrying amount of accrued interest receivable and payable approximates their fair values.


	 




	Off-Balance-Sheet
	Financial Instruments:


	In the normal course of business, the Bank makes commitments to extend credit and issues standby
	letters of credit. The Bank expects most of these commitments to expire without being drawn upon; therefore, the commitment amounts
	do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Due to the uncertainty of cash flows and difficulty in the predicting the
	timing of such cash flows, fair values were not estimated for these instruments.

	The following tables
	present fair value information about

	financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the Consolidated
	Statement of Financial Condition, for which it is practicable to estimate that value.

	The actual carrying amounts and estimated
	fair values of the Corporation’s financial instruments that are included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition

	are as follows:

	Note 10 – Junior Subordinated Debentures and Restrictions
	on Dividends



	 


	First United Corporation
	is the parent company to three statutory trust subsidiaries - First United Statutory Trust I and First United Statutory Trust
	II, both of which are Connecticut statutory trusts (“Trust I” and “Trust II”, respectively), and First
	United Statutory Trust III, a Delaware statutory trust (“Trust III” and, together with Trust I and Trust II, the “Trusts”).
	The Trusts were formed for the purposes of selling preferred securities to investors and using the proceeds to purchase junior
	subordinated debentures from First United Corporation (“TPS Debentures”) that would qualify as regulatory capital.


	 


	In March 2004, Trust
	I and Trust II issued preferred securities with an aggregate liquidation amount of $30.0 million to third-party investors and

	issued common equity with an aggregate liquidation amount of $.9 million to First United Corporation.
	Trust I and Trust II used the proceeds of these offerings to purchase an equal amount of TPS Debentures, as follows:



	 







	37










	 






	 



	$20.6 million

	—floating rate payable
	quarterly based on three-month LIBOR plus 275 basis points (3.02% at June 30, 2013),

	maturing in 2034,
	became redeemable five years after issuance at First United Corporation’s option.



	 



	$10.3 million

	—floating rate payable
	quarterly based on three-month LIBOR plus 275 basis points (3.02% at June 30, 2013) maturing in 2034, became

	redeemable
	five years after issuance at First United Corporation’s option.



	 


	In December 2004,

	First United

	Corporation issued $5.0 million of junior subordinated debentures to third-party
	investors that were not tied to preferred securities. The debentures had a fixed rate of 5.88% for the first five years,

	payable
	quarterly, and converted to a floating rate in March 2010 based on the three month LIBOR plus 185 basis points (2.1

	2

	%
	at June 30, 2013). The debentures mature in 2015, but became redeemable five years after issuance at First United Corporation’s
	option.



	 


	In December 2009,
	Trust III issued 9.875% fixed-rate preferred securities with an aggregate liquidation amount of approximately $7.0 million to
	private investors and issued common securities to

	First United

	Corporation with an aggregate
	liquidation amount of approximately $.2 million. Trust III used the proceeds of the offering to purchase approximately $7.2 million
	of 9.875% fixed-rate

	TPS Debentures. Interest on these TPS Debentures are

	payable quarterly,
	and the TPS Debentures mature in 2040 but are

	redeemable five years after issuance at First United
	Corporation’s option.



	 


	In January 2010, Trust
	III issued an additional $3.5 million of 9.875% fixed-rate preferred securities to private investors and issued common securities
	to

	First United

	Corporation with an aggregate liquidation amount of $.1 million. Trust III used
	the proceeds of the offering to purchase $3.6 million of 9.875% fixed-rate

	TPS Debentures. Interest
	on these TPS Debentures is

	payable quarterly, and the TPS Debentures mature in 2040 but are

	redeemable five years after issuance at First United Corporation’s option.



	 


	The TPS Debentures
	issued to each of the Trusts represent the sole assets of that Trust, and payments of the TPS Debentures by

	First
	United

	Corporation are the only sources of cash flow for the Trust.

	First United

	Corporation
	has the right, without triggering a default, to defer interest on all of the TPS Debentures for up to 20 quarterly periods, in
	which case distributions on the preferred securities

	will also be deferred. Should this occur, the
	Corporation may not pay dividends or distributions on, or repurchase, redeem or acquire any shares of its capital stock.



	 



	At
	the request of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond (the “Reserve Bank”), First United Corporation elected to defer
	quarterly interest payments under its TPS Debentures beginning with the payments that were due in March 2011. As of June 30, 2013,
	this deferral election remained in effect. Cumulative deferred interest on all TPS Debentures was approximately $5.5 million,
	which must be paid in full when First United Corporation terminates the deferral of interest payments.

	Management cannot
	predict when the deferral will be terminated. First United Corporation’s ability to resume quarterly interest payments will
	depend primarily on our earnings in future periods.


	 


	Interest payments
	on the $5.0 million junior subordinated debentures that were issued outside of trust preferred securities offerings cannot be,
	and have not been, deferred.


	 



	The
	terms of First United Corporation’s Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock,

	Series A (“Series A Preferred
	Stock”)

	call for the payment, if declared by the Board of Directors of First United Corporation,
	of cash dividends on February 15

	th

	, May 15

	th

	, August 15

	th

	and November 15

	th

	of each
	year. On November 15, 2010, at the request of the Reserve Bank, the Board of Directors of First United Corporation voted to suspend
	quarterly cash dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock beginning with the dividend payment due November 15, 2010. Dividends

	Effective April 30,
	2010, the Pension Plan was amended, resulting in a “soft freeze”. The effects of the amendment were to prohibit new
	entrants into the plan and to cease crediting additional years of service after that date. Effective January 1, 2013, the plan
	was amended to unfreeze the plan for those employees for whom the sum of (a) their ages, at their closest birthday, plus (b) years
	of service for vesting purposes equal 80 or greater. The “soft freeze” continues to apply to all other plan participants.
	Pension benefits for these participants will be managed through discretionary contributions to the 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan.
	The Corporation anticipates that the plan changes will have a minimal impact on the consolidated financial statements.



	 



	The Corporation will assess the need for
	future annual contributions to the pension plan based upon its funded status and an evaluation of the future benefits to be provided
	thereunder. The Corporation expects to fund the annual projected benefit payments for the SERP from operations.


	 



	Note 13 - Equity Compensation Plan Information



	 


	At the 2007 Annual
	Meeting of Shareholders, First United Corporation’s shareholders approved the First United Corporation Omnibus Equity Compensation
	Plan (the “Omnibus Plan”), which authorizes the issuance of up to 185,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the grant
	of stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, stock units, performance units, dividend equivalents, and other stock-based
	awards to employees or directors.


	 


	On June 18, 2008, the
	Board of Directors of First United Corporation adopted a Long-Term Incentive Program (the “LTIP”). This program was
	adopted as a sub-plan of the Omnibus Plan to reward participants for increasing shareholder value, align executive interests with
	those of shareholders, and serve as a retention tool for key executives. Under the LTIP, participants are granted shares of restricted
	common stock of First United Corporation. The amount of an award is based on a specified percentage of the participant’s
	salary as of the date of grant. These shares will vest if the Corporation meets or exceeds certain performance thresholds. There
	were no grants of restricted stock outstanding at June 30, 2013.


	 







	40










	 






	 


	The Corporation complies
	with the provisions of ASC Topic 718,

	Compensation

	-

	Stock Compensation

	, in measuring and disclosing stock compensation
	cost. The measurement objective in ASC Paragraph 718-10-30-6 requires public companies to measure the cost of employee services
	received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award. The cost is recognized
	in expense over the period in which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (the vesting period).
	The performance-related shares granted in connection with the LTIP are expensed ratably from the date that the likelihood of meeting
	the performance measures is probable through the end of a three year vesting period.


	 


	The American Recovery
	and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the “Recovery Act”) imposes restrictions on the type and timing of bonuses and incentive
	compensation that may be accrued for or paid to certain employees of institutions like First United Corporation that participated
	in Treasury’s Capital Purchase Program. The Recovery Act generally limits bonuses and incentive compensation to grants of
	long-term restricted stock that, among other requirements, cannot fully vest until the Capital Purchase Program assistance is repaid.


	 


	Stock-based awards
	were made to non-employee directors in May 2013 pursuant to First United Corporation’s director compensation policy. Five
	thousand dollars of each director’s annual retainer is paid in shares of stock, with the remainder paid in cash. Beginning
	in 2011, each non-employee director was given the option to receive the remainder of his or her retainer, or any portion thereof,
	in shares of stock. A total of 11,304 fully-vested shares of common stock were issued to directors in 2013, which had a fair market
	value of $7.96 per share. Director stock compensation expense was $43,311 for the six months ended June 30, 2013 and $31,217 for
	the six months ended June 30, 2012. Stock compensation expense was $21,660 and $18,420 for the three months ended June 30, 2013
	and 2012, respectively.


	 



	Note 14 – Letters of Credit and Off Balance Sheet Liabilities



	 


	The Corporation does
	not issue any guarantees that would require liability recognition or disclosure other than the standby letters of credit issued
	by the Bank.  Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer
	to a third party.  Generally, the Bank’s letters of credit are issued with expiration dates within one year.  The
	credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. 
	The Bank generally holds collateral and/or personal guarantees supporting these commitments.  The Bank had $1.2
	million of outstanding standby letters of credit at June 30, 2013 and $1.3 million as of December 31, 2012. Management believes
	that the proceeds obtained through a liquidation of collateral and the enforcement of guarantees would be sufficient to cover the
	potential amount of future payment required by the letters of credit.  Management does not believe that the amount of the
	liability associated with guarantees under standby letters of credit outstanding at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012 is material.



	 




	Note 15 – Derivative Financial Instruments



	 


	As a part of managing
	interest rate risk, the Bank entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the re-pricing characteristics of certain interest-bearing
	liabilities. The Corporation has designated these interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges under the guidance of ASC Subtopic
	815-30,

	Derivatives and Hedging – Cash Flow Hedges

	. Cash flow hedges have the effective portion of changes in the
	fair value of the derivative, net of taxes, recorded in net accumulated other comprehensive income.


	 


	In July 2009, the Corporation
	entered into three interest rate swap contracts totaling $20.0 million notional amount, hedging future cash flows associated with
	floating rate trust preferred debt. As of June 30, 2013, swap contracts totaling $15.0 million notional amount remained, as the
	three-year $5.0 million contract matured on June 15, 2012. The five-year $10 million contract matures June 17, 2014 and the seven-year
	$5 million contract matures June 17, 2016. The fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was ($619) thousand at June 30, 2013
	and ($849) thousand at December 31, 2012 and was reported in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition.
	Cash in the amount of $1.4 million was posted as collateral as of June 30, 2013.


	 


	For the six months
	ended June 30, 2013, the Corporation recorded an increase in the value of the derivatives of $230 thousand and the related deferred
	tax benefit of $92 thousand in net accumulated other comprehensive loss to reflect the effective portion of cash flow hedges. ASC
	Subtopic 815-30 requires this amount to be reclassified to earnings if the hedge becomes ineffective or is terminated. There was
	no hedge ineffectiveness recorded for the six months ending June 30, 2013. The Corporation does not expect any losses relating
	to these hedges to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months.


	 


	Interest rate swap
	agreements are entered into with counterparties that meet established credit standards and the Corporation believes that the credit
	risk inherent in these contracts is not significant as of June 30, 2013.

	Note 16 – Variable Interest Entities (VIE)




	 



	As noted in Note 10,
	First United Corporation created the Trusts for the purposes of raising regulatory capital through the sale of mandatorily redeemable
	preferred capital securities to third party investors and common equity interests to First United Corporation. The Trusts are
	considered Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”), but are not consolidated because First United Corporation is not the
	primary beneficiary of the Trusts. At March 31, 2013, the Corporation reported all of the $41.7 million of TPS Debentures issued
	in connection with these offerings as long-term borrowings (along with the $5.0 million of stand-alone junior subordinated debentures),
	and it reported its $1.3 million equity interest in the Trusts as “Other Assets”.


	 



	In
	November 2009, the Bank became a 99.99% limited partner in

	Liberty Mews Limited Partnership (the “Partnership”),
	a Maryland limited partnership formed for the purpose of acquiring, developing and operating low-income housing units in Garrett
	County, Maryland.

	The Partnership

	was financed with a total of $10.6 million of funding, including
	a $6.1 million equity contribution from the Bank as the limited partner. The Partnership used the proceeds from these sources to
	purchase the land and construct a 36-unit low income housing rental complex at a total cost of $10.6 million. The total assets
	of the Partnership were approximately $9.9 million at June 30, 2013 and $10.0 million at December 31, 2012.


	 


	As of December 31,
	2011, the Bank had made contributions to the Partnership totaling $6.1 million. The project was completed in June 2011, and the
	Bank is entitled to $8.4 million in federal investment tax credits over a 10-year period as long as certain qualifying hurdles
	are maintained. The Bank will also receive the benefit of tax operating losses from the Partnership to the extent of its capital
	contribution. The investment in the Partnership assists the Bank in achieving its community reinvestment initiatives.


	 


	Because the Partnership
	is considered to be a VIE, management performed an analysis to determine whether its involvement with the Partnership would lead
	it to determine that it must consolidate the Partnership. In performing its analysis, management evaluated the risks creating the
	variability in the Partnership and identified which activities most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance.
	Finally, it examined each of the variable interest holders to determine which, if any, of the holders was the primary beneficiary
	based on their power to direct the most significant activities and their obligation to absorb potentially significant losses of
	the Partnership.


	 


	The Bank, as a limited
	partner, generally has no voting rights. The Bank is not in any way involved in the daily management of the Partnership and has
	no other rights that provide it with the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the Partnership’s
	economic performance, which are to develop and operate the housing project in such a manner that complies with specific tax credit
	guidelines. As a limited partner, there is no recourse to the Bank by the creditors of the Partnership. The tax credits that result
	from the Bank’s investment in the Partnership are generally subject to recapture should the partnership fail to comply with
	the applicable government regulations. The Bank has not provided any financial or other support to the Partnership beyond its required
	capital contributions and does not anticipate providing such support in the future. Management currently believes that no material
	losses are probable as a result of the Bank’s investment in the Partnership.


	 







	42










	 






	 


	On the basis of management’s
	analysis, the general partner is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the Partnership. Because the Bank is not the primary beneficiary,
	the Partnership has not been included in the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements.


	 


	At June 30, 2013 and
	December 31, 2012, the Corporation included its total investment in the Partnership in “Other Assets” in its Consolidated
	Statement of Financial Condition. As of June 30, 2013, the Corporation’s commitment in the Partnership was fully funded.

	Note 17 – Assets and Liabilities
	Subject to Enforceable Master Netting Arrangements




	 




	Interest Rate Swap Agreements (“Swap
	Agreements”)



	 


	The Corporation has
	entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the re-pricing characteristics of certain interest-bearing liabilities as
	a part of managing interest rate risk. The swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges, and accordingly, the fair
	value of the interest rate swap contracts is reported in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition.
	The swap agreements were entered into with a third party financial institution. The Corporation is party to master netting arrangements
	with its financial institution counterparty; however the Corporation does not offset assets and liabilities under these arrangements
	for financial statement presentation purposes. The master netting arrangements provide for a single net settlement of all swap
	agreements, as well as collateral, in the event of default on, or termination of, any one contract. Collateral, in the form of
	cash, is posted by the Corporation as the counterparty with net liability positions in accordance with contract thresholds. See
	Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.


	 



	Securities Sold Under Agreements to
	Repurchase (“Repurchase Agreements”)



	 


	The Bank enters into
	agreements under which it sells interests in U.S. Securities to certain customers subject to an obligation to repurchase, and on
	the part of the customers to resell, such interests. Under these arrangements, the Bank may transfer legal control over the assets
	but still retain effective control through an agreement that both entitles and obligates the Bank to repurchase the assets. As
	a result, these repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing arrangements (i.e. secured borrowings) and
	not as a sale and subsequent repurchase of securities. The obligation to repurchase the securities is reflected as a liability
	in the consolidated statement of condition, while the securities underlying the repurchase agreements remain in the respective
	investment securities asset accounts. There is no offsetting or netting of the investment securities assets with the repurchase
	agreement liabilities. In addition, as the Bank does not enter into reverse repurchase agreements, there is no such offsetting
	to be done with the repurchase agreements. The right of setoff for a repurchase agreement resembles a secured borrowing, whereby
	the collateral would be used to settle the fair value of the repurchase agreement should the Bank be in default (i.e. fails to
	repurchase the U.S. Securities on the maturity date of the agreement). The investment security collateral is held by a third party
	financial institution in the counterparty’s custodial account.

	Note 18 – Adoption of New Accounting Standards and
	Effects of New Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	In December 2011, the
	FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2011-11,

	“Disclosures About Offsetting Assets and Liabilities”

	The new disclosure requirements mandate that entities disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions
	eligible for offset in the statement of financial condition as well as instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar
	to a master netting arrangement. ASU No. 2011-11 also requires disclosure of collateral received and posted in connection with
	master netting agreements or similar arrangements. In January 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-01,

	“Clarifying the Scope
	of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.”

	The provisions of ASU No. 2013-01 limit the scope of the new
	balance sheet offsetting disclosures to the following financial instruments, to the extent they are offset in the financial statements
	or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, irrespective of whether they are offset in the statement
	of financial condition: (a) derivative financial instruments; (b) repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements; and
	(c) securities borrowing and securities lending transactions. The Corporation adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2011-11 and ASU
	No. 2013-01 effective January 1, 2013. As the provisions of ASU No. 2011-11 and ASU No. 2013-01 only impacted the disclosure requirements
	related to the offsetting of assets and liabilities and information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the
	statement of financial condition, the adoption had no impact on the Corporations’ consolidated statements of income and condition.
	See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the disclosures required by ASU No. 2011-11 and ASU No. 2013-01.


	 


	In February 2013, the
	FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02,

	“Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income,”

	to improve the transparency of reporting these reclassifications. ASU No. 2013-02 does not amend any existing requirements for
	reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements. ASU No. 2013-02 requires an entity to disaggregate
	the total change of each component of other comprehensive income and separately present reclassification adjustments and current
	period other comprehensive income. The provisions of ASU No. 2013-02 also require that entities present in a single note or parenthetically
	on the face of the financial statements, the effect of significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other
	comprehensive income based on its source and the income statement line item affected by the reclassification. If a component is
	not required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety, entities would instead cross-reference to the related note to the
	financial statements for additional information. The Corporation adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2013-02 effective January 1,
	2013. As the Corporation provided these required disclosures in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the adoption
	of ASU No. 2013-02 had no impact on the Corporation’s consolidated statements of income and condition. See Note 9 to the
	Consolidated Financial Statements for the disclosures required by ASU No. 2013-02.

	In July 2013, the FASB
	issued ASU 2013-11

	Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or
	a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists

	. In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11,

	Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit
	When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists

	,

	which
	provides guidance on financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax

	benefit when a net operating loss (“NOL”)
	carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists

	. The ASU is intended to eliminate
	diversity in practice resulting from a lack of guidance on this topic in current GAAP. Under the ASU, an entity generally must
	present an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, in the financial statements as a reduction to
	a deferred tax asset for an NOL carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward. This ASU is effective for fiscal
	years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013.

	The adoption of this ASU will not have
	a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operation

	Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations





	 


	INTRODUCTION


	 


	The following discussion
	and analysis is intended as a review of material changes in and significant factors affecting the financial condition and results
	of operations of the First United Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries for the periods indicated. This discussion and
	analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained in
	Item 1 of Part I of this report. Unless the context clearly suggests otherwise, references in this report to “us”,
	“we”, “our”, and “the Corporation” are to First United Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.




	 




	FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS


	 


	This report may contain
	forward-looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Readers of this report should
	be aware of the speculative nature of “forward-looking statements.” Statements that are not historical in nature, including
	those that include the words “anticipate”, “estimate”, “should”, “expect”, “believe”,
	“intend”, and similar expressions, are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about, among other
	things, the industry and the markets in which we operate, and they are not guarantees of future performance. Whether actual results
	will conform to expectations and predictions is subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including risks and uncertainties
	discussed in this report; general economic, market, or business conditions; changes in interest rates, deposit flow, the cost of
	funds, and demand for loan products and financial services; changes in our competitive position or competitive actions by other
	companies; changes in the quality or composition of our loan and investment portfolios; our ability to manage growth; changes in
	laws or regulations or policies of federal and state regulators and agencies; and other circumstances beyond our control. Consequently,
	all of the forward-looking statements made in this report are qualified by these cautionary statements, and there can be no assurance
	that the actual results anticipated will be realized, or if substantially realized, will have the expected consequences on our
	business or operations. These and other risks are discussed in detail in the periodic reports that First United Corporation files
	with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) (see Item 1A of Part II of this report for further information).
	Except as required by applicable laws, we do not intend to publish updates or revisions of any forward-looking statements we make
	to reflect new information, future events or otherwise.


	 


	FIRST UNITED CORPORATION


	 


	First United Corporation
	is a Maryland corporation chartered in 1985 and a financial holding company registered under the federal Bank Holding Company Act
	of 1956, as amended. First United Corporation’s primary business is serving as the parent company of First United Bank &
	Trust, a Maryland trust company (the “Bank”), First United Statutory Trust I (“Trust I”) and First United
	Statutory Trust II (“Trust II”), both Connecticut statutory business trusts, and First United Statutory Trust III,
	a Delaware statutory business trust (“Trust III” and together with Trust I and Trust II, the “Trusts”).
	The Trusts were formed for the purpose of selling trust preferred securities that qualified as Tier 1 capital. First United Corporation
	is also the parent company of First United Insurance Group, LLC, a Maryland limited liability company (the “Insurance Agency”)
	that, through the close of business on December 31, 2011, operated as a full service insurance agency. Effective on January 1,
	2012, the Insurance Agency sold substantially all of its assets, net of cash, to a third-party and is no longer an active subsidiary.
	The Bank has three wholly-owned subsidiaries: OakFirst Loan Center, Inc., a West Virginia finance company; OakFirst Loan Center,
	LLC, a Maryland finance company (collectively, the “OakFirst Loan Centers”), and First OREO Trust, a Maryland statutory
	trust formed for the purposes of servicing and disposing of the real estate that the Bank acquires through foreclosure or by deed
	in lieu of foreclosure. Until March 27, 2013, the Bank also owned a majority interest in Cumberland Liquidation Trust, a Maryland
	statutory trust formed for the purposes of servicing and disposing of real estate that secured a loan made by another bank and
	in which the Bank held a participation interest, but this entity was dissolved on such date. The Bank also owns 99.9% of the limited
	partnership interests in Liberty Mews Limited Partnership, a Maryland limited partnership formed for the purpose of acquiring,
	developing and operating low-income housing units in Garrett County, Maryland.

	At June 30, 2013, the
	Corporation had total assets of approximately $1.3 billion, net loans of $826.3 million, and deposits of approximately $972.7 million.
	Shareholders’ equity at June 30, 2013 was approximately $97.8 million.


	 


	The Corporation maintains
	an Internet site at www.mybank4.com on which it makes available, free of charge, its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports
	on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to the foregoing as soon as reasonably practicable after these reports
	are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.


	 


	ESTIMATES AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES


	 


	This discussion and
	analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial

	statements,
	which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation
	of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
	revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. (See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
	included in Item 8 of Part II of First United Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012).
	On an on-going basis, management evaluates estimates, including those related to loan losses and intangible assets, other-than-temporary
	impairment (“OTTI”) of investment securities, income taxes, fair value of investments and pension plan assumptions.
	Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under
	the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
	that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
	conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates
	used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.



	 



	Allowance for Loan Losses



	 


	One of our most important
	accounting policies is that related to the monitoring of the loan portfolio. A variety of estimates impact

	the
	carrying value of the loan portfolio, including the calculation of the allowance for loan losses (the “ALL”), the valuation
	of underlying collateral, the timing of loan charge-offs and the placement of loans on non-accrual status. The ALL is established
	and maintained at a level that management believes is adequate to cover losses resulting from the inability of borrowers to make
	required payment on loans. Estimates for loan losses are arrived at by analyzing risks associated with specific loans and the loan
	portfolio, current and historical trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, and changes in the size and composition of the loan
	portfolio. The analysis also requires consideration of the economic climate and direction, changes in lending rates, political
	conditions, legislation impacting the banking industry and economic conditions specific to Western Maryland and Northeastern West
	Virginia. Because the calculation of the ALL relies on management’s estimates and judgments relating to inherently uncertain
	events, actual results may differ from management’s estimates.



	 



	Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets



	 


	Financial Accounting
	Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 350,

	Intangibles - Goodwill and Other

	, establishes
	standards for the amortization

	of acquired intangible assets and impairment assessment of goodwill. 
	The $11 million in recorded goodwill is primarily related to the acquisition of Huntington National Bank branches that occurred
	in 2003 and is not subject to periodic amortization. 



	 


	Goodwill arising from
	business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired. Goodwill
	is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
	asset might be impaired. Impairment testing requires that the fair value of each of the Corporation’s reporting units be
	compared to the carrying amount of its net assets, including goodwill.  If the estimated current fair value of the reporting
	unit exceeds its carrying value, no additional testing is required and an impairment loss is not recorded. Otherwise, additional
	testing is performed, and to the extent such additional testing results in a conclusion that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds
	its implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized.


	 


	Our goodwill relates
	to value inherent in the banking business, and that value is dependent upon our ability to provide quality, cost effective services
	in a highly competitive local market.  This ability relies upon continuing investments in processing systems, the development
	of value-added service features and the ease of use of our services.  As such, goodwill value is ultimately supported by revenue
	that is driven by the volume of business transacted.  A decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the inability
	to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill, which could adversely impact earnings
	in future periods.  ASC Topic 350 requires an annual evaluation of goodwill for impairment.  The determination of whether
	or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments and estimates.

	Accounting for Income Taxes



	 


	First United Corporation
	accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes”. Under this guidance, deferred taxes are
	recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
	assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
	that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The
	effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes
	the enactment date.


	 


	Management regularly
	reviews the carrying amount of its net deferred tax assets to determine if the establishment of a valuation allowance is necessary.
	If based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the Company’s net deferred tax assets
	will not be realized in future periods, a deferred tax valuation allowance would be established. Consideration is given to various
	positive and negative factors that could affect the realization of the deferred tax assets. In evaluating this available evidence,
	management considers, among other things, historical performance, expectations of future earnings, the ability to carry back losses
	to recoup taxes previously paid, length of statutory carry forward periods, experience with utilization of operating loss and tax
	credit carry forwards not expiring, tax planning strategies and timing of reversals of temporary differences. Significant judgment
	is required in assessing future earnings trends and the timing of reversals of temporary differences. The Corporation’s evaluation
	is based on current tax laws as well as management’s expectations of future performance.


	 


	Management expects
	that First United Corporation’s adherence to the required accounting guidance may result in increased volatility in quarterly
	and annual effective income tax rates because of changes in judgment or measurement including changes in actual and forecasted
	income before taxes, tax laws and regulations, and tax planning strategies.



	 




	Other-Than-Temporary Impairment of Investment Securities



	 



	Management
	systematically evaluates securities for impairment on a quarterly basis. Based upon application of accounting guidance for subsequent
	measurement in ASC Topic 320 (Section 320-10-35),

	management assesses whether (a) the Corporation
	has the intent to sell a security being evaluated and (b) it is more likely than not that the Corporation will be required to sell
	the security prior to its anticipated recovery. If neither applies, then

	declines in the fair values of securities below
	their cost that are considered other-than-temporary declines are split into two components. The first is the loss attributable
	to declining credit quality. Credit losses are recognized in earnings as realized losses in the period in which the impairment
	determination is made. The second component consists of all other losses, which are recognized in other comprehensive loss. In
	estimating OTTI losses, management considers (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost,
	(2) adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry, or a geographic area, (3) the historic and implied volatility
	of the fair value of the security, (4) changes in the rating of the security by a rating agency, (5) recoveries or additional declines
	in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date, (6) failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal
	payments, and (7) the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that
	increase in the future.

	Management also

	monitors cash flow projections for securities that are
	considered beneficial interests under the guidance of ASC Subtopic 325-40,

	Investments – Other – Beneficial Interests
	in Securitized Financial Assets

	, (ASC Section 325-40-35).


	This process is described more fully in the Investment Securities section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review.




	 




	Fair Value of Investments




	 




	We
	have determined the fair value of our investment securities in accordance with the requirements of ASC Topic 820,

	Fair Value
	Measurements and Disclosures

	,

	which

	defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
	fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements. The Corporation
	measures the fair market values of its investments based on the fair value hierarchy established in Topic 820. The determination
	of fair value of investments and other assets is discussed further in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements presented
	elsewhere in this report.



	 







	47










	 






	 



	Pension Plan Assumptions




	 



	Our pension plan costs
	are calculated using actuarial concepts, as discussed within the requirements of ASC Topic 715,

	Compensation – Retirement
	Benefits.

	Pension expense and the determination of our projected pension liability are based upon two critical assumptions:
	the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. We evaluate each of these critical assumptions annually. Other assumptions
	impact the determination of pension expense and the projected liability including the primary employee demographics, such as retirement
	patterns, employee turnover, mortality rates, and estimated employer compensation increases. These factors, along with the critical
	assumptions, are carefully reviewed by management each year in consultation with our pension plan consultants and actuaries. Further
	information about our pension plan assumptions, the plan’s funded status, and other plan information is included in Note
	12 to the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report.


	 


	Other than as discussed
	above, management does not believe that any material changes in our critical accounting policies have occurred since December 31,
	2012.

	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


	 



	Overview



	 


	Consolidated net income
	available to common shareholders was $2.9 million for the first six months of 2013, compared to a net loss attributable to common
	shareholders of $1.9 million for the same period of 2012. Basic and diluted net income per common share for the first six months
	of 2013 was $.47, compared to a net loss per common share of $.30 for the same period of 2012. The change in earnings, from a net
	loss for the first six months of 2012 to net income for the first six months in 2013, was primarily due to a $8.3 million decrease
	in the provision for loan losses during the first six months of 2013 when compared to the same time period of 2012. This decrease
	was offset by a decrease in net gains of $.3 million due to reduced gains on sales of investment securities, and a decrease of
	$.8 million in other income due to a reduction in bank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”) income driven by a one-time death
	benefit of $.7 million that occurred in March 2012. Total other operating expenses increased $.1 million during the first six months
	of 2013 when compared to the same period of 2012. Other expenses related to other real estate owned (“OREO”) increased
	$.3 million in the first six months of 2013 when compared to the first six months of 2012. The net interest margin for the first
	six months of 2013, on a fully tax equivalent (“FTE”) basis, decreased to 3.17% from 3.33% for the first six months
	of 2012. The net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2012, on a FTE basis, was 3.30%.


	 


	The provision for loan
	losses decreased to $.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013, compared to $9.2 million for the same period of 2012. The
	lower provision expense thus far in 2013 was primarily due to a loan charge-off of $9.0 million on a shared national credit for
	an ethanol plant in western Pennsylvania during the first quarter of 2012 and charge-offs of $1.1 million on a participation loan
	for a hotel located in Hazleton, Pennsylvania and $.9 million on a motel located in Salisbury, Maryland during the first quarter
	of 2012. For the first six months of 2013, we continued to see a leveling in the credit quality of our loan portfolio as we experienced
	fewer loan downgrades and delinquency levels have improved. Specific allocations have been made for impaired loans where management
	has determined that the collateral supporting the loans is not adequate to cover the loan balance, and the qualitative factors
	affecting the ALL have been adjusted based on the current economic environment and the characteristics of the loan portfolio.

	Interest expense on
	our interest-bearing liabilities decreased $1.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2013 when compared to the same period
	of 2012 due primarily to a decrease of $76.8 million in average interest-bearing deposits and a $24.1 million decrease in average
	long-term debt outstanding. The decline in average interest-bearing deposits and average long-term debt was due to the repayment
	of $40.0 million in brokered certificates of deposit and the repayment of $23.5 million in Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”)
	advances at their stated maturities, respectively. During 2013, the Bank’s treasury team will continue to monitor rates on
	our deposits and increases special pricing only for full relationship customers. Our retail staff continues to be focused on shifting
	our deposit mix away from higher cost certificates of deposit and towards lower cost money market and transaction accounts.


	 


	Other operating income
	decreased $.8 million during the first six months of 2013 when compared to the same period of 2012. This decrease was primarily
	attributable to a decline in BOLI income due to the one-time death benefit of $.7 million received in March 2012. Net gains declined
	$.3 million during the first six months of 2013 when compared to the first six months of 2012 due to a reduction in gains on sales
	of investment securities.


	 


	Operating expenses
	increased $.1 million in the first six months of 2013 when compared to the same period of 2012. This increase was due to a $.6
	million reduction in gains on sales of OREO offset by a reduction of approximately $.3 million in salaries and benefits due to
	reduced health insurance costs and incentives and a decrease of $.2 million in other miscellaneous expenses.


	 


	Consolidated net income
	available to common shareholders was $1.4 million, or $.23 per common share, for the second quarter of 2013, compared to net income
	available to common shareholders of $1.2 million, or $.20 per common share, for the same period of 2012. The net interest margin
	for the second quarter of 2013, on a FTE basis, was 3.09%, compared to 3.34% for the same period of 2012.


	 


	Other operating income
	remained stable during the second quarter of 2013 when compared to the same period of 2012.


	 


	Operating expenses
	decreased $.3 million in the second quarter of 2013 when compared to the same period of 2012. This decrease was due to a $.3 million
	reduction in salaries and benefits related to reduced health insurance costs and incentives.


	 



	Net Interest Income



	 


	Net interest income
	is the largest source of operating revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on interest-earning assets and the
	interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. For analytical and discussion purposes, net interest income is adjusted
	to a FTE basis to facilitate performance comparisons between taxable and tax-exempt assets. FTE income is determined by increasing
	tax-exempt income by an amount equal to the federal income taxes that would have been paid if this income were taxable at the statutorily
	applicable rate.

	Net interest income
	on a FTE basis decreased $1.4 million during the first six months of 2013 over the same period in 2012 due to a $3.0 million (10.8%)
	decrease in interest income, which was partially offset by a $1.6 million (21.3%) decrease in interest expense. The decrease in
	interest income was primarily due to the $62.5 million reduction in the average balance of loans when comparing the first six months
	of 2013 to the same period of 2012. The slightly lower yield on both loans and investment securities, as funds were reinvested,
	also contributed to the decline in interest income when comparing the two periods. The decline in interest income was partially
	offset by a decline in interest expense due to the reduction in average balances in interest-bearing deposits and long-term borrowings.
	We saw a slight decline in the net interest margin in the first six months of 2013 to 3.17% when compared to 3.30% for the year
	ended December 31, 2012 and 3.33% for the first six months of 2012.


	 


	There was an overall
	$26.2 million decrease in average interest-earning assets, driven by a $62.5 million reduction in loans, offset by increases of
	$23.9 million in investment securities and $12.4 million in other interest earning assets, primarily cash.


	 


	Interest expense decreased
	during the first six months of 2013 when compared to the same period of 2012 due primarily to an overall reduction in average interest-bearing
	liabilities of $92.2 million. This reduction was due to the repayments of $40.0 in brokered deposits and $23.5 million in long-term
	borrowings. The overall effect was a 19 basis point decrease in the average rate paid on our average interest-bearing liabilities,
	from 1.34% for the six months ended June 30, 2012 to 1.15% for the same period of 2013.

	Net interest income
	on a FTE basis decreased $.8 million during the second quarter of 2013 over the same period in 2012 due to a $1.5 million (10.6%)
	decrease in interest income, which was partially offset by a $.7 million (18.5%) decrease in interest expense. The decrease in
	interest income was primarily due to the $61.0 million reduction in the average balance of loans when comparing the second quarter
	of 2013 to the same period of 2012. The slightly lower yield on both loans and investment securities, as funds were reinvested,
	also contributed to the decline in interest income when comparing the two periods. The decline in interest income was partially
	offset by a decline in interest expense due to the reduction in average balances in interest-bearing deposits and long-term borrowings.
	We saw a decline in the net interest margin in the second quarter of 2013 to 3.09% when compared to 3.34% for the three months
	ended June 30, 2012.


	 


	Interest expense decreased
	during the second quarter of 2013 when compared to the same period of 2012 due primarily to an overall reduction in average interest-bearing
	liabilities of $52.0 million. This reduction was due to the repayments of $40.0 in brokered deposits and $23.5 million in long-term
	borrowings. The overall effect was a 20 basis point decrease in the average rate paid on our average interest-bearing liabilities,
	from 1.31% for the three months ended June 30, 2012 to 1.11% for the same period of 2013. 



	 




	Provision for Loan Losses



	 


	The provision for loan
	losses was $.9 million for the first six months of 2013, compared to $9.2 million for the same period of 2012.  The lower
	provision expense was primarily due to the significantly lower net charge-offs in the first six months of 2013 as well as overall
	lower loan balances. During 2013, we continue to see stabilization in our total rolling historical loss rates and the qualitative
	factors utilized in the determination of the ALL, as well as stabilization in the level of classified assets (discussed below in
	the section entitled “FINANCIAL CONDITION” under the heading “Allowance and Provision for Loan Losses”).
	Management strives to ensure that the ALL reflects a level commensurate with the risk inherent in our loan portfolio.

	Other Operating Income



	 


	Other operating income,
	exclusive of gains, decreased $.8 million during the first six months of 2013 when compared to the same period of 2012. The decrease
	was due to the reduction in BOLI income due to the one-time death benefit of $.7 million received in March 2012.


	 


	Net gains of $.4 million
	were reported through other income in the first six months of 2013, compared to net gains of $.7 million during the same period
	of 2012. The reduction in net gains during the first six months of 2013 when compared to the same period of 2012 was due to reduced
	gains on sales of investment securities.


	 


	Other operating income,
	exclusive of gains, remained consistent during the second quarter of 2013 when compared to the same period of 2012.


	 


	Net gains of $ 27 thousand

	Other Operating Expenses



	 


	Other operating expenses
	increased slightly for the first six months of 2013 when compared to the first six months of 2012. The increase was due to an increase
	of $.5 million in other expense due to reduced gains on sales of other real estate owned offset by a $.3 million reduction in salaries
	and benefits related to a decrease in health insurance costs and a reduction in incentives.


	 


	Operating expenses
	decreased $.3 million (3.3%) for the second quarter of 2013 when compared to the same period of 2012. The decrease was due primarily

	Applicable Income Taxes



	 


	In reporting interim
	financial information, income tax provisions should be determined under the procedures set forth in

	ASC
	Topic 740,

	I



	ncome Taxes


	(Section 740-270-30).

	This guidance provides that
	at the end of each interim period, an entity should make its best estimate of the effective tax rate expected to be applicable
	for the full fiscal year. The rate so determined should be used in providing for income taxes on a current year-to-date basis.
	The effective tax rate should reflect anticipated investment tax credits, capital gains rates, and other available tax planning
	alternatives. In arriving at this effective tax rate, however, no effect should be included for the tax related to significant,
	unusual or extraordinary items that will be separately reported or reported net of their related tax effect in reports for the
	interim period or for the fiscal year.


	 


	The effective tax rate
	for the first six months of 2013 was 23.8%, compared to an effective tax rate of 20.4% for the first six months of 2012. Our effective
	income tax rates differed from the 35% federal statutory rate due to the effects of tax-exempt income on loans, securities and
	bank-owned life insurance, as well as the low income housing tax credits.

	liabilities increased by approximately $9.5 million during the first six months of 2013, reflecting a decrease in total deposits
	of $4.2 million offset by an increase of $11.7 million in short-term borrowings and a $2.1 million increase in accrued interest
	payable and other liabilities. Shareholders’ equity decreased $1.1 million from December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2013 as a result
	of increased earnings of $2.9 million offset by an increase of $4.1 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss.

	Comparing June 30,
	2013 to December 31, 2012, outstanding loans decreased by $33.0 million (3.8%). Commercial Real Estate (“CRE”) loans
	decreased $12.9 million as a result of the payoff of several large loans and ongoing scheduled principal payments. Acquisition
	and development (“A&D”) loans decreased $10.0 million due to the movement of $2.1 million from construction to
	permanent financing and $2.2 million of payoffs. Commercial and industrial (“C&I”) loans decreased $5.2 million
	due to scheduled principal payments. Residential mortgages decreased by $.3 million. The decrease in the residential mortgage portfolio
	was attributable to the purchase of a pool of loans of approximately $8.4 million in January 2013 offset by refinancings and regularly
	scheduled principal payments on existing loans. Management continues to use Fannie Mae for the majority of new, longer-term, fixed-rate
	residential loan originations. The consumer portfolio decreased $4.6 million due primarily to repayment activity in the indirect
	auto portfolio offsetting new production. At June 30, 2013, approximately 59% of the commercial loan portfolio was collateralized
	by real estate compared to 60% at December 31, 2012.

	Performing loans considered
	to be impaired (including performing troubled debt restructurings, or TDRs), as defined and identified by management, amounted
	to $24.4 million at June 30, 2013 and $28.2 million at December 31, 2012. Loans are identified as impaired when, based on current
	information and events, management determines that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to contractual terms.
	These loans consist primarily of A&D loans and CRE loans. The fair values are generally determined based upon independent third
	party appraisals of the collateral or discounted cash flows based upon the expected proceeds. Specific allocations have been made
	where management believes there is insufficient collateral to repay the loan balance if liquidated and there is no secondary source
	of repayment available.

	The
	level of performing impaired loans (other than performing TDRs) decreased $3.3

	million during the six months ended June
	30, 2013, due to the reclassification of a $1.8 million A&D loan out of impaired status due to improved performance as well
	as $1.5 million of net principal

	repayments received during the first six months of 2013. Management
	will continue to monitor all loans that have been removed from an impaired status and take appropriate steps to ensure that satisfactory
	performance is sustained.

	The level of TDRs decreased
	$1.1 million during the six months ended June 30, 2013. Three loans totaling $.4 million were added to performing TDRs and four
	loans already in performing TDRs were re-modified. One loan totaling $.5 million that had been modified prior to December 31, 2012
	at a market rate is no longer reported as a performing TDR during 2013 because the borrower had made at least six consecutive payments
	and was current at the time of reclassification. Two non-performing A&D loans totaling $.4 million were transferred to OREO
	during the six months ended June 30, 2013 and $.6 million in principal payments were received during the same time period.


	 



	Allowance and Provision for Loan Losses



	 


	The ALL is maintained
	to absorb losses from the loan portfolio. The ALL is based on management’s continuing evaluation of the quality of the loan
	portfolio, assessment of current economic conditions, diversification and size of the portfolio, adequacy of collateral, past and
	anticipated loss experience, and the amount of non-performing loans.


	 







	56










	 






	  


	The ALL is also based
	on estimates, and actual losses will vary from current estimates. These estimates are reviewed quarterly, and as adjustments, either
	positive or negative, become necessary, a corresponding increase or decrease is made in the ALL. The methodology used to determine
	the adequacy of the ALL is consistent with prior years. An estimate for probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments,
	such as letters of credit and binding but unfunded loan commitments is also prepared. This estimate is computed in a manner similar
	to the methodology described above, adjusted for the probability of actually funding the commitment.

	The ALL decreased
	to $15.5 million at June 30, 2013, from $16.0 million at December 31, 2012 and $16.8 million at June 30, 2012. The provision for
	loan losses for the first six months of 2013 decreased to $.9 million from $9.2 million for the same period in 2012. Net charge-offs
	declined to $1.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013, compared to $11.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012.
	Included in the net charge-offs for the six months ended June 30, 2013 was a $.8 million charge-off for a C&I loan. The lower
	provision expense was due to the significantly lower level of net charge-offs as well as the lower level of loan balances. The
	ratio of the ALL to loans outstanding as of June 30, 2013 was 1.84%, which was slightly lower than the 1.85% for the same period
	last year.


	 


	The ratio of net charge-offs
	to average loans for the six months ended June 30, 2013 was an annualized .34%, compared to an annualized 2.59% for the same period
	in 2012 and 1.41% for the year ended December 31, 2012. Relative to December 31, 2012, C&I, residential mortgage and consumer
	segments of loans showed improvement. The CRE portfolio had an annualized net charge-off rate as of June 30, 2013 of 1.04% compared
	to an annualized net charge-off rate of .67% as of December 31, 2012. The annualized net charge-off rate for A&D loans as
	of June 30, 2013 was .39% compared to an annualized net charge-off rate of .29% as of December 31, 2012. The ratios for C&I
	loans were 2.87% and 12.10% for June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. The residential mortgage ratios were .08% and
	.33% for June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively, and the consumer loan ratios were .57% and .69% for June 30, 2013
	and December 31, 2012, respectively.


	 


	Accruing loans past
	due 30 days or more declined to .75% of the loan portfolio at June 30, 2013, compared to 2.39% at December 31, 2012. The decrease
	for the first six months of 2013 was primarily due to a decrease of $11.2 million in past-due accruing residential mortgage loans
	and a $1.9 million decrease in past-due accruing CRE loans. Other improvements in the levels of past-due loans were attributable
	to a combination of a slowly improving economy and vigorous collection efforts by the Bank.

	Comparing the six-month
	periods ended June 30, 2013 and June 30, 2012, total non-accrual loan balances have declined. Non-accrual loans totaled $19.4 million
	as of June 30, 2013, compared to $19.9 million as of December 31, 2012 and $27.0 million as of June 30, 2012. Non-accrual loans
	which have been subject to a partial charge-off totaled $7.4 million as of June 30, 2013, compared to $6.7 million as of December
	31, 2012.


	 


	Management believes
	that the ALL at June 30, 2013 is adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. Amounts that will be recorded
	for the provision for loan losses in future periods will depend upon trends in the loan balances, including the composition of
	the loan portfolio, changes in loan quality and loss experience trends, potential recoveries on previously charged-off loans and
	changes in other qualitative factors. Management also applies interest rate risk, collateral value and debt service sensitivity
	analyses to the Commercial real estate loan portfolio and obtains new appraisals on specific loans under defined parameters to
	assist in the determination of the periodic provision for loan losses.



	 




	Investment Securities



	 


	At June 30, 2013, the
	total amortized cost basis of the available-for-sale investment portfolio was $333.7 million, compared to a fair value of $304.7
	million. Unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a
	component of shareholders’ equity.

	Total investment securities
	available-for-sale increased $81.4 million since December 31, 2012. At June 30, 2013, the securities classified as available-for-sale
	included a net unrealized loss of $29.1 million, which represents the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of
	securities in the portfolio.


	 


	As discussed in Note
	8 to the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report,

	the Corporation measures
	fair market values based on the fair value hierarchy established in ASC Topic 820,

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

	.
	The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level
	1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). Level 3 p

	rices or valuation techniques
	require inputs that are both significant to the valuation assumptions and are not readily observable in the market (i.e. supported
	with little or no market activity). These Level 3 instruments are valued based on both observable and unobservable inputs derived
	from the best available data, some of which is internally developed, and considers risk premiums that a market participant would
	require.


	 


	Approximately $289.7
	million of the available-for-sale portfolio was valued using Level 2 pricing, and had net unrealized gains of $7.0 million at
	June 30, 2013. The remaining $15.0 million of the securities available-for-sale represents the entire CDO portfolio, which was
	valued using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 assets). The $22.2 million in unrealized losses associated with this portfolio
	relates to 17 of the 18 pooled trust preferred securities that comprise the CDO portfolio. Unrealized losses of $14.5 million
	represent non-credit related OTTI charges on 13 of the securities, while $7.7 million of unrealized losses relates to five securities
	which have had no credit related OTTI. The unrealized losses on these securities were primarily attributable to continued depression
	in the marketability and liquidity associated with CDOs.

	The following table
	provides a summary of the trust preferred securities in the CDO portfolio and the credit status of these securities as of June
	30, 2013.

	*  Security has been deemed other-than-temporarily impaired and loss has been recognized in accordance with ASC Section 320-10-35.





	 


	The terms of the debentures
	underlying trust preferred securities allow the issuer of the debentures to defer interest payments for up to 20 quarters, and,
	in such case, the terms of the related trust preferred securities allow their issuers to defer dividend payments for up to 20
	quarters. Some of the issuers of the trust preferred securities in our investment portfolio have defaulted and/or deferred payments
	ranging from 7.08% to 40.13% of the total collateral balances underlying the securities. The securities were designed to include
	structural features that provide investors with credit enhancement or support to provide default protection by subordinated tranches.
	These features include over-collateralization of the notes or subordination, excess interest or spread which will redirect funds
	in situations where collateral is insufficient, and a specified order of principal payments. There are securities in our portfolio
	that are under-collateralized, which does represent additional stress on our tranche. However, in these cases, the terms of the
	securities require excess interest to be redirected from subordinate tranches as credit support, which provides additional support
	to our investment.


	 


	Management systematically
	evaluates securities for impairment on a quarterly basis. Based upon application of ASC Topic 320 (Section 320-10-35),

	management
	must assess whether (a) the Corporation has the intent to sell the security and (b) it is more likely than not that the Corporation
	will be required to sell the security prior to its anticipated recovery. If neither applies, then

	declines in the fair value
	of securities below their cost that are considered other-than-temporary declines are split into two components. The first is the
	loss attributable to declining credit quality. Credit losses are recognized in earnings as realized losses in the period in which
	the impairment determination is made. The second component consists of all other losses. The other losses are recognized in other
	comprehensive income. In estimating OTTI charges, management considers (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair
	value has been less than cost, (2) adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry, or a geographic area,
	(3) the historic and implied volatility of the security, (4) changes in the rating of a security by a rating agency, (5) recoveries
	or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date, (6) failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled
	interest payments, and (7) the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments
	that increase in the future. Due to the duration and the significant market value decline in the pooled trust preferred securities
	held in our portfolio, we performed more extensive testing on these securities for purposes of evaluating whether or not an OTTI
	has occurred.

	The market for these
	securities as of June 30, 2013 is not active and markets for similar securities are also not active. The inactivity was evidenced
	first by a significant widening of the bid-ask spread in the brokered markets in which these securities trade and then by a significant
	decrease in the volume of trades relative to historical levels. The new issue market is also inactive, as no new CDOs have been
	issued since 2007. There are currently very few market participants who are willing to effect transactions in these securities.
	The market values for these securities, or any securities other than those issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury
	(the “Treasury”), are very depressed relative to historical levels. Therefore, in the current market, a low market
	price for a particular bond may only provide evidence of stress in the credit markets in general rather than being an indicator
	of credit problems with a particular issue. Given the conditions in the current debt markets and the absence of observable transactions
	in the secondary and new issue markets, management has determined that (a) the few observable transactions and market quotations
	that are available are not reliable for the purpose of obtaining fair value at June 30, 2013, (b) an income valuation approach
	technique (i.e. present value) that maximizes the use of relevant unobservable inputs and minimizes the use of observable inputs
	will be equally or more representative of fair value than a market approach, and (c) the CDO segment is appropriately classified
	within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy because management determined that significant adjustments were required to determine
	fair value at the measurement date.


	 


	Management utilizes
	an independent third party to prepare both the evaluations of OTTI and the fair value determinations for the CDO portfolio. Management
	does not believe that there were any material differences in the OTTI evaluations and pricing between December 31, 2012 and June
	30, 2013.


	 



	The
	approach used by the third party to determine fair value involved several steps, including detailed credit and structural evaluation
	of each piece of collateral in each bond, default, recovery and prepayment/amortization probabilities for each piece of collateral
	in the bond, and discounted cash flow modeling.

	The discount rate methodology used by the third party combines a baseline
	current market yield for comparable corporate and structured credit products with adjustments based on evaluations of the differences
	found in structure and risks associated with actual and projected credit performance of each CDO being valued. Currently, the only
	active and liquid trading market that exists is for stand-alone trust preferred securities. Therefore, adjustments to the baseline
	discount rate are also made to reflect the additional leverage found in structured instruments.


	 


	Based upon a review
	of credit quality and the cash flow tests performed by the independent third party, management determined that no securities had
	credit-related OTTI during the first six months of 2013.


	 


	The risk-based capital
	ratios require that banks set aside additional capital for securities that are rated below investment grade. Securities rated one
	level below investment grade require a 200% risk weighting. Additional methods are applicable to securities rated more than one
	level below investment grade. Management believes that, as of June 30, 2013, we maintain sufficient capital and liquidity to cover
	the additional capital requirements of these securities and future operating expenses. Additionally, we do not anticipate any material
	commitments or expected outlays of capital in the near term.

	Liquidity Management



	 


	Liquidity is a financial
	institution’s capability to meet customer demands for deposit withdrawals while funding all credit-worthy loans. The factors
	that determine the institution’s liquidity are:


	 







	·




	Reliability and stability of core deposits;










	·




	Cash flow structure and pledging status
	of investments; and










	·




	Potential for unexpected loan demand.





	 


	We actively manage
	our liquidity position through weekly meetings of a sub-committee of executive management, known as the Treasury Sub-Committee,
	which looks forward 12 months at 30-day intervals. The measurement is based upon the projection of funds sold or purchased position,
	along with ratios and trends developed to measure dependence on purchased funds and core growth. Monthly reviews by management
	and quarterly reviews by the Asset and Liability Committee under prescribed policies and procedures are designed to ensure that
	we will maintain adequate levels of available funds.


	 


	It is our policy to
	manage our affairs so that liquidity needs are fully satisfied through normal Bank operations. That is, the Bank will manage its
	liquidity to minimize the need to make unplanned sales of assets or to borrow funds under emergency conditions. The Bank will use
	funding sources where the interest cost is relatively insensitive to market changes in the short run (periods of one year or less)
	to satisfy operating cash needs. The remaining normal funding will come from interest-sensitive liabilities, either deposits or
	borrowed funds. When the marginal cost of needed wholesale funding is lower than the cost of raising this funding in the retail
	markets, the Corporation may supplement retail funding with external funding sources such as:


	 






	1.


	Unsecured Fed Funds lines of credit with upstream correspondent banks (M&T Bank, Atlantic Central
	Banker’s Bank, Community Banker’s Bank).








	2.


	Secured advances with the FHLB of Atlanta, which are collateralized by eligible one to four family
	residential mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit, commercial real estate loans, and various securities. Cash may also be
	pledged as collateral.








	3.


	Secured line of credit with the Fed Discount Window for use in borrowing funds up to 90 days, using
	municipal securities as collateral.








	4.


	Brokered deposits, including CDs and money market funds, provide a method to generate deposits
	quickly. These deposits are strictly rate driven but often provide the most cost effective means of funding growth.




	 







	61










	 






	 






	5.


	One Way Buy CDARS funding – a form of brokered deposits that has become a viable supplement
	to brokered deposits obtained directly.




	 


	Management believes
	that we have adequate liquidity available to respond to current and anticipated liquidity demands and is not aware of any trends
	or demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that are likely to materially affect our ability to maintain liquidity at satisfactory
	levels.


	 



	Market Risk and Interest
	Sensitivity




	 



	Our primary market
	risk is interest rate fluctuation. Interest rate risk results primarily from the traditional banking activities that we engage
	in, such as gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest
	rates and consumer preferences affect the difference between the interest earned on our assets and the interest paid on our liabilities.
	Interest rate sensitivity refers to the degree that earnings will be impacted by changes in the prevailing level of interest rates.
	Interest rate risk arises from mismatches in the repricing or maturity characteristics between interest-bearing assets and liabilities.
	Management seeks to minimize fluctuating net interest margins, and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through
	periods of changing interest rates. Management uses interest sensitivity gap analysis and simulation models to measure and manage
	these risks. The interest rate sensitivity gap analysis assigns each interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability to a
	time frame reflecting its next repricing or maturity date. The differences between total interest-sensitive assets and liabilities
	at each time interval represent the interest sensitivity gap for that interval. A positive gap generally indicates that rising
	interest rates during a given interval will increase net interest income, as more assets than liabilities will reprice. A negative
	gap position would benefit us during a period of declining interest rates.


	 


	At June 30, 2013, we
	were asset sensitive.


	 


	Our interest rate risk
	management goals are:


	 







	·



	Ensure that the Board of Directors and senior management will provide effective oversight and ensure that risks are adequately
	identified, measured, monitored and controlled;









	·



	Enable dynamic measurement and management of interest rate risk;









	·



	Select strategies that optimize our ability to meet our long-range


	financial goals while maintaining interest rate risk
	within policy limits established by the Board of Directors;









	·



	Use both income and market value oriented techniques to select strategies that optimize the relationship between risk and return;
	and









	·



	Establish interest rate risk exposure limits for fluctuation in net interest income (“NII”), net income and economic
	value of equity.




	 


	In order to manage
	interest sensitivity risk, management formulates guidelines regarding asset generation and pricing, funding sources and pricing,
	and off-balance sheet commitments. These guidelines are based on management’s outlook regarding future interest rate movements,
	the state of the regional and national economy, and other financial and business risk factors. Management uses computer simulations
	to measure the effect on net interest income of various interest rate scenarios. Key assumptions used in the computer simulations
	include cash flows and maturities of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities, changes in asset volumes and pricing, and
	management’s capital plans. This modeling reflects interest rate changes and the related impact on net interest income over
	specified periods.


	 


	We evaluate the effect
	of a change in interest rates of +/-100 basis points to +/-400 basis points on both NII and Net Portfolio Value (“NPV”)
	/ Economic Value of Equity (“EVE”). We concentrate on NII rather than net income as long as NII remains the significant
	contributor to net income.


	 


	NII


	modeling
	allows


	management to view how changes in interest rates


	will affect the spread between the yield paid on assets and
	the cost of deposits and borrowed funds. Unlike traditional Gap modeling, NII modeling takes into account the different degree
	to which installments in the same repricing period will adjust to a change in interest rates. It also allows the use of different
	assumptions in a falling versus a rising rate environment. The period considered by the NII modeling is the next eight quarters.


	 


	NPV


	/ EVE


	modeling focuses on the change in the market value of equity. NPV / EVE is defined as the market value of assets less the market
	value of liabilities plus/minus the market value of any off-balance sheet positions. By effectively looking at the present value
	of all future cash flows on or off the balance sheet, NPV / EVE modeling takes a longer-term view of interest rate risk. This complements
	the shorter-term view of the NII modeling.

	Measures of NII at
	risk produced by simulation analysis are indicators of an institution’s short-term performance in alternative rate environments.
	These measures are typically based upon a relatively brief period, usually one year. They do not necessarily indicate the long-term
	prospects or economic value of the institution.






	 



	Capital Resources



	 


	The Bank and First
	United Corporation are subject to risk-based capital regulations, which were adopted and are monitored by federal banking regulators.
	These guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy and are based on an institution’s asset risk profile and off-balance
	sheet exposures, such as unused loan commitments and stand-by letters of credit. The regulatory guidelines require that a portion
	of total capital be Tier 1 capital, consisting of common shareholders’ equity, qualifying portion of trust issued preferred
	securities, and perpetual preferred stock, less goodwill and certain other deductions. The remaining capital, or Tier 2 capital,
	consists of elements such as subordinated debt, mandatory convertible debt, remaining portion of trust issued preferred securities,
	and grandfathered senior debt, plus the ALL, subject to certain limitations.


	 


	Under the risk-based
	capital regulations, banking organizations are required to maintain a minimum total risk-based capital ratio (total qualifying
	capital divided by risk-weighted assets) of 8% (10% for well capitalized banks), including a Tier 1 ratio of at least 4% (6% for
	well capitalized banks). The risk-based capital rules have been further supplemented by a leverage ratio, defined as Tier I capital
	divided by average assets, after certain adjustments. The minimum leverage ratio is 4% (5% for well capitalized banks) for banking
	organizations that do not anticipate significant growth and have well-diversified risk (including no undue interest rate risk exposure),
	excellent asset quality, high liquidity and good earnings, and between 4% and 5% for other institutions depending on their particular
	condition and growth plans. Regulators may require higher capital ratios when warranted by the particular circumstances or risk
	profile of a given banking organization. In the current regulatory environment, banking organizations must stay well capitalized
	in order to receive favorable regulatory treatment on acquisition and other expansion activities and favorable risk-based deposit
	insurance assessments. Our capital policy establishes guidelines meeting these regulatory requirements and takes into consideration
	current or anticipated risks as well as potential future growth opportunities.

	As of June 30, 2013,
	the most recent notification from the regulators categorized First United Corporation and the Bank as “well capitalized”
	under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. All capital ratios increased at June 30, 2013 when compared to December
	31, 2012.


	 


	Basel is a committee
	of central banks and bank regulators from major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines for use by each
	country’s regulators with the purpose of ensuring that financial institutions have adequate capital given the risk levels
	of assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments.


	 


	On July 2, 2013,
	the Federal Reserve approved final rules that substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to First United
	Corporation. The FDIC and the OCC have subsequently approved these rules. The final rules were adopted following the issuance of
	proposed rules by the Federal Reserve in June 2012, and implement the “Basel III” regulatory capital
	reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. “Basel III” refers to two consultative documents
	released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2009, the rules text released in December 2010, and loss absorbency
	rules issued in January 2011, which include significant changes to bank capital, leverage and liquidity requirements.


	 







	63










	 






	 


	The rules include new
	risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which would be phased in from 2015 to 2019, and would refine the definition of what constitutes
	“capital” for purposes of calculating those ratios. The new minimum capital level requirements applicable to the Corporation
	under the final rules would be: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% (increased
	from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions.
	The final rules also establish a “capital conservation buffer” above the new regulatory minimum capital requirements,
	which must consist entirely of common equity Tier 1 capital. The capital conservation buffer will be phased-in over four years
	beginning on January 1, 2016, as follows: the maximum buffer will be 0.625% of risk-weighted assets for 2016, 1.25% for 2017, 1.875%
	for 2018, and 2.5% for 2019 and thereafter. This will result in the following minimum ratios beginning in 2019: (i) a common equity
	Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. Under the final rules,
	institutions are subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if
	its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that
	could be utilized for such actions.


	 


	Basel III provided
	discretion for regulators to impose an additional buffer, the “countercyclical buffer,” of up to 2.5% of common equity
	Tier 1 capital to take into account the macro-financial environment and periods of excessive credit growth. However, the final
	rules permit the countercyclical buffer to be applied only to “advanced approach banks” ( i.e. , banks with $250 billion
	or more in total assets or $10 billion or more in total foreign exposures), which currently excludes the Corporation. The final
	rules also implement revisions and clarifications consistent with Basel III regarding the various components of
	Tier 1 capital, including common equity, unrealized gains and losses, as well as certain instruments that will no longer qualify
	as Tier 1 capital, some of which will be phased out over time. However, the final rules provide that small depository institution
	holding companies with less than $15 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2009 (which includes the Corporation) will be able
	to permanently include non-qualifying instruments that were issued and included in Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital prior to May 19, 2010
	in additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital until they redeem such instruments or until the instruments mature.


	 


	The final rules also
	contain revisions to the prompt corrective action framework, which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions
	if their capital levels begin to show signs of weakness. These revisions take effect January 1, 2015. Under the prompt corrective
	action requirements, which are designed to complement the capital conservation buffer, insured depository institutions will be
	required to meet the following increased capital level requirements in order to qualify as “well capitalized:” (i)
	a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8% (increased from 6%); (iii) a total capital
	ratio of 10% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% (increased from 4%).


	 


	The final rules set
	forth certain changes for the calculation of risk-weighted assets, which we will be required to utilize beginning January 1, 2015.
	The standardized approach final rule utilizes an increased number of credit risk exposure categories and risk weights, and also
	addresses: (i) an alternative standard of creditworthiness consistent with Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act Act; (ii) revisions
	to recognition of credit risk mitigation; (iii) rules for risk weighting of equity exposures and past due loans; (iv) revised capital
	treatment for derivatives and repo-style transactions; and (v) disclosure requirements for top-tier banking organizations with
	$50 billion or more in total assets that are not subject to the “advance approach rules” that apply to banks with greater
	than $250 billion in consolidated assets. Based on our current capital composition and levels, we believe that we would be in compliance
	with the requirements as set forth in the final rules if they were presently in effect.


	 


	The total risk based
	capital ratios of First United Corporation include $38.2 million of junior subordinated debentures (“TPS Debentures”)
	which qualified as Tier 1 capital at June 30, 2013, under guidance issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.


	 



	In
	January 2009, p

	ursuant to the Treasury’s Troubled Asset Relief Program Capital Purchase Program, First United Corporation
	sold 30,000 shares of its Series A Preferred Stock and a Warrant to purchase 326,323 shares of its common stock, having an exercise
	price of $13.79 per share, to the Treasury for an aggregate purchase price of $30 million. The proceeds from this transaction count
	as Tier 1 capital and the Warrant qualifies as tangible common equity. Information about the terms of these securities is provided
	in Note 10 to the

	Consolidated Financial Statements.

	The
	terms of the Series A Preferred Stock call for the payment, if declared by the Board of Directors of First United Corporation,
	of a quarterly cash dividend on February 15

	th

	, May 15

	th

	, August 15

	th

	and November 15

	th

	of each year. At the request of the Reserve Bank, First United Corporation deferred the payment of cash dividends on the Series
	A Preferred Stock beginning with the payment that was due on November 15, 2010. As of June 30, 2013, this deferral election remained
	in effect and dividends of $.4 million per quarterly dividend period continue to accrue. First United Corporation will be required
	to pay all accrued and unpaid dividends if and when the Board of Directors declares and pays the next quarterly cash dividend.

	Management cannot predict whether or when the Board of Directors will resume quarterly cash dividends on the Series A Preferred
	Stock. First United Corporation’s ability to make dividend payments in the future will depend primarily on our earnings in
	future periods.


	 



	On
	December 15, 2010, also at the request of the Reserve Bank, the Board of Directors of First United Corporation elected to
	defer quarterly interest payments under the

	TPS Debentures

	beginning with the payments that
	were due in March 2011. As of June 30, 2013, this deferral election remained in effect and cumulative deferred interest was
	approximately $5.5 million, which has been fully accrued and must be paid in full when the Board of Directors elects to
	terminate the deferral.

	First United Corporation’s ability to resume quarterly interest payments will depend
	primarily on our earnings in future periods. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to if or when First United Corporation
	will resume the payment of interest under the TPS Debentures.


	 


	In connection with,
	and as a result of, the aforementioned deferrals, the Board of Directors of First United Corporation voted to suspend the declaration
	of quarterly cash dividends on the common stock until further notice. The payment of cash dividends on the common stock is at the
	discretion of the Board of Directors and is dependent on our earnings in future periods. In addition, cash dividends on the common
	stock may be paid only if all accrued and unpaid interest due under the TPS Debentures and all accrued and unpaid dividends due
	under the Series A Preferred Stock have been paid in full. There can be no assurance as to if or when First United Corporation
	will resume the payment of cash dividends on the common stock.


	 



	Contractual Obligations, Commitments
	and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	Loan commitments are
	made to accommodate the financial needs of our customers. Letters of credit commit us to make payments on behalf of customers when
	certain specified future events occur. The credit risks inherent in loan commitments and letters of credit are essentially the
	same as those involved in extending loans to customers, and these arrangements are subject to our normal credit policies. Loan
	commitments and letters of credit totaled $91.2 million and $1.2 million, respectively, at June 30, 2013, compared to $87.1 million
	and $1.3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2012. We are not a party to any other off-balance sheet arrangements.


	 


	See Note 11 to the
	consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report for further disclosure on Borrowed Funds. There have been
	no other significant changes to contractual obligations as presented at December 31, 2012.


	 









	Item 3.




	Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk





	 


	Our primary market
	risk is interest rate fluctuation and we have procedures in place to evaluate and mitigate this risk. This market risk and our
	procedures are described above in Item 2 of Part I of this report under the caption “

	Market Risk and Interest Sensitivity

	”,
	and in Item 7 of Part II of First United Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 under
	the caption “Market Risk and Interest Sensitivity”. Management believes that no material changes in our procedures
	used to evaluate and mitigate these risks have occurred since December 31, 2012. We believe the investment portfolio restructuring
	has better positioned the Corporation for a rising interest rate environment.


	 







	Item 4.




	Controls and Procedures





	 


	We maintain disclosure
	controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities
	Exchange Act of 1934 with the SEC, such as this Quarterly Report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods
	specified in those rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the
	Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), as appropriate, to allow for timely
	decisions regarding required disclosure. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable,
	not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect
	the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. These inherent
	limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple
	error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more
	people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions
	about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals
	under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree
	of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


	 







	65










	 






	 


	An evaluation of the
	effectiveness of these disclosure controls as of June 30, 2013 was carried out under the supervision and with the participation
	of Management, including the CEO and the CFO. Based on that evaluation, Management, including the CEO and the CFO, has concluded
	that our disclosure controls and procedures are, in fact, effective at the reasonable assurance level.


	 


	During the first six
	months of 2013, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably
	likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	, May 15

	th

	, August 15

	th

	of each year. At the request of the Reserve Bank, First United Corporation has not declared or paid cash dividends on its Series
	A Preferred Stock since August 15, 2010. Dividends of $.4 million per dividend period continue to accrue, aggregating $4.4 million
	at June 30, 2013. First United Corporation will be required to pay all accrued and unpaid dividends if and when the Board of Directors
	declares the next quarterly cash dividend.

	1.           I
	have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of First United Corporation;


	 


	2.           Based
	on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
	to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to
	the period covered by this report;


	 


	3.           Based
	on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material

	4.           The
	registrant’s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures
	(as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange
	Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:


	 






	a.


	Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
	supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known
	to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;




	 






	b.


	Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed
	under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
	financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;




	 






	c.


	Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions
	about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on
	such evaluation; and




	 






	d.


	Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
	the registrant’s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant’s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report)
	that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant’s internal control over financial
	reporting; and




	 


	5.           The
	registrant’s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over
	financial reporting, to the registrant’s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant’s board of directors (or
	persons performing the equivalent functions):


	 






	a.


	All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting
	which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
	information; and




	 






	b.


	Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant’s
	internal control over financial reporting.
