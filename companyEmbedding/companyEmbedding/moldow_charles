In this new era, the companies best positioned to disrupt or even displace the Financial Services incumbents will develop against four key consumer trends: Simplification, Transparency, Analytics, & Reduce Friction.Charles MoldowGeneral partner, foundation capital































Friends Don't Let Friends Use Banks
Young people are particularly disdainful of banks. Seven out of ten would rather go to the dentist than listen to what banks are saying. One-third believe they won't need a bank at all. Half are counting on tech startups to overhaul the way banks work. And three-quarters would be more excited about a new financial services offering from a tech company than from their own national bank.




 





I believe marketplace lending will increasingly encroach upon – and take market share from – traditional banking. I believe this will happen across lending (consumer, real estate, SMB, purchase finance), payments, insurance, equity and beyond.Charles MoldowGeneral partner, foundation capital































Big Ideas in Financial Technology: Opportunities Abound
When incumbents seem not only too big to fail but also too slow to react, innovative technology companies are looking at significant opportunities.




 





Bill Gates was right two decades ago when he observed banking is necessary but banks are not. Marketplace lending is now poised to demonstrate how accurate that observation was. Yes, banking is still largely being provided by banks. But marketplace lending is changing that.Charles MoldowGeneral partner, foundation capital































Marketplace Lending is Disintermediating the Borrowing & Investing Experience
This industry held, and still holds, such tremendous potential: a giant market with incumbents that are universally disliked, offering outmoded products and services. I believe there exists a new model with the potential to displace that system. The marketplace model cuts several links out of today's banking chain.

Charles joined Foundation Capital in 2005, with a background in general management, sales, marketing, product management, and business development.
Before coming to Foundation Capital, he was part of two teams that successfully built companies from early start-up through greater than $100 million in sales and exits near or above a billion dollars. Charles has made thirteen investments since joining Foundation, of which four have been acquired: PowerSet to Microsoft; Xoopit to Yahoo!; Adwhirl to Google; and, Weblistic to Spot Runner. Charles works closely with his current portfolio, which includes: AdRoll, Bancbox, CloudOn, Copious, Everyday Health, Fanhood, LendingClub, Motif Investing, Pixazza, Refresh, RevelTouch, and SunRun.
Prior to Foundation, Charles spent five years with Tellme Networks and was a member of the founding executive team. While there, he led Tellme in raising one of the largest private financing rounds in the country post-Internet bubble, adding $125 million in cash to the company balance sheet during tough market conditions in August, 2000. Tellme was acquired by Microsoft in 2007 for $760 million.
Prior to Tellme, Charles was a member of the founding team of Internet access provider @Home Network. In 1996, he established the @Media division; and over the ensuing three years helped establish @Media as the leading broadband media provider. In 1997 the company went public. A year later, Charles assisted in the $7 billion acquisition of Excite Network. After the merger, he became General Manager of Matchlogic, the $80 million division focused on interactive advertising.
Charles’ entrepreneurial penchant dates back to 1989 when he co-founded OnTime Guide which replaced the OAG Pocket Flight Guide as the must-have resource for frequent business travelers and PrimeTime Partners, which attempted to establish a new category of self liquidating promotions on behalf of advertisers and direct marketers. Prior to that, Charles spent three years in the Mergers and Acquisitions practice at Merrill Lynch.
Charles holds a BS degree from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and received his MBA from Harvard University. He lives in the Bay Area with his wife and four children.
