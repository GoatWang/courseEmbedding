Wall Street's 'fear gauge'--the VIX--just logged its second-lowest close in history
              
              One measure of fear on Wall Street on Friday booked its second-lowest finish ever, according to FactSet data. The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, wrapped up the session down 2.3% at 9.36, marking the lowest close since the so-called "fear gauge" ended at 9.31 in December 1993 at 9.31. The gauge flirted with the lowest reading in history at 9.30, before bucking up a touch. The VIX is based on options contracts on the S&P 500 30-days in the future. The metric's historical average is 20 and it has continued to mostly slump in 2017, with the majority of its readings below 10 being put in this year, as stocks have reached repeated records since President Donald Trump's Election Day victory in November. That dynamic, lower readings for VIX and elevated stock prices, have suggested to market participants that investors are becoming increasingly complacent. Friday's VIX slide came as many major equity benchmarks closed lower, but not far from records, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average , the S&P 500 index , and the Nasdaq Composite Index , which all finished less than 1% shy of all-time closing highs.

Newspaper publisher McClatchy Co. reports Q2 loss, but growth in digital business
              
              Newspaper publisher McClatchy Co.  reported second-quarter earnings before the market opened on Friday and said digital-only subscribers grew nearly 14% from the previous year's first quarter. The company reported a net loss of $37.4 million, or $4.91 per share for the second quarter, compared with a loss of $14.7 million, or $1.89 per share during the same quarter a year ago. The adjusted loss per share was 79 cents. McClatchy's revenue hit $225.1 million in the quarter, down 7% compared with the prior year. Total advertising revenue revenues were down 11% compared with the same quarter last year, while digital-only advertising revenue grew by 10%. The company said that the rate of decline in total advertising slowed in the quarter. "As I have mentioned before, achieving a normalized operating environment takes some time in digital transitions," McClatchy Chief Executive Craig Forman said in a statement. "While we continue to see strong headwinds in print advertising, we also are seeing our digital efforts in all aspects of the business moderate those headwinds." McClatchy's average total unique visitors to the company's online products grew close to 15% to 66 million in the quarter. Shares of McClatchy were inactive in morning trade on Friday, but have declined more than 34% in the year to date, while the S&P 500 index  have gained more than 10%.

Polaris beats profit and sales expectation as ORV and snowmobile growth helps boost results
              
              Polaris Industries Inc.  reported Thursday a second-quarter net profit that fell to $62.0 million, or 97 cents a share, from $71.2 million, or $1.09 a share, in the same period a year ago. The off-road vehicle maker said adjusted earnings per share came to $1.16, above the FactSet consensus of $1.08. Revenue rose to $1.36 billion from $1.13 billion, beating the FactSet consensus of $1.26 billion. Off-road and snowmobile sales rose to $845.5 million from $799.3 million, above the FactSet consensus of $761.7 million, while motorcycle sales fell 13% to $198 million but beat expectations of $192 million. The company raised its 2017 sales growth outlook to 12% to 14% from 10% to 13% and its adjusted EPS outlook to $4.35 to $4.50 from $4.25 to $4.50. "The powersports industry remained very competitive and headwinds persist, but we were encouraged by the return to growth in our Side-by-Side business and continued strength and aggressive share gains for Indian Motorcycles," said Chief Executive Scott Wine. On Wednesday, the company said it recalled 25,600 ATVs after reports of fuel leaks and fires. The stock, which wasn't active in premarket trade, has rallied 12.2% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 10.5%.

Tesla stock initiated as neutral/high risk at Citi with price target 10% above current price
              
              Citigroup initiated coverage of electric car maker Tesla Inc.  Thursday, with a neutral/high risk rating and $357 stock price target. That's equal to about 10% upside from its current level. "We're positive on Tesla's position as a Car of the Future leader and view the upside case to still be significant, however, we prefer to wait for a better entry point either through: (a) A stronger balance sheet, which in our view would more favorably tilt the 12-month risk/reward equation, all-else-equal; or (b) convincing signs of a smooth Model 3 ramp with limited Model S cannibalization," analyst Itay Michaeli wrote in a note. The analyst said he is "fundamentally bullish" on Tesla, but that both bull and bear cases for the stock have merit. On the bull side, the company has had initial product success, brand appeal, speed of innovation and tech/software leadership," he wrote. The next 12 months rely on Tesla achieving Model 3 conversions and meeting margin goals, while continuing to cement its leadership in self-driving. Tesla shares were slightly lower premarket, but have gained 52% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 10.5%.

Polaris recalls tens of thousands of ATVs after reports of fire, fuel leaks
              
              Recreational vehicles company Polaris Industries Inc.  recalled about 25,600 all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) after reports of fuel leaks and fires. The recall involves 2014 Sportsman 570 model ATVs sold from April 2014 through May 2017 for $6,500 to $7,700 in several colors, which were made by Polaris in the U.S., according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The recall follows 30 reports of fuel leaks and four incidents involving a fire, although no injuries had been reported. "Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled ATVs and contact Polaris to schedule a free repair," the company said in a statement. "Polaris is contacting all known purchasers directly." The stock, which was up 1.2% in afternoon trade, has rallied 12.9% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 10.4%.

Herbalife Appoints Richard Goudis As CEO
By Ted Nuyten
June 1, 2017
 


Premier global nutrition company, Herbalife (NYSE: HLF), today announced the official transition of Richard P. Goudis as the new Chief Executive Officer (CEO), in succession to Michael O. Johnson, who will now assume the position of Executive Chairman of the Company.
With his passions grounded in innovation, education and training, Goudis will set the strategy for Herbalife Nutrition, overseeing all aspects of the Company’s growth initiatives and ensuring the Company continues to be recognized worldwide as a leading nutrition company.
Goudis will guide the overall Herbalife Nutrition business strategy in the 94 countries where the Company operates. He will also be responsible for strengthening and increasing the base of Independent distributors and consumers, as well as the development of new product lines with broad scientific support.
“This is an exciting time to be leading such a dynamic team of dedicated professionals who everyday position our company for further innovation and growth. Our talented global distributors bring innovative products to market that help customers live healthy, active lifestyles, truly making us the premier global nutrition company,” said Richard P. Goudis, CEO, Herbalife Nutrition.
Goudis, a recognized leader in the nutrition industry, has more than 18 years of experience in the field of nutrition with 13 years as part of the Herbalife Nutrition management team serving as COO since 2010 and CFO from 2004 to 2009.
In his role as COO, he was responsible for building a global infrastructure that created competitive advantages including the oversight of worldwide manufacturing operations, product development, quality assurance and control, supply chain and strategic sourcing, warehousing and logistics, human resources, Information technology, security and safety, and regional finance and operations functions.
During Goudis’ tenure as COO, the Company expanded its Herbalife Innovation and Manufacturing (H.I.M.) facilities to five locations around the world ensuring the highest levels of quality control for the company’s nutrition products. Under Mr. Goudis’ management, Herbalife Nutrition also grew its employee base to more than 8,000 people worldwide.
The Company’s competitive advantage and success in the nutrition industry is based on science and education – science-based products and the education provided to customers by its distributors otherwise known as the “Distributor Difference.” This difference has become more evident in recent years with retail stores closing at what seems to be an accelerated rate. The educated and trained distributors meet face-to-face with their customers, providing personalized nutrition and fitness services.
Newly appointed Executive Chairman Michael O. Johnson draws from his extensive working history with Goudis to say, “The Board and I could not have picked a more qualified candidate to lead this Company forward, we look forward to supporting him as he leads Herbalife Nutrition well into the future.”

Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) announced the official transition of Richard P. Goudis as the new Chief Executive Officer (CEO), in succession to Michael O. Johnson, who will now assume the position of Executive Chairman of the Company.
With his passions grounded in innovation, education and training, Goudis will set the strategy for Herbalife Nutrition, overseeing all aspects of the Company’s growth initiatives and ensuring the Company continues to be recognized worldwide as a leading nutrition company.

“This is an exciting time to be leading such a dynamic team of dedicated professionals who everyday position our company for further innovation and growth. Our talented global distributors bring innovative products to market that help customers live healthy, active lifestyles, truly making us the premier global nutrition company,” said Richard P.

Under Mr. Goudis’ management, Herbalife Nutrition also grew its employee base to more than 8,000 people worldwide.
The Company’s competitive advantage and success in the nutrition industry is based on science and education – science-based products and the education provided to customers by its distributors otherwise known as the “Distributor Difference.” This difference has become more evident in recent years with retail stores closing at what seems to be an accelerated rate. The educated and trained distributors meet face-to-face with their customers, providing personalized nutrition and fitness services.
Newly appointed Executive Chairman Michael O. Johnson draws from his extensive working history with Goudis to say, “The Board and I could not have picked a more qualified candidate to lead this Company forward, we look forward to supporting him as he leads Herbalife Nutrition well into the future.”
Shares of Herbalife are currently trading at $73.42, up $1.64 or 2.28%. HLF has a 1-year high of $73.61 and a 1-year low of $47.62. The stock’s 50-day moving average is $66.73 and its 200-day moving average is $57.09.
