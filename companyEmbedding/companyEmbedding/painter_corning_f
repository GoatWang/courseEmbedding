Ask how they plan to clean your walls, if at all, before getting started. A high-quality company will thoroughly prepare a wall so that the paint will lay smoothly and last a long time.Can I ask for references?Yes. A well-established company will have more experience and likely more references for you to reach out to than a new company that's just getting off the ground. Be sure to ask for references so you can speak to former customers about their experience working with the painter. When speaking to these people, ask about:

Whether they had issues with the crew
If the painters were messy or neat
How the paint has held up since the project was completed
Do I have a choice of what kind I paint I want a painter to use?The quality of the paint will affect how good the walls look when the project is completed. If your contractor says they plan on using a paint you don't like, feel free to request an alternative.How important is a trained painter?If the contractor makes a point to train new hires on safety techniques as well as quality standards on the job, you're probably in good hands.What are some risks with hiring a painter?Unfortunately, there are plenty of cases where a painter has stolen items from a home or caused damage to the house or injury to the homeowner. Subcontractors may not be as skilled as employees, and the contractor you're hiring may not have much experience working with them, making them more of a risk.

Additionally, ask if the painters are employees or subcontractors, and what the screening or hiring process is like.Do I have a right to know who will be doing the painting?If the person you are speaking with says he or she will not be personally supervising the project, ask who will be, what their role is, and how long they've been with the company.Does a painter need a warranty?Not offering a warranty is a red flag, and you may want to be cautious about hiring a company that doesn't provide one. If they have a warranty, ask how long it lasts, and what it covers. Additionally, you'll want to get the warranty in writing should you need to refer to it later.Does a painter need to have insurance?It's never a good idea to hire a contractor whose business isn't properly insured. Ask both about comprehensive business liability insurance and workers' compensation, and don't be hesitant to ask for proof. If you are unsure of the validity of the insurance, you can also call the insurance company to double-check that it is an active policy.What questions should I ask a painter before I hire them?
Do you have insurance?
Do you have a warranty?
Who, specifically, will be in my house, and can I trust them?
What kind of training do your employees receive?
What kind of paint will you use?
How long have you been in business, and do you have references?
How much wall prep is included in the price?
Are you active in the community and are you involved in any trade organizations?
What are the red flags to look for in a painters quote?On the other hand, be skeptical of any price points that seem unfathomably low. There could be a reason their prices are below the industry norm - perhaps their quality standards are uncommonly low, too.See more Tips & AdviceDidn't find what you were looking for?magnifying glassDid You Know?Painting can be a significant undertaking, whether you're painting just one room or an entire home. While some people like to take on this project themselves, many choose to hire professionals to ensure the task is completed correctly.Types of Interior PaintMatte PaintMatte paint doesn't have a shiny quality when it dries, which many homeowners prefer for their interior walls. This is the most popular style of paint for homes. It covers up irregularities in the wall well but is also easily blemished.Matte Enamel PaintMatte enamel paint has all the positive qualities of matte paint but will last longer and isn't scuffed as easily.Gloss PaintGloss paint will dry with a shine to it and is the second-most popular choice for interior wall paint. The shiny quality highlights imperfections in a surface, so people tend to stay away from it when painting wood.Semi-Gloss PaintSemi-gloss is also shiny but less so than gloss paint. It's more commonly used on trim than on walls.Satin PaintSatin falls somewhere between gloss and matte in terms of shininess. It will highlight imperfections well, like gloss, but is easy to clean.Eggshell PaintEggshell is also between gloss and matte on the shininess scale, but it won't highlight imperfections quite as much as satin, semi-gloss, or gloss.Types of Exterior PaintExterior paints have similar choices for finishes as interior paints, but the pros and cons can be different for outdoor use.Gloss PaintThough gloss paint will make imperfections easily seen, it will also hold up to the elements the best. This paint is best suited for areas of a home or building that are frequently used, like door frames.Semi-Gloss PaintSemi-gloss paint is similarly long-lasting but isn't as shiny as gloss.Satin PaintSatin paint is commonly used for siding but will display irregularities underneath if the siding isn't in good shape.Flat PaintFlat paint is the best choice if painting over siding that has many dents, scrapes, or other imperfections.Oil-Based PaintIf you're repainting a home that has been previously painted with oil-based paint, your best bet is to stick with this option. Water-based paint layered over old oil-based paint will peel easily.Water-Based PaintWater-based paint, or latex paint, dries quickly and cleans up easily, making it the preferred paint for a home's exterior. It will also expand when warm and contract when cool, which means it will hold up in all types of weather.Hiring a PainterWhen embarking on a project as big as painting your home, it's important to know ahead of time what kind of quality you can expect from the painters you hire. Don't settle for the first one you find or the cheapest option. Instead, do your homework to be sure that you hire a trustworthy professional who knows how to paint a house well.The first thing you'll do when hiring a painter is request quotes from three or four in your area. If you reach out to too many, you'll wind up wasting time narrowing down your list; too few and you may not end up with the best quality or right price.The typical price range for an interior paint job is between $400 and $4,120, with the average falling around $1,670, depending on the scope of the project and paint requests. It will typically cost around $380 to $790 to paint a typical 10-by​-12 foot room.The cost to paint a home's exterior is a little higher: between $730 and $5,600, with an average of $2,624. The typical home of between 500 and 1,500 square feet will generally cost between $1,000 and $3,000, but this will change depending on the number of stories and home location.If a quote seems high, ask the contractor what is increasing the price point. Perhaps it's something that can be negotiated, or maybe this business is just overpricing their services. On the other hand, be skeptical of any price points that seem unfathomably low. There could be a reason their prices are below the industry norm - perhaps their quality standards are uncommonly low, too.Once you have quotes, conduct an over-the-phone interview with your prospects. Some important questions to ask your painter include:1. Do you have insurance?It's never a good idea to hire a contractor whose business isn't properly insured. Ask both about comprehensive business liability insurance and workers' compensation, and don't be hesitant to ask for proof. If you are unsure of the validity of the insurance, you can also call the insurance company to double-check that it is an active policy.2. Do you have a warranty?Not offering a warranty is a red flag, and you may want to be cautious about hiring a company that doesn't provide one. If they have a warranty, ask how long it lasts, and what it covers. Additionally, you'll want to get the warranty in writing should you need to refer to it later.3. Who, specifically, will be in my house, and can I trust them?You always have a right to know who will be entering your home. If the person you are speaking with says he or she will not be personally supervising the project, ask who will be, what their role is, and how long they've been with the company.Also, don't be afraid to ask if the painters are trustworthy people. Unfortunately, there are plenty of cases where a painter has stolen items from a home or caused damage to the house or injury to the homeowner. Subcontractors may not be as skilled as employees, and the contractor you're hiring may not have much experience working with them, making them more of a risk. Additionally, ask if the painters are employees or subcontractors, and what the screening or hiring process is like. If the company conducts background checks, that's a good sign. 4. What kind of training do your employees receive?If the contractor makes a point to train new hires on safety techniques as well as quality standards on the job, you're probably in good hands.5. What kind of paint will you use?The quality of the paint will affect how good the walls look when the project is completed. If your contractor says they plan on using a paint you don't like, feel free to request an alternative.6. How long have you been in business, and do you have references?A well-established company will have more experience and likely more references for you to reach out to than a new company that's just getting off the ground. Be sure to ask for references so you can speak to former customers about their experience working with the painter. When speaking to these people, ask about:Whether they had issues with the crewIf the painters were messy or neatHow the paint has held up since the project was completed7. How much wall prep is included in the price?For a long-lasting paint job, a clean wall is crucial. Ask how they plan to clean your walls, if at all, before getting started. A high-quality company will thoroughly prepare a wall so that the paint will lay smoothly and last a long time.8. Are you active in the community and are you involved in any trade organizations?Community involvement shows the company:Is established and well-knownCares about its customersIs confident in their workAdditionally, being active in trade organizations indicates it is likely up to date on the latest industry best practices and that the company is dedicated to its trade. Also, a Better Bureau Business membership demonstrates the company is stable, confident, and willing to let potential customers check them out before hiring them.Trade Organizations for PaintersIf the company you hire is involved in a trade organization, it shows they take pride in their work, and are dedicated to providing quality service. Some top trade organizations painters might be a part of include:Painting and Decorating Contractors of AmericaPDCA connects painters and home decorators through local chapters and councils. The organization also provides webinars, educational videos, and podcasts so members can stay up to date on the latest best practices and news.American Coatings AssociationThe ACA doesn't focus on best practices so much as it does on best products. The nonprofit is dedicated to research and development of high-quality paint products as well as sustainability issues.Finishing Contractors AssociationThe FCA has members that are painters as well as professionals who focus on flooring, drywall, and other elements to home construction and renovation.Better Business BureauThe BBB isn't a painter-specific group but rather an organization that is dedicated to ensuring that consumers can access information about anyone they do business with. The BBB also rates companies based on a Standards of Trust scale, which goes from A+ to F. A company doesn't have to be a member to get a grade, and it's a good idea to check to see how your contractor is scored as well as its membership status.

Merv Corning
1926-2006

In Loving Memory of Merv Corning. Merv Passed Away on September 25th, 2006. We’ll miss him. Creator of Esterline’s Heritage of the Air Collection of WWI aviation paintings, Merv has been making realist art on a range of subjects close to his heart, from airplanes to automobiles, landscapes to portraits, since 1945.
“My dad and uncle owned a Waco open-cockpit biplane, and flying about in that airplane at the tender age of eight left an indelible impression indeed. I’ve flown many hours since those less complicated times, in all kinds of aircraft, but nothing will ever match the thrill of lifting off in that Waco. I remember the sound of wind in wire, the hot fuel and oil smells, the clattering engine noise and the lurching, swooping, sometime weightless feeling of flight.” Corning has the gift of translating his feeling for his subject into paint. “My goal …is the marriage of the airplane, authentic in every detail, with the rich, sometimes scarred landscapes over which these young warriors flew. I place the viewer in the air, beside these beautiful ancient machines, to experience the sensation of flight…”
In addition to the 43 watercolors of heroic WWI pilots and planes he originally painted for Leach International (now a subsidiary of Esterline Corporation), Corning is equally well known for his portraits of players commissioned by the National Football League. As recently as 2003, he was presented the R. G. Smith Award for Excellence in Naval Aviation at the National Museum of Naval Aviation in Pensacola, Florida. Corning is currently creating the final watercolor in Esterline’s Heritage of the Air series. That collection, along with a special display on “Merv Corning and the Artist’s Process,” will be exhibited at The Museum of Flight in Seattle, opening February 2, 2006.
Mervin Allen Corning, born June 16, 1926, in Santa Ana, California, joined the Merchant Marines at age 17 and remained in that service until the end of World War II. Though he had been drawing since childhood, he began his career as an illustrator for Kleer, a Bay Area drug company chain. In less than two years, Corning worked as an art director for L.C. Cole, a prominent San Francisco advertising agency. In 1949, he became the men’s fashion artist for the Broadway Department Stores in Los Angeles. In 1953 Corning’s versatility led him to Studio Artist Inc., a professional group of artists committed to providing a complete art service for advertising agencies and their clients, which included TWA, Lockheed, Ford-Mercury, Sunkist and North American. Starting as an illustrator, he became a partner and eventually president of the corporation.
It was during his tenure at Studio Artist that Leach International commissioned Corning to paint the Heritage of the Air series of WWI watercolors. What started as a set of four paintings to be used in a Leach ad campaign with Aviation Week and Space Technology magazine became, due to their enormous popularity, a series of 45 paintings that spanned a decade, from 1959 to 1970. (Since that time, two more of Corning’s paintings have been added to the collection.) In 1965 Corning began a long association with the Automobile Club of Southern California, creating some 16 covers for their Westways magazine. The NFL first contacted Corning in 1966-67 for watercolor illustration work; their relationship would span 30 years, with Corning becoming the official National Football League Super Bowl artist in 1977. In 1968 Corning had his first one-man show at the Nut Tree Gallery in Vacaville, California.
Merv Corning retired from Studio Artist in 1969, devoting his time exclusively to fine art painting and commissions. His work has been extensively shown and collected worldwide: the Smithsonian Institution’s National Air and Space Museum, the U.S. Air Force Museum and Archives, the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C., the Royal Air Force Museum in England, the National Museum of Naval Aviation in Pensacola, Peterson Automotive Museum in Los Angeles and the Football Hall of Fame, as well as a great number of galleries across the country. Corning is the recipient of many awards, including “ The Dillon Lauritzen Memorial Award” (1975) from the Art Director’s Club of Los Angeles for the best painting of the year, “Artist of the West Gold Medal Award” (1989) from the American Indian and Cowboy Artists and the previously mentioned “R.G. Smith Award for Excellence in Aviation Art” (2003) from the National Museum of Aviation Art. More than 65 publications, such as Life, Time, Reader’s Digest, National Geographic, American Artist, Aviation, Aviation Heritage and Aviation History, have reproduced Merv Corning’s artwork. His exploration of other art forms led to his handmade aircraft lithographs, which were published by Circle Fine Art Corporation.
Represented by Young’s Gallery in Los Olivos, California, Merv Corning resided and continued to paint in Solvang, California until his death in 2006 at the age of 80.
