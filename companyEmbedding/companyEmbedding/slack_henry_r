HENRY RICHMOND SLACK (HRS)















 HENRY RICHMOND SLACK (HRS)
 
 
 
 
 
Henry (Hank) Slack was until recently Chairman of Terra Industries (NYSE), an international nitrogen-based fertilizer company.  (After a lengthy takeover battle, Terra, a $5.5 bil company, was acquired by CF Industries at a premium of 235% to its unaffected price).   
 
 
 
HRS is a director of E. Oppenheimer and Son International Limited and on its Investment Committee.  He is the senior partner of Quarterwatch, LLC.  In addition, he is a director of several other non-listed companies mostly based in the United Kingdom.
 
 
 
HRS was born in Dayton, Ohio, on 1 February, 1950.  He attended secondary school in Switzerland and Groton School in Massachusetts.  He graduated from Princeton University in 1972 with a BA degree in history, and soon afterwards went to Johannesburg to join the Anglo American Corporation as a trainee in the finance division.
 
 
 
In 1974 he became personal assistant to then Deputy Chairman of Anglo American, and shortly after in 1975, he was appointed personal assistant to the Chairman, Harry Oppenheimer, a position HRS held in one form or another until Mr. Oppenheimer's retirement in 1982.  During this period, HRS became especially involved in the North American activities of the Anglo Group.  In 1981 he joined the board of Engelhard Minerals and Chemicals Corporation.  He was appointed to the board of Anglo American in 1983 and soon thereafter joined its Executive Committee.  Following this he was actively involved in the full range of the corporation’s mining, financial and industrial activities worldwide.
 
 
 
HRS joined the board of Minorco in 1981.  In 1988 he was appointed Executive Director of Minorco in charge of North America.  During this time he played a significant role in Minorco’s bid for Consolidated Gold Fields. In 1992 HRS was appointed Chief Executive of Minorco, following which he oversaw the culmination of Minorco's transformation from an investment holding company into one of the world's leading operating natural resources groups.  As Chief Executive and within the sectors of base metals, gold and aggregates, he oversaw the purchase of new mining operations, expansion programs for existing ones, and exploration programs of approximately $4 billion. 
 
 
 
 
 
From 1981 – 1987 HRS was a director of Salomon Brothers Inc. (NYSE), and more recently SABMiller plc.  During his twenty-eight years with Anglo American and Minorco, 
 
HRS was a board member of numerous subsidiaries and associated companies of the Group worldwide.  He remained on the board of Engelhard Corporation until the company was purchased by BASF in 2007.  HRS continues to have a close and working relationship with the Oppenheimer family.  He is a Director of the family firm and a member of its Investment Committee.  
 
 
 
From 1985 to 2000, HRS was a trustee of Groton School and inter alia in the 1980’s of the Urban Foundation and Redhill School in South Africa.  He is currently a member of the Advisory Council of the Willow School, and a trustee of the Upper Raritan Watershed Association in New Jersey.  HRS enjoys skiing, tennis, riding and fishing.
 
 
He is married to Sarah Lawrence Slack.  Together they have six children, two of whom are still under the age of 21.  HRS and his family reside in Peapack, New Jersey.

Title: Trustee
               Company: Upper Raritan Watershed Association
Job Details
               URWA was the first non-profit environmental group in New Jersey to obtain and implement geographic information systems (G.I.S.) technology. Assisted by the Cook College Remote Sensing Center, URWA established the first watershed-wide computer database in the state. The technology is a vital component of our programs and provides advanced computer analysis to local governments, and statewide initiatives. In the late 1990's URWA implemented the Non-Profit G.I.S. Users Community, a training and problem-solving program to assist other environmental organizations. Because there were too few opportunities and resources for our citizens and particularly children, to learn about the natural environment, in the mid 1990's URWA stepped up its educational activities including school and scouting programs, a nature day camp, and family programs. Hands-on stewardship projects, such as invasive plant removal, water monitoring, trail maintenance and tree plantings were carried out by citizen volunteers throughout the year. As URWA's Land Preservation Program expanded, stewardship and monitoring responsibilities increased. Without URWA's dedication and commitment to the land and waters over these past forty-seven years, this region would be a different place to live. The Association's presence has made a significant contribution to natural resource protection and the quality of life throughout the Upper Raritan Watershed region.

MRS. HENRY R. SLACK COLLECTION
Manuscript MS-010
1889-1965

	SOURCE: Mrs. Fuller E. Callaway, Jr., 1984

	SHELVING UNITS: 1 document box

	PROCESSING: RAA, 1992

	 

	BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE

	Ruth Bradfield Slack and her husband, Dr. Henry Richmond Slack, Jr., were civic leaders in LaGrange from the 1890s until their deaths in 1943 and 1944.  Mrs. Slack was born in LaGrange 10 September 1864.  Her father, Thomas Searcy Bradfield, was a pharmacist.  Dr. Slack was born in Louisiana 7 May 1862.  He moved to LaGrange with his parents in 1880 and went to work in Dr. Bradfield's pharmacy.  In 1885, he received a degree from the Maryland College of Pharmacy.  He and Ruth married 14 September  1887.  Slack received his degree from the Atlanta Medical College (later Emory University School of Medicine) in 1891.  In 1903, the Slacks opened LaGrange Sanitorium which became known as the  Dunson Hospital in 1916 and was the forerunner of West Georgia Medical Center.

	 

	 

	SCOPE AND CONTENT NOTE

	Pamphlets, magazine articles and other literature published  between 1906 and 1960 promote LaGrange as a progressive  industrial town with antebellum charm.  The publications provide statistics such as the number of spindles and looms in operation and include many photographs of textile mills, mill villages and public buildings.  A small collection of post cards features public buildings and historic homes.

	Remarks by Dr. Slack at the 25 March 1904, meeting of charter members of the LaGrange Sanitorium describe the sanitorium's first year of operation.  A 1939 address before the 4th District Medical Society recounts his medical career and mentions several  other doctors who practiced in LaGrange.

	The Slacks promoted the organization of the LaGrange public school system.  Dr. Slack was a charter member of the Board of Education in 1903.  A petition requesting the mayor and council to call an election to organize a school board bears the names of more than two hundred LaGrange citizens.

	In April 1932, Mrs. Slack presented a talk on the history of Ferrell Gardens to a group from the Garden Club of America when they visited the Gardens.  A copy of the talk and two magazine articles on Ferrell Gardens are included.

	Among other items of memorabilia are a 1916 pattern book and a fashion show invitation from Callaway's Department Store.  A hand bill lists the program of observances when Jefferson Davis' funeral train passed through LaGrange in 1889.

	 

	 

	SPECIAL NOTE
