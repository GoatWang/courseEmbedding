Index Investing Puts Americans' Retirement Savings in Peril, Wintergreen Advisers Says
Wintergreen cites position concentration and passive stance on executive pay



Click the image to view the report


New York, NY - (Business Wire) - April 30, 2015 - The rush of money into index equity funds has ballooned into a market mania that is fueling excessive CEO compensation and putting the savings of ordinary investors at risk, according to a new report by Wintergreen Advisers that was released today.
The report noted that the massive assets of index giants Vanguard, BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) and State Street (NYSE: STT) make them the largest block of shareholders in America's largest publicly traded companies, holding an average of 16% of the shares outstanding of the top 25 companies in the S&P 500.



David Winters, CEO of Wintergreen Advisers, said:  "Trillions of ordinary investors' dollars are now committed to a mechanistic strategy that day in and day out simply buys stocks without a thought for their actual underlying value. Students of market history know that index mania - like other market fads before it - will end badly.
"The sad reality is that index funds have turned ordinary investors into the pawns in a game that undermines the integrity of American markets and imposes costs on society that don't show up in index fund expense ratios. We believe that one consequence of this is that billions of dollars of value created by American companies are being diverted to a select few executives while ordinary investors, distracted by 'low fee' hype, are subjected to dangerous risk concentrations in their retirement portfolios."
Wintergreen's analysis of the voting histories of the leading S&P 500 index funds run by Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street over the past five years for the 25 largest companies in the S&P 500 found that these funds cast their votes in favor of equity compensation plans 89% of the time, and opposed executives' pay packages less than 4% of the time. They withheld or cast votes against directors a meager 4% of the time.
Liz Cohernour, COO of Wintergreen Advisers, added: "Index mania has been a boon for executives of companies in the index, whether or not these executives are delivering real shareholder value. Flows into Big Index's fund products that tend to vote with management means a significant block of the shareholders in an S&P 500 company can generally be counted on to support executive compensation packages even when shareholders are receiving meager returns."
The Wintergreen report noted that index hype creates an illusion of safety and diversification.  Wintergreen believes this can lead ordinary investors to take on a dangerously high concentration of risk in their investment portfolios.
By Wintergreen's estimate, the top 25 securities by market value in the S&P 500 in 2014 contributed over 33% of the index's total return, while the top 25 securities by performance contributed 55% of the index's total return. Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and Intel alone accounted for over 20% of the total return of the S&P 500 in 2014.

Wintergreen Advisers Cites Complete Victory in Settlement with Consolidated-Tomoka Land
March 8, 2017
MOUNTAIN LAKES, NJ - On March 6, 2017, Wintergreen Advisers, LLC ("Wintergreen") and Consolidated-Tomoka Land Co. ("CTO", NYSE: CTO) and its directors (collectively, the "Defendants") entered into a settlement agreement whereby CTO shareholders will be permitted to vote on Wintergreen's nominees to CTO's Board of Directors at CTO's 2017 Annual Meeting.  This is exactly the relief Wintergreen requested in its complaint against the Defendants and Wintergreen views the settlement as a complete victory, both for itself and for all CTO shareholders.
Wintergreen serves as investment adviser to clients who have collectively owned more than 10% of CTO's shares since 2006 and who currently own more than 27.1% of CTO's shares.  In November of 2016, Wintergreen notified CTO of its nomination of four individuals to serve on CTO's Board and to be voted on by shareholders.  Rather than engage Wintergreen on the merits, CTO sought to reject Wintergreen's right to nominate directors, effectively taking away the ability of CTO shareholders to choose their own directors.  Although Wintergreen attempted in good faith to negotiate with CTO, ultimately Wintergreen was forced to defend its shareholder rights in court.
Wintergreen's Chief Operating Officer Liz Cohernour issued the following statement on behalf of Wintergreen:
"We are extremely pleased to have vindicated our rights as shareholders of CTO and are looking forward to presenting our vision for the future of CTO directly to shareholders and providing them with a real choice at the 2017 Annual Meeting.  We believe that our nominees have the expertise and experience to unlock significant unrealized shareholder value in the Company while also implementing sound corporate governance and compensation policies that will benefit shareholders, not senior management.  It is a shame the current board has sought to limit the right of CTO's shareholders to choose their board representatives, arguably a shareholder's most important right, in order to stay in power.  This is not an isolated incident and represents yet another example of existing management putting their own interests before those of shareholders. In addition to making our case forcefully to fellow CTO shareholders, we look forward to holding CTO and its directors accountable."

Wintergreen Advisers, LLC Files Complaint against Consolidated-Tomoka Land Co. to Vindicate its Shareholder Right to Propose Director Nominees
February 21, 2017
Wintergreen Advisers, LLC ("Wintergreen" or "the Firm") has brought an action (the "Action") for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against Consolidated-Tomoka Land Co. ("CTO" or "the Company", NYSE: CTO) and the current members of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") in the Circuit Court of the Seventh Judicial Circuit in and for Volusia County, Florida, in order to vindicate its right as a shareholder of the Company to present a proposal to shareholders for the election of four individuals to the Board at the Company's upcoming annual shareholder meeting.
In November 2016, Wintergreen submitted to the Company a proposal to nominate four individuals to the Board at the upcoming annual shareholder meeting (the "Proposal").  Wintergreen proposed these director nominees to represent the interests of all shareholders of CTO.  Motivated solely by a desire to stifle legitimate shareholder action that would diminish their control over the Company, and despite in the past ten years never questioning Wintergreen's right to bring nearly-identical proposals, CTO and the Board improperly rejected the Proposal, in violation of state and federal law.
Wintergreen believes that this decision to exclude the Proposal stands on hollow grounds and is yet another example of the lengths to which members of management and the Board, entrenched in their lucrative positions, are willing to go to deny shareholders the right to choose their representatives on the Board and to continue operating in an opaque and deceitful manner, at great expense to the owners of the Company, its shareholders.  This result left Wintergreen with little other choice than to defend its rights as a CTO shareholder and bring this Action against CTO, continuing Wintergreen's efforts to take action to find ways to maximize value for all shareholders, improve corporate governance and otherwise ensure that the interests of all shareholders remain protected.
Wintergreen believes that its shareholder proposals over the past ten years have improved corporate governance at CTO and have included the implementation of annual elections of directors, the separation of the roles of CEO and Chairman of the Board, and annual 'say on pay' votes, which have benefitted all CTO shareholders.  Wintergreen has endeavored to serve the interests of all shareholders, and this improved corporate governance has also improved CTO's stature as a company.
As evidenced by recent investor sentiment and by the vote at last year's Annual Meeting when over 69% of the votes cast directed CTO to hire an independent advisor to evaluate ways to maximize shareholder value through the sale of CTO, and over 60% of the votes were cast against CTO's proposal to issue additional shares of common stock which would dilute existing shareholders by more than 23% if fully exercised, shareholders have expressed their extreme dissatisfaction with the Company's prolonged value drift.
In the Action, Wintergreen alleges claims for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief: (i) against CTO and the current members of the Board (collectively, the "Defendants") for breach of contract; (ii) against the members of the Board for breach of fiduciary duty; (iii) against all Defendants for declaratory judgment pursuant to Florida Statutes § 86; and (iv) against CTO for violating Federal proxy requirements under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 14a-8, 17 C.F.R. § 24014a-8, promulgated thereunder.  Due to the impending dates of CTO's annual meeting and the date set as the record date for shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the annual meeting, Wintergreen moved for a temporary injunction prohibiting Defendants from filing CTO's proxy statement and holding the annual meeting; or, in the alternative, prohibiting Defendants from including a proposal for the election of directors in CTO's proxy statement and from bringing the election of directors before a vote at the annual meeting, until this litigation is resolved.  Wintergreen also moved for a speedy hearing and to shorten the time for Defendants to respond to discovery requests.
Wintergreen believes CTO is wrong on the law and the facts.  The Action, motion for temporary injunction, and motion for speedy hearing will be publicly available at https://app02.clerk.org/ccms/ by looking up the case number, 2017 30267 CICI.

Wintergreen Responds to Consolidated-Tomoka's Desperate Attempt to Block Shareholder Action
Suggests New Directors Needed to Arrest Prolonged Value Drift
January 31, 2017
MOUNTAIN LAKES, NJ - Wintergreen Advisers, LLC serves as investment adviser to clients who have collectively owned more than 10% of Consolidated-Tomoka Land Co. 's ("CTO", NYSE: CTO) shares since 2006, and who currently own more than 27.1% of CTO's shares.  Attempting to block our legitimate right to propose nominees to CTO's Board of Directors is yet another example of CTO's Board and management putting their own interests before those of shareholders, and seeking to distract shareholders from their own mismanagement.
As evidenced by recent investor sentiment and by the vote at last year's Annual Meeting of over 69% of the votes cast directing CTO to hire an independent advisor to evaluate ways to maximize shareholder value through the sale of CTO, shareholders are extremely unhappy with the company's prolonged value drift.  We believe CTO shareholders would welcome directors with shared values to arrest this drift and we think CTO's current directors and management believe this as well, which is why they are trying desperately to keep Wintergreen's nominees off the ballot.
If our goal was to exit this investment at any cost, we would take CTO up on its repeated offers to buy back all or a large portion of our shares (which according to them we apparently do not own).  However, we believe in the value of CTO and its underlying properties, and wish to maximize this value to the benefit of all shareholders.  If CTO's Board and management acted with similar goals and in accordance with their fiduciary obligations, we would not be having this discussion.

Liz Cohernour Discusses the Outcome of Consolidated-Tomoka's 2016 Proxy Vote with The Deal's Alicia McElhaney

Following Consolidated-Tomoka's Annual Meeting of Shareholders on April 27, 2016, Wintergreen's Liz Cohernour discusses how the votes cast by CTO shareholders have sent a "clear message to the board" by voting against two proposals, and supporting the proposal for CTO to hire an independent adviser to evaluate ways to maximize shareholder value.

Wintergreen Advisers, LLC to Oppose Consolidated-Tomoka Land Co. Proposed Share Issuance that It Believes Could Dilute Current Holders by 23%, and Support Proposal to Hire Independent Advisor to Maximize Shareholder Value
Wintergreen Advisers also Files 13D Indicating 26% Deemed Beneficial Ownership of Consolidated-Tomoka Land Co.
April 7, 2016
MOUNTAIN LAKES, NJ - Wintergreen Advisers, LLC ("Wintergreen" or "the Firm") today announced that it intends to vote against certain proxy items proposed by Consolidated-Tomoka Land Co. ("CTO" or "the Company", NYSE: CTO), including the Item 5 proposal to issue additional shares of common stock.  According to Wintergreen's analysis of CTO's proxy statement, Wintergreen believes this issuance, if fully exercised, could dilute existing CTO shareholders to the tune of more than 23%.  Accordingly, the Firm believes that this proposal is destructive to the interests of CTO shareholders and it plans on voting no to Item 5.
To help illustrate what this dilution means for a shareholder of CTO, if this proposal passes and the Company issues the full amount of the requested shares, a shareholder who owns $1,000 worth of stock would be diluted such that the value of the shares immediately after the additional stock is issued, would be $765.
In a letter filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), Wintergreen indicated it will support the Wintergreen proposal to request that CTO hire an independent adviser to evaluate ways to maximize shareholder value.  Wintergreen believes that shares of CTO are extremely undervalued and that substantial value is available to be unlocked quickly.  Wintergreen believes an independent third party would accelerate this process by assisting CTO's Board of Directors (the "Board") in identifying viable opportunities to maximize shareholder value.  The letter is included below.
In its letter, Wintergreen also indicated that it plans to vote against the following Board sponsored proposals:
- Against the re-election of each director
- Against the ratification of the appointment of Grant Thornton, LLP as auditor
- Against the advisory vote to approve executive compensation
Wintergreen's Schedule 13D, filed with the SEC, also indicates Wintergreen's 26% deemed beneficial ownership of CTO as of April 6, 2016.  To view the SEC filing, click here. 
Wintergreen believes these items are not in the best interest of CTO shareholders, and that shareholders deserve better than this.

Wintergreen to Vote YES to Item 4
Wintergreen Proposal to Hire Independent Advisor to Maximize CTO Shareholder Value
And 
Wintergreen to vote NO to Item 5
Board Proposal to Approve Issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock
April 6, 2016
Wintergreen Advisers, LLC ("Wintergreen") supports its proposal to request that Consolidated-Tomoka Land Co. ("CTO" or "Company") hire an independent adviser to evaluate ways to maximize shareholder value.  We believe that shares of CTO are extremely undervalued and that substantial value is available to be unlocked quickly.  We believe an independent third party would accelerate this process by assisting CTO's board of directors (the "Board") in identifying viable opportunities to maximize shareholder value.
We plan to vote against certain other proxy items including the Board's Item 5 proposal to issue additional shares of common stock 1.  According to our analysis of the proxy statement, we believe this issuance, if fully exercised, could dilute existing CTO shareholders to the tune of more than 23%.  Accordingly, we believe that this proposal is destructive to the interests of CTO shareholders and we plan on voting no to Item 5, as described more fully below.
To help illustrate what this dilution means for a shareholder of CTO, if this proposal passes and the Company issues the full amount of the requested shares, a shareholder who owns $1,000 worth of stock would be diluted such that the value of the shares immediately after the additional stock is issued, would be $765.  
We plan to vote against the following Board sponsored proposals:
- Against the issuance of additional shares of CTO 
- Against the re-election of each director
- Against the ratification of the appointment of Grant Thornton, LLP as auditor
- Against the advisory vote to approve executive compensation 
As outlined in detail below, we believe these items are not in the best interest of CTO shareholders, and that shareholders deserve better than this.
Item 1.  We intend to vote against the re-election of all 7 directors.
We believe that the Board has failed to look out for the best interests of CTO shareholders.  The Board's latest transgression is a proxy statement that includes a proposal to issue more than 1.3 million shares, which could by our calculations, result in dilution of over 23% for existing shareholders.  We do not believe there is a beneficial reason to shareholders for this issuance and think that better financing options are clearly available.  Additionally, we view the proposal to increase compensation for what we believe to be a failed management team is egregious and another indication that the Board needs to be replaced.
Further, we have reached out to the Board on multiple occasions in an attempt to work with the Board on the issues that we have identified, but we have not received a satisfactory response.  In our view the Board has expressed an interest to rubber stamp management's actions and is no longer focused on its true role - to look after the interests of CTO shareholders.
Item 2.  We intend to vote against the ratification of the appointment of Grant Thornton as auditor.
In a series of letters to the Board 2, we have identified what we believe to be deficiencies in CTO's publicly filed reports.  We also find it alarming that over a two-year period, Grant Thornton's audit fees have doubled without a clear explanation to CTO shareholders as to why this has occurred.  We believe that the engagement of a new audit firm that can undertake a thorough review of CTO's financial statements and disclosures would benefit all shareholders.
Item 3.  We intend to vote against the approval of executive compensation.
We think increasing John Albright's total compensation (including stock and option awards) by over five times his 2015 compensation is reckless, destructive, and undeserved.  We believe CTO's recent share price performance has been abysmal.  Its -5.5% performance in 2015 fell well behind both the overall S&P 500's return of +1.4% and the REIT Index's return of +1.4% 3.  With the rebound in local real estate prices, and the low interest rate environment, we believe management's actions have detracted from share performance and absolutely no increase in compensation is warranted.   We also find it very curious that CTO has shifted the membership of its peer group twice in the last three years, and also uses a different listing of "peers" in CTO's investor presentations than what is contained in CTO's annual report.  We think this constant shifting and misdirection has become all too commonplace for this management team and shareholders should not reward this type of behavior.
Additionally, in our view, Mr. Albright has demonstrated a pattern of taking on dangerous amounts of leverage, both with regards to CTO and his personal dealings.  As detailed in the 2016 proxy, Mr. Albright beneficially owns 109,446 4 shares of CTO.   However, footnote 7, in much smaller print, reveals that Mr. Albright has pledged most of these shares in a margin trading account and as security for a line of credit.  We think leveraging his CTO shares is risky and if CTO's market value declines, Mr. Albright could be subject to a margin call that may force him to liquidate his CTO shares.  Under Mr. Albright's leadership, CTO has also taken on what we believe to be a dangerous amount of leverage which could lead to disastrous results for CTO shareholders. As recently as 2010, the Company wrote of the risks of leverage, writing to shareholders that "...The real estate market has always been cyclical. In down markets, significant debt can severely weaken a real estate company by forcing it to sell off valuable assets at a discount..." 5  Given CTO's recent use of leverage, it seems to us that the lessons of the past have been forgotten.  
Wintergreen will not support a plan to increase the compensation of Mr. Albright by more than five times his prior year's pay.  Nothing we have seen from Mr. Albright justifies this increase.
Item 4. We will vote for the hiring of an independent advisor to evaluate ways to maximize shareholder value.
We are pleased that Deutsche Bank was hired to pursue the directive of our proxy proposal: to explore strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value, including the possible liquidation of assets or the sale of the company.  This is a good first step.  At this point, we cannot tell precisely what instructions have been given to Deutsche Bank as investment banker advisor, nor can we know how vigorously it will be permitted by the Board to explore all meaningful strategic paths for maximizing shareholder value. That said, we believe CTO is trading at a massive discount to the value of its underlying assets and that if Deutsche Bank acts in accordance with our proposal, we think it will uncover numerous opportunities to unlock shareholder value.
We question the Company's motives for not supporting the Wintergreen Proposal.  We do not believe that the continued pursuit of the Company's business plan is a viable option.  We think it is time to initiate, expedite and ultimately finalize a sales process while interest rates remain low in order to take advantage of the ongoing real estate market recovery. We have heard from many other CTO shareholders who support our proposal. We believe prior and current CTO management alike has failed to enhance shareholder value beyond a slight reflection of the recovery of the real estate market and a potential sale could be the best way to unlock CTO's value.  
Item 5.  We will vote against the issuance of additional shares.  
We believe there is absolutely no need to dilute shareholders by issuing common stock - there are several tax efficient transactions that the Company could pursue without diluting shareholders.
The Company's current obligation to bond holders is significant, approximately $75 million.  To meet its payment obligations without issuing additional shares and diluting shareholders potentially by over 23%, the Company has available to it:
1. The Raleigh, North Carolina office complex, purchased in November 2015 for $42.3m 6
2. The Commercial Loan Portfolio of approximately $38.3m 7
3. The land pipeline sales of approximately $56m 8 that will be closing in the coming years
4. The approximately $8.7 million in treasury stock (subject to CTO's share price)
We believe the Company could liquidate (or, in the case of the treasury stock, sell) these assets to raise much needed cash.  We believe the Company should use any excess proceeds to repay debt and begin the process of deleveraging the Company.  The proceeds of the sale of the investment portfolio, which was recently liquidated at a substantial loss 9, should also be used to reduce debt in preparation for the upcoming need for cash.  Between now and the bonds' 2020 conversion date, we believe there is ample opportunity for the Board to responsibly meet bond holder obligations while also addressing shareholder concerns.  Wintergreen believes that potentially diluting shareholders to the tune of 23% (if the additional shares are fully issued) is NOT the preferred method for CTO to meet its obligations to bond holders. 
Accordingly, Wintergreen intends to vote "AGAINST" 
- Item 1:  Against each of the seven directors nominated for one year terms
- Item 2:  Against the ratification of the appointment of Grant Thornton, LLP as auditor
- Item 3:  Against the advisory vote to approve executive compensation
- Item 5:  Against the issuance of additional shares of CTO
Wintergreen intends to vote "FOR"
- Item 4:  For the hiring of an independent advisor to evaluate ways to maximize shareholder value

Company Description


Wintergreen Advisers makes investment decisions based on fundamental research. The firm follows a global approach to investing that combines the following key elements: Activism & Arbitrage, Bankruptcy, Cash & Convertibles, Distressed Companies, Undervalued Equities, and Financial Restructurings.Wintergreen's hedging strategies are designed to reduce potential loss as a result of certain economic or market risks, including risks related to fluctuations in interest rates, currency exchange rates, and broad or specific market movements. To the extent that they engage in currency hedging strategy, the firm primarily engages in forward currency contracts. Wintergreen may also engage in other currency transactions such as currency futures contracts, currency swaps, options on currencies, or options on currency futures, or they may engage in other types of transactions, such as the purchase and sale of exchange-listed and over-the-counter put and call options on securities, equity and fixed-income indices, and other financial instruments; and the purchase and sale of financial and other futures contracts, and options on futures contracts.Wintergreen's investments in distressed companies typically involve the purchase of bank debt, lower-rated or defaulted debt securities, comparable unrated debt securities or other indebtedness (or participations in the indebtedness) of such companies. The debt securities may either be unrated, or rated in any rating category established by one or more independent rating organizations. The fund may invest in securities that are rated in the medium to lowest rating categories by S&P and Moody's, some of which may be junk bonds. The firm manages the Wintergreen Fund, a no-load global value fund with the investment objective of capital appreciation. The firm invests mainly in equity securities including securities convertible into or exchangeable for common or preferred stock of companies that they believe are trading below intrinsic value. They invest in the securities of US and non-US issuers, including securities of issuers in emerging markets.  Wintergreen often engages in shareholder activist investment strategies. They take an activist role in the companies in which they invest by seeking to control or influence management or by investing in other companies that do so. Wintergreen invests in arbitrage opportunities where companies are involved in restructurings such as mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, liquidations, spin-offs or tender or exchange offers. They also invest in bankruptcy situations.

Dear Fellow Wintergreen Fund Shareholder,
EXCERPT FROM THE 2016 ANNUAL REPORT SHAREHOLDER LETTER
Posted March 1, 2017
Looking back on Wintergreen Fund, Inc.'s (the "Fund") 2016 results, two related themes stick out in bold relief. First, there's simply no sure thing in this world - no sure winner, no sure loser, no sure outcome. Because of that, investors need to be prepared for the unexpected, owning undervalued companies that can survive, if not thrive, in a broad range of market conditions. Second, every vote matters, whether shareholder or citizen. With that in mind, we at Wintergreen Advisers look for companies that respect and live by good governance. If we are invested and don't see that, there's a good chance we will ask management to change or we will ask shareholders to join us in bringing about that change. Quite literally, we are active managers. The vote matters.
The Fund had strong 2016 returns from long-term portfolio holdings Reynolds American Inc. ("Reynolds"), Birchcliff Energy Ltd., and Altria Group Inc. Securities that underperformed included Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., which the Fund sold during the year, Swatch Group AG, and Provident Financial plc. The Fund also employed forward currency contracts, which had an overall positive impact on performance during the year.
If you would be a real seeker after truth,it is necessary that at least once in your life you doubt, as far as possible, all things.
- René Descartes
Let's look at some highlights for the Fund. In last year's annual letter, we noted many virtues of Reynolds as a core portfolio investment for many years. A smart management team combined Reynolds with Lorillard, Inc. in an earnings-accretive deal, creating an even more powerful cash generating business. In the process, the company increased its appeal to British American Tobacco plc ("BAT"), its largest owner with 42% of outstanding shares, as a must-own asset to fully capture opportunities in the U.S. and benefit from Reynolds's product innovations. Our belief that BAT would eventually bid for the rest of the shares came to fruition last October, resulting in a surge in the value of Reynolds, the Fund's largest holding. With an improved deal price and structure more favorable to shareholders, Reynolds agreed to the takeover in January of 2017 (closing is expected by the Adviser to occur in the third quarter of 2017). As shareholders of BAT, another top holding of the Fund, we hope to continue to collect the steady amounts of cash returned by this combined powerhouse.

David J. Winters, CFA
Portfolio Manager
The views contained in this report are those of the Fund's portfolio manager as of December 31, 2016, and may not reflect his views on the date this report is first published or anytime thereafter. The preceding examples of specific investments are included to illustrate the Fund's investment process and strategy. There can be no assurance that such investments will remain represented in the Fund's portfolios. Holdings and allocations are subject to risks and to change. The views described herein do not constitute investment advice, are not a guarantee of future performance, and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any security.

The Fund is subject to several risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The Fund may purchase risk arbitrage securities (securities of companies involved in a restructuring) or distressed companies. These companies may not be successful in their restructuring and securities of distressed companies are generally more likely to become worthless than securities of more financially stable companies. Smaller companies involve substantial risk as these securities are traditionally more volatile in price than larger company securities. Value risk is that the securities in which the Fund invests may never reach what the Investment Manager believes are their full market values. Securities rated below investment grade, sometimes called junk bonds, involve a greater degree of risk than investment grade bonds in return for higher yield potential. The Fund may be subject to interest rate risk which is the risk that debt securities in the Fund's portfolio will decline in value because of increases in market interest rates. By participating in derivative securities, the Fund may attempt to hedge (protect) against currency risk which is the risk that the value of foreign securities may be affected by changes in currency exchange rates. Derivatives can be volatile and involve various types and degrees of risks, depending upon the characteristics of a particular derivative. International investing involves certain risks and increased volatility not associated with investing solely in the U.S. These risks include currency fluctuations, economic or financial instability, lack of timely or reliable financial information or unfavorable political or legal developments. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. As a result of appreciation of certain of the Fund's portfolio securities and/or a change in the size of the Fund, investments in a particular sector or industry may represent a significant portion of the Fund's overall portfolio.  If this occurs, the Fund will be subject to greater potential risk than funds that do not have as much exposure to such sector or industry. Short sale risk is the risk that the Fund will incur an unlimited loss if the price of a security sold short increases between the time of the short sale and the time the Fund replaces the borrowed security.
In light of these risks, the Fund may not be suitable for all investors.
Before investing you should carefully consider the Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and additional information regarding the Fund. To obtain a prospectus or summary prospectus, please download from this site or call toll-free 1-888-468-6473. The prospectus and summary prospectus should be read carefully before investing. This website is not a solicitation for the Fund outside of the United States.
