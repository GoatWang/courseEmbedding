	Products that Accelerate Cyber Security Incident Response

	 




	 

About TaaSera, Inc:



	www.taasera.com

TaaSera is 
	revolutionizing cyber security incident response by helping identify, 
	resolve and restore business operations more quickly. TaaSeras 
	patent-protected NetTrust solution allows IT security professionals 
	worldwide to gain invaluable minutes when responding to coordinated attacks 
	and infections.

 

Unlike 
	traditional security tools that require highly trained professionals to 
	analyze millions of events to identify a potential breach, NetTrust 
	instantly connects the dots to visualize which systems may already be 
	compromised, and to prioritize them by risk. With NetTrust, for the first 
	time incident response teams know where to focus their efforts, and how 
	urgently they need to act.

 

TaaSera has 
	offices in Cupertino, California and McLean, VA.

 


Scott 
	Hartz
	CEO
 

Mr. Hartz is 
	recognized as a pioneer in leading transformational business solutions for 
	Fortune 500 global enterprises. His career in management consulting and 
	systems integration at Price Waterhouse and PricewaterhouseCoopers brings 
	experience with managing an enterprise serving more than half of the 
	companies in the Fortune 500 as well as numerous smaller business 
	organizations and governmental units throughout the world.  From 1995 to 
	2002, while Global CEO of PwC Consulting, Hartz led the companys growth to 
	a $6.0 billion enterprise with a global leadership position serving 
	multi-national companies in corporate transformation and systems 
	integration.  He serves on the Boards of the Erie Insurance Group, Satmetrix, 
	and Alien Technology.  Hartz also served on The Wharton School Graduate 
	Board and Lehigh University Business School Advisory Board and on the Board 
	of Directors of Siebel Systems until its acquisition by Oracle in 2006.

 

He holds a B.S. 
	degree in Economics from Lehigh University and an MBA degree from The 
	Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.



Interview conducted by: Lynn Fosse, Senior 
	Editor, CEOCFO Magazine, Published  September 8, 2014
	 


CEOCFO: 
	Mr. Hartz, what is the concept of TaaSera?


Mr. Hartz: 
TaaSera 
	NetTrust is a suite of products used to accelerate cyber security incident 
	response. Unlike tools that focus on individual events or intrusions, 
	NetTrust watches for patterns of malicious behavior in systems and 
	prioritizes them according to their risk to assist security analysts 
	resulting in a more timely, targeted response.

 


CEOCFO: 
	What do you understand fundamentally about this area that perhaps other 
	companies do not?


Mr. Hartz: 
	I think in the existing paradigm, virtually all of the products in this 
	arena rely on what we call perimeter defense. The concept being that if we 
	protect the edge (or perimeter) of the enterprise and keep malware out, then 
	by definition, everything inside will be great, which is a good concept. 
	Unfortunately, it is not working very well as the recent attacks would 
	attest. The adversaries are smart enough to penetrate the perimeter defenses 
	and no one is really watching what is going on inside the system, and that 
	is where we come in. We monitor traffic inside the enterprise system, 
	looking for malicious activities that have gotten through the perimeter. We 
	identify the breach and help target the security team to where they need 
	respond.

 


CEOCFO: 
	How are you able to do that?


Mr. Hartz: 
	Our product is based on years of research at SRI International (formerly 
	Stanford Research Institute). Most solutions on the market today depend on 
	well-known signatures, file hashes, and published blacklists to identify the 
	malware in flight or at rest. So, they block input based on a static pattern 
	match, and not based on dynamic behavior recognition that does not rely on 
	information that is in constant flux. These other products depend on a 
	blacklist of bad IP signatures harvested daily from multiple sources with 
	limited or no attribution. The blacklist is in the order of hundreds of 
	millions of signatures, and they are always out of date because of constant 
	IP and domain flux, and evasion techniques used by cyber criminals. 
	 Therefore, such approaches will not scale and identify an emerging and 
	well-orchestrated first time attack.  Rather than using such run of the mill 
	approaches, what the SRI team figured out was that when they looked at 
	behaviors of malware inside a network, they found that all malware 
	exhibit a common set of behaviors. They found that combinations of those 
	behaviors inside a network can be used to identify malware that evaded other 
	detection systems. That was break through patented research. We are adding 
	our own innovations, to this behavior analysis technology, some of which are 
	also patented or patent pending.

 


CEOCFO: 
	What would be one or two of the behaviors?


Mr. Hartz: 
	Think about when you get something suspicious on an email coming in and you 
	click on it. The resulting first step is generally an egg download. That is 
	one behavior. A second would be that the malware comes alive and starts 
	sniffing around your network to see where it is. The third would be that it 
	communicates out with its command and control server to get  further 
	instructions and further code to tell it what to do. That is a sequence of 
	three behaviors.

 


CEOCFO: 
	What are you are providing to an organization that will enable preventive 
	detection?


Mr. Hartz: 
We are 
	continually monitoring traffic, looking for this combination of behaviors 
	and then flagging them. We are keeping an ongoing track of suspicious 
	activity and building up a case as we see one behavior, two behaviors, three 
	behaviors, four behaviors and the case gets stronger. As it gets stronger, 
	it bubbles up on a reporting and alerts dashboard and our system highlights 
	to the customer that this is a rising concern. Maybe another way to describe 
	it is we operate in a post intrusion mode when the malware is already 
	inside, but pre-breach -- before they have actually grabbed your key data 
	and sent it back out. We are operating at a different timeframe, not before 
	it has gotten in but after it has gotten in and before it has done harm.

 


CEOCFO: 
	What is involved in implementation?


Mr. Hartz: 
	That is somewhat amazing. We implemented one of our clients yesterday and it 
	took about an hour. We have it loaded on a small device.  It is a software 
	tool we are supplying, but in many cases, we are loading it on a small 
	appliance as a plug-and-play set up, which is easy to deploy and quickly 
	shows results.

 


CEOCFO: 
	When a potential problem is identified so that you can look at it, are you 
	doing that at your end and is the customer being notified where?


Mr. Hartz: 
	No, the client has a control tool.  In a typical enterprise, there are staff 
	assigned to security response. We are providing a tool and a dashboard to 
	them that is highlighting an array of risky behaviors they are facing, and 
	identifying the most serious problems. You touched on another problem that 
	those security analysts face today. Many of the other tools identify 
	potential problems, what are called false positives in the statistics world. 
	If you take the example of Neiman Marcus, the story there was that there 
	were sixty six thousand alerts that could have pointed to a problem in the 
	several weeks before the actual breach occurred. The real problem is that 
	the vast majority of those alerts were ignored or considered false 
	positives. That is one of the big problems security analysts face today.  
	TaaSera screens out that type of noise to amplify the signal.

 


CEOCFO: 
	What types of companies are using your service today?


Mr. Hartz: 
	We are fairly early into the market. We have just come to market this year, 
	we have several insurance companies, and some banks, technology companies 
	and universities using it. We are trying to cover a variety of industries 
	and use-cases because each of these is a learning experience for us as we 
	gather more customers.

 


CEOCFO: Do 
	you find that you are able to reach the correct person or people, and do 
	people understand immediately?


Mr. Hartz: 
	We find that during the first fifteen minutes at a prospective account, they 
	seem a little skeptical. Then we light up a few screens and find they have a 
	very high level of interest after that.

 


CEOCFO: 
	Skeptical because you cannot do it or that it even exists?


Mr. Hartz: 
	Skeptical as in what we broadly say does not sound possible, knowing what 
	they know from other tools.

 


CEOCFO: 
	How do you get your foot in the door?


Mr. Hartz: 
	The product really speaks for itself, and much of our early business has 
	come from word-of-mouth and referrals. Word is beginning to spread about 
	TaaSera and were now being invited into more and more accounts.

 


CEOCFO: 
	Have there been changes or tweaks since you started to develop the product 
	and since it has been available? What have you learned along the way to make 
	it better?


Mr. Hartz: 
	We have had to provide access for the user to a broader set of underlying 
	information from our system. One of the things we have learned is that the 
	user does not just want to know that there is something bad happening; they 
	want conclusive evidence to understand why they need to be concerned. We 
	provide forensic evidence over a period of time that gives them enough 
	actionable intelligence to take to their boss and say we have to take that 
	server offline, even it is generating revenue, because the risk of breach 
	or exfiltration is too high.

 


CEOCFO: 
	How do you really get the attention and follow through that it really proves 
	its worth?


Mr. Hartz: 
	I come back to my earlier point that the security teams now come in every 
	morning, and turn on a screen showing millions of alerts and thousands of 
	problems they need to deal with, but they cannot deal with thousands of 
	potential problems. TaaSera narrows it down to individual systems and shows 
	the top five or ten that are most critically in need of attention. So we 
	give them a highly focused set of intelligence that really directs them to 
	the most serious problems. Therefore, I envision no real difficulty in our 
	customers quickly seeing the value from TaaSera. We are being very helpful 
	in filtering out the noise and pointing out the real problems.

 


CEOCFO: 
	Would you be implementing your system in addition to others or would this 
	replace current systems that people might be using?


Mr. Hartz: 
	We think of our system largely as a compliment. You certainly still want to 
	maintain a perimeter defense with a network firewall and an event management 
	system together with antivirus software. We are picking up what they miss. 
	You do not take down the perimeter defense of the fort just because you are 
	watching the middle, so we compliment what is there.

 


CEOCFO: 
	What do you bring to the table from previous experience that has been 
	helpful at TaaSera?


Mr. Hartz: 
	I spent the bulk of my career at PricewaterhouseCoopers consulting and I 
	spent my last seven years there as CEO of that business. I was running a six 
	billion dollar business on five continents with thirty thousand people. I 
	dealt with a large array of large corporate enterprises and managed a large 
	number of people. I think I have learned the importance of teaming 
	technology solutions with service providers who can actually implement them. 
	One of the things that we are spending more time on now is establishing 
	partnering relationships with expert services organizations who will help us 
	extend our reach, but also be able to hand-hold customers and make us part 
	of a larger solutions set.

 


CEOCFO: 
	What about at Wharton?


Mr. Hartz: 
	There, the focus was on the financial issues of an enterprise and one of the 
	things I am doing in our organization right now is focusing a great deal of 
	attention on the fund raising and capital structure that supports all the 
	things we are trying to do, so that was a helpful background.

 


CEOCFO: 
	Are you finding interest from investors?


Mr. Hartz: 
	We have taken a very different approach from many start-ups. Many 
	organizations in this phase of their development would have been going out 
	and chasing venture capital firms. Instead we have relied on private 
	investors. The net result is I think we have a very friendly and supportive 
	investor base. I am rather pleased with the outcome of that.


CEOCFO: Is it one standard offering or are there 
	bells and whistles that companies might utilize?


Mr. Hartz: 
	There is a core product right now but we have a pipeline of other 
	complimentary product offerings that will be coming on down the line. 


 


CEOCFO: 
	Are smaller businesses an area that you are addressing or will be in the 
	future?


Mr. Hartz: 
	I think it will be through these partnering relationships that I talk about. 
	This will enable us to extend our reach through IT services organizations 
	that are already dealing with smaller enterprises.

 


CEOCFO: 
	The bad guys constantly come up with new ways. What gives you the confidence 
	that you will be able to identify those as time goes on?


Mr. Hartz: 
	They have done a good job of disguising their presence (IP addresses and 
	such), which are fooling other detection tools, and they have learned to 
	stay asleep in sandbox type situations and come out on the other side 
	undetected. However, we do not think they can change the core fundamental 
	behaviors of malware and I think that is our great defense. They have to 
	communicate with command and control, perform reconnaissance, and 
	communicate in and out of the enterprise they have penetrated to exfiltrate 
	information. As long as we are watching the life cycle episodes of malware 
	and identifying risky behaviors, I think we can do a good job of detecting 
	it.

 


CEOCFO: 
	Put it all together. Why pay attention to TaaSera today?


Mr. Hartz: 
	Because the world is facing an increasing level of cyber risks. These come 
	from both criminal enterprise and state sponsored groups. Virtually every 
	enterprise at some level has already been penetrated by malware. No prudent 
	organization can ignore it and the existing tools do some things well -- but 
	they are not providing complete protection.


	In short, the world of cyber defense is about to undergo a paradigm shift 
	from perimeter defenses that rely on threat information that is in constant 
	flux, to a behavior based risk intelligence that is resilient to evasion. TaaSera 
	is at the forefront of the technology that will revolutionize the IT 
	security incident response process.

CUPERTINO, Calif., July 17, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- TaaSera Inc. today announced the release of the NetTrust 2.0 Enterprise Edition for accelerated cyber security incident response and forensic analysis. NetTrust continuously monitors network traffic to correlate and analyze risky behaviors associated with advanced threats and coordinated attacks.
Every day, incident response teams identify, analyze and respond to millions of individual security events. It's easy to miss critical alerts, and hard to connect the dots across every stage of the cyber kill chain. As a result, it takes an average 8 months to identify compromised systems inside the network perimeter; by then it's too late.
Traditional tools require security analysts to collect, analyze and interpret forensic evidence manually. In contrast, NetTrust's "FAAR Sight" solution (Forensic Analysis and Advanced Response) automates triage, diagnosis and remediation by providing threat relevance and context across every stage of the infection lifecycle.
"We're very excited to announce the next generation of our flagship product," said TaaSera CEO Scott Hartz. "NetTrust allows security professionals to prioritize threats, resulting in maximized efficiency and valuable time saved responding to incidents. By assessing their enterprise risk profile at any given moment, they take a much more proactive security posture."
FAAR Sight's advanced threat visualization automatically "connects the dots" across millions of events to deliver risk-based systems analysis, threat classification and forensic drill-down. With NetTrust, security professionals, operations and incident response teams can quickly identify compromised systems, streamline response time and reduce their window of exposure. 
Mike Thomas, Senior Security Architect at Erie Insurance, a Fortune 500 company, said, "TaaSera offers a unique approach for accelerating the collection and analysis of forensic evidence critical to effective cyber incident response. By providing context across the post-infection, pre-breach behaviors exhibited by advanced threats, the technology provides a more proactive way to respond to threats."
NetTrust 2.0 Enterprise Edition includes enhanced threat visualization for ease of deployment, operations and analysis in either physical or virtualized environments. The software includes an integrated suite of automatic threat intelligence updates, as well as comprehensive REST APIs for integration with existing security infrastructure.
Also featured are enhanced rules for monitoring insider threats across web, application and database tiers, and integration with SIEM, Active Directory and vulnerability assessment solutions like QualysGuard and Rapid7.
AvailabilityNetTrust 2.0 Enterprise Edition is available for download today as a software-only virtual appliance, or as a network appliance. NetTrust is easy to use and quick to deploy, without the need to rely on signatures or build custom rules.
For a live demonstration, or to request a no-risk NetTrust security assessment, visit http://taasera.com or call TaaSera at 855-TaaSera (855-822-7372).  
About TaaSeraTaaSera is revolutionizing Cyber security forensic analysis and advanced response. With more than one thousand installations worldwide, TaaSera's patent-protected NetTrust solution allows IT security professionals worldwide to gain invaluable minutes when responding to coordinated attacks.
Unlike traditional security tools that require highly trained professionals to analyze millions of events to identify a potential breach, NetTrust instantly "connects the dots" to visualize which systems may already be compromised and to prioritize them by risk. With NetTrust, for the first time incident response teams know where to focus their efforts, and how urgently they need to act.

TaaSera, IncCorporate Headquarters10055 North Portal AvenueSuite 120Cupertino, California 95104United States855.822.7372101 - 200 employees OverviewAbout TaaSera
TaaSera is a cyber security company spun out from SRI Ventures after 5 years of development and over $10 million in Army research funding. Led by former PWC CEO Scott Hartz, the company has 7 patents issued and pending.
TaaSera builds runtime behavior detection solutions used by the world’s leading companies and government agencies to identify previously unseen attacks and infections as they occur – before they result in breach or exfiltration.
Unlike technologies that review published exploit signatures or other historical data, assess potential vulnerabilities or analyze the impact of malware programs in non-production staging environments, TaaSera software solutions leverage patented behavior detection capabilities to highlight the emergence of previously unseen attacks as they are being carried out — providing organizations with the specific information necessary to adjust defenses and mitigate vulnerabilities targeted by today’s sophisticated threats.
TaaSera provides an embedded source of strategic intelligence within a broad range of third party solutions and services. The TaaSera Attack Warning and Response Engine (AWARE) improves the effectiveness of nearly every element of today’s layered IT security defenses to boost protection of underlying business systems and information, and prevent costly data breach incidents.
