What is Form D? What It Is Used For
Form D disclosures could be used to track and understand better your competitors. The information in Form D is usually highly confidential for ventures and startups and they don’t like revealing it. This is because it reveals amount raised or planned to be raised as well as reasons for the financing. This could help competitors. Entrepreneurs usually want to keep their financing a ‘secret’ so they can stay in stealth mode for longer.
Why Fundraising Reporting Is Good For Hendricks Resources  Also
The Form D signed by R William West might help Hendricks Resources Ltd’s sector. First, it helps potential customers feel more safe to deal with a firm that is well financed.

Revolutionizing the World'sEnergy and Food Supply
    

By transforming coal discard into cleaner fuel and topsoil


More







Revolutionizing the World's Energy and Food Supply
The world is facing significant challenges in energy and food supply. Our unique technology transforms coal waste into valuable, high-grade energy and topsoil products, reclaiming the coal discard and revitalizing local communities.







Cleaner, Lower Cost Energy
    

Hendricks Refined Carbon is a high energy coal substitute with significanty less impurities


More







Cleaner, Lower Cost Energy
Hendricks Refined Carbon (HRC) is a high-grade energy feed stock for steel, power and industrial markets, refined from previously unusable coal discard. HRC is cleaner, and lower cost than traditional solid energy sources.







Topsoil Enhancement
    

Hendricks Refined Minerals are used to enrich the soil and rehabilitate land that has been nutritionally exhausted


More







Topsoil Enhancement
Hendricks Refined Minerals (HRM) contains the essential minerals separated from coal during the washing process. Our technology extracts the minerals providing a valuable topsoil enhancement addressing the significant global topsoil erosion crisis.











 

LEADING THE WAY TO A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE






Refining Coal Discard
Our process harvests valuable carbon energy and agricultural minerals from coal discard.






Refined Carbon Energy
This innovative technology produces a new category of solid energy that burns cleaner and more efficiently than traditional coal.






Refined Minerals
We also extract valuable minerals from coal discard for future use in mineral, rare earth fertilizer and brick industries.


 



OUR PRODUCTS






Hendricks Refined Carbon
Our Refined Carbon contains significantly more energy in every ton than traditional coal products. This reduces emissions, maximizes efficiency and increases value to customers.







Hendricks Petroleum Conserver
Hendricks Petroleum Conserver is highly pure hydrocarbon derived from coal. It dramatically reduces fuel and refinery costs when blended with fuel or crude oil or when used as a direct substitute for conventional products.







Hendricks Refined Minerals
Hendricks Resources is currently evaluating future, valuable uses of the mineral, rare earth materials extracted during the refining process.






THE INNOVATIVE PROCESS

This patented technology refines coal discard, creating high value Refined Carbon.






1
Reclaiming
We safely and cost effectively employ reclamation methods best suited to each site. We remove coal discard and restore the site as close as possible to the original landform or reshape it for recreational or commercial use.






2
Micro-sizing
The sizing process cost effectively optimizes particle size to enable efficient separation of mineral matter from hydrocarbon.






3
De-watering
Low cost mechanical dewatering creates separate carbon and mineral filter cakes ready for pelletization.






4
Conditioning
The pulse jet conditioning system removes moisture and seals and weatherproofs the pellets. Plant emissions are recycled in a manner that further enhances the Hendricks Refined Minerals product resulting in ultra low emissions.

Coal is the world’s most abundant and lowest cost fuel, with nearly 8 billon tons consumed every year. The application of this technology will reignite the energy market by addressing the significant environmental & regulatory headwinds faced by the coal sector. The vast resources of coal discard available worldwide (>10 billion tons in the US alone), represent an extensive, low cost feedstock for the process.


Who is the Hendricks Management Team?

Hendricks is led by a unique combination of senior executives from the coal, oil, trading, technology and marketing fields. Our team includes senior leadership from Shell, Goldman Sachs, BG, BHP and Anglo American (see Our Team section above).


Why is Hendricks Refined Carbon Better?

Hendricks Refined Carbon (HRC) is a high-energy, low-impurity product. HRC delivers significant efficiency gains to our industrial and utility customers across the value chain, including logistics and other benefits.
We are the lowest cost producer of the highest quality solid hydrocarbon fuel, delivering a superior value proposition than any of our competitors in the traditional mining sector. Additionally,  the removal of moisture and inorganic material prior to combustion during our patented process, significantly improves the environmental footprint.

 History of Irish Mining

 Ireland has a long tradition of mining dating back to the Bronze Age. Coal, lead and copper mining flourished during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Following a period of relative decline, the discovery of the Tynagh lead zinc copper mine in 1961 was followed by further discoveries at Silvermines and Gortdrum. These mines have now closed, but the development of the Navan mine in 1974, followed by the Galmoy and Lisheen mines means that Ireland is a leading European producer of zinc and lead concentrates in Europe (http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/Natural/Exploration). Base Metal exploration discoveries continue with major companies, including Xstrata (Pallas Green, Limerick 2010 inferred resource of 24.1Mt grading at 7.85% Zn and 1.35% Pb), Teck (Limerick best drill result at 7.45m at 19.24% Zn/8.52% Pb), Lundin (County Clare best drill intersection at Dec 2011 – Hole 153 with 9.6m at 6.18% Zn/1.65% Pb, and second deeper zone at 3m 6.8% Cu) & New Boliden actively working across the Midland Basin.

 The Avoca Mines are located to the east of the Leinster Granites. These mines are VHMS deposits hosted by Ordovician age tuffs and felsites of the Duncannon Group. Periodically operating from 1720 until 1982, there is evidence of Bronze Age. Associated minerals include pyrite, sphalerite, galena & gold/silver.



 Government policy is to support the development of Ireland's mineral resources provided this is done in an environmentally and socially responsible way. The Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1999 are the principal legislative instruments which govern

 activity in this area.  A new Minerals Development Bill is currently being developed which will consolidate these Acts and will also update and modernise many of their provisions.

 The Exploration and Mining Division (EMD) is responsible for the administration of regulatory aspects of Ireland’s minerals industry by means of a  system of Prospecting Licences, and Mining Leases and Licences. 

 State Mining Facilities are negotiated on a case by case basis as required by Section 26 of the Minerals Development Act 1940, which also applies to Licences under the Minerals Development Act 1979 (see Section 17 of the 1979 Act).






KEY FEATURES

      • Sole right of working minerals vested in the state

      • Royalties fixed by individual agreement. Currently a percentage of net revenues for base metals, and on tonnage extracted in the case of industrial minerals

      • Private mineral owners receive compensation

      • Corporation Tax at 25% for mines, and 12.5% on income and chargeable gains from general trading

      • Capital allowances include exploration and development expenditure, expenditure on plant, machinery, buildings, up to 100%

      • Immediate write-off of exploration and development expenditure

      • Cost of rehabilitation after closure is tax deductible

       








 At the EU level the Commission has recently launched an initiative aimed at acquiring secure supplies of raw material for European industry.  

IRISH EXPLORATION CURRENT OUTLOOK

 In February 2012 Hendrick Resources and Connemara Mining Plc (CMC) (www.connemaramc.com) announced a joint venture which would begin exploration work on four CMC licenses on the Wicklow/Wexford border. A fifth license was added to the JV when CMC had fulfilled their first 2-year commitment to the Exploration & Mining Division prospecting licence terms. The Company can earn a 50% interest in these licences by spending €500,000 and may extend its option to 75% by investing a further €500,000. Initial exploration has been completed with an airborne geophysical survey. Subsequent exploration will include ground geochemistry and geophysics with follow up drill testing.

 The Airborne Magnetic, Electromagnetic & Radiometric Survey over the JV area started in April and was completed in May 2012. Total survey coverage was of 885 km2.  The survey was flown by Terraquest Geophysics, a Canadian company operating world-wide. The new survey data is currently being combined with historical data on gold prospects in the area to inform the next phase of ground follow-up. The first phase of this work will include regional soil sampling traverses over the zones identified from a combination of the new survey work and the historical datasets from previous operators.

The results from the airborne survey have proven to contain many tantalizing targets, which could fit to a variety of mineralization models. Some of these models are outlined below.

 The Leinster Granites to the west are overlain by Ribband Group metasediments, which are intruded by dioritic & felsic dykes. Faulted Serpentinites have been mapped to the north of Carnew in the central area. Duncannon Group felsic volcanics and rhyolites overly and are faulted against the Ribband metasediments to the south-east.
