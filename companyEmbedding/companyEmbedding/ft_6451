                    Rancho Cucamonga is the Inland Empire's premier City and one of the fastest growing metropolian areas, and still one of the safest cities in the county.  Rancho Cucamonga is rich in history from it's vineyards to being part of the Old Route 66 and a great place to live work and play.  With the San Gabriel mountains as a back drop the cities planned communities and award winning architecture you won't be disappointed to call this home. The city has over 20 parks and community facilities and highly rated schools.  Rancho Cucamonga has much to offer its residents, and businesses are finding Rancho Cucamonga a great place to call home.

My husband and I have lived here for 31 years and have raised our kids in this great community.  We have enjoyed watching the city grow and love that we are conveniently located to L.A., beaches, mountains, Palm Springs and Riverside.  The city offers wonderful shopping, dining, and entertainment.  I invite you to see all that the city has to offer.  Come see for yourself.

                    With the growth Rancho has been experiencing in the past couple decades we have been blessed with many beautiful places to spend our evenings and weekends. In the next few years we are also expecting a few more new buildings, including a new hotel and a mixed use building for housing and businesses.

                    The city of Rancho Cucamonga was named last week as one of the best cities in the US to start a family. The scoring was based not only on cost of first home purchase, but also on each city's education system, crime & safety, and percentage of young families.
Congratulations to Rancho Cucamonga, and also to Murrieta, Temecula, and Irvine who made the top 50 list!
