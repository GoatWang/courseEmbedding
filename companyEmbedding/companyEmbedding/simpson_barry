About This Collection






























Barbara Barry is among the world's most prominent and talented designers. Based in Southern California, she has created quietly beautiful, livable interiors for more than three decades. Barry is inspired by the natural world, and she believes that home furnishings should evoke calm and serenity as an antidote to the chaos of our modern lives. The ideas of simplicity, understated elegance, and timelessness define Barry’s design ethos. In her words, “Designing furniture that will become a part of a family’s history is one of the things I love about my work.”

All prices are Manufacturer’s Suggested List Price in U.S. dollars. Choosing a different grade may result in a higher price. The price you pay at a Baker showroom or authorized dealer may be different than the Manufacturer’s Suggested List Price.  These prices supersede previous prices and are subject to change without notice. These prices do not include shipping. Any applicable sales tax and/or VAT will be added to the prices.
