Telesat Canada is a Canadian satellite communications company founded on May 2, 1969. The company is headquartered in Ottawa, Ontario as well as having offices in the United States and Brazil.
On October 5, 2007 Loral Space & Communications Inc. and the Public Sector Pension Investment Board of Canada received the final regulatory approval necessary to complete the acquisition of Telesat from BCE Inc. for CAD $3.25 billion. The acquisition closed on October 31, 2007, with Loral owning 64 percent of Telesat.
At the same time, Telesat Canada merged with Loral Skynet, a subsidiary of Loral Space & Communications. Loral Skynet was a full-service global satellite operator headquartered in Bedminster, New Jersey. This resulted in the transfer of all of the assets of Loral Skynet to Telesat.

Services[edit]
The company is now the fourth-largest fixed satellite services provider in the world. It owns a fleet of satellites, with others under construction, and operates additional satellites for other entities.
Telesat carries Canada's two major DBS providers signals: Bell TV and Shaw Direct, as well as more than 200 of Canada's television channels.
Telesat's Anik F2 carries a KA band spot beam payload for satellite Internet access for Wildblue users in the United States and Xplornet users in Canada.[1][2] The KA band system uses spot beams to manage bandwidth concerns, linking to multiple satellite ground stations connected to the Internet.
Skynet’s customers included HBO, Disney, Cable & Wireless, Singapore Telecom, Connexion by Boeing, Global Crossing, BT North America, Globecomm Systems, UPC and China Central Television. These are now Telesat customers.
Loral Skynet provided a wide range of video and data transmission services. It became a subsidiary of Loral Space & Communications when Loral acquired it in 1997 from AT&T Corporation.
Skynet’s fleet consists of Telstars-11N, -12, -14R (Estrela do Sul 2), and -18. In 2003, Skynet sold its North American satellite fleet (Telstars 5 through 8 and 13) to Intelsat; they were renamed Intelsat Americas 5–8 and 13. This was done to help reduce debt after its parent, Loral Space & Communications, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 15, 2003. As part of the agreement, Skynet was precluded from competing in the North American market until March 18, 2006. In June 2007, Loral Space & Communications made an unsuccessful bid to acquire Intelsat. [1][dead link]
History[edit]
Telesat began as Telesat Canada, a Canadian Crown corporation created by an Act of Parliament in 1969.[3]
Telesat launched Anik A1 in 1972 as the world's first domestic communications satellite in geostationary orbit, operated by a commercial company. The satellite was retired from use in 1981.
Until February 1979, Telesat had a legal monopoly on earth stations in Canada: any entity wishing send or receive satellite signals had to sign a long-term lease with Telesat for an earth station; contracts for such leases were still enforced after the monopoly was ended.
Telesat was sold by the federal government to Bell in 1998.[4]
On December 18, 2006, Loral Space & Communications announced that it, along with Canada's Public Sector Pension Investment Board (PSP Investments), would acquire Telesat for US$2.8b.[5]
On November 17, 2010: Telesat Holdings Inc. hired JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse Group AG to start a formal sales process and offer so-called staple financing to interest buyers for $6 billion to $7 billion.[6]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Telesat Canada is a Canadian satellite communications company founded on May 2, 1969. The company is headquartered in Ottawa, Ontario as well as having offices in the United States and Brazil.
On October 5, 2007 Loral Space & Communications Inc. and the Public Sector Pension Investment Board of Canada received the final regulatory approval necessary to complete the acquisition of Telesat from BCE Inc. for CAD $3.25 billion. The acquisition closed on October 31, 2007, with Loral owning 64 percent of Telesat.
At the same time, Telesat Canada merged with Loral Skynet, a subsidiary of Loral Space & Communications. Loral Skynet was a full-service global satellite operator headquartered in Bedminster, New Jersey. This resulted in the transfer of all of the assets of Loral Skynet to Telesat.

Services[edit]
The company is now the fourth-largest fixed satellite services provider in the world. It owns a fleet of satellites, with others under construction, and operates additional satellites for other entities.
Telesat carries Canada's two major DBS providers signals: Bell TV and Shaw Direct, as well as more than 200 of Canada's television channels.
Telesat's Anik F2 carries a KA band spot beam payload for satellite Internet access for Wildblue users in the United States and Xplornet users in Canada.[1][2] The KA band system uses spot beams to manage bandwidth concerns, linking to multiple satellite ground stations connected to the Internet.
Skynet’s customers included HBO, Disney, Cable & Wireless, Singapore Telecom, Connexion by Boeing, Global Crossing, BT North America, Globecomm Systems, UPC and China Central Television. These are now Telesat customers.
Loral Skynet provided a wide range of video and data transmission services. It became a subsidiary of Loral Space & Communications when Loral acquired it in 1997 from AT&T Corporation.
Skynet’s fleet consists of Telstars-11N, -12, -14R (Estrela do Sul 2), and -18. In 2003, Skynet sold its North American satellite fleet (Telstars 5 through 8 and 13) to Intelsat; they were renamed Intelsat Americas 5–8 and 13. This was done to help reduce debt after its parent, Loral Space & Communications, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 15, 2003. As part of the agreement, Skynet was precluded from competing in the North American market until March 18, 2006. In June 2007, Loral Space & Communications made an unsuccessful bid to acquire Intelsat. [1][dead link]
History[edit]
Telesat began as Telesat Canada, a Canadian Crown corporation created by an Act of Parliament in 1969.[3]
Telesat launched Anik A1 in 1972 as the world's first domestic communications satellite in geostationary orbit, operated by a commercial company. The satellite was retired from use in 1981.
Until February 1979, Telesat had a legal monopoly on earth stations in Canada: any entity wishing send or receive satellite signals had to sign a long-term lease with Telesat for an earth station; contracts for such leases were still enforced after the monopoly was ended.
Telesat was sold by the federal government to Bell in 1998.[4]
On December 18, 2006, Loral Space & Communications announced that it, along with Canada's Public Sector Pension Investment Board (PSP Investments), would acquire Telesat for US$2.8b.[5]
On November 17, 2010: Telesat Holdings Inc. hired JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse Group AG to start a formal sales process and offer so-called staple financing to interest buyers for $6 billion to $7 billion.[6]

Telesat announced on December 30, 2009 that Nimiq 6 was built by Space Systems/Loral (SS/L). Bell TV, a Canadian satellite TV provider agreed to fully lease the satellite for its lifetime to serve their subscribers across Canada. Nimiq 6 has a payload of 32 high-powered Ku-band transponders. It uses the SS/L1300 platform and has a 15-year mission life. It was launched in 2012 by International Launch Services.[7]
Telesat launched Telstar 12 VANTAGE in November 2015 on a H2A204 variant of the H-IIA rocket,[8] and it commenced service in December 2015.[9]

Telesat Canada is a Canadian satellite communications company founded on May 2, 1969. The company is headquartered in Ottawa, Ontario as well as having offices in the United States and Brazil.
On October 5, 2007 Loral Space & Communications Inc. and the Public Sector Pension Investment Board of Canada received the final regulatory approval necessary to complete the acquisition of Telesat from BCE Inc. for CAD $3.25 billion. The acquisition closed on October 31, 2007, with Loral owning 64 percent of Telesat.
At the same time, Telesat Canada merged with Loral Skynet, a subsidiary of Loral Space & Communications. Loral Skynet was a full-service global satellite operator headquartered in Bedminster, New Jersey. This resulted in the transfer of all of the assets of Loral Skynet to Telesat.

Services[edit]
The company is now the fourth-largest fixed satellite services provider in the world. It owns a fleet of satellites, with others under construction, and operates additional satellites for other entities.
Telesat carries Canada's two major DBS providers signals: Bell TV and Shaw Direct, as well as more than 200 of Canada's television channels.
Telesat's Anik F2 carries a KA band spot beam payload for satellite Internet access for Wildblue users in the United States and Xplornet users in Canada.[1][2] The KA band system uses spot beams to manage bandwidth concerns, linking to multiple satellite ground stations connected to the Internet.
Skynet’s customers included HBO, Disney, Cable & Wireless, Singapore Telecom, Connexion by Boeing, Global Crossing, BT North America, Globecomm Systems, UPC and China Central Television. These are now Telesat customers.
Loral Skynet provided a wide range of video and data transmission services. It became a subsidiary of Loral Space & Communications when Loral acquired it in 1997 from AT&T Corporation.
Skynet’s fleet consists of Telstars-11N, -12, -14R (Estrela do Sul 2), and -18. In 2003, Skynet sold its North American satellite fleet (Telstars 5 through 8 and 13) to Intelsat; they were renamed Intelsat Americas 5–8 and 13. This was done to help reduce debt after its parent, Loral Space & Communications, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 15, 2003. As part of the agreement, Skynet was precluded from competing in the North American market until March 18, 2006. In June 2007, Loral Space & Communications made an unsuccessful bid to acquire Intelsat. [1][dead link]
History[edit]
Telesat began as Telesat Canada, a Canadian Crown corporation created by an Act of Parliament in 1969.[3]
Telesat launched Anik A1 in 1972 as the world's first domestic communications satellite in geostationary orbit, operated by a commercial company. The satellite was retired from use in 1981.
Until February 1979, Telesat had a legal monopoly on earth stations in Canada: any entity wishing send or receive satellite signals had to sign a long-term lease with Telesat for an earth station; contracts for such leases were still enforced after the monopoly was ended.
Telesat was sold by the federal government to Bell in 1998.[4]
On December 18, 2006, Loral Space & Communications announced that it, along with Canada's Public Sector Pension Investment Board (PSP Investments), would acquire Telesat for US$2.8b.[5]
On November 17, 2010: Telesat Holdings Inc. hired JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse Group AG to start a formal sales process and offer so-called staple financing to interest buyers for $6 billion to $7 billion.[6]

Telesat Canada is a Canadian satellite communications company founded on May 2, 1969. The company is headquartered in Ottawa, Ontario as well as having offices in the United States and Brazil.
On October 5, 2007 Loral Space & Communications Inc. and the Public Sector Pension Investment Board of Canada received the final regulatory approval necessary to complete the acquisition of Telesat from BCE Inc. for CAD $3.25 billion. The acquisition closed on October 31, 2007, with Loral owning 64 percent of Telesat.
At the same time, Telesat Canada merged with Loral Skynet, a subsidiary of Loral Space & Communications. Loral Skynet was a full-service global satellite operator headquartered in Bedminster, New Jersey. This resulted in the transfer of all of the assets of Loral Skynet to Telesat.

Services[edit]
The company is now the fourth-largest fixed satellite services provider in the world. It owns a fleet of satellites, with others under construction, and operates additional satellites for other entities.
Telesat carries Canada's two major DBS providers signals: Bell TV and Shaw Direct, as well as more than 200 of Canada's television channels.
Telesat's Anik F2 carries a KA band spot beam payload for satellite Internet access for Wildblue users in the United States and Xplornet users in Canada.[1][2] The KA band system uses spot beams to manage bandwidth concerns, linking to multiple satellite ground stations connected to the Internet.
Skynet’s customers included HBO, Disney, Cable & Wireless, Singapore Telecom, Connexion by Boeing, Global Crossing, BT North America, Globecomm Systems, UPC and China Central Television. These are now Telesat customers.
Loral Skynet provided a wide range of video and data transmission services. It became a subsidiary of Loral Space & Communications when Loral acquired it in 1997 from AT&T Corporation.
Skynet’s fleet consists of Telstars-11N, -12, -14R (Estrela do Sul 2), and -18. In 2003, Skynet sold its North American satellite fleet (Telstars 5 through 8 and 13) to Intelsat; they were renamed Intelsat Americas 5–8 and 13. This was done to help reduce debt after its parent, Loral Space & Communications, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 15, 2003. As part of the agreement, Skynet was precluded from competing in the North American market until March 18, 2006. In June 2007, Loral Space & Communications made an unsuccessful bid to acquire Intelsat. [1][dead link]
History[edit]
Telesat began as Telesat Canada, a Canadian Crown corporation created by an Act of Parliament in 1969.[3]
Telesat launched Anik A1 in 1972 as the world's first domestic communications satellite in geostationary orbit, operated by a commercial company. The satellite was retired from use in 1981.
Until February 1979, Telesat had a legal monopoly on earth stations in Canada: any entity wishing send or receive satellite signals had to sign a long-term lease with Telesat for an earth station; contracts for such leases were still enforced after the monopoly was ended.
Telesat was sold by the federal government to Bell in 1998.[4]
On December 18, 2006, Loral Space & Communications announced that it, along with Canada's Public Sector Pension Investment Board (PSP Investments), would acquire Telesat for US$2.8b.[5]
On November 17, 2010: Telesat Holdings Inc. hired JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse Group AG to start a formal sales process and offer so-called staple financing to interest buyers for $6 billion to $7 billion.[6]

Telesat Canada is a Canadian satellite communications company founded on May 2, 1969. The company is headquartered in Ottawa, Ontario as well as having offices in the United States and Brazil.
On October 5, 2007 Loral Space & Communications Inc. and the Public Sector Pension Investment Board of Canada received the final regulatory approval necessary to complete the acquisition of Telesat from BCE Inc. for CAD $3.25 billion. The acquisition closed on October 31, 2007, with Loral owning 64 percent of Telesat.
At the same time, Telesat Canada merged with Loral Skynet, a subsidiary of Loral Space & Communications. Loral Skynet was a full-service global satellite operator headquartered in Bedminster, New Jersey. This resulted in the transfer of all of the assets of Loral Skynet to Telesat.

Services[edit]
The company is now the fourth-largest fixed satellite services provider in the world. It owns a fleet of satellites, with others under construction, and operates additional satellites for other entities.
Telesat carries Canada's two major DBS providers signals: Bell TV and Shaw Direct, as well as more than 200 of Canada's television channels.
Telesat's Anik F2 carries a KA band spot beam payload for satellite Internet access for Wildblue users in the United States and Xplornet users in Canada.[1][2] The KA band system uses spot beams to manage bandwidth concerns, linking to multiple satellite ground stations connected to the Internet.
Skynet’s customers included HBO, Disney, Cable & Wireless, Singapore Telecom, Connexion by Boeing, Global Crossing, BT North America, Globecomm Systems, UPC and China Central Television. These are now Telesat customers.
Loral Skynet provided a wide range of video and data transmission services. It became a subsidiary of Loral Space & Communications when Loral acquired it in 1997 from AT&T Corporation.
Skynet’s fleet consists of Telstars-11N, -12, -14R (Estrela do Sul 2), and -18. In 2003, Skynet sold its North American satellite fleet (Telstars 5 through 8 and 13) to Intelsat; they were renamed Intelsat Americas 5–8 and 13. This was done to help reduce debt after its parent, Loral Space & Communications, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 15, 2003. As part of the agreement, Skynet was precluded from competing in the North American market until March 18, 2006. In June 2007, Loral Space & Communications made an unsuccessful bid to acquire Intelsat. [1][dead link]
History[edit]
Telesat began as Telesat Canada, a Canadian Crown corporation created by an Act of Parliament in 1969.[3]
Telesat launched Anik A1 in 1972 as the world's first domestic communications satellite in geostationary orbit, operated by a commercial company. The satellite was retired from use in 1981.
Until February 1979, Telesat had a legal monopoly on earth stations in Canada: any entity wishing send or receive satellite signals had to sign a long-term lease with Telesat for an earth station; contracts for such leases were still enforced after the monopoly was ended.
Telesat was sold by the federal government to Bell in 1998.[4]
On December 18, 2006, Loral Space & Communications announced that it, along with Canada's Public Sector Pension Investment Board (PSP Investments), would acquire Telesat for US$2.8b.[5]
On November 17, 2010: Telesat Holdings Inc. hired JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse Group AG to start a formal sales process and offer so-called staple financing to interest buyers for $6 billion to $7 billion.[6]

Telesat Canada Reports Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the Second Quarter and Six Months Ended June 30, 2017
Jul 25 17
Telesat Canada reported unaudited consolidated earnings results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2017. For the quarter, the company reported revenue of CAD 225,982,000 against CAD 231,686,000 a year ago. Operating income was 119,291,000 against CAD 125,998,000 a year ago. Income before tax was CAD 165,400,000 against CAD 80,900,000 a year ago. Net income was CAD 147,634,000 against CAD 61,729,000 a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was CAD 183,637,000 against CAD 191,105,000 a year ago. The decline in revenue was primarily due to short-term services provided to another satellite operator in the second quarter of 2016, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rate changes on the conversion of U.S. dollar revenue, as the U.S. dollar was approximately 5% stronger on average against the Canadian dollar than it was during the second quarter of 2016.

For the six months, the company reported revenue of CAD 460,651,000 against CAD 466,619,000 a year ago. Operating income was 236,029,000 against CAD 248,685,000 a year ago. Income before tax was CAD 268,589,000 against CAD 338,196,000 a year ago. Net income was CAD 235,617,000 against CAD 299,095,000 a year ago.

Purchase of intangible assets was CAD 12,653,000 against CAD 36,745,000 a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was CAD 375,872,000 against CAD 382,096,000 a year ago.

              Why Satellite?            




 






	An Introduction to the Technology and Services
There are more than 1000 operational satellites in varying orbits around the earth, including satellites used for:

		Communications & Broadcasting

		Military & Reconnaissance

		Meteorology

		Navigation

		Imaging & Remote Sensing

		Research
Communications & broadcasting satellites typically orbit above the equator at about 35,800 kilometers (22,300 miles) in what is called the “geostationary arc.” From this arc, the satellite appears to remain in a fixed location above the earth – a highly desirable feature that enables antennas on the ground to point to (or access) the satellite without tracking its movement, and then receive or transmit communications signals.
Because geostationary (GEO) satellites operate at a very high altitude above the equator, a single satellite can cover, or see, approximately one-third of the earth’s surface. This makes GEO communications satellites extremely powerful for broadcasting content such as TV programs. One GEO satellite can cover continents (e.g., North & South America), and three can fully cover the earth (except for the extreme northern and southern latitudes).
GEO satellites are often described by their longitudinal orbital location, or “slot”, such as Telesat’s Anik F1 at 107.3 degrees West longitude. The orbital slot designations of “East” and “West” are in relation to the Prime Meridian that passes through Greenwich, London, United Kingdom.
There are more than 200 GEO communications and broadcasting satellites in orbit today around the world. Main frequencies are:

	C-band –First band to be used in the commercial satcom industry

		Uses 3.7 to 4.2 GHz frequency band for transmissions from the satellite to the receive earth terminal

		Consistent frequency allocation worldwide with low-cost and well-proven earth station equipment

		Supports video broadcasting (cable and over-the-air), and telecom trunking

		Minimally affected by atmospheric conditions

		Telesat was the first to use C-band in a domestic GEO communications satellite
		 

	Ku-band – Growth began in the 1980s

		Uses frequency sub-bands in the range 10.95-11.2; 11.45-11.7; 11.7-12.2; and 12.25-12.75 GHz frequency band for transmissions from the satellite to the receive terminal and allows for smaller dishes

		Supports satellite Direct-to-Home (DTH) and VSAT networking

		Still growing rapidly in most world regions; mature in North America and Europe

		Some atmospheric effects, particularly in tropical regions

		Telesat was the first in the world to commercialize Ku-band on the Anik B satellite
		 

	Ka-band – Growth began in the 2000s

		Uses frequency sub-bands in the range 17.7GHz to 21.2 GHz for transmissions from the satellite to the receive terminal

		Ka frequencies have the shortest wavelength of the three commercial fixed satellite bands and are most affected by atmospheric absorption

		Short wavelengths allow for multiple spot beams each of which concentrates the satellite power into a small geographic area

		Spot beam Ka-band satellites are well suited for two-way broadband services such as high speed Internet access for homes and small businesses

		Major consumer broadband services using advanced Ka-band satellites are underway in both North America and Europe

		Ka-band spot beams can also support distribution of regional or local broadcast programming and interactive television services

		Telesat was the first in the world to successfully commercialize consumer Ka-band broadband services using the Anik F2 satellite
