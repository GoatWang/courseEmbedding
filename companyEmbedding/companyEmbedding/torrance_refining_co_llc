                PBF CEO Tom Nimbley  spoke at the transition ceremony for the new Torrance Refining Company as it takes over the ExxonMobil plant in Torrance. July 1, 2016. (Brad Graverson / Staff Photographer)
                







PBF Energy officially assumed ownership Friday of the ExxonMobil Torrance Refinery, bringing an end to the oil giant’s catastrophic final 15 months in charge of the aging plant after a February 2015 explosion shattered the confidence of residents in the company’s ability to operate it safely. PBF unveiled new white-and-blue signs at a brief ribbon-cutting ceremony Friday, while pledging to operate the plant, now called the Torrance Refining Co. Refinery, in a safe, reliable and environmentally responsible manner. 



“I really have empathy for the people of Torrance,” said CEO and Chairman Tom Nimbley. “It’s been a difficult 18 months for them. Torrance was always viewed as the best refinery in the state. It’s our intention to get it back to that level.”The pledge of reliability was put to the test early when company and city officials struggled to remove a securely fastened covering to unveil the sign; a burly worker eventually gave it the requisite hard tug to finish the job.Assemblyman David Hadley put the event in context in a statement read by former Councilman Tom Brewer, now a member of the Republican’s district staff.



“Let’s be honest about this,” he said. “This is not a celebration; it’s a transition. This is not a victory lap; it’s a chance for a new beginning here in Torrance and we’re cheering you on to succeed.“Your predecessor lost significant confidence and goodwill in the community in recent years,” Hadley’s statement said. “It’s sad to say this, but that’s true. We want you to succeed and we’ll cheer you on, but we want you first and foremost to protect the safety of the people in the South Bay.”ExxonMobil’s safety record since the blast frightened many members of the community and prompted the formation of no fewer than three grass-roots groups that are demanding safety improvements.



Both state and federal investigators have blamed ExxonMobil for the blast, including citing a deliberate decision not to fix equipment the company knew could cause a life-threatening explosion.The state has fined the company more than $500,000, while the U.S. Chemical Safety Board issued subpoenas to the company in an effort to uncover more information in the blast’s wake.ExxonMobil has appealed the fine and numerous state citations, while also ignoring some CSB subpoenas, much to the anger of politicians like Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Manhattan Beach, a former Torrance City Council member.

The South Coast Air Quality Management District also is conducting a study to determine whether an alternative to extremely toxic modified hydrofluoric acid is viable for use at the refinery. The acid forms a toxic ground-hugging gas at room temperature that could kill thousands in the densely populated area during an accidental release.CSB officials have said a catastrophic release of the acid was only averted during the explosion when debris hit scaffolding erected for future maintenance around a large vessel containing MHF.



ExxonMobil has only reluctantly communicated with city residents since the explosion, largely when compelled to by government officials holding public hearings on the explosion.No ExxonMobil official played a formal role in Friday’s ribbon-cutting, although a member of its public relations staff was on hand to take photos.Public confidence was further eroded by a series of relatively minor accidents since the 1.7-magnitude blast that literally rocked the city, showered neighborhoods with industrial debris and increased gas pump prices.



The incidents included an accidental release of highly toxic modified hydrofluoric acid and, just last week, the collapse of a 300-ton crane. PBF already has taken steps to improve community outreach.Workers Friday were seen tending to the unkempt landscaping around the refinery. That was a source of complaints by community leaders before last year’s explosion convinced many they had bigger problems to deal with at the plant than aesthetics.PBF has also used delays in the ownership transfer — originally scheduled to close in the first quarter — to reach out to a variety of community organizations, including “a lot of groups our predecessor did not have a dialogue with,” said Jeffrey Dill, president of PBF Energy Western Region LLC.



“Everything falls into place when the refinery is running reliably, people are kept safe, we are a good member of the community, and that’s the place we want to be,” Dill said.In addition, PBF has committed to an independent third-party review of the refinery to see if any improvements are recommended and plans to extend an automated monitoring system of the MHF unit to the city Fire Department, Dill said. That monitoring system is already tied in to equipment at the AQMD.With the $537.5 million purchase of the 155,000-barrel-per-day refinery that was announced last year, PBF increases its refining capacity to about 900,000 barrels of crude a day, making it North America’s fourth-largest independent refiner.



In addition to the 750-acre north Torrance refinery, PBF has acquired a network of pipelines, storage facilities and distribution terminals.Those pipelines send crude oil from the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles to the refinery, while jet fuel is sent from the refinery to Los Angeles International Airport.PBF also acquired a 171-mile crude gathering and transportation system, which delivers San Joaquin Valley crude oil directly from the oil field to the refinery.Dill said PBF plans further investment to improve the refinery. Next year a major maintenance project is planned to overhaul the half of the refinery that wasn’t shut down by the explosion.



PBF stock closed Friday at $24.06 on the New York Stock Exchange, up 28 cents.

2206, 2017Electrical Reliability ProjectThe Torrance Refining Company LLC entered into an agreement with the South Coast Air Quality Management District to improve Southern California Edison’s (SCE) electrical reliability to the Torrance Refinery (refinery), which will minimize refinery flaring from SCE-related power outages.
Click here to view the project update provided at the Torrance City Council Refinery Workshop on February 28, 2017 under Agenda Item 6B.
About the Torrance Refinery Electrical Reliability Project: 

The refinery’s portion of the project will be built to meet California Electrical Code and Industry Standards.
The permanent solution will address SCE’s electrical supply issues.
SCE will install and connect to their system via new 220 kV underground cables to new 220kV switching station on refinery property.
The SCE 220 kV system connection is on SCE right of way.
Torrance Refining Company will install new 220 kV cables and transformers connecting the new SCE switching station to the existing refinery electrical distribution system. This Phase I is expected to improve SCE’s reliability.
In Phase II, Torrance Refining Company will install new local substations and perform upgrades/modifications to the plant’s electrical distribution system, which will be scheduled to coincide with future unit shutdowns to support continued safe, reliable and environmentally responsible operations.
The project is currently in the permit approval process.

PBF Energy (“PBF”) is one of the largest independent petroleum refiners and suppliers of unbranded transportation fuels, heating oil, petrochemical feedstocks, lubricants and other petroleum products in the United States. PBF currently owns and operates five domestic oil refineries and related assets with a combined processing capacity, known as throughput, of approximately 900,000 bpd, and a weighted average Nelson Complexity Index of 12.2.
PBF Energy’s refineries are located in California, Delaware, Louisiana, New Jersey and Ohio. Our newest refinery is located in Torrance, California processes a blend of primarily heavy and medium crudes to produce a high-value product slate.  The Torrance refinery has a nameplate crude capacity of 155,000 barrels per day and is PBF’s most complex refinery with a Nelson Complexity index of 14.9.  The Chalmette refinery was acquired by PBF Energy in 2015 and is located just outside of New Orleans, Louisiana. Chalmette is a 189,000 barrel per day, dual-train coking refinery with a Nelson Complexity of 12.7 and is capable of processing both light and heavy crude oil. The facility is strategically positioned on the Gulf Coast with strong logistics connectivity that offers flexible raw material sourcing and product distribution opportunities, including the potential to export products.  Our East Coast refineries, at Delaware City and Paulsboro, have a combined refining capacity of 370,000 bpd and Nelson Complexity Indices of 11.3 and 13.2, respectively. These high-conversion refineries process primarily medium and heavy, sour crudes and have historically received the bulk of their feedstock via ships and barges on the Delaware River but have the capability to receive crude shipments via rail into crude rail unloading facilities at our Delaware City refinery.  Our Midcontinent refinery, at Toledo, processes light, sweet crude, has a throughput capacity of 170,000 bpd and a Nelson Complexity Index of 9.2. The majority of Toledo’s WTI-based crude is delivered via pipelines that originate in both Canada and the United States. Since our acquisition of Toledo in 2011, we have added additional truck and rail crude unloading capabilities that provide feedstock sourcing flexibility for the refinery and enables Toledo to run a more cost-advantaged crude slate.
PBF Energy also owns 49.5% of PBF Logistics LP (NYSE: PBFX). PBF Logistics LP, headquartered in Parsippany, New Jersey, is a fee-based, growth-oriented master limited partnership formed by PBF Energy to own or lease, operate, develop and acquire crude oil and refined petroleum products, terminals, pipelines, storage facilities and similar logistics assets.

Fire hits Torrance refinery in California 








HOUSTON, Feb. 20


02/20/2017


By
Robert Brelsford

OGJ Downstream Technology Editor






































South Coast Air Quality Management District and Torrance Refining Co. LLC (TORC), a subsidiary of PBF Energy Inc., Parsippany, NJ, are investigating the cause of a weekend fire at TORC’s 155,000-b/d refinery in Torrance, Calif.
The localized fire, which broke out at about 6:00 a.m. local time on Feb. 18 in a crude unit, was quickly contained by plant personnel and extinguished within 30 min with help from the Torrance Fire Department, SCAQMD said in a series of releases.
No injuries occurred as a result of the fire, but the refinery did have to burn excess gases through a flare stack, causing excess air pollution in the area, according to SCAQMD, which remained on site throughout the day to investigate the incident.
Other than the affected unit, the refinery continues to operate, but a cause of the fire still remains under investigation, said SCAQMD, which has called for a special hearing to discuss concerns about impacts to air quality resulting from a series of recent upsets at the processing site.
“I’m very disappointed in the frequency of breakdowns, [unplanned] flaring, accidents, and fires at the Torrance refinery, and I’m concerned about the impact of these incidents to community residents,” SCAQMD Governing Board Chairman William A. Burke said in Feb. 19 release.








Last year, power interruptions led to three unplanned flaring events at the Torrance manufacturing site in March, September, and October, the latter of which required the city of Torrance to issue a temporary shelter-in-place order as well as SCAQMD to issue TORC a notice of violation for causing a public nuisance after receiving 67 complaints from nearby residents, according to the agency.
SCAQMD also referenced the February 2015 explosion and subsequent fire at the refinery under former owner ExxonMobil Corp., which shuttered the plant’s fluid catalytic cracker for more than a year and nearly resulted in a release of hydrofluoric acid into the surrounding area (OGJ Online, May 11, 2016; Feb. 19, 2015).
“The refinery must step up its efforts to reduce the frequency and severity of these episodes,” Burke said.
SCAQMD, the regulatory agency responsible for air-pollution control for all of Orange County as well as portions of Los Angeles, Riverside, and San Bernardino counties, said it will announce plans in the coming days for the proposed special community hearing.
Awkward timing
The Feb. 18 fire comes just days after TORC agreed to an SCAQMD administrative order that requires the refinery to help reduce air pollution by taking specific steps to improve the plant’s ability to better withstand power interruptions that could result in flaring incidents.
Adopted at a Feb. 15 SCAQMD hearing, the order of abatement stipulates the Torrance refinery must meet specified timelines to enhance its backup power capability as well as demonstrate the reliability improvements that will stem from TORC’s proposal to construct a dedicated underground power supply line at the site, the agency said in a Feb.16 release.
While SCAQMD acknowledged the complexity of the refinery and electrical grid system means the process of installing an underground power line could take 7-8 years with costs in excess of $10 million, the administrative order requires the refinery to meet the following milestones and deadlines:
• Within 90 days, complete a public outreach and community relations plan, including updates to the Torrance City Council and the Torrance Refinery Community Advisory Panel.
• Within 180 days, develop a computer model to demonstrate how proposed upgrades from the current 66-kv electrical system to a 220-kv system will improve electrical reliability at the refinery.
• Within 180 days, provide refresher training and simulations for refinery workers for procedures during loss of power.
• Provide evidence that existing backup power supply systems are maintained and working.
• Within 270 days, complete evaluations of critical safety devices and certain utility systems, and within 365 days of completing the evaluations, implement improvements identified.
SCAQMD’s hearing board will conduct a status hearing on Sept. 7 to review the refinery’s progress in meeting the order’s initial milestones and deadlines, the agency said.

PBF Energy closes deal for California refinery, related assets








HOUSTON, July 7


07/07/2016


By
Robert Brelsford

OGJ Downstream Technology Editor






































PBF Holding Co. LLC, a subsidiary of PBF Energy Inc., Parsippany, NJ, has completed its acquisition of ExxonMobil Corp.’s 155,000-b/d Torrance, Calif., refinery, and related logistics assets (OGJ Online, Oct. 1, 2015).
Upon the deal’s July 1 closing, PBF Energy took 100% ownership of the Torrance refinery as well as a network of crude and product pipelines, product distribution terminals, and storage facilities, including a 171-mile crude gathering and transportation system that delivers the refinery its main feedstock of San Joaquin Valley crude directly from the field, PBF Energy said.
Alongside a shell capacity of 8.6 million bbl in on site crude, intermediate, and finished product storage at the refinery, the purchase also includes several pipelines that provide the plant access to imported crude supplies arriving at the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles.
PBF Energy paid a $537.5 million plus an estimated working capital of $460.9 million for the assets, the company said.
With the addition of the Torrance refinery to its refining operations, PBF Energy now operates five US refineries with a combined crude processing capacity of 900,000 b/d to become North America’s fourth-largest independent refiner.
Last year, PBF Energy closed a deal with ExxonMobil and Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) for the purchase of former ExxonMobil-PDVSA joint venture Chalmette Refining LLC’s 189,000-b/d refinery in Chalmette, La., outside of New Orleans (OGJ Online, Nov. 2, 2015).
