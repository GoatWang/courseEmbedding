Private and Hedged Investments to Build Better Portfolios
Hatteras Funds provides unique alternative investment solutions for Financial Advisors and their Clients.  We help our clients build better portfolios.
We invest on behalf of clients across alternative investment strategies, such as private equity, private real estate and hedged investments.  We design, build, and manage portfolios that include allocations to one or multiple alternative strategies.

What are private investments?
Investment strategies that involve the purchase of securities in private transactions.
Our private investment solutions are designed to provide return enhancement.  We look to build diversified portfolios that invest across multiple stages including growth, venture capital, buyout, and distressed and mezzanine debt strategies.
The structure of our Evergreen Private Investments Platform seeks to simplify the process associated with initiating and maintaining a diversified private investment program.  Our platform expands access to a greater number of investors and provides Asset Allocators a solution for reaching one’s target private investments allocation.
What are hedged investments?
Hedged investments are vehicles that invest long and short in public markets.
Our hedged investments are designed to provide risk mitigation to portfolios and are diversified across manager, strategy, and geography. The strategies include equity hedges, fixed income hedges, absolute return, and managed futures. Solutions may also focus on small emerging managers. Clients may choose single-strategy or multi-strategy portfolios based on their investment goals and needs.

Disclosures
When considering alternative investments, you should consider various risks, including the fact that some products use leverage and other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss, can be illiquid, are not required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors, may involve complex tax structures and delays in distributing important tax information, are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds, often charge high fees, and, in many cases, the underlying investments are not transparent and are known only to the investment manager. With respect to alternative investments in general, you should be aware that returns from some alternative investments can be volatile and you may lose all or a portion of your investment.
Past performance of any investment is not necessarily indicative of future results. You should only commit risk capital to a fund investment. Alternative investment products, including hedge funds, are not for everyone and entail risks that are different from more traditional investments. You should obtain investment and tax advice from your advisors before deciding to invest.

Performance results and calculations after the Funds’ most recent fiscal year are unaudited. The principal value of the Funds will fluctuate so that an investor’s units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Returns are net of all expenses of the Funds, including the management fee and incentive allocations, and reflect reinvestment of all distributions, if applicable.

Past performance does not guarantee future results and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures shown.

Important Disclosures
This is not an offering to subscribe for units in any fund and is intended for informational purposes only. An offering can only be made by delivery of the Prospectus to “qualified clients” within the meaning of U.S. securities laws. The Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund, L.P.; the Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Fund, L.P; the Hatteras Core Alternatives Institutional Fund, L.P.; and the Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Institutional Fund, L.P. (collectively referred to herein as the “Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund” or the “Fund”) are Delaware limited partnerships that are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”), as amended, as non-diversified, closed-end management investment companies whose units are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund is a fund of alternative investments. As such, the Fund invests in private hedge funds and private equity investments. Hedge funds are speculative investments and are not suitable for all investors, nor do they represent a complete investment program. A hedge fund can be described generally as a private and unregistered investment pool that accepts investors’ money and employs hedging and arbitrage techniques using long and short positions, leverage and derivatives, and investments in many markets.
Key Risk Factors
The Fund, through an investment in the Master Fund, will invest substantially all of its assets in underlying funds that are generally not registered as investment companies under the 1940 Act and, therefore, the Fund will not have the benefit of various protections provided under the 1940 Act with respect to an investment in those underlying funds. The Fund can be highly volatile, carry substantial fees, and involve complex tax structures. Investments in the Fund involves a high degree of risk, including loss of entire capital. The underlying funds may engage in speculative investment strategies and practices, such as the use of leverage, short sales, and derivatives transactions, which can increase the risk of investment loss. The Fund provides limited liquidity, and units in the Funds are not transferable. Liquidity will be provided only through repurchase offers made by the Fund from time to time, generally on a quarterly basis upon prior written notice.
The success of the Fund is highly dependent on the financial and managerial expertise of its principals and key personnel of the Fund’s investment manager. Although the investment manager for the Fund expects to receive detailed information from each underlying fund on a regular basis regarding its valuation, investment performance, and strategy, in most cases the investment manager has little or no means of independently verifying this information. The underlying funds are not required to provide transparency with respect to their respective investments. By investing in the underlying funds indirectly through the Fund, investors will be subject to a dual layer of fees, both at the Fund and underlying fund levels. Certain underlying funds will not provide final Schedule K-1s for any fiscal year before April 15th of the following year. Those funds, however, will endeavor to provide estimates of taxable income or losses with respect to their investments. Please see the Prospectus for a detailed discussion of the specific risks disclosed here and other important risks and considerations.

About Us


Hatteras Funds provides unique alternative investment solutions for Financial Advisors and their Clients. We help our clients build better portfolios.  We believe that all investors should have access to the same sophisticated investment approach and superior portfolio management talent as the largest institutions. As a boutique alternative investment firm founded in 2003, we offer a suite of innovative products designed to help Financial Advisors allocate to alternative investments.






A Message From Our Founder
David B. Perkins
Founder and Chief Executive OfficerHow badly do you want something? Do you want it so badly you’ll overcome any obstacle that might keep you from your goal?
As a financial advisor, my goal was to find a solution. The question that kept me up at night was how could I put together a program that would allow my clients to invest in the same strategies and managers utilized by the largest endowments and institutions?
I’m an intense and passionate guy. I don't like to accept the status quo without searching for something better. 
Alternatives like hedge funds and fund of hedge funds were widely available. But in order to construct an efficient, highly diversified, institutional-quality portfolio that mirrored the university endowment model, we had to find a way to add private equity to the mix.
Everywhere I turned the reaction was the same: “Can’t be done.”
Instead of listening to the naysayers, we rolled up our sleeves and focused on making it happen. Not by doing the same old, same old, but by bringing a different perspective to the table. We focused on finding a breach in the system.  It always starts with listening to Advisors.
Having been on that side, understanding the difficulties Advisors had in implementing alternatives, led us to simplify and streamline the process. In removing barriers to entry, our focus is on solutions, not product. For that reason, I like to think that Advisors who know alternatives, know Hatteras.
We are committed to helping you produce better outcomes. Your understanding of asset allocation and alternatives puts you in the unique position to advise clients with confidence.
When you partner with us, you should feel like you’re our only client. If you don’t, you should fire us. It may seem glib, but it drives us.
Our entire organization, including me, is here to work with you to help build the trust that’s so important to your practice. We are dedicated to serving Advisors through identifying and providing solutions.
