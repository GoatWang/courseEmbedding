Innocoll Holdings plc Requests NASDAQ To File Form 25 With SEC To Delist And Deregister Shares

Jul 24 17
Innocoll Holdings plc, (“Innocoll” or the “Company”), entered into a Transaction Agreement on April 4, 2017 (the “Transaction Agreement”) by and among the Company, Gurnet Point L.P. (acting through its general partner Waypoint International GP LLC ) (“Gurnet Point”) through its wholly owned subsidiary Lough Ree Technologies Limited (“Gurnet Bidco”). On July 24, 2017, pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreement, Gurnet Bidco acquired Innocoll by means of a scheme of arrangement under Chapter 1 of Part 9 of the Irish Companies Act 2014 (the “Scheme”). As a result of the completion of the Acquisition, Gurnet Bidco now owns the Company, and the Company’s shareholders of record as of immediately prior to the completion of the Acquisition, are entitled to receive (i) $1.75 in cash and (ii) a contingent value right which represents a contractual right to receive payments up to a maximum aggregate amount of $4.90 in cash upon, and subject to, the occurrence of certain CVR Payment Events, for each ordinary share of the Company owned by them immediately prior to the completion of the Acquisition. As contemplated by the Transaction Agreement, the Company notified the NASDAQ Global Market (“NASDAQ”) of the Scheme becoming effective and requested that the trading of the Shares be suspended prior to opening of trading on July 24, 2017.  In addition, the Company requested that NASDAQ file with the SEC a notification of removal from listing on Form 25 to effect the delisting of the Shares on the NASDAQ and the deregistration of the Shares under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).  The Company intends to file with the SEC a certification on Form 15 under the Exchange Act, requesting the suspension of the Company’s reporting obligations under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act.


Innocoll Holdings plc Intends To Request NASDAQ To File Form 25 With SEC To Delist And Deregister Shares Upon Completion Of Acquisition By Gurnet Point
Jul 21 17
Innocoll Holdings plc announced that the High Court of Ireland has approved the acquisition of Innocoll by Gurnet Point L.P. (acting through its general partner Waypoint International GP LLC) ("Gurnet Point") through its wholly owned subsidiary Lough Ree Technologies Limited ("Gurnet Bidco") by means of a scheme of arrangement under Chapter 1 of Part 9 of the Companies Act 2014 (the "Scheme"). The court sanction hearing in relation to the Scheme (the Court Sanction Hearing) was held on July 21, 2017 at which the High Court of Ireland sanctioned the Scheme pursuant to Sections 449 to 455 of the Companies Act 2014 and confirmed the related reduction of capital. Accordingly, the Scheme is expected to take effect on 24 July 2017. In connection with the completion of the Acquisition, Innocoll intends to request that the NASDAQ (i) suspend the trading and the listing of Innocoll's ordinary shares on the NASDAQ before the market opens on the effective date of the Scheme, and (ii) file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a notification of removal from listing on Form 25 to delist Innocoll’s ordinary shares.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

About Us








WHAT IF...


the right blend of people plus pharmaceutical innovation could provide solutions to redefine today’s medicines? At Innocoll, our focus on engineering collagen-based products and medicines—for better patient outcomes—begins with our people.









Innocoll is dedicated to making better happen — finding solutions to help patients reduce pain associated with surgeries and to treat limb-threatening infections.
Our proprietary, biocompatible, and biodegradable collagen-based products are engineered for targeted use. Applied locally to wound and/or surgery sites, they are designed to provide a range of treatment benefits. 
Our late-stage product pipeline is focused on addressing a number of significant unmet medical needs: INL-001, bioresorbable bupivacaine HCI collagen-matrix implants (Phase III completed), in development for  postsurgical analgesia; INL-002, a gentamicin collagen-matrix patch, in development for the treatment of diabetic foot infections (Phase III completed); and INL-003, a bioresorbable collagen film surgical adhesion barrier (approved ex-US), in development for the prevention of postsurgical adhesions. 
Our currently approved products include: COLLAGUARD® (ex-US), COLLATAMP® G, SEPTOCOLL® E, REGENEPRO®, COLLACARE®, COLLEXA®, and ZORPREVA®, some of which are sold globally through strategic partnerships. All of our collagen products—from extraction/purification of Type 1 collagen through final delivery— are manufactured at our certified, integrated plant in Saal, Germany.

Since 1985, Innocoll has ensured consistency and quality of all of its products by engineering and manufacturing within its own facility in Saal, Germany.
We recently fully integrated our manufacturing capabilities at our newly constructed state-of-the-art facility, beginning with the extraction and purification of the Type 1 collagen (from bovine and equine Achilles tendons), which is further processed using one of our proprietary technologies to produce final finished products in the forms of matrices, films, powders, liquids, and gels. Our facility in Germany is cGMPs compliant. The facility is also ISO 13485 certified.

Completes Acquisition of Innocoll Holdings plcBusiness WireJuly 24, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareCAMBRIDGE, Mass. & ATHLONE, Ireland--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Gurnet Point L.P., a healthcare investment fund, and Innocoll Holdings plc (INNL), a global pharmaceutical and medical device company, today announced that Gurnet Point has completed its acquisition of Innocoll. As a result, Innocoll’s shares (INNL) will no longer be traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market as of today.Under the terms of the agreement, Gurnet Point will acquire Innocoll for $1.75 per share in cash, and up to $4.90 in cash from a contingent value right (CVR), for a total potential per share value of up to $6.65 or up to approximately $209 million in aggregate.As previously announced, Gurnet Point is providing a $10 million term loan to provide the additional resources needed for the continued development of XARACOLL, Innocoll’s late-stage surgically implantable and bioresorbable collagen matrix, within the post-operative pain market. The term loan will provide the additional capital needed to prepare for the re-submission of the XARACOLL new drug application (“NDA”) to the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (“FDA”) in order to achieve the milestones related to the CVR.“With the close of this transaction, we are excited by the prospect of helping to develop and bring XARACOLL to the market and we look forward to assisting with the re-submission of XARACOLL for FDA approval and preparing for its commercialization," Christopher Viehbacher, Managing Partner at Gurnet Point Capital. We are looking forward to working closely with Innocoll’s management team to identify XARACOLL’s path to commercialization.Mr. Viehbacher concluded, “This transaction supports Gurnet Point’s strategy of deploying long-term capital in life sciences, medical technology and healthcare services companies across all stages of development through to commercialization. It builds on Gurnet Point’s track record of partnering with companies seeking long-term partners to develop and implement transformative technologies and health care solutions.”Tony Zook, Chief Executive Officer of Innocoll, said, “We are excited to begin our work with Gurnet Point with the aim of successfully filing and commercializing XARACOLL in the U.S. market. Gurnet Point’s deep knowledge of value-driven drug development, regulatory affairs and clinical trial design and execution will provide us with the opportunity to ultimately bring XARACOLL to patients.”About Gurnet Point CapitalGurnet Point Capital (GPC) is a unique health care fund founded by Ernesto Bertarelli and led by Christopher A. Viehbacher, who, together, have decades of expertise in an industry for which they share a passion, both as Chief Executives and as investors. With an initial allocation of $2 billion, GPC is investing long-term capital and supporting entrepreneurs in building a new generation of companies. Based in Cambridge, MA, its remit is global, encompassing life sciences and medical technologies. The fund invests across all stages of product development through to commercialisation and does so with an approach that is a hybrid of venture and private equity investing strategies. This approach is governed by a guiding tenet that even the earliest of technologies must present a clear commercial case, benefiting both patients and the healthcare system as a whole.About Innocoll Holdings plcInnocoll is a global, commercial stage specialty pharmaceutical and medical device company with late stage development programs targeting areas of significant unmet medical need.
