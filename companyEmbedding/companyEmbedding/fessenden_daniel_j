Daniel J. Fessenden

Daniel
J. Fessenden has served as a
Director of the Company since 2009 and as a Director of Tompkins Trust Company since
January 2009. Mr. Fessenden served as a member of the New York State Assembly
from 1993 to 1999. He currently serves as the Executive Director of the Fred L.
Emerson Foundation, a fourth-generation family foundation located in Auburn,
New York. From 2004 to 2006 he served as the founding Executive Director of the
Cornell Agriculture & Food Technology Park, Geneva, New York. Prior to
2004, Mr. Fessenden served as a key member of the government relations team for
the Carrier Corporation, Syracuse, New York. Mr. Fessenden has been actively
engaged with various business, civic and educational organizations throughout
the Central New York region for more than 25 years.  In addition to serving as a director of
Midstate Mutual Insurance Company, he also serves on the board of Seward House
Museum, Wells College, American Agriculturist Foundation and several other
charitable organizations.  We believe Mr.
Fessenden’s qualifications to sit on our Board of Directors include his
extensive experience in government and public service (as well as executive
experience in the private sector), his active engagement with civic
organizations, and his deep connections to the Central New York business
community.

Daniel
J. Fessenden has served as a
Director of the Company since 2009 and as a Director of Tompkins Trust Company since
January 2009. Mr. Fessenden served as a member of the New York State Assembly
from 1993 to 1999. He currently serves as the Executive Director of the Fred L.
Emerson Foundation, a fourth-generation family foundation located in Auburn,
New York. From 2004 to 2006 he served as the founding Executive Director of the
Cornell Agriculture & Food Technology Park, Geneva, New York. Prior to
2004, Mr. Fessenden served as a key member of the government relations team for
the Carrier Corporation, Syracuse, New York. Mr. Fessenden has been actively
engaged with various business, civic and educational organizations throughout
the Central New York region for more than 25 years.  In addition to serving as a director of
Midstate Mutual Insurance Company, he also serves on the board of Seward House
Museum, Wells College, American Agriculturist Foundation and several other
charitable organizations.  We believe Mr.
Fessenden’s qualifications to sit on our Board of Directors include his
extensive experience in government and public service (as well as executive
experience in the private sector), his active engagement with civic
organizations, and his deep connections to the Central New York business
community.
