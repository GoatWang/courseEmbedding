Event-Driven Opportunity Funds



Firm Overview
Standard General is a New York-based investment firm that manages event-driven opportunity funds.
We focus on companies with complex capital structures that are undergoing dramatic change or are faced with material events. The key to our investment approach is familiarity with both credit markets and equity investing. Companies in our universe have investable equity and credit components. Our experienced investment professionals analyze how each part of a company's capital structure will act and interact with the whole.
We complement this analysis with an event-driven approach. We seek mispriced opportunities that we anticipate the market will correct, or where we ourselves have the opportunity to create value. We apply this framework in an even-handed manner that generates both long and short investment ideas. Combining a catalyst-dependent focus with our willingness to position ourselves flexibly allows us to target an all-weather stream of returns.  We believe this approach can generate a differentiated and uncorrelated return stream.
Standard General was founded in 2007 and has been a SEC-registered Investment Adviser since 2009. We primarily manage capital for public and private pension plans, endowments, foundations, and high net worth individuals.



Investment Process
Our cross-capital structure approach gives us a broader foundation from which to identify specific events and catalysts.
We seek very specific situations, but we seek them broadly across markets, asset classes, and industries. The strategy allows us to be nimble and to go where markets offer the most compelling risk/reward opportunities. Most investment strategies are compartmentalized by different constraints-limited to debt or equity, by loans or bonds, by credit rating, by market capitalization, or by time horizon. Unencumbered by these restrictions, our strategy is to deploy capital in all of the above areas.
We use our analysis of specific credit considerations such as liquidity, collateral, and covenants to help us evaluate potential investments across capital structures.  Over the years, we have found this especially relevant for public companies that also have a credit component.  We believe we have an advantage over more equity-centric investors when evaluating such companies, as those unaccustomed to evaluating credit may minimize its relevance when markets are uneventful, yet overreact when credit issues loom.  Our cross-capital structure approach gives us a broader foundation from which to identify specific events and catalysts.
The greatest impact of employing this approach, particularly without the constraints of silos or arbitrary limitations, is that we uncover an uncommon pool of situations, which we believe has little overlap with other managers.  We believe that our investors are specifically drawn to our differentiated approach and portfolios.  Over time, this has given us the added advantage of a committed investor base that has allowed us to see events through to their resolution.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
