THE FUND
   This series of Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Municipal Series (the "Fund") consists
of underlying separate unit investment trusts described above. Each Trust       
consists of an insured portfolio of interest-bearing obligations (the "Bonds" or
"Securities") issued by or on behalf of municipalities and other governmental   
authorities, the interest on which is, in the opinion of recognized bond counsel
to the issuing governmental authority, exempt from all Federal income taxes     
under existing law. In addition, the interest income of each State Trust is, in 
the opinion of counsel, exempt to the extent indicated from state and local     
taxes, when held by residents of the state where the issuers of Bonds in such   
Trust are located.                                                              

 PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE
 The Public Offering Price of the Units of each Trust includes the aggregate
bid price of the Securities in such Trust, an applicable sales charge, cash, if 
any, in the Principal Account held or owned by such Trust, and accrued interest,
if any. See "Summary of Essential Financial Information".                       

 ESTIMATED CURRENT AND LONG-TERM RETURNS
Estimated Current and Long-Term Returns to Unitholders are indicated under
"Summary of Essential Financial Information". The methods of calculating        
Estimated Current Returns and Estimated Long-Term Return are set forth in Part  
II of this Prospectus.                                                          

THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR HAS THE COMMISSION PASSED UPON THE ACCURACY OR ADEQUACY

Summary of Essential Financial Information
As of August 6, 2008
Sponsor: Van Kampen Funds Inc.
 Evaluator: Standard & Poor's Securities Evaluations, Inc.
 Supervisor: Van Kampen Asset Management (4)
Trustee: The Bank of New York Mellon

The income, expense and distribution data set forth below have been       
calculated for Unitholders electing to receive monthly distributions.           
Unitholders choosing a different distribution plan (if available) will receive a
slightly higher net annual interest income because of the lower Trustee's fees  
and expenses under such plan.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Unitholders of Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Municipal Series 515:             
We have audited the accompanying statements of condition (including the   
analyses of net assets and the related portfolio schedules) of Insured          
Municipals Income Trust, Series 490 and Insured Municipals Income Trust,        
Laddered Series 10 (the "Trusts," included in Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Municipal 
Series 515) as of June 30, 2008, and the related statements of operations and   
changes in net assets for each of the three years in the period ended June 30,
2008, and the financial highlights for the period from July 27, 2004 (date of   
deposit) through June 30, 2005 and for each of the three years in the period    
ended June 30, 2008. These financial statements and financial highlights are the
responsibility of management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on    
these financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.        
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public    
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.
The Trusts are not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of 
their internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included            
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for       
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not   
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trusts'    
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such      
opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the          
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures      
included confirmation of securities owned at June 30, 2008 by correspondence    
with The Bank of New York Mellon, Trustee. We believe that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for our opinion.                                               
   In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of       
Insured Municipals Income Trust, Series 490 and Insured Municipals Income Trust,
Laddered Series 10 (included in Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Municipal Series 515) as
of June 30, 2008, and the results of its operations and changes in net assets   
for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2008, and the financial
highlights for the period from July 27, 2004 (date of deposit) through June 30,
2005 and for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2008, in      
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

VAN KAMPEN UNIT TRUSTS, MUNICIPAL SERIES 515
 Notes to Financial Statements
June 30, 2006, 2007 and 2008

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                             
  Security Valuation - Tax-exempt municipal securities are stated at the value
determined by the Evaluator. The Evaluator may determine the value of the Bonds 
(1) on the basis of current bid prices of the Bonds obtained from dealers or    
brokers who customarily deal in Bonds comparable to those held by each of the   
Trusts, (2) on the basis of bid prices for comparable Bonds, (3) by determining 
the value of the Bonds by appraisal or (4) by any combination of the above.     

 Security Cost - The original cost to each of the Trusts (Insured Municipals
Income Trust, Series 490 and Insured Municipals Income Trust, Laddered Series   
10) was based on the determination by J.J. Kenny Co. of the offering prices of  
the Bonds on the date of deposit (July 27, 2004). Since the valuation is based  
upon the bid prices, such Trusts (Insured Municipals Income Trust, Series 490   
and Insured Municipals Income Trust, Laddered Series 10) recognized downward    
adjustments of $91,131 and $35,719, respectively, on the date of deposit        
resulting from the difference between the bid and offering prices. These        
downward adjustments were included in the aggregate amount of unrealized        
depreciation reported in the financial statements for each Trust for the period 
ended June 30, 2005.                                                            

  Unit Valuation - The redemption price per Unit is the pro rata share of each
Unit in each Trust based upon (1) the cash on hand in such Trust or monies in   
the process of being collected, (2) the Bonds in such Trust based on the value  
determined by the Evaluator and (3) interest accrued thereon, less accrued      
expenses of the Trust, if any.                                                  

 Federal Income Taxes - The Trust is not a taxable entity for Federal income
tax purposes. Each Unitholder is considered to be the owner of a pro rata       
portion of such Trust and, accordingly, no provision has been made for Federal  
income taxes.                                                                   

Other - The financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of    
accounting. Any realized gains or losses from securities transactions are       
reported on an identified cost basis.                                           

NOTE 2 - PORTFOLIO                                                              
 Ratings - The source of all ratings, exclusive of those designated N/R or *
is Standard & Poor's, A Division of the McGraw-Hill Companies. Ratings marked * 
are by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. as these Bonds are not rated by Standard 
& Poor's, A Division of the McGraw-Hill Companies. N/R indicates that the Bond  
is not rated by Standard & Poor's, A Division of the McGraw-Hill Companies or   
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. The ratings shown represent the latest published
ratings of the Bonds. For a brief description of rating symbols and their       
related meanings, see "Description of Securities Ratings" in the Information    
Supplement.                                                                     

   Redemption Feature - There is shown under this heading the year in which each
issue of Bonds is initially or currently callable and the call price for that   
year. Each issue of Bonds continues to be callable at declining prices          
thereafter (but not below par value) except for original issue discount Bonds   
which are redeemable at prices based on the issue price plus the amount of      
original issue discount accreted to redemption date plus, if applicable, some   
premium, the amount of which will decline in subsequent years. "S.F." indicates 
a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of Bonds. "P.R."         
indicates a bond has been prerefunded. Redemption pursuant to call provisions   
generally will, and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may, occur at
times when the redeemed Bonds have an offering side evaluation which represents 
a premium over par. To the extent that the Bonds were deposited in the Trust at 
a price higher than the price at which they are redeemed, this will represent a 
loss of capital when compared with the original Public Offering Price of the    
Units. Conversely, to the extent that the Bonds were acquired at a price lower  
than the redemption price, this will represent an increase in capital when      
compared with the original Public Offering Price of the Units. Distributions    
will generally be reduced by the amount of the income which would otherwise have
been paid with respect to redeemed Bonds and there will be distributed to       
Unitholders the principal amount in excess of $1 per Unit semi-annually and any 
premium received on such redemption. However, should the amount available for   
distribution in the Principal Account exceed $10.00 per Unit, the Trustee will  
make a special distribution from the Principal Account on the next succeeding   
monthly distribution date to holders of record on the related monthly record    
date. The Estimated Current Return in this event may be affected by such        
redemptions. For the Federal tax effect on Unitholders of such redemptions and  
resultant distributions, see "Federal Tax Status" in Part II.                   

 Insurance - Insurance coverage providing for the timely payment when due of
all principal and interest on the Bonds in the Insured Municipals Income Trust, 
Series 490 and Insured Municipals Income Trust, Laddered Series 10 Trusts has   
been obtained by the Trusts or by one of the Preinsured Bond Insurers (as       
indicated in the Bond name). Such insurance does not guarantee the market value 
of the Bonds or the value of the Units. For Bonds covered under the Trust's     
insurance policy the insurance is effective only while Bonds thus insured are   
held in the Trust and the insurance premium, which is a Trust obligation, is    
paid on a monthly basis. The premium for insurance which has been obtained from 
various insurance companies by the issuer of the Bond involved is payable by the
issuer.                                                                         

NOTE 2 - PORTFOLIO (continued)                                                  
An Accounting and Auditing Guide issued by the American Institute of      
Certified Public Accountants states that, for financial reporting purposes,     
insurance coverage of the type acquired by the Trust does not have any          
measurable value in the absence of default of the underlying Bonds or indication
of the probability of such default. In the opinion of the Evaluator, there is no
indication of a probable default of Bonds in the portfolio as of the date of    
these financial statements.                                                     

Unrealized Appreciation and Depreciation - An analysis of net unrealized  
appreciation (depreciation) at June 30, 2008 is as follows:

                  =========        =========

NOTE 3 - OTHER                                                                  
   Marketability - Although it is not obligated to do so, the Sponsor intends to
maintain a market for Units and to continuously offer to purchase Units at      
prices, subject to change at any time, based upon the aggregate bid price of the
Bonds in the portfolio of each Trust, plus interest accrued to the date of      
settlement. If the supply of Units exceeds demand, or for other business        
reasons, the Sponsor may discontinue purchases of Units at such prices. In the  
event that a market is not maintained for the Units, a Unitholder desiring to   
dispose of his Units may be able to do so only by tendering such Units to the   
Trustee for redemption at the redemption price.                                 

Cost to Investors - The cost to original investors was based on the       
Evaluator's determination of the aggregate offering price of the Bonds per Unit 
on the date of an investor's purchase, plus a sales charge of 4.9% of the public
offering price which is equivalent to 5.152% of the aggregate offering price of 
the Bonds for the IM-IT Trust and 3.9% of the public offering price which is    
equivalent to 4.058% of the aggregate offering price of the Bonds for the       
remaining trust. The secondary market cost to investors is based on the         
Evaluator's determination of the aggregate bid price of the Bonds per Unit on   
the date of an investor's purchase plus a sales charge based upon the years to  
average maturity of the Bonds in the portfolio. The sales charge ranges from    
1.0% of the public offering price (1.010% of the aggregate bid price of the     
Bonds) for a Trust with a portfolio with less than two years to average maturity
to 5.40% of the public offering price (5.708% of the aggregate bid price of the 
Bonds) for a Trust with a portfolio with twenty-one or more years to average    
maturity.                                                                       

  Compensation of Evaluator and Supervisor - The Supervisor receives a fee for
providing portfolio supervisory services for the Trust ($.25 per Unit, not to   
exceed the aggregate cost of the Supervisor for providing such services to the  
Trust). In addition, the Evaluator receives an annual fee for regularly         
evaluating each of the Trust's portfolios. Both fees may be adjusted for        
increases under the category "All Services Less Rent of Shelter" in the Consumer
Price Index.                                                                    

NOTE 4 - REDEMPTION OF UNITS                                                    
Units were presented for redemption as follows:

THE TRUSTS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Fund. Your Trust is one of several unit investment trusts created under
the name Insured Municipals Income Trust, Insured Municipals Income Trust and   
Investors' Quality Tax-Exempt Trust, Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Municipal     
Series or Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Municipal Series (the "Fund"). The Fund was   
created under the laws of the State of New York pursuant to a Trust Indenture   
and Agreement (the "Trust Agreement"), dated the Date of Deposit among Van      
Kampen Funds Inc., as Sponsor, Standard & Poor's Securities Evaluations, Inc.,  
as Evaluator, Van Kampen Asset Management, as Supervisor, and The Bank of New   
York Mellon, as Trustee, or their predecessors.                                 

The Fund consists of separate portfolios of interest-bearing obligations  
issued by or on behalf of states and territories of the United States, and      
political subdivisions and authorities thereof, the interest on which is, in the
opinion of recognized bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered at       
closing, excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes under     
existing law. All issuers of bonds in a State Trust are located in the state for
which the Trust is named or in United States territories or possessions and     
their public authorities; consequently, in the opinion of recognized bond       
counsel to the bond issuers rendered at closing, the interest earned on the     
bonds is exempt from state and local taxes to the extent indicated herein and to
the extent permitted under local law. Further, in the opinion of bond counsel to
the respective issuers rendered at closing, the interest income of each bond in 
a U.S. Territorial IM-IT Trust is exempt from state, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico
and local income taxation. Interest on certain bonds in a National Quality AMT  
Trust may be a preference item for purposes of the alternative minimum tax.     
Accordingly, a National Quality AMT Trust may be appropriate only for investors 
who are not subject to the alternative minimum tax. Trusts that hold only       
insured bonds or bonds that are insured under a portfolio insurance policy are  
referred to herein as "Insured Trusts". "Long-Term Trust" refers to IM-IT,      
Investment Grade Municipal, U.S. Territorial IM-IT, Long-Term State and National
Quality Trusts. "Intermediate-Term Trust" refers to Strategic Municipal Trust   
Intermediate Series, State Intermediate Trusts and State Intermediate Laddered  
Maturity Trusts. Trusts that are named for a particular state are referred to   
herein as "State Trusts". "State Intermediate Trust" refers to a State Trust    
which is designated as an "intermediate series" in the name of such Trust.      
"State Intermediate Laddered Maturity Trust" refers to a State Trust which is   
designated as an "intermediate laddered maturity series" in the name of such    
Trust. State Trusts, other than State Intermediate Laddered Maturity Trusts or  
State Intermediate Trusts, are referred to herein as "Long-Term State Trusts".  

   On the Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited the bonds with the Trustee. The
bonds initially consisted of delivery statements relating to contracts for their
purchase and cash, cash equivalents and/or irrevocable letters of credit issued 
by a financial institution. Thereafter, the Trustee, in exchange for the bonds, 
delivered to the Sponsor evidence of ownership of the Units.                    

  The portfolio of any IM-IT, Investment Grade Municipal, IM-IT Discount, U.S.
Territorial IM-IT, Long-Term State or National Quality Trust consists of bonds  
maturing approximately 15 to 40 years from the Date of Deposit. The approximate 
range of maturities from the Date of Deposit for bonds in any IM-IT Laddered    
Series, IM-IT Limited Maturity Trust, IM-IT Intermediate Trust, Strategic       
Municipal Trust Intermediate Series, State Intermediate Laddered Maturity Trust 
and IM-IT Short Intermediate Trust is 10 to 30 years, 12 to 15 years, 5 to 15   
years, 5 to 15 years, 5 to 10 years and 3 to 7 years, respectively. The         
portfolio of any IM-IT Laddered Series is structured so that approximately 20%  
of the bonds will mature every five years, beginning in approximately the tenth 
year of the Trust, entitling each Unitholder to return of principal. The        
portfolio of any State Intermediate Laddered Maturity Trust is structured so    
that approximately 20% of the bonds will mature each year, beginning in         
approximately the fifth year of the Trust, entitling each Unitholder to a return
of principal. This return of principal may offer Unitholders the opportunity to 
respond to changing economic conditions and to specific financial needs that may
arise during the periods of scheduled maturities. However, the flexibility      
provided by the return of principal may also eliminate a Unitholder's ability to
reinvest at a rate as high as the yield on the bonds which matured.             

   Each Unit represents a fractional undivided interest in the principal and net
income of a Trust. To the extent that any Units are redeemed by the Trustee, the
fractional undivided interest in a Trust represented by each Unit will increase,
although the actual interest in the Trust will remain unchanged. Units will     
remain outstanding until redeemed by Unitholders or until the termination of the
Trust Agreement.                                                                

Objectives and Bond Selection. The Trusts seek to provide federal tax-exempt
income and, in the case of most State Trusts, federal, state, and, if           
applicable, local tax-exempt income and to preserve capital. The Trusts invest  
in portfolios of municipal bonds issued by or on behalf of states and           
territories of the United States, and political subdivisions and authorities    
thereof, the interest on which is, in the opinion of recognized bond counsel to 
the issuing authorities rendered at closing, excludable from gross income for   
federal and, for State Trusts, state and, if applicable, local personal income  
tax purposes under existing law. An IM-IT Laddered Series has additional        
objectives of providing protection against changes in interest rates and        
investment flexibility through an investment in a laddered portfolio of         
interest-bearing obligations with maturities ranging from approximately 10 to 30
years in which roughly 20% of the bonds mature every five years beginning in    
approximately the tenth year of the Trust. A State Intermediate Laddered        
Maturity Trust has additional objectives of providing protection against changes
in interest rates and investment flexibility through an investment in a laddered
portfolio of intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations with maturities     
ranging from approximately 5 to 10 years in which roughly 20% of the bonds      
mature each year beginning in approximately the fifth year of the Trust. There  
is, of course, no guarantee that the Trusts will achieve their objectives. A    
Trust may be an appropriate investment vehicle for investors who desire to      
participate in a portfolio of tax-exempt fixed income bonds with greater        
diversification than they might be able to acquire individually. Insurance      
guaranteeing the timely payment, when due, of all principal and interest on the 
bonds in each Insured Trust has been obtained from a municipal bond insurance   
company. For information relating to insurance on the bonds, see "Insurance on
the Bonds in the Insured Trusts". In addition, these bonds are often not        
available in small amounts.                                                     

In selecting bonds for the Trusts, the Sponsor considered the following   
factors, among others: (a) with respect to Insured Trusts, the bonds must be    
insured with a Standard & Poor's rating of AAA or a Moody's Investors Service,  
Inc. ("Moody's") rating of Aaa, with respect to all Quality Trusts, the bonds   
must have a Standard & Poor's rating of at least "A-", a Moody's rating of at   
least "A3" or, if not rated, credit characteristics sufficiently similar to     
those of comparable bonds that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition
by a Trust in the opinion of the Sponsor, and with respect to all other Trusts, 
either the Standard & Poor's rating of the bonds was not less than "BBB-", or   
the Moody's rating of the bonds was not less than "Baa3", including provisional 
or conditional ratings, respectively, (or, if not rated, the bonds had credit   
characteristics sufficiently similar to the credit characteristics of           
interest-bearing tax-exempt bonds that were so rated as to be acceptable for    
acquisition by a Trust in the opinion of the Sponsor), (b) the prices of the    
bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity, (c) the       
current income provided by the bonds, (d) the diversification of bonds as to    
purpose of issue and location of issuer and (e) the probability of early return 
of principal or high legal or event risk. After the Date of Deposit, a bond may 
cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of 
the Date of Deposit. Neither event requires elimination of a bond from a Trust  
but may be considered in the Sponsor's determination as to whether or not to    
direct the Trustee to dispose of the bond (see "Trust Administration--Portfolio
Administration"). In particular, the ratings of the bonds in an Investment Grade
Municipal Trust could fall below "investment grade" (i.e., below "BBB-" or      
"Baa3") during the Trust's life and the Trust could continue to hold the bonds. 
See "The Trusts--Risk Factors".                                                 

The Bonds. Your Trust invests in municipal bonds. States, municipalities and
public authorities issue these bonds to raise money for a variety of purposes.  
In selecting bonds, we seek to diversify your portfolio by bond purpose. This   
section briefly describes different bond types to help you better understand    
your investment. These bonds are described in greater detail in the Information 
Supplement. See "Additional Information".                                       

General obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the    
issuer. The issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith, credit and        
unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest.               

Revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or  
authority. They are not supported by the issuer's general power to levy taxes.  
The risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income 
of the related project falters because that income is the only source of        
payment. All of the following bonds are revenue bonds:                          

 Airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports. The
ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the  
ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements. Due to      
increased competition, deregulation, increased fuel costs and other factors,    
some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations.                    

 Bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger
offerings. This reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities. The types 
of financing projects that these obligations support vary.                      

Certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease     
obligation. Lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these    
bonds. These payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations
for the lease payments. A governmental body cannot obligate future governments  
to appropriate for or make lease payments, but governments typically promise to 
take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets. If a          
government fails to budget for or make lease payments, sufficient funds may not 
exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds.                              

Health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from     
hospitals and hospital systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on
bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, demand for services,
competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations, the need to reduce
costs, government regulation, costs of malpractice insurance and claims, and    
government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).                

 Higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities
and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants   
and endowments. These issuers face problems related to declines in the number of
college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees,         
uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and        
government legislation or regulation.                                           

   Industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring, building or improving
industrial projects. Private corporations usually operate these projects. The   
ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as
the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project, revenues         
generated by the project, expenses of the project and environmental or other    
regulatory restrictions.                                                        

Multi-family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on multiple family residences, retirement housing or housing
projects for low to moderate-income families. These bonds are generally         
pre-payable at any time. It is likely that their life will be less than their   
stated maturity. The ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends 
on such factors as rental income, occupancy levels, operating expenses, mortgage
default rates, taxes, government regulations and appropriation of subsidies.    

Other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from  
mental health facilities, nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. These 
bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general    
risks.                                                                          

Public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring, leasing, building or 
improving public buildings such as offices, recreation facilities, convention   
centers, police stations, correctional institutions and parking garages. The    
ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such  
as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments 
on the facility, user fees or rents, costs of maintenance and decreases in use  
of the facility.                                                                

Public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and
secondary schools. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds 
depends primarily on ad valorem taxes. These issuers may also face problems     
related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education    
financing.                                                                      

Retail electric/gas/telephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive
revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers. The ability of these   
issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and
demand for these utilities, competition, government regulation and rate         
approvals, overhead expenses and the cost of fuels.                             

 Single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on single family residences. Single family residences       
generally include one to four-family dwellings. These bonds are similar to      
multi-family housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks.         

 Tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a
municipality, such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds. These    
bonds are similar to general obligation bonds. Unlike general obligation bonds, 
however, the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay     
these bonds. Instead, the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to  
pay these bonds. If the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal, a 
municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds. An inability 
to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds.                   

 Transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public
transit systems, ports, highways, turnpikes, bridges and other transportation   
systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on
variations in use, the degree of government subsidization, competition from     
other forms of transportation and increased costs. Port authorities derive      
revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities. These  
fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air, rail
and truck transportation. Increased fuel costs, alternative transportation modes
and competition from toll-free bridges and roads will impact revenues of issuers
that operate bridges, roads or tunnels.                                         

Waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from 
resource recovery facilities. These facilities process solid waste, generate    
steam and convert steam to electricity. These issuers face problems such as     
costs and delays due to environmental concerns, effects of conservation and     
recycling, destruction or condemnation of a project, void or unenforceable      
contracts, changes in the economic availability of raw materials, operating     
supplies or facilities, and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect     
operation of a project.                                                         

Water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services. These issuers face      
problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases, population declines,     
difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and "no-growth" zoning       
ordinances. These issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal 
issuers.                                                                        

   Wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
selling electricity to other utilities. The ability of these issuers to make    
payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for     
electric utilities, competition, overhead expenses and government regulation and
rate approvals.                                                                 

More About the Bonds. In addition to describing the purpose of the bonds, 
other information about the bonds is also listed in the "Portfolio" in          
Prospectus Part I. This information relates to other characteristics of the     
bonds. This section briefly describes some of these characteristics.            

Original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their
face (or par) value. These bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than       
comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value. In a stable      
interest rate environment, the market value of these bonds tends to increase    
more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach      
maturity. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before
its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par value.         

  Zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond. These bonds do
not pay any current interest during their life. If an investor own this type of 
bond, the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bond's par   
value at maturity. The price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during     
periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current   
interest payments. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a   
bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par    
value.                                                                          

  "When, as and if issued" bonds are bonds that trade before they are actually
issued. This means that the Sponsor can only deliver them to your Trust "when,  
as and if" the bonds are actually issued. Delivery of these bonds may be delayed
or may not occur. Interest on these bonds does not begin accruing to your Trust 
until the Sponsor delivers the bond to the Trust. You may have to adjust your   
tax basis if the Sponsor delivers any of these bonds after the expected delivery
date. Any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued between the time you   
purchased your Units and the delivery of the bonds to your Trust. This could    
lower your first year estimated current return. You may experience gains or     
losses on these bonds from the time you purchase Units even though your Trust   
has not yet received them.                                                      

Risk Factors. All investments involve risk. This section describes the main
risks that can impact the value of bonds in your Trust. You should understand   
these risks before you invest. If the value of the bonds falls, the value of    
your Units will also fall. You can lose money by investing in a Trust. No one   
can guarantee that your Trust will achieve its objective or that your investment
return will be positive over any period. The Information Supplement contains a  
more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment.                   

Market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your Trust will    
fluctuate. This could cause the value of your Units to fall below your original 
purchase price or below the par value. Market value fluctuates in response to   
various factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the    
financial condition of a bond's issuer or insurer, perceptions of the issuer or 
insurer, or ratings on a bond. Even though the Supervisor supervises your       
portfolio, you should remember that no one manages your portfolio. Your Trust   
will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a  
managed fund.                                                                   

  Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest
rates increase. Bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise 
in value when interest rates fall. Bonds with longer periods before maturity are
often more sensitive to interest rate changes.                                  

   Credit risk is the risk that a bond's issuer or insurer is unable to meet its
obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond.                            

Call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or "calls" a bond before its
stated maturity. An issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond
pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original 
purpose. If an issuer calls a bond, your Trust will distribute the principal to 
you but your future interest distributions will fall. You might not be able to  
reinvest this principal at as high a yield. A bond's call price could be less   
than the price your Trust paid for the bond and could be below the bond's par   
value. This means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your 
units. If enough bonds in your Trust are called, your Trust could terminate     
early. The first date that the issuer can call each bond in the portfolio is    
listed in Prospectus Part I along with the price the issuer would have to pay.  

Bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating  
  agency decreases the bond's rating. Bond concentration risk is the risk that
your Trust is less diversified because it concentrates in a               

particular type of bond. When a certain type of bond makes up 25% or more of a  
Trust, the Trust is considered to be "concentrated" in that bond type. The      
different bond types are described under "The Bonds".                           

  Reduced diversification risk is the risk that your Trust will become smaller
and less diversified as bonds are sold, are called or mature. This could        
increase your risk of loss and increase your share of Trust expenses.           

 Liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in
the bond is limited or absent. No one can guarantee that a liquid trading market
will exist for any bond because these bonds generally trade in the              
over-the-counter market (they are not listed on a securities exchange).         

 Insurer Default risk is the risk that an investor of an insured trust could
lose income and/or principal if the issuer and the insurer of a municipal bond  
both default in making their payment obligations.                               

Litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or     
legislation could affect the value of your Trust. For example, future           
legislation could reduce tax rates, impose a flat tax, exempt all investment    
income from tax or change the tax treatment of the bonds or of your Trust.      
Litigation could challenge an issuer's authority to issue or make payments on   
bonds.                                                                          

 No FDIC Guarantee. An investment in your Trust is not a deposit of any bank
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or
any other government agency.                                                    

ESTIMATED CURRENT AND LONG-TERM RETURNS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Estimated Current Returns and the Estimated Long-Term Returns are set 
forth in the Prospectus Part I. Estimated Current Return is calculated by       
dividing the estimated net annual interest income per Unit by the Public        
Offering Price. The estimated net annual interest income per Unit will vary with
changes in fees and expenses of the Trust and with the principal prepayment,    
redemption, maturity, exchange or sale of bonds. The Public Offering Price will 
vary with changes in the price of the bonds. Accordingly, there is no assurance 
that the present Estimated Current Return will be realized in the future.       
Estimated Long-Term Return is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into   
consideration, and determines and factors in the relative weightings of, the    
market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and
the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirements of the bonds and (2) takes
into account the expenses and sales charge associated with Units. Since the     
value and estimated retirements of the bonds and the expenses of a Trust will   
change, there is no assurance that the present Estimated Long-Term Return will  
be realized in the future. The Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-Term 
Return are expected to differ because the calculation of Estimated Long-Term    
Return reflects the estimated date and amount of principal returned while the   
Estimated Current Return calculation includes only net annual interest income   
and Public Offering Price.                                                      

PUBLIC OFFERING 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General. Units are offered at the Public Offering Price. The secondary market
public offering price is based on the bid prices of the bonds, the sales charge 
described below, cash, if any, in the Principal Account and accrued interest, if
any. The actual sales charge that may be paid by an investor may differ slightly
from the sales charges to rounding that occurs in the calculation of the Public 
Offering Price and in the number of Units purchased. The minimum purchase is one
Unit. Certain broker-dealers or selling firms may charge an order handling fee  
for processing Unit purchases.                                                  

 The secondary market sales charge is computed as described in the following
table based upon the estimated long-term return life (ELTR Life) of a Trust's   
portfolio:                                                                      

                                                        [Enlarge/Download Table]

 4................       2.302      11..................      4.603         18.................      5.374     
 5................       2.564      12..................      4.712         19.................      5.485     
 6................       2.828      13..................      4.822         20.................      5.597     
 7................       3.093      14..................      4.932   21 to 30.................      5.708     

The ELTR Life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trusts'     
portfolio as determined for purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return. 
See "Estimated Current and Long-Term Returns". The sales charges in the above   
table are expressed as a percentage of the aggregate bid prices of the bonds.   

 Reducing Your Sales Charge. The Sponsor offers a variety of ways for you to
reduce the sales charge that you pay. It is your financial professional's       
responsibility to alert the Sponsor of any discount when you purchase Units.    
Before you purchase Units you must also inform your broker-dealer of your       
qualification for any discount or of any combined purchases to be eligible for a
reduced sales charge.                                                           

Fee Accounts. A portion of the sales charge is waived for certain accounts
described in this paragraph. Purchases by these accounts are subject only to the
portion of the sales charge that is retained by the Sponsor. Please refer to the
section called "Fee Accounts" for additional information on these purchases.    
Units may be purchased in the primary or secondary market at the Public Offering
Price less the concession the Sponsor typically allows to brokers and dealers   
for purchases by investors who purchase Units through registered investment     
advisers, certified financial planners and registered broker-dealers who in each
case either charge periodic fees for brokerage services, financial planning,    
investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such services in   
connection with the establishment of an investment account for which a          
comprehensive "wrap fee" charge is imposed ("Fee Accounts"). The Sponsor        
reserves the right to limit or deny purchases of Units described in this        
paragraph by investors or selling firms whose frequent trading activity is      
determined to be detrimental to a Trust.                                        

Employees. Employees, officers and directors (including their spouses and 
children under 21 living in the same household, and trustees, custodians or     
fiduciaries for the benefit of such persons) of Van Kampen Funds Inc. and its   
affiliates and dealers and their affiliates may purchase Units at the Public    
Offering Price less the applicable dealer concession. All employee discounts are
subject to the policies of the related selling firm. Only employees, officers   
and directors of companies that allow their employees to participate in this    
employee discount program are eligible for the discounts..                      

Offering Price. The Public Offering Price of Units will vary from the amounts
stated under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I  
in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the bonds. The "Evaluation     
Time" is the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on each day that   
the Exchange is open for trading. Orders received by the Trustee or Sponsor for 
purchases, sales or redemptions after that time, or on a day when the New York  
Stock Exchange is closed, will be held until the next determination of price.   
The secondary market Public Offering Price per Unit will be equal to the        
aggregate bid price of the bonds plus the applicable secondary market sales     
charge and dividing the sum by the number of Units outstanding. For secondary   
market purposes, this computation will be made by the Evaluator as of the       
Evaluation Time for each day on which any Unit is tendered for redemption and as
necessary. The offering price of bonds may be expected to average approximately 
0.5%-1% more than the bid price.                                                

   The aggregate price of the bonds is determined on the basis of bid prices (a)
on the basis of current market prices obtained from dealers or brokers who      
customarily deal in bonds comparable to those held by the Fund; (b) if these    
prices are not available, on the basis of current market prices for comparable  
bonds; (c) by causing the value of the bonds to be determined by others engaged 
in the practice of evaluation, quoting or appraising comparable bonds; or (d) by
any combination of the above. Market prices of the bonds will generally         
fluctuate with changes in market interest rates. Unless bonds are in default in 
payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of default, the         
Evaluator will not attribute any value to the insurance obtained by an Insured  
Trust, if any.                                                                  

 The Evaluator will consider in its evaluation of bonds which are in default
in payment of principal or interest or, in the Sponsor's opinion, in significant
risk of default (the "Defaulted Bonds") the value of any insurance guaranteeing 
interest and principal payments. The value of the insurance will be equal to the
difference between (i) the market value of Defaulted Bonds assuming the exercise
of the right to obtain Permanent Insurance (less the insurance premiums and     
related expenses attributable to the purchase of Permanent Insurance) and (ii)  
the market value of Defaulted Bonds not covered by Permanent Insurance. In      
addition, the Evaluator will consider the ability of a Portfolio Insurer to meet
its commitments under any insurance policy, including commitments to issue      
Permanent Insurance. No value has been ascribed to insurance obtained by an     
Insured Trust, if any, as of the date of this prospectus.                       

A person will become the owner of Units on the date of settlement provided
payment has been received. Cash, if any, made available to the Sponsor prior to 
the date of settlement for the purchase of Units may be used in the Sponsor's   
business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the Sponsor, subject to the       
limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.                             

Accrued Interest. Accrued Interest (Accrued Interest to Carry). Accrued   
interest to carry is added to the Public Offering Price for Insured Municipals  
Income Trust, 151st Insured Multi-Series and prior series and Insured Municipals
Income Trust and Investors' Quality Tax-Exempt Trust, Multi-Series 212 and prior
series. Accrued interest to carry consists of two elements. The first element   
arises as a result of accrued interest which is the accumulation of unpaid      
interest on a bond from the last day on which interest thereon was paid.        
Interest on Securities in each Trust is actually paid either monthly, quarterly,
if applicable, or semi-annually to such Trust. However, interest on the         
Securities in each Trust is accounted for daily on an accrual basis. Because of 
this, each Trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected  
by the Trustee because of coupons that are not yet due. For this reason, the    
Public Offering Price will have added to it the proportionate share of accrued  
and undistributed interest to the date of settlement.                           

The second element of accrued interest to carry arises because of the     
structure of the Interest Account. The Trustee has no cash for distribution to  
Unitholders of a Trust until it receives interest payments on the Securities in 
such Trust. The Trustee is obligated to provide its own funds, at times, in     
order to advance interest distributions. The Trustee will recover these         
advancements when such interest is received. Interest Account balances are      
established so that it will not be necessary on a regular basis for the Trustee 
to advance its own funds in connection with such interest distributions. The    
Interest Account balances are also structured so that there will generally be   
positive cash balances and since the funds held by the Trustee may be used by it
to earn interest thereon, it benefits thereby. If a Unitholder sells or redeems 
all or a portion of his Units or if the bonds in a Trust are sold or otherwise  
removed or if a Trust is liquidated, he will receive at that time his           
proportionate share of the accrued interest to carry computed to the settlement 
date in the case of sale or liquidation and to the date of tender in the case of
redemption.                                                                     

Purchased and Accrued Interest. Added to the Public Offering Price for    
Insured Municipals Income Trust, 152nd-173rd Insured Multi-Series and Insured   
Municipals Income Trust and Investors' Quality Tax-Exempt Trust, Multi-Series   
213-246 is Purchased Interest and accrued interest. Included in the Public      
Offering Price for Insured Municipals Income Trust, 174th Insured Multi-Series  
and subsequent series and Insured Municipals Income Trust and Investors' Quality
Tax-Exempt Trust, Multi-Series 247 and subsequent series is accrued interest    
only. References to "accrued interest" in this prospectus include both Purchased
Interest and accrued interest as described in this section.                     

 Purchased Interest - Purchased Interest is a portion of the unpaid interest
that has accrued on the Securities from the later of the last payment date on   
the Securities or the date of issuance thereof through the First Settlement Date
and is included in the calculation of the Public Offering Price. Purchased      
Interest will be distributed to Unitholders as Units are redeemed or Securities 
mature or are called. See "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in this  
Prospectus Part I for the amount of Purchased Interest per Unit for each Trust. 
Purchased Interest is an element of the price Unitholders will receive in       
connection with the sale or redemption of Units prior to the termination of a   
Trust.                                                                          

  Accrued Interest - Accrued Interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on
securities which generally is paid semi-annually, although a Trust accrues such 
interest daily. Because of this, a Trust always has an amount of interest earned
but not yet collected by the Trustee. For this reason, with respect to sales    
settling after the First Settlement Date, the proportionate share of accrued    
interest to the settlement date is added to the Public Offering Price of Units. 
Unitholders will receive on the next distribution date of a Trust the amount, if
any, of accrued interest paid on their Units. As indicated in "Purchased        
Interest", accrued interest as of the First Settlement Date includes Purchased  
Interest. In an effort to reduce the amount of Purchased Interest which would   
otherwise have to be paid by Unitholders, the Trustee may advance a portion of  
such accrued interest to the Sponsor as the Unitholder of record as of the First
Settlement Date. Consequently, the accrued interest added to the Public Offering
Price of Units will include only accrued interest from the First Settlement Date
to the date of settlement (other than the Purchased Interest already included   
therein), less any distributions from the Interest Account after the First      
Settlement Date. Because of the varying interest payment dates of the bonds,    
accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount of        
interest actually received by a Trust and distributed to Unitholders. If a      
Unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of his Units, he will be entitled  
to receive his proportionate share of the Purchased Interest and accrued        
interest from the purchaser of his Units. Since the Trustee has the use of the  
funds (including Purchased Interest) held in the Interest Account for           
distributions to Unitholders and since such Account is non-interest-bearing to  
Unitholders, the Trustee benefits thereby.                                      

Accrued Interest. Accrued interest is added to the Public Offering Price for
all Trusts not listed above. Accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid      
interest on securities which generally is paid semi-annually, although each     
Trust accrues interest daily. Because of this, a Trust always has an amount of  
interest earned but not yet collected by the Trustee. For this reason, with     
respect to sales settling after the First Settlement Date, the proportionate    
share of accrued interest as described in this paragraph to the settlement date 
is added to the Public Offering Price of Units for all Trusts not mentioned     
above. Unitholders will receive the amount of accrued interest paid on their    
Units on the next distribution date. In an effort to reduce the accrued interest
which would have to be paid by Unitholders, the Trustee will advance the amount 
of accrued interest to the Sponsor as the Unitholder of record as of the First  
Settlement Date. Consequently, the accrued interest added to the Public Offering
Price of Units will include only accrued interest from the First Settlement Date
to the date of settlement, less any distributions from the Interest Account     
after the First Settlement Date. Because of the varying interest payment dates  
of the bonds, accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the    
amount of interest actually received by a Trust and distributed to Unitholders. 
If a Unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of his Units, he will be      
entitled to receive his proportionate share of the accrued interest from the    
purchaser of his Units.                                                         

  Unit Distribution. Units will be distributed to the public by broker-dealers
and others at the Public Offering Price, plus accrued interest. The Sponsor     
intends to qualify Units for sale in a number of states. Broker-dealers or      
others will be allowed a concession or agency commission in connection with the 
distribution of Units equal to 80% of the sales charge applicable to the        
transaction provided that the Units are acquired from the Sponsor. Certain      
commercial banks may be making Units available to their customers on an agency  
basis. A portion of the sales charge paid by these customers (equal to the      
agency commission referred to above) is retained by or remitted to the banks.   
Any discount provided to investors will be borne by the selling dealer or agent.
The Sponsor reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any order for the
purchase of Units and to change the amount of the concession or agency          
commission to dealers and others up to the entire amount of the sales charge.   

   Sponsor Compensation. The Sponsor will receive a gross sales commission equal
to the sales charge applicable to the transaction involved. See "Public
Offering--General". In addition, the Sponsor realized a profit or loss, as a    
result of the difference between the price paid for the bonds by the Sponsor and
the cost of the bonds to a Trust. The Sponsor has not participated as sole      
underwriter or as manager or as a member of the underwriting syndicates from    
which the bonds in the Trusts were acquired. The Sponsor may further realize    
profit or loss as a result of possible fluctuations in the market value of the  
bonds since all proceeds received from purchasers of Units (excluding dealer    
concessions or agency commissions allowed, if any) will be retained by the      
Sponsor. The Sponsor will also realize profits or losses in the amount of any   
difference between the price at which Units are purchased and the price at which
Units are resold in connection with maintaining a secondary market for Units and
will also realize profits or losses resulting from a redemption of repurchased  
Units at a price above or below the purchase price.                             

   Broker-dealers of the Trusts, banks and/or others are eligible to participate
in a program in which such firms receive from the Sponsor a nominal award for   
each of their representatives who have sold a minimum number of units of unit   
investment trusts created by the Sponsor during a specified time period. In     
addition, at various times the Sponsor may implement other programs under which 
the sales forces of such firms may be eligible to win other nominal awards for  
certain sales efforts, or under which the Sponsor will reallow to any such firms
that sponsor sales contests or recognition programs conforming to criteria      
established by the Sponsor, or participate in sales programs sponsored by the   
Sponsor, an amount not exceeding the total applicable sales charges on the sales
generated by such persons at the public offering price during such programs.    
Also, the Sponsor in its discretion may from time to time pursuant to objective 
criteria established by the Sponsor pay fees to qualifying firms for certain    
services or activities which are primarily intended to result in sales of Units 
of the Trusts. Such payments are made by the Sponsor out of its own assets, and 
not out of the assets of the Trusts. These programs will not change the price   
Unitholders pay for their Units or the amount that the Trusts will receive from 
the Units sold. Approximately every eighteen months the Sponsor holds a business
seminar which is open to certain Underwriters that sell units of trusts it      
sponsors. The Sponsor pays substantially all costs associated with the seminar, 
excluding travel costs. These Underwriters are invited to send a certain number 
of representatives based on the gross number of units such firm underwrites     
during a designated time period.                                                

Market for Units. Although not obligated to do so, the Sponsor intends to 
maintain a market for Units and offer to purchase Units at prices, subject to   
change at any time, based upon the aggregate bid prices of the bonds plus       
accrued interest and any principal cash on hand, less any amounts representing  
taxes or other governmental charges payable out of the Trust and less any       
accrued Trust expenses. If the supply of Units exceeds demand or if some other  
business reason warrants it, the Sponsor may either discontinue all purchases of
Units or discontinue purchases of Units at these prices. If a market is not     
maintained and the Unitholder cannot find another purchaser, a Unitholder will  
be able to dispose of Units by tendering them to the Trustee for redemption at  
the Redemption Price. See "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units". A       
Unitholder who wishes to dispose of his Units should inquire of his broker as to
current market prices in order to determine whether there is in any price in    
excess of the Redemption Price and, if so, the amount thereof. The Trustee will 
notify the Sponsor of any tender of Units for redemption. If the Sponsor's bid  
in the secondary market at that time equals or exceeds the Redemption Price per 
Unit, it may purchase the Units not later than the day on which the Units would 
otherwise have been redeemed by the Trustee.                                    

RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Distributions of Interest and Principal. Interest received by a Trust, pro
rated on an annual basis, will be distributed monthly unless a Unitholder elects
to receive quarterly or semi-annual distributions. Certain Trusts offer only    
monthly distribution options while others offer only monthly and semi-annual    
distribution options. The distribution options applicable to a Trust are        
described in Prospectus Part I. The plan of distribution selected by a          
Unitholder will remain in effect until changed. Unitholders who purchase Units  
in the secondary market will receive distributions in accordance with the       
election of the prior owner. Unitholders may change their distribution plan by  
indicating the change on a card which may be obtained from the Trustee and      
return the card to the Trustee with their certificates and other documentation  
required by the Trustee. Certificates should be sent by registered or certified 
mail to avoid their being lost or stolen. If the card and certificate are       
properly presented to the Trustee, the change will become effective on the first
day after the next semi-annual record date and will remain effective until      
changed.                                                                        

Interest received by a Trust, including that part of the proceeds of any  
disposition of bonds which represents accrued interest, is credited by the      
Trustee to the Interest Account. Other receipts are credited to the Principal   
Account. After deduction of amounts sufficient to reimburse the Trustee, without
interest, for any amounts advanced and paid to the Sponsor as the Unitholder of 
record as of the First Settlement Date, interest received will be distributed on
each distribution date to Unitholders of record as of the preceding record date.
All distributions will be net of estimated expenses. Funds in the Principal     
Account will be distributed on each semi-annual distribution date to Unitholders
of record as of the preceding semi-annual record date. The Trustee is not       
required to pay interest on funds held in the Principal or Interest Account (but
may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits from the use of these   
funds) nor to make a distribution from the Principal Account unless the amount  
available for distribution therein shall equal at least $1.00 per Unit. However,
should the amount available for distribution in the Principal Account equal or  
exceed $10.00 per Unit, the Trustee will make a special distribution from the   
Principal Account on the next monthly distribution date to Unitholders of record
on the related monthly record date.                                             

Because interest payments are not received by a Trust at a constant rate  
throughout the year, interest distributions may be more or less than the amount 
credited to the Interest Account as of the record date. For the purpose of      
minimizing fluctuations in interest distributions, the Trustee is authorized to 
advance amounts necessary to provide interest distributions of approximately    
equal amounts. The Trustee is reimbursed for these advances from funds in the   
Interest Account on the next record date. Persons who purchase Units between a  
record date and a distribution date will receive their first distribution on the
second distribution date after the purchase, under the applicable plan of       
distribution.                                                                   

Reinvestment Option. Unitholders may elect to have distributions on their 
Units automatically reinvested in shares of certain Van Kampen mutual funds     
which are registered in the Unitholder's state of residence (the "Reinvestment  
Funds"). Each Reinvestment Fund has investment objectives that differ from those
of the Trusts. The prospectus relating to each Reinvestment Fund describes its  
investment policies and the procedures to follow to begin reinvestment. A       
Unitholder may obtain a prospectus for the Reinvestment Funds from the Sponsor. 

  After becoming a participant in a reinvestment plan, each Trust distribution
will automatically be applied on the applicable distribution date to purchase   
shares of the applicable Reinvestment Fund at a net asset value computed on such
date. Unitholders with an existing Planned Reinvestment Option (PRO) Program    
account (whereby a sales charge is imposed on distribution reinvestments) may   
transfer their existing account into a new PRO account which allows purchases of
Reinvestment Fund shares at net asset value. Confirmations of all reinvestments 
will be mailed to the Unitholder by the Reinvestment Fund. A participant may    
elect to terminate his or her reinvestment plan and receive future distributions
in cash by notifying the Trustee in writing at least five days before the next  
distribution date. Each Reinvestment Fund, its sponsor and investment adviser   
have the right to terminate its reinvestment plan at any time. Each reinvestment
plan is subject to availability or limitation by each broker-dealer or selling  
firm. Broker-dealers may suspend or terminate the offering of a reinvestment    
plan at any time. Please contact your financial professional for additional     
information. Unitholders of New York Trusts who are New York residents may elect
to have distributions reinvested in shares of First Investors New York Insured  
Tax Free Fund, Inc. subject to a sales charge of $1.50 per $100 reinvested (paid
to First Investors Management Company, Inc.).                                   

The same federal income tax treatment will apply to distributions on Units
whether received by a Unitholder in cash or reinvested in a Reinvestment Fund   
pursuant to a reinvestment plan.                                                

Redemption of Units. A Unitholder may redeem all or a portion of his Units by
tender to the Trustee at Unit Investment Trust Division, 111 Sanders Creek      
Parkway, East Syracuse, New York 13057, of the certificates representing the    
Units to be redeemed, duly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of     
transfer with signature guaranteed (or by providing satisfactory indemnity, such
as in connection with lost, stolen or destroyed certificates) and by payment of 
applicable governmental charges, if any. Redemption of Units cannot occur until 
certificates representing the Units or satisfactory indemnity have been received
by the Trustee. No later than seven calendar days following satisfactory tender,
the Unitholder will receive an amount for each Unit equal to the Redemption     
Price per Unit next computed after receipt by the Trustee of the tender of      
Units. The "date of tender" is deemed to be the date on which Units are received
by the Trustee, except that as regards Units received after the Evaluation Time 
on days of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the date of tender is the    
next day on which that Exchange is open and the Units will be deemed to have    
been tendered to the Trustee on that day for redemption at the Redemption Price.
Redemption requests received by authorized financial professionals prior to the 
Evaluation Time that are properly transmitted to the Trustee by the time        
designated by the Trustee, are priced based on the date of receipt. Redemption  
requests received by the Trustee after the Evaluation Time, and redemption      
requests received by authorized financial professionals after the Evaluation    
Time or redemption requests received by such persons that are not transmitted to
the Trustee until after the time designated by the Trustee, are priced based on 
the date of the next determined redemption price provided they are received     
timely by the Trustee on such date. It is the responsibility of authorized      
financial professionals to transmit redemption requests received by them to the 
Trustee so they will be received in a timely manner. Certain broker-dealers or  
selling firms may charge an order handling fee for processing redemption        
requests. Units redeemed directly through the Trustee are not subject to such   
fees.                                                                           

 Under Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") regulations, the Trustee is required
to withhold a specified percentage of a Unit redemption if the Trustee has not  
received the Unitholder's tax identification number as required by such         
regulations or if the IRS notifies a Trust that such withholding is required.   
Any amount withheld is transmitted to the IRS and may be recovered by the       
Unitholder only when filing a return or a claim for refund. Under normal        
circumstances the Trustee obtains the Unitholder's tax identification number    
from the selling broker. However, at any time a Unitholder elects to tender     
Units for redemption, the Unitholder should provide a tax identification number 
to the Trustee in order to avoid this possible "back-up withholding".           

The Redemption Price per Unit (as well as the secondary market Public     
Offering Price) will be determined on the basis of the bid price of the bonds as
of the Evaluation Time on days of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the 
date any such determination is made. The Evaluator determines the Redemption    
Price per Unit on days Units are tendered for redemption. The Redemption Price  
per Unit is the pro rata share of each Unit on the basis of (i) the cash on hand
in the Trust or moneys in the process of being collected, (ii) the value of the 
bonds based on the bid prices of the bonds, except for cases in which the value 
of insurance has been included, (iii) accrued interest, less (a) amounts        
representing taxes or other governmental charges and (b) the accrued Trust      
expenses. The Evaluator may determine the value of the bonds by employing any of
the methods set forth in "Public Offering--Offering Price". In determining the  
Redemption Price per Unit no value will be assigned to the portfolio insurance  
maintained on the bonds in an Insured Trust unless the bonds are in default in  
payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of default. For a       
description of the situations in which the Evaluator may value the insurance    
obtained by the Insured Trusts, see "Public Offering--Offering Price". Accrued  
interest paid on redemption shall be withdrawn from the Interest Account or, if 
the balance therein is insufficient, from the Principal Account. All other      
amounts will be withdrawn from the Principal Account. Units so redeemed shall be
cancelled.                                                                      

   The price at which Units may be redeemed could be less than the price paid by
the Unitholder and may be less than the par value of the bonds represented by   
the Units redeemed. The Trustee may sell bonds to cover redemptions. When bonds 
are sold, the size and diversity of the Trust will be reduced. Sales may be     
required at a time when bonds would not otherwise be sold and might result in   
lower prices than might otherwise be realized.                                  

   In addition, with respect to Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Municipal Series 654 and
subsequent series, the Trustee reserves the right to satisfy any redemption of  
1,000 or more Units with an aggregate redemption price of $1,000,000 or more in 
an in kind distribution of bonds. An in kind distribution of bonds will be made 
by the Trustee through the distribution of each of the bonds in the Trust in    
book-entry form to the account of the Unitholder's broker-dealer at Depository  
Trust Company. Amounts representing fractional portions of a bond will be       
distributed in cash. The Trustee may adjust the bonds included in a Unitholder's
in kind distribution to facilitate the distribution of whole bonds. Special tax 
consequences will result if a Unitholder receives an in kind distribution. See  
"Tax Status".                                                                   

   The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any period
during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than for customary    
weekend and holiday closings, or during which the SEC determines that trading on
that Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists, as a result of which        
disposal or evaluation of the bonds is not reasonably practicable, or for other 
periods as the SEC may by order permit. Under certain extreme circumstances the 
Sponsor may apply to the SEC for an order permitting a full or partial          
suspension of the right of Unitholders to redeem their Units.                   

   Units. Ownership of Units is evidenced in book-entry form unless a Unitholder
makes a written request to the Trustee that ownership be in certificate form.   
Units are transferable by making a written request to the Trustee and, in the   
case of Units in certificate form, by presentation and surrender of the         
certificate to the Trustee properly endorsed or accompanied by a written        
instrument or instruments of transfer. A Unitholder must sign the written       
request, or certificate transfer instrument, exactly as his name appears on the 
records of the Trustee and on the face of any certificate with the signature    
guaranteed by a participant in the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program 
("STAMP") or a signature guaranty program accepted by the Trustee. The Trustee  
may require additional documents such as, but not limited to, trust instruments,
certificates of death, appointments as executor or administrator or certificates
of corporate authority. Certificates will be issued in denominations of one Unit
or any multiple thereof. Although no such charge is now made, the Trustee may   
require a Unitholder to pay a reasonable fee for each certificate re-issued or  
transferred and to pay any governmental charge that may be imposed in connection
with each transfer or interchange. Destroyed, stolen, mutilated or lost         
certificates will be replaced upon delivery to the Trustee of satisfactory      
indemnity, evidence of ownership and payment of expenses incurred. Mutilated    
certificates must be surrendered to the Trustee for replacement.                

  Reports Provided. Unitholders will receive a statement of interest and other
receipts received for each distribution. For as long as the Sponsor deems it to 
be in the best interest of Unitholders, the accounts of each Trust will be      
audited annually by independent registered public accounting firm and the report
of the accountants will be furnished to Unitholders upon request. Within a      
reasonable period of time after the end of each year, the Trustee will furnish  
to each person who was a registered Unitholder during that year a statement     
describing the interest and principal received on the bonds, actual Trust       
distributions, Trust expenses, a list of the bonds and other Trust information. 
Unitholders will be furnished the Evaluator's evaluations of the bonds upon     
request to the Trustee. If you have questions regarding your account or your    
Trust, please contact your financial advisor or the Trustee. The Sponsor does   
not have access to individual account information.                              

INSURANCE ON THE BONDS IN THE INSURED TRUSTS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Insurance has been obtained guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and   
principal, when due, in respect of the bonds in each Insured Trust. An insurance
policy obtained by an Insured Trust, if any, is non-cancelable and will continue
in force so long as the Trust is in existence, the respective Portfolio Insurer 
is still in business and the bonds described in the policy continue to be held  
by the Trust. Any portfolio insurance premium for an Insured Trust is paid by   
the Trust on a monthly basis. The premium for any Preinsured Bond insurance has 
been paid by the issuer, by a prior owner of the bonds or the Sponsor and any   
policy is noncancelable and will continue in force so long as the bonds so      
insured are outstanding and the Preinsured Bond Insurer remains in business. The
Portfolio Insurers and the Preinsured Bond Insurers are described in "Portfolio"
and the notes thereto in Prospectus Part I. More detailed information regarding 
insurance on the bonds and the Preinsured Bond and Portfolio Insurers is        
included in the Information Supplement. See "Additional Information".           

  The portfolio insurance obtained by an Insured Trust, if any, guarantees the
timely payment of principal and interest on the bonds when they fall due. For   
this purpose, "when due" generally means the stated payment or maturity date for
the payment of principal and interest. However, in the event (a) an issuer      
defaults in the payment of principal or interest, (b) an issuer enters into a   
bankruptcy proceeding or (c) the maturity of the bond is accelerated, the       
affected Portfolio Insurer has the option to pay the outstanding principal      
amount of the bond plus accrued interest to the date of payment and thereby     
retire the bond from the Trust prior to the bond's stated maturity date. The    
insurance does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the  
Units. The Trustee, upon the sale of a bond covered under a portfolio insurance 
policy has the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to the bond     
(i.e., insurance to maturity of the bond regardless of the identity of the      
holder) (the "Permanent Insurance") upon the payment of a single predetermined  
insurance premium and expenses from the proceeds of the sale of the bond. It is 
expected that the Trustee would exercise the right to obtain Permanent Insurance
only if upon exercise the Trust would receive net proceeds in excess of the sale
proceeds if the bonds were sold on an uninsured basis.                          

Each Portfolio Insurer is subject to regulation by the department of      
insurance in the state in which it is qualified to do business. Such regulation,
however, is no guarantee that each Portfolio Insurer will be able to perform on 
its contract of insurance in the event a claim should be made. At the date      
hereof, it is reported that no claims have been submitted or are expected to be 
submitted to any of the Portfolio Insurers which would materially impair the    
ability of any such company to meet its commitment pursuant to any contract of  
insurance. The information relating to each Portfolio Insurer has been furnished

  Van Kampen Funds Inc. and your Trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring
Van Kampen's employees who have access to information on Trust transactions to  
report personal securities transactions. The purpose of the code is to avoid    
potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct   
with respect to your Trust. The Information Supplement contains additional      
information about the Sponsor.                                                  

If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust    
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs 
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a        
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be          
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trusts as      
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the    
Trust Agreement.                                                                

Trustee. The Trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company      
organized under the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its       
principal unit investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, 
Brooklyn, New York 11217, telephone (800) 221-7668. If you have any questions   
regarding your account or your Trust, please contact the Trustee at its         
principal unit investment trust division offices or your financial advisor. The 
Sponsor does not have access to individual account information. The Bank of New 
York Mellon is subject to supervision and examination by the Superintendent of  
Banks of the State of New York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System, and its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance           
Corporation to the extent permitted by law. Additional information regarding the
Trustee is set forth in the Information Supplement, including the Trustee's     
qualifications and duties, its ability to resign, the effect of a merger        
involving the Trustee and the Sponsor's ability to remove and replace the       
Trustee. See "Additional Information".                                          

Portfolio Administration. The Trusts are not managed funds and, except as 
provided in the Trust Agreement, bonds generally will not be sold or replaced.  
The Sponsor may, however, direct that bonds be sold in certain limited          
situations to protect the Trust based on advice from the Supervisor. These      
situations may include default in interest or principal payments on the bonds or
other obligations of an issuer, an advanced refunding or institution of certain 
legal proceedings. In addition, the Trustee may sell bonds designated by the    
Supervisor for purposes of redeeming Units or payment of expenses. The          
Supervisor will consider a variety of factors in designating bonds to be sold   
including interest rates, market value and marketability. Except in limited     
circumstances, the Trustee must reject any offer by an issuer to issue bonds in 
exchange or substitution for the bonds (such as a refunding or refinancing      
plan). The Trustee will promptly notify Unitholders of any exchange or          
substitution. The Information Supplement contains a more detailed description of
circumstances in which bonds may be sold or replaced. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

  If a Trust is structured as a "regulated investment company" for federal tax
purposes, the Sponsor may direct the reinvestment of proceeds of the sale of    
bonds if the sale is the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which, 
in the opinion of the Sponsor, would make retention of the bonds detrimental to 
the Trust. In such a case, the Sponsor may, but is not obligated to, direct the 
reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria for
inclusion in the trust on the Date of Deposit. The Sponsor may also instruct the
Trustee to take action necessary to ensure that such a Trust continues to       
satisfy the requirements for qualification as a regulated investment company and
to avoid imposition of tax on undistributed income of the Trust.                

Replacement Bonds. No assurance can be given that a Trust will retain its 
present size or composition because bonds may be sold, redeemed or mature from  
time to time and the proceeds will be distributed to Unitholders and will not be
reinvested. In the event of a failure to deliver any bond that has been         
purchased under a contract ("Failed Bonds"), the Sponsor is authorized under the
Trust Agreement to direct the Trustee to acquire other bonds ("Replacement
Bonds") to make up the original portfolio of a Trust. Replacement Bonds must be 
purchased within 20 days after delivery of the notice of the failed contract and
the purchase price (exclusive of accrued interest) may not exceed the amount of 
funds reserved for the purchase of the Failed Bonds. The Replacement Bonds must 
be substantially identical to the Failed Bonds in terms of (i) the exemption    
from federal and state taxation, (ii) maturity, (iii) yield to maturity and     
current return, (iv) Standard & Poor's or Moody's ratings, and (v) insurance in 
an Insured Trust. The Trustee shall notify all Unitholders of a Trust within    
five days after the acquisition of a Replacement Bond and shall make a pro rata 
distribution of the amount, if any, by which the cost of the Failed Bond        
exceeded the cost of the Replacement Bond plus accrued interest. If Failed Bonds
are not replaced, the Sponsor will refund the sales charge attributable to the  
Failed Bonds to all Unitholders of the Trust and distribute the principal and   
accrued interest (at the coupon rate of the Failed Bonds to the date of removal 
from the Trust) attributable to the Failed Bonds within 30 days after removal.  
All interest paid to a Unitholder which accrued after the expected date of      
settlement for Units will be paid by the Sponsor and accordingly will not be    
treated as tax-exempt income. If Failed Bonds are not replaced, the Estimated   
Net Annual Interest Income per Unit would be reduced and the Estimated Current  
Return and Estimated Long-Term Return might be lowered. Unitholders may not be  
able to reinvest their proceeds in other securities at a yield equal to or in   
excess of the yield of the Failed Bonds.                                        

   Amendment of Trust Agreement. The Sponsor and the Trustee may amend the Trust
Agreement without the consent of Unitholders to correct any provision which may 
be defective or to make other provisions that will not materially adversely     
affect the interest of the Unitholders (as determined in good faith by the      
Sponsor and the Trustee). The Trust Agreement may not be amended to increase the
number of Units or to permit the acquisition of bonds in addition to or in      
substitution for any of the bonds initially deposited in the Trust, except for  
the substitution of certain refunding bonds. The Trustee will notify Unitholders
of any amendment.                                                               

Termination of Trust Agreement. A Trust will terminate upon the redemption,
sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the Trust. A Trust may also  
be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders of 51% of the Units then    
outstanding (or, with respect to Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Municipal Series 654   
and subsequent series, by consent of Unitholders of 75% of the Units then       
outstanding) or by the Trustee when the value of the Trust is less than 20% of  
the original principal amount of bonds. The Trustee will notify each Unitholder 
of any termination within a reasonable time and will then liquidate any         
remaining bonds. The sale of bonds upon termination may result in a lower amount
than might otherwise be realized if the sale was not required at that time. For 
this reason, among others, the amount realized by a Unitholder upon termination 
may be less than the principal amount of bonds per Unit or value at the time of 
purchase. The Trustee will distribute to each Unitholder his share of the       
balance of the Interest and Principal Accounts after deduction of costs,        
expenses or indemnities. The Unitholder will receive a final distribution       
statement with this distribution. When the Trustee in its sole discretion       
determines that any amounts held in reserve are no longer necessary, it will    
distribute these amounts to Unitholders. The Information Supplement contains    
further information regarding termination of a Trust. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

Limitation on Liabilities. The Sponsor, Supervisor, Evaluator and Trustee 
shall be under no liability to Unitholders for taking any action or for         
refraining from taking any action in good faith pursuant to the Trust Agreement,
or for errors in judgment, but shall be liable only for their own willful       
misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence (negligence in the case of the       
Trustee) in the performance of their duties or by reason of their reckless      
disregard of their obligations and duties hereunder. The Trustee shall not be   
liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale by the Trustee of
any of the bonds. In the event of the failure of the Sponsor to act under the   
Trust Agreement, the Trustee may act thereunder and shall not be liable for any 
action taken by it in good faith under the Trust Agreement. The Trustee is not  
liable for any taxes or governmental charges imposed on the bonds, on it as     
Trustee under the Trust Agreement or on the Fund which the Trustee may be       
required to pay under any present or future law of the United States of America 
or of any other taxing authority having jurisdiction. In addition, the Trust    
Agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the     
Trustee. The Trustee and Sponsor may rely on any evaluation furnished by the    
Evaluator and have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof. Determinations by
the Evaluator shall be made in good faith upon the basis of the best information
available to it; provided, however, that the Evaluator shall be under no        
liability to the Trustee, Sponsor or Unitholders for errors in judgment.        

FEDERAL TAX STATUS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Grantor Trusts                                                                  

This section summarizes some of the principal U.S. federal income tax     
consequences of owning Units of a Trust that has been structured to be treated  
as a grantor trust for federal tax purposes. Please see "Notes to Financial     
Statements" in Prospectus Part I. Tax laws and interpretations change           
frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to  
all taxpayers. For example, these summaries generally do not describe your      
situation if you are a corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, a       
tax-exempt enitity, or other investor with special circumstances. In addition,  
this section does not describe your state, local or foreign tax consequences.   

   This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice and opinion of
counsel to the Sponsor. The IRS could disagree with any conclusions set forth in
this section. In addition, our counsel was not asked to review the federal      
income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the Trust. The Trust may  
be subject to penalties under federal tax law with respect to its compliance and
reporting obligations.                                                          

As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual   
circumstances from your own tax advisor.                                        

Assets of the Trust. The Trust will hold various debt obligations (the    
"Bonds") of state and local governmental entities that constitute debt the      
interest on which is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes 
as described below. It is possible that the Trust will also hold other assets,  
including assets that are treated differently for federal income tax purposes   
from those described above, in which case you will have federal income tax      
consequences different from or in addition to those described in this section.  
All of the assets held by the Trust constitute the "Trust Assets." Neither our  
counsel nor we have analyzed the proper federal income tax treatment of the     
Trust Assets.                                                                   

Trust Status. If the Trust is at all times operated in accordance with the
documents establishing the Trust and certain requirements of federal income tax 
law are met, the Trust will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax
purposes. As a Unit owner, you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata       
portion of each of the Trust Assets, and as such you will be considered to have 
received a pro rata share of income (e.g., interest, accruals of original issue 
discount and market discount, and capital gains, if any) from each Trust Asset  
when such income would be considered to be received by you if you directly owned
the Trust Assets. This is true even if you elect to have your distributions     
reinvested into additional Units. In addition, the income from Trust Assets that
you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by    
amounts used to pay sales charges or Trust expenses.                            

  Exclusion from Gross Income of Interest. At the respective times of issuance
of the Bonds, opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the exclusion of 
interest thereon from federal gross income were rendered by bond counsel to the 
respective issuing authorities, based on certain representations and subject to 
compliance with certain covenants. Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel have made
any special review for the Trust of the proceedings relating to the issuance of 
the Bonds, the bases for the bond counsel opinions, or compliance with the      
covenants required for tax-exemption. The IRS has an ongoing program of auditing
tax-exempt obligations to determine whether, in the view of the IRS, interest on
such tax-exempt obligations is includible in the gross income of the owners     
thereof for federal income tax purposes. It cannot be predicted whether or not  
the IRS will commence an audit of any of the Bonds. If an audit is commenced,   
under current procedures of the IRS, Unitholders may have no right to           
participate in such procedure. If the interest on a Bond should be determined to
be taxable, the Bond would generally have to be sold at a substantial discount. 
In addition, investors could be required to pay income tax on interest received 
both prior to and after the date on which interest is determined to be taxable. 

   Your pro rata share of interest on the Bonds will be excluded from your gross
income for federal income tax purposes to the same extent that such interest    
would be excluded from your gross income if you directly owned the Bonds.       
However, such interest may be taken into account in computing the alternative   
minimum tax, and the branch profits tax imposed on certain foreign corporations.

Ownership of the Units may result in collateral federal income tax        
consequences to certain Unit holders, including, without limitation,            
corporations subject to the branch profits tax, financial institutions, certain 
insurance companies, certain S corporations, individual recipients of Social    
Security or Railroad Retirement benefits and Unit holders who may be deemed to  
have incurred (or continued) indebtedness to purchase or carry tax-exempt       
obligations.                                                                    

  If you are a "substantial user" of the facilities financed with the proceeds
of certain Bonds, or a related person to a substantial user, you will not be    
able to exclude from your gross income interest with respect to these Bonds.    
"Substantial user" and "related person" are defined under federal income tax    
law.                                                                            

For purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax for individuals and 
corporations, interest on certain bonds is included as an item of tax           
preference.                                                                     

   In the case of certain corporations, the alternative minimum tax depends upon
the corporation's alternative minimum taxable income ("AMTI"), which is the     
corporation's taxable income with certain adjustments. One of the adjustment    
items used in computing AMTI of a corporation (excluding S Corporations,        
Regulated Investment Companies, Real Estate Investment Trusts, REMICs or FASITs)
is an amount equal to 75% of the excess of such corporation's "adjusted current 
earnings" over an amount equal to its AMTI (before such adjustment item and the 
alternative tax net operating loss deduction. "Adjusted current earnings"       
includes all tax-exempt interest, including interest on all of the Bonds in the 
Trust. In addition, a branch profits tax is levied on the "effectively connected
earnings and profits" of certain foreign corporations, which include tax-exempt 
interest, such as interest on the Bonds in the Trust.                           

   Your Tax Basis and Income or Loss upon Disposition. If your Trust disposes of
Trust Assets, you will generally recognize gain or loss. If you dispose of your 
Units or redeem your Units for cash, you will also generally recognize gain or  
loss. To determine the amount of this gain or loss, you must subtract your tax  
basis in the related Trust Assets from your share of the total amount received  
in the transaction. You can generally determine your initial tax basis in each  
Trust Asset by apportioning the cost of your Units, including sales charges,    
among the Trust Assets ratably according to their values on the date you acquire
your Units. In certain circumstances, however, you may have to adjust your tax  
basis after you acquire your Units (for example, in the case of accruals of     
original issue discount, market discount, premium and accrued interest, as      
discussed below).                                                               

If you are an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net   
capital gain is generally 15% (zero for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax
brackets). These capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable years  
beginning before January 1, 2011. For later periods, if you are an individual,  
the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is scheduled         
generally to be 20% (10% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets).
The 20% rate is reduced to 18% and the 10% rate is reduced to 8% for long-term  
capital gains from most property acquired after December 31, 2000 with a holding
period of more than five years.                                                 

Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term   
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the     
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the     
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you 
purchase your Units to determine your holding period. The tax rates for capital 
gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as  
for ordinary income. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
however, also treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special        
situations.                                                                     

Discount, Accrued Interest and Premium on Bonds. Some Bonds may have been 
issued with original issue discount. This generally means that the Bonds were   
originally issued at a price below their face (or par) value. Original issue    
discount accrues on a daily basis and generally is treated as interest income   
for federal income tax purposes. Thus, the accrual of original discount will be 
excluded from your gross income for federal income tax purposes to the same     
extent as interest on the Bonds, as discussed above. Your basis of each Bond    
that was issued with original issue discount must be increased as original issue
discount accrues.                                                               

   Some Bonds may have been purchased by you or your Trust at a market discount.
Market discount is generally the excess of the stated redemption price at       
maturity for the Bond over the purchase price of the Bond. Market discount can  
arise based on the price your Trust pays for a Bond or based on the price you   
pay for your Units. Market discount is taxed as ordinary income. You will       
recognize this income when your Trust receives principal payments on the Bond,  
when the Bond is disposed of or redeemed, or when you sell or redeem your Units.
Alternatively, you may elect to include market discount in taxable income as it 
accrues. Whether or not you make this election will affect how you calculate    
your basis and the timing of certain interest expense deductions.               

 Alternatively, some Bonds may have been purchased by you or your Trust at a
premium. Generally, if the tax basis of your pro rata portion of any Bond,      
generally including sales charges, exceeds the amount payable at maturity, such 
excess is considered premium. You must amortize bond premium on a constant yield
basis over the remaining term of the Bond in a manner that takes into account   
potential call dates and call prices. You cannot deduct amortized bond premium  
relating to a Bond. The amortized bond premium is treated as a reduction in the 
tax-exempt interest received. As bond premium is amortized, it reduces your     
basis in the Bond. The tax basis reduction requirement may result in your       
realizing a taxable gain when your Units are sold or redeemed for an amount     
equal to or less than your cost.                                                

If the price of your Units includes accrued interest on a Bond, you must  
include the accrued interest in your tax basis in that Bond. When your Trust    
receives this accrued interest, you must treat it as a return of capital and    
reduce your tax basis in the Bond.                                              

This discussion provides only the general rules with respect to the tax   
treatment of original issue discount, market discount and premium. The rules,   
however, are complex and special rules apply in certain circumstances. For      
example, the accrual of market discount or premium may differ from the          
discussion set forth above in the case of Bonds that were issued with original  
issue discount.                                                                 

Exchanges. If you elect to have your proceeds from your Trust rolled over 
into a future series of the Trust, it is considered a sale for federal income   
tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain, and any
loss will be treated as a capital loss. However, any loss you incur in          
connection with the exchange of your Units of your Trusts for units of the next 
series will generally be disallowed with respect to this deemed sale and        
subsequent deemed repurchase, to the extent the two trusts have substantially   
identical Trust Assets under the wash sale provisions of the Code.              

In Kind Distributions. Under certain circumstances as described in this   
prospectus, you may request an In Kind Distribution of Trust Assets when you    
redeem your Units. By electing to receive an In Kind Distribution, you will     
receive Trust Assets plus, possibly, cash. You will not recognize gain or loss  
if you only receive whole Trust Assets in exchange for the identical amount of  
your pro rata portion of the same Trust Assets held by your Trust. However, if  
you also receive cash in exchange for a Trust Asset or a fractional portion of a
Trust Asset, you will generally recognize gain or loss based on the difference  
between the amount of cash you receive and your tax basis in such Trust Asset or
fractional portion.                                                             

Limitations on the Deductibility of Trust Expenses. Generally, for federal
income tax purposes, you must take into account your full pro rata share of your
Trust's income, even if some of that income is used to pay Trust expenses. You  
may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by your Trust to the same   
extent as if you directly paid the expense. You may be required to treat some or
all of the expenses of your Trust as miscellaneous itemized deductions.         
Individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions to the    
extent they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income. Your ability to deduct Trust    
expenses is also limited to the extent the expenses are allocable to tax-exempt 
interest from the Trust.                                                        

Regulated Investment Companies                                                  

This section summarizes some of the principal U.S. federal income tax     
consequences of owning Units of a Trust that intends to qualify as a "regulated 
investment company" under the federal tax laws. Please see "Notes to Financial  
Statements" in Prospectus Part I. Tax laws and interpretations change           
frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to  
all taxpayers. For example, these summaries generally do not describe your      
situation if you are a corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, a       
tax-exempt entity, or other investor with special circumstances. In addition,   
this section does not describe your state, local or foreign tax consequences.   

  This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to
the Sponsor. The IRS could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this      
section. In addition, our counsel was not asked to review the federal income tax
treatment of the assets to be deposited in the Trusts. A Trust may be subject to
penalties under federal tax law with respect to its compliance and reporting    
obligations.                                                                    

As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual   
circumstances from your own tax advisor.                                        

Trust Status. Certain Trusts intend to elect and to qualify annually as   
"regulated investment companies" under the federal tax laws. If a Trust         
qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes its income as       
required by the tax law, such Trust generally will not pay federal income taxes.
In addition, such Trusts intend to hold a sufficient amount of their assets in  
bonds that are exempt from U.S. federal income taxation so as to qualify to     
distribute exempt-interest dividends to Unitholders. Such exempt-interest       
dividends are not subject to regular U.S. federal income tax, but may be subject
to the alternative minimum tax. The Trusts may hold bonds issued by the         
Government of Puerto Rico or under its authority. Such bonds are exempt from    
taxation by the U.S. federal government, the government of Puerto Rico, any     
state or its political subdivisions, any possession of the United States, or the
District of Columbia.                                                           

Distributions. After the end of each year, you will receive a tax statement
that specifies your amounts of exempt-interest dividends, ordinary income       
distributions and capital gains dividends. Exempt-interest dividends generally  
are excluded from your gross income for federal income tax purposes. Some or all
of the exempt-interest dividends, however, may be taken into account in         
determining your alternative minimum tax and may have other tax consequences    
(e.g., they may affect the amount of your social security benefits that are     
taxed). Ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax  
rate. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital
gains regardless of how long you have owned your shares. In addition, the Trust 
may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and  
thus will generally not be taxable to you. The tax status of your distributions 
from your Trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in   
additional shares or receive them in cash. The income from your Trust that you  
must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts
used to pay a deferred sales charge, if any. The tax laws may require you to    
treat distributions made to you in January as if you had received them on       
December 31 of the previous year.                                               

Dividends Received Deduction and Qualified Dividend Income. A corporation 
that owns Units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received        
deduction with respect to dividends received from a Trust because the dividends 
received deduction is generally not available for distributions from regulated  
investment companies. An individual that owns Units generally will not be       
entitled to treat dividends received from a Trust as qualified dividend income  
currently taxed at long-term capital gains rates because it is not expected that
such dividends will be attributable to qualified dividend income received by    
such Trust.                                                                     

Sale or Redemption of Units. If you sell or redeem your Units, you will   
generally recognize a taxable gain or loss. To determine the amount of this gain
or loss, you must subtract your adjusted tax basis in your Units from the amount
you receive in the transaction. Your tax basis in your Units is generally equal 
to the cost of your Units, generally including sales charges. In some cases,    
however, you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your Units.   
Further, if you hold your Units for six months or less, any loss incurred by you
related to the disposition of such a Unit will be disallowed to the extent of   
the exempt-interest dividends you received.                                     

Capital Gains and Losses. If you are an individual, the maximum marginal  
federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally 15% (zero for taxpayers whose
marginal federal income tax rate is in the 10% and 15% tax brackets). These     
capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable years beginning before  
January 1, 2011. For later periods, if you are an individual, the maximum       
marginal federal tax rate for net capital gains currently is scheduled to be    
generally 20% (10% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets). The  
20% rate is reduced to 18% and the 10% rate is reduced to 8% for long-term      
capital gains from most property acquired after December 31, 2000 with a holding
period of more than five years.                                                 

Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term   
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the     
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the     
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you 
purchase your Units to determine your holding period. However, if you receive a 
capital gain dividend from your Trust and sell your Unit at a loss after holding
it for six months or less, the loss will be disallowed to the extent of the     
exempt-interest dividends you received. To the extent, if any, it is not        
disallowed, it will be recharacterized as long-term capital loss to the extent  
of the capital gain dividend received. The tax rates for capital gains realized 
from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary    
income. The Code treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special     
situations.                                                                     

Exchanges. If you elect to have your proceeds from your Trust rolled over 
into a future series of the Trust, the exchange would generally be considered a 
sale and a taxable transaction for federal income tax purposes.                 

In Kind Distributions. Under certain circumstances, as described in this  
prospectus, you may receive an in kind distribution of Trust Assets when you    
redeem your Units. This distribution will be treated as a sale for federal      
income tax purposes and you will generally recognize gain or loss, generally    
based on the value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash        
received. The IRS could however assert that a loss could not be currently       
deducted.                                                                       

 Deductibility of Trust Expenses. Generally, expenses incurred by your Trust
will be deducted from the gross income received by your Trust and your share of 
the Trust's net taxable income, if any, will be paid to you and reported as     
taxable income to you. However, if the Units of your Trust are held by fewer    
than 500 Unitholders at any time during a taxable year, your Trust will         
generally not be able to deduct certain expenses from income, thus resulting in 
your reported share of your Trust's taxable income being increased by your share
of those expenses, even though you do not receive a corresponding cash          
distribution. In this case you may be able to take a deduction for these        
expenses; however, certain miscellaneous itemized deductions, such as investment
expenses, may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these   
deductions exceed 2% of the individual's adjusted gross income.                 

  Further, because the Trusts pay exempt-interest dividends, which are treated
as exempt interest for federal income tax purposes, you will not be able to     
deduct some of your interest expense for debt that you incur or continue to     
purchase or carry your Units.                                                   

   Investors may be subject to state, local, or foreign taxes in connection with
their investment in a Trust. Investors are encouraged to consult their own tax  
advisors regarding the specific federal (including the federal alternative      
minimum tax), state, local, and foreign tax consequences that may affect them as
a result of an investment in a Trust.                                           

STATE TRUST RISK FACTORS AND TAX STATUS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

State Tax Exemptions In General                                                 

The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the ability of the states to provide a  
state tax exemption for interest derived from in-state municipal bonds while    
subjecting interest derived from municipal bonds issued by other states and     
their political subdivisions to tax. The Court's decision affirms current market
practice and should not impact the state and local income and franchise tax     
treatment of distributions from the Trusts as described herein.                 

Grantor Trusts                                                                  

Arizona Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Arizona is  
affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and   
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the Bonds, are    
affected by numerous factors. Severe weather conditions, as well as natural     
disasters, may have a significant impact on the State's economy.                

The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final   
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

Further information concerning Arizona risk factors may be obtained upon  
request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".                

Arizona Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to qualify as "grantor trusts"  
under the federal tax laws. For a discussion of the federal tax treatment of    
income earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see "Federal Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts" above.                                                  

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--Arizona Tax Status" are defined solely for purposes of  
this subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other sections of this  
prospectus.                                                                     

  This section summarizes some of the Arizona tax consequences to residents of
the State of Arizona of owning Units of an Arizona Trust (the "Trust") treated  
as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. Tax laws and interpretations
change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of the tax           
consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on the advice of   
counsel to the Sponsor. The Arizona taxing authorities could disagree with any  
conclusions set forth in this section.                                          

 At the time of the closing, special Arizona tax counsel ("Arizona Counsel")
to the Trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form below addressing     
certain Arizona tax consequences under then-existing Arizona income tax law to  
Unitholders subject to Arizona income tax.                                      

 The assets of the Trust will consist of interest-bearing obligations issued
by or on behalf of the State of Arizona, it political subdivisions and          
authorities (the "Arizona Bonds"), and certain bonds issued by Puerto Rico      
authorities (the "Possession Bonds", and together with the Arizona Bonds, the   
"Bonds"), provided the interest on such Bonds received by the Trust is exempt   
from State income taxes.                                                        

 Neither the Sponsor, nor its counsel, nor Arizona Counsel has independently
examined the Bonds to be deposited in and held in the Trust. However, although  
Arizona Counsel expressed no opinion with respect to such matters, in rendering 
its opinion it assumed that: (i) the Bonds were validly issued, (ii) the        
interest thereon is excludable from gross income for federal income tax         
purposes, and (iii) interest on the Bonds, if received directly by an Arizona   
Unitholder, would be exempt from the Arizona income tax. Arizona Counsel assumed
that, at the respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions that the Bonds 
were validly issued and that interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income
for federal income tax purposes were rendered by bond counsel to the respective 
issuing authorities. In addition, Arizona Counsel assumed that, with respect to 
the Arizona Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions    
that the interest on the Arizona Bonds is exempt from the Arizona income tax    
and, with respect to the Possession Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing          
authorities rendered opinions that the Possession Bonds and the interest thereon
is exempt from all state and local income taxation. Neither the Sponsor, nor its
counsel, nor Arizona Counsel made any review for the Trust of the proceedings   
relating to the issuance of the Bonds or of the basis for the opinions rendered 
in connection therewith.                                                        

 Based on the assumptions above, Arizona Counsel rendered its opinion to the
Trust at closing that, under then-existing Arizona law:                         

        (1)For Arizona income tax purposes, each Unitholder will be treated as
           the owner of a pro rata portion of the Trust, and the income of the
       Trust therefore will be treated as the income of the Unitholder
under Arizona State law.                                

    (2)For Arizona income tax purposes, interest on the Bonds which is
     excludable from federal gross income and which is exempt from
           Arizona income taxes when received by the Trust, and which would be
           excludable from federal gross income and exempt from Arizona income
          taxes if received directly by a Unitholder, will retain its status
            as tax-exempt interest when received by the Trust and distributed to
the Unitholders.                                        

       (3)To the extent that interest derived from the Trust by a Unitholder
          with respect to the Bonds is excludable from federal gross income,
  such interest will not be subject to Arizona income taxes.

    (4)Interest on the Possession Bonds which is excludable from gross
          income for federal tax purposes and is exempt from state and local
           taxation pursuant to federal law when received by the Trust will be
     exempt from Arizona income taxation and therefore will not be
           includible in the income of the Unitholders for income tax purposes
      when distributed by the Trust and received by the Unitholders.

         (5)Each Unitholder will receive taxable gain or loss for Arizona income
      tax purposes when Bonds held in the Trust are sold, exchanged,
       redeemed or paid at maturity, or when the Unitholder redeems or
           sells Units, at a price that differs from original cost as adjusted
           for accretion of Bond discount or amortization of premium and other
    basis adjustments, including any basis reduction that may be
     required to reflect a Unitholder's share of interest, if any,
      accruing on Bonds during the interval between the Unitholder's
           settlement date and the date such Bonds are delivered to the Trust,
if later.                                               

      (6)Amounts paid by the Insurer under an insurance policy or policies
           issued to the Trust, if any, with respect to the Bonds in the Trust
        which represent maturing interest on defaulted Bonds held by the
            Trustee will be exempt from Arizona income taxes if, and to the same
         extent as, such interest would have been so exempt if paid by the
     issuer of the defaulted Bonds provided that, at the time such
      policies are purchased, the amounts paid for such policies are
            reasonable, customary and consistent with the reasonable expectation
            that the issuer of the Bonds, rather than the insurer, will pay debt
service on the Bonds.                                   

 (7)Arizona law does not permit a deduction for interest paid or
           incurred on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry
        Units in the Trust, the interest on which is exempt from Arizona
        income taxes. Special rules apply to financial institutions, and
            such institutions should consult their own tax advisors with respect
to deductions of interest.                              

        (8)Neither the Bonds nor the Units will be subject to Arizona property
taxes, sales tax or use tax.                            

  Arizona Counsel did not examine any of the Bonds to be deposited and held in
the Trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of bond   
counsel with respect thereto, and Arizona Counsel expressed no opinion with     
respect to taxation under any other provisions of Arizona law.                  

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other Arizona tax          
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

Arkansas Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Arkansas is
affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and   
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the Bonds, are    
affected by numerous factors. Severe weather conditions, as well as natural     
disasters, may have a significant impact on the State's economy.                

The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final   
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

Further information concerning Arkansas risk factors may be obtained upon 
request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".                

Arkansas Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to qualify as "grantor trusts" 
under the federal tax laws. For a discussion of the federal tax treatment of    
income earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see "Federal Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts" above.                                                  

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--Arkansas Tax Status" are defined solely for purposes of 
this subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other sections of this  
prospectus.                                                                     

   This section summarizes some of the Arkansas tax consequences to residents of
the State of Arkansas of owning Units of an Arkansas Trust (the "Trust") treated
as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. Tax laws and interpretations
change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of the tax           
consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on the advice of   
counsel to the Sponsor. The Arkansas taxing authorities could disagree with any 
conclusions set forth in this section.                                          

   At the time of the closing, special Arkansas tax counsel ("Arkansas Counsel")
to the Trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form below addressing     
certain Arkansas tax consequences under then-existing Arkansas income tax law to
Unitholders subject to Arkansas income tax.                                     

   The assets of the Trust will consist of bonds issued by the State of Arkansas
or a local government of Arkansas (the "Bonds"). Arkansas Counsel rendered its  
opinion at closing that, under then-existing Arkansas law:                      

 (1)The Trust is not an association  taxable as a corporation or
otherwise for purposes of Arkansas  income taxation;    

        (2)Each Arkansas Unitholder will be treated as the owner of a pro rata
            portion of the Trust for Arkansas income tax purposes, and will have
     a taxable event when the Trust disposes of a Bond or when the
         Unitholder sells, exchanges, redeems or otherwise disposes of his
Units;                                                  

        (3)Any gains realized upon the sale, exchange, maturity, redemption or
     other disposition of Bonds held by the Trust resulting in the
         distribution of income to Arkansas Unitholders will be subject to
        Arkansas income taxation to the extent that such income would be
         subject to Arkansas income taxation if the Bonds were held, sold,
    exchanged, redeemed or otherwise disposed of by the Arkansas
Unitholders; and                                        

    (4)Interest on Bonds, issued by the State of Arkansas, or by or on
            behalf of political subdivisions, thereof, that would be exempt from
            federal income taxation when paid directly to an Arkansas Unitholder
         will be exempt from Arkansas income taxation when received by the
          Arkansas Trust and attributed to such Arkansas Unitholder and when
distributed to such Arkansas Unitholder.                

   Arkansas Counsel did not examine any of the Bonds to be deposited and held in
the Trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of bond   
counsel with respect thereto, and Arkansas Counsel expressed no opinion with    
respect to taxation under any other provisions of Arkansas law.                 

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other Arkansas tax         
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

 California Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of California
is affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and
conditions. Additionally, limitations imposed by constitutional amendments,     
legislative measures, or voter initiatives on the State and its local           
governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and other matters may constrain 
the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its local governments and,     
therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to satisfy their obligations.

The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the Bonds, are    
affected by numerous factors, such as natural disasters, complications with     
exports and industry deregulation.                                              

The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final   
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

 Further information concerning California risk factors may be obtained upon
request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".                

California Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to qualify as "grantor trusts"
under the federal tax laws. For a discussion of the federal tax treatment of    
income earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see "Federal Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts" above.                                                  

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--California Tax Status" are defined solely for purposes  
of this subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other sections of    
this prospectus.                                                                

  This section summarizes some of the California tax consequences to residents
of the State of California of owning Units of a California Trust (the "Trust")  
treated as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. Tax laws and        
interpretations change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of   
the tax consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on the     
advice of counsel to the Sponsor. The California taxing authorities could       
disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section.                        

At the time of the closing, special California tax counsel ("California   
Counsel") to the Trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form below      
addressing certain California tax consequences under then-existing California   
income tax law to Unitholders subject to California income tax.                 

   California Counsel examined the income tax laws of the State of California to
determine their applicability to the Trust and to the holders of Units in the   
Trust who are full-time residents of the State of California ("California       
Unitholders"). The assets of the Trust will consist of bonds issued by the State
of California or a local government of California (the "California Bonds") or by
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or its authority (the "Possession Bonds", and   
together with the California Bonds, the "Bonds"). For purposes of rendering its 
opinions at closing, California Counsel assumed that each asset of the Trust    
will be debt, the interest on which is excluded from gross income for federal   
income tax purposes.                                                            

Neither the Sponsor, nor its counsel, nor California Counsel has          
independently examined the Bonds to be deposited in and held in the Trust.      
However, although California Counsel expressed no opinion with respect to the   
issuance of the Bonds, in rendering its opinion at closing it assumed that: (i) 
the Bonds were validly issued, (ii) the interest thereon is excludable from     
gross income for federal income tax purposes, and (iii) interest on the Bonds,  
if received directly by a California Unitholder, would be exempt from the income
tax imposed by the State of California that is applicable to individuals, trusts
and estates (the "California Personal Income Tax"). The opinion of California   
Counsel did not address the taxation of persons other than full time residents  
of California. California Counsel assumed that, at the respective times of      
issuance of the Bonds, opinions that the Bonds were validly issued and that     
interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax      
purposes were rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities. In
addition, California Counsel assumed that, with respect to the California Bonds,
bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions that the interest on  
the California Bonds is exempt from the California Personal Income Tax and, with
respect to the Possession Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing authorities        
rendered opinions that the Possession Bonds and the interest thereon is exempt  
from all state and local income taxation. Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel   
nor California Counsel made any review for the Trust of the proceedings relating
to the issuance of the Bonds or of the basis for the opinions rendered in       
connection therewith.                                                           

   Based upon the foregoing, and upon an investigation of such matters of law as
California Counsel considered to be applicable, California Counsel rendered its 
opinion to the Trust at closing that, under then-existing California law:       

 (1)The Trust is not an association taxable as a corporation for
           purposes of the California Corporation Tax Law, and each California
            Unitholder will be treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of the
          Trust, and the income of such portion of the Trust will be treated
       as the income of the California Unitholders for purposes of the
California Personal Income Tax.                         

        (2)Interest on the Bonds which is exempt from tax under the California
          Personal Income Tax when received by the Trust, and which would be
     excludable from California taxable income for purposes of the
           California Personal Income Tax if received directly by a California
         Unitholder, will be excludable from California taxable income for
           purposes of the California Personal Income Tax when received by the
Trust and distributed to a California Unitholder.       

     (3)Each California Unitholder of the Trust will generally recognize
       gain or loss for California Personal Income Tax purposes if the
  Trustee disposes of a Bond (whether by redemption, sale or
           otherwise) or when the California Unitholder redeems or sells Units
        of the Trust, to the extent that such a transaction results in a
         recognized gain or loss to such California Unitholder for federal
           income tax purposes. However, there are certain differences between
           the recognition of gain or loss for federal income tax purposes and
   for California Personal Income Tax purposes, and California
            Unitholders are advised to consult their own tax advisors. Tax basis
            reduction requirements relating to amortization of bond premium may,
   under some circumstances, result in a California Unitholder
          realizing taxable gain for California Personal Income Tax purposes
           when a Unit is sold or redeemed for an amount equal to or less than
its original cost.                                      

       (4)Under the California Personal Income Tax, interest on indebtedness
          incurred or continued by a California Unitholder to purchase Units
     in the Trust is not deductible for purposes of the California
Personal Income Tax.                                    

The opinion of California Counsel was limited to California Unitholders   
subject to the California Personal Income Tax. No opinion was expressed with    
respect to the taxation of California Unitholders subject to the California     
Corporation Tax Law, and such California Unitholders are advised to consult     
their own tax advisors. California Counsel did note, however, that interest on  
the underlying Bonds attributed to a California Unitholder that is subject to   
the California Corporation Tax Law may be includible in its gross income for    
purposes of determining its California franchise tax. California Counsel did not
examine any of the Bonds to be deposited and held in the Trust or the           
proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of bond counsel with       
respect thereto, and California Counsel expressed no opinion with respect to    
taxation under any other provisions of California law.                          

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other California tax       
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

Colorado Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Colorado is
affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and   
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the Bonds, are    
affected by numerous factors. Severe weather conditions, as well as natural     
disasters, may have a significant impact on the State's economy.                

The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final   
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

Further information concerning Colorado risk factors may be obtained upon 
request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".                

Colorado Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to qualify as "grantor trusts" 
under the federal tax laws. For a discussion of the federal tax treatment of    
income earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see "Federal Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts" above.                                                  

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--Colorado Tax Status" are defined solely for purposes of 
this subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other sections of this  
prospectus.                                                                     

   This section summarizes some of the Colorado tax consequences to residents of
the State of Colorado of owning Units of a Colorado Trust (the "Trust") treated 
as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. Tax laws and interpretations
change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of the tax           
consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on the advice of   
counsel to the Sponsor. The Colorado authorities could disagree with any        
conclusions set forth in this section.                                          

   At the time of the closing, special Colorado tax counsel ("Colorado Counsel")
to the Trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form below addressing     
certain Colorado tax consequences under then-existing Colorado income tax law to
Unitholders subject to Colorado income tax.                                     

   The assets of the Colorado Trust will consist of interest-bearing obligations
issued by or on behalf of the State of Colorado ("Colorado") or counties,       
municipalities, authorities or political subdivisions thereof (the "Colorado    
Bonds") or by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (the "Puerto Rico Bonds", and     
together with the Colorado Bonds, the "Bonds") the interest on which is expected
to qualify as exempt from Colorado income taxes.                                

  Neither the Sponsor, nor its counsel, nor Colorado Counsel has independently
examined the Bonds to be deposited in and held in the Trust. However, although  
Colorado Counsel expressed no opinion with respect to the issuance of the Bonds,
in rendering its opinion it assumed that: (i) the Bonds were validly issued,    
(ii) the interest thereon is excludable from gross income for federal income tax
purposes, and (iii) interest on the Bonds, if received directly by a Unitholder,
would be exempt from the income tax imposed by Colorado that is applicable to   
individuals and corporations (the "Colorado Income Tax").                       

It is assumed that, at the respective times of issuance of the Bonds: (i) 
opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the exemption of interest      
thereon from federal income tax were rendered by bond counsel to the respective 
issuing authorities, (ii) with respect to the Colorado Bonds, bond counsel to   
the issuing authorities rendered opinions that the interest on the Colorado     
Bonds is exempt from the Colorado Income Tax and, (iii) with respect to the     
Possession Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions that
the interest on the Puerto Rico Bonds is exempt from all state and local income 
taxation. Neither the Sponsor, nor its counsel, nor Colorado Counsel made any   
review for the Trust of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the Bonds or
of the bases for the opinions rendered in connection therewith. This opinion of 
Colorado Counsel did not address the taxation of persons other than full time   
residents of Colorado.                                                          

In the opinion of Colorado Counsel rendered to the Trust at closing, in   
summary under then-existing Colorado law:                                       

       (1)Because Colorado income tax law is based upon the federal law, the
         Colorado Trust is not an association taxable as a corporation for
purposes of Colorado income taxation.                   

      (2)With respect to Colorado Unitholders, in view of the relationship
      between federal and Colorado tax computations described above:

           (i) Each Colorado Unitholder will be treated as owning a pro rata
          share of each asset of the Trust for Colorado income tax
             purposes in the proportion that the number of Units of such
           Trust held by the Unitholder bears to the total number of
             outstanding Units of the Trust, and the income of the Trust
          will therefore be treated as the income of each Colorado
               Unitholder under Colorado law in the proportion described and
                an item of income of the Trust will have the same character in
            the hands of a Colorado Unitholder as it would have if the
             Colorado Unitholder directly owned the assets of the Trust;

          (ii)Interest on Bonds that would not be includible in income for
               Colorado income tax purposes when paid directly to a Colorado
              Unitholder will be exempt from Colorado income taxation when
       received by the Trust and attributed to such Colorado
              Unitholder and when distributed to such Colorado Unitholder;

            (iii) To the extent that interest income derived from the Trust by
               a Unitholder with respect to Puerto Rico Bonds is exempt from
              state taxation pursuant to 48 U.S.C. 745, such interest will
not be subject to the Colorado Income Tax.    

         (iv)Any proceeds paid under an insurance policy or policies, if
                 any, issued to the Trust with respect to the Bonds in the Trust
              which represent maturing interest on defaulted Bonds held by
             the Trustee will be excludable from Colorado adjusted gross
           income if, and to the same extent as, such interest is so
           excludable for federal income tax purposes if paid in the
                normal course by the issuer notwithstanding that the source of
               payment is from insurance proceeds provided that, at the time
                 such policies are purchased, the amounts paid for such policies
              are reasonable, customary and consistent with the reasonable
           expectation that the issuer of the Bonds, rather than the
insurer, will pay debt service on the Bonds.  

             (v) Each Colorado Unitholder will realize taxable gain or loss when
          the Trust disposes of a Bond (whether by sale, exchange,
          redemption, or payment at maturity) or when the Colorado
                Unitholder redeems or sells Units at a price that differs from
                original cost as adjusted for amortization of bond discount or
          premium and other basis adjustments (including any basis
      reduction that may be required to reflect a Colorado
           Unitholder's share of interest, if any, accruing on Bonds
       during the interval between the Colorado Unitholder's
              settlement date and the date such Bonds are delivered to the
Trust, if later);                             

          (vi)Tax basis reduction requirements relating to amortization of
                bond premium may, under some circumstances, result in Colorado
                 Unitholders realizing taxable gain when their Units are sold or
             redeemed for an amount equal to or less than their original
cost; and                                     

      (vii) If interest on indebtedness incurred or continued by a
           Colorado Unitholder to purchase Units in the Trust is not
                 deductible for federal income tax purposes, it also will not be
deductible for Colorado income tax purposes.  

Unitholders should be aware that all tax-exempt interest, including their 
share of interest on the Bonds paid to the Trust, is taken into account for     
purposes of determining eligibility for the Colorado Property Tax/Rent/Heat     
Rebate.                                                                         

  Counsel to the Trust has expressed no opinion with respect to taxation under
any other provision of Colorado law. Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has    
independently examined the bonds or the opinions of bond counsel rendered in    
connection with the issuance of the bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may  
result in other Colorado tax consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective 
investors should consult their tax advisors.                                    

   Connecticut Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Connecticut
is affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the Bonds, are    
affected by numerous factors. Severe weather conditions, as well as natural     
disasters, may have a significant impact on the State's economy.                

The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final   
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

  Further information concerning Connecticut risk factors may be obtained upon
request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".                

Connecticut Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to qualify as "grantor trusts"
under the federal tax laws. For a discussion of the federal tax treatment of    
income earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see "Federal Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts" above.                                                  

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--Connecticut Tax Status" are defined solely for purposes 
of this subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other sections of    
this prospectus.                                                                

   This section summarizes some of the Connecticut tax consequences to residents
of the State of Connecticut of owning Units of a Connecticut Trust (the "Trust")
treated as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. Tax laws and        
interpretations change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of   
the tax consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on the     
advice of counsel to the Sponsor. The Connecticut taxing authorities could      
disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section.                        

At the time of the closing, special Connecticut tax counsel ("Connecticut 
Counsel") to the Trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form below      
addressing certain Connecticut tax consequences under then-existing Connecticut 
income tax law to Unitholders subject to Connecticut income tax.                

   The assets of the Trust will consist of obligations (the "Bonds"); certain of
the Bonds have been issued by or on behalf of the State of Connecticut or its   
political subdivisions or other public instrumentalities, state or local        
authorities, districts, or similar public entities created under the laws of the
State of Connecticut ("Connecticut Bonds"); the balance of the Bonds have been  
issued by or on behalf of entities classified for the relevant purposes as      
territories or possessions of the United States, including one or more of Puerto
Rico, Guam, or the Virgin Islands, the interest on the obligations of which     
federal law would prohibit Connecticut from taxing if received directly by the  
Unitholders. Certain Connecticut Bonds in the Trust were issued prior to the    
enactment of the Connecticut income tax on the Connecticut taxable income of    
individuals, trusts, and estates (the "Connecticut Income Tax"); therefore, bond
counsel to the issuers of such Bonds did not opine as to the exemption of the   
interest on such Bonds from such tax. However, the Sponsor and Connecticut      
Counsel believe that such interest will be so exempt. Interest on other Bonds in
the Trust, if any, is, in the opinion of bond counsel to such issuers, exempt   
from state taxation.                                                            

Connecticut Counsel rendered its opinion to the Trust at closing, which   
relied explicitly on the opinion of the Trust's federal income tax counsel at   
closing regarding federal income tax matters, that under then-existing          
Connecticut law:                                                                

     (1)The Trust is not liable for any tax on or measured by net income
imposed by the State of Connecticut;                    

      (2)Interest income from a Connecticut Bond, or from a Bond issued by
      United States territories or possessions the interest on which
      federal law would prohibit Connecticut from taxing if received
        directly by a Unitholder from the issuer thereof, is not taxable
  under the Connecticut Income Tax when any such interest is
        received by the Trust or distributed by it to such a Unitholder;

   (3)Insurance proceeds received by the Trust representing maturing
           interest on defaulted Bonds held by the Trust are not taxable under
      the Connecticut Income Tax if, and to the same extent as, such
        interest would not be taxable thereunder if paid directly to the
Trust by the issuer of such Bonds;                      

       (4)Gains and losses recognized by a Unitholder for federal income tax
          purposes upon the maturity, redemption, sale, or other disposition
        by the Trust of a Bond held by the Trust or upon the redemption,
   sale, or other disposition of a Unit of the Trust held by a
           Unitholder are taken into account as gains or losses, respectively,
            for purposes of the Connecticut Income Tax, except that, in the case
            of a Unitholder holding a Unit of the Trust as a capital asset, such
           gains and losses recognized upon the maturity, redemption, sale, or
          exchange of a Connecticut Bond held by the Trust are excluded from
            gains and losses taken into account for purposes of such tax, and no
            opinion is expressed as to the treatment for purposes of such tax of
  gains and losses recognized, to the extent attributable to
          Connecticut Bonds, upon the redemption, sale, or other disposition
by a Unitholder of a Unit of the Trust held by him;     

         (5)The portion of any interest income or capital gain of the Trust that
       is allocable to a Unitholder that is subject to the Connecticut
          corporation business tax is includible in the gross income of such
Unitholder for purposes of such tax; and                

        (6)An interest in a Unit of the Trust that is owned by or attributable
           to a Connecticut resident at the time of his death is includible in
           his gross estate for purposes of the Connecticut succession tax and
the Connecticut estate tax.                             

Generally, a Unitholder recognizes gain or loss for purposes of the       
Connecticut Income Tax to the same extent as the Unitholder recognizes gain or  
loss for federal income tax purposes. Ordinarily this would mean that gain or   
loss would be recognized by a Unitholder upon the maturity, redemption, sale, or
other disposition by the Trust of a Bond held by it, or upon the redemption,    
sale or other disposition of a Unit of the Trust held by the Unitholder.        
However, gains and losses from the sale or exchange of Connecticut Bonds held as
capital assets are not taken into account for purposes of this tax. Regulations 
indicate that this rule would apply to gain or loss recognized by a Unitholder  
holding a Unit of the Trust as a capital asset upon the maturity, redemption,   
sale, or other disposition of a Connecticut Bond held by the Trust. However, it 
is not clear whether this rule would also apply, to the extent attributable to  
Connecticut Bonds held by the Trust, to gain or loss recognized by a Unitholder 
upon the redemption, sale, or other disposition of a Unit of the Trust held by  
such Unitholder. Unitholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors        
concerning these matters.                                                       

   Connecticut Counsel did not examine any of the Bonds to be deposited and held
in the Trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of bond
counsel with respect thereto, and Connecticut Counsel expressed no opinion with 
respect to taxation under any other provisions of Connecticut law.              

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other Connecticut tax      
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

Florida Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Florida is  
affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and   
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the Bonds, are    
affected by numerous factors. Severe weather conditions, as well as natural     
disasters, may have a significant impact on the State's economy.                

The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final   
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

Further information concerning Florida risk factors may be obtained upon  
request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".                

Florida Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to qualify as "grantor trusts"  
under the federal tax laws. For a discussion of the federal tax treatment of    
income earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see "Federal Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts" above.                                                  

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--Florida Tax Status" are defined solely for purposes of  
this subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other sections of this  
prospectus.                                                                     

  This section summarizes some of the Florida tax consequences to residents of
the State of Florida of owning Units of a Florida Trust (the "Trust") treated as
a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. Tax laws and interpretations   
change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of the tax           
consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on the advice of   
counsel to the Sponsor. The Florida taxing authorities could disagree with any  
conclusions set forth in this section.                                          

 At the time of the closing, special Florida tax counsel ("Florida Counsel")
to the Trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form below addressing     
certain Florida tax consequences under then-existing Florida tax law to         
Unitholders subject to Florida tax.                                             

 The bonds issued by the State of Florida or its political subdivisions (the
"Florida Bonds") were accompanied by opinions of bond counsel to the respective 
issuers thereof to the effect that the Florida Bonds were exempt from the       
Florida intangibles tax. The bonds issued by Puerto Rico or its authority (the  
"Puerto Rico Bonds", and together with the Florida Bonds, the "Bonds") were     
accompanied by opinions of bond counsel to the respective issuers thereof to the
effect that the Puerto Rico Bonds and the interest thereon is exempt from all   
state and local income taxation.                                                

  Neither the Sponsor, nor its counsel, nor Florida Counsel have independently
reviewed such opinions or examined the Bonds to be deposited in and held by the 
Florida IM-IT Trust and they have assumed the correctness as of the date of     
deposit of the opinions of bond counsel and that the Bonds are and will continue
to be exempt from such taxes. It is assumed for purposes of the opinion of      
Florida Counsel issued at closing as described below that the Bonds constitute  
debt for federal income tax purposes.                                           

  "Non-Corporate Unitholder" means a Unitholder of the Florida IM-IT Trust who
is an individual not subject to the Florida state income tax on corporations    
under Chapter 220, Florida Statutes and "Corporate Unitholder" means a          
Unitholder of the Florida IM IT Trust that is a corporation, bank or savings    
association or other entity subject to Florida state income tax on corporations 
or franchise tax imposed on banks or savings associations under Chapter 220,    
Florida Statutes.                                                               

Florida Counsel rendered its opinion at closing that, under then-existing 
Florida law:                                                                    

        (1)For Florida state income tax purposes, the Florida IM-IT Trust will
        not be subject to the Florida income tax imposed by Chapter 220,
Florida Statutes.                                       

  (2)Because Florida does not impose an income tax on individuals,
            Non-Corporate Unitholders residing in Florida will not be subject to
           any Florida income taxation on income realized by the Florida IM-IT
Trust. Any amounts paid to the Florida IM-IT Trust or to
         Non-Corporate Unitholders under an insurance policy issued to the
            Florida IM-IT Trust or the Sponsor which represent maturing interest
           on defaulted obligations held by the Trustee will not be subject to
        the Florida income tax imposed by Chapter 220, Florida Statutes.

       (3)Corporate Unitholders with commercial domiciles in Florida will be
          subject to Florida income or franchise taxation on income realized
          by the Florida IM-IT Trust and on payments of interest pursuant to
       any insurance policy to the extent such income constitutes "non
          business income" as defined by Chapter 220, Florida Statutes or is
           otherwise allocable to Florida under Chapter 220, Florida Statutes.
        Other Corporate Unitholders will be subject to Florida income or
            franchise taxation on income realized by the Florida IM-IT Trust (or
         on payments of interest pursuant to any insurance policy) only to
the extent that the income realized does not constitute 
         "non-business income" as defined by Chapter 220, Florida Statutes
          and if such income is otherwise allocable to Florida under Chapter
            220, Florida Statutes. However, no opinion is expressed with respect
        to the treatment under Chapter 220, Florida Statutes of any such
income that is attributable to the Puerto Rico Bonds.   

        (4)Units will be subject to Florida estate tax only if held by Florida
           residents. However, the Florida estate tax is limited to the amount
           of the credit for state death taxes provided for in Section 2011 of
the Code.                                               

      (5)Neither the Bonds nor the Units will be subject to the Florida ad
          valorem property tax, the Florida intangible personal property tax
or the Florida sales or use tax.                        

   Florida Counsel expressed no opinion with respect to taxation under any other
provision of Florida law. The Florida intangible personal property tax was      
repealed effective January 1, 2007. Such repeal should have no impact on the    
opinion of Florida Counsel issued at closing, as such opinion concluded in item 
(5) above that neither the Bonds nor the Units will be subject to the Florida   
intangible personal property tax.                                               

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other Florida tax          
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

Georgia Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Georgia is  
affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and   
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations. Historically, the State has experienced significant  
revenue shortfalls.                                                             

The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the Bonds, are    
affected by numerous factors. Weather conditions may have a significant impact  
on Georgia's agricultural sector. In the past, widespread flooding in central   
and southern Georgia has caused extensive damage and destruction of farmland,   
private residences, businesses and local and state government facilities.       

The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final   
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

Further information concerning Georgia risk factors may be obtained upon  
request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".                

Georgia Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to qualify as "grantor trusts"  
under the federal tax laws. For a discussion of the federal tax treatment of    
income earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see "Federal Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts" above.                                                  

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--Georgia Tax Status" are defined solely for purposes of  
this subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other sections of this  
prospectus.                                                                     

  This section summarizes some of the Georgia tax consequences to residents of
the State of Georgia of owning Units of the Georgia IM-IT Trust (the "Trust")   
treated as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. Tax laws and        
interpretations change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of   
the tax consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on the     
advice of counsel to the Sponsor. The Georgia taxing authorities could disagree 
with any conclusions set forth in this section.                                 

 At the time of the closing, special Georgia tax counsel ("Georgia Counsel")
to the Trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form below addressing     
certain Georgia tax consequences under then-existing Georgia income tax law to  
Unitholders subject to Georgia income tax.                                      

 The assets of the Trust will consist of interest-bearing obligations issued
by or on behalf of the State of Georgia or counties, municipalities, authorities
or political subdivisions thereof (the "Georgia Bonds") and certain bonds issued
by Puerto Rico authorities (the "Possession Bonds", and together with the       
Georgia Bonds, the "Bonds").                                                    

 Neither the Sponsor, nor its counsel, nor Georgia Counsel has independently
examined the Bonds to be deposited in and held in the Trust. However, although  
no opinion is expressed herein regarding such matters, it is assumed that (i)   
the Bonds were validly issued, (ii) the interest thereon is excludable from     
gross income for federal income tax purposes, and (iii) interest on the Bonds,  
if received directly by a Georgia Unitholder, would be exempt from the Georgia  
income tax. Georgia Counsel assumed for purposes of its opinion delivered at    
closing that, at the respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions        
relating to the validity thereof and to the exemption of interest thereon from  
federal income tax were rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing      
authorities. In addition, Georgia Counsel assumed that, with respect to the     
Georgia Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions that   
interest on the Georgia Bonds is exempt from the Georgia income tax and, with   
respect to the Possession Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing authorities        
rendered opinions that the Possession Bonds and the interest thereon is exempt  
from all state and local income taxation. Neither the Sponsor, nor its counsel, 
nor Georgia counsel has made any review for the Trust of the proceedings        
relating to the issuance of the Bonds or of the bases for the opinions rendered 
in connection therewith.                                                        

Georgia Counsel rendered its opinion to the Trust at closing that under   
then-existing Georgia law:                                                      

     (1)For Georgia income tax purposes, the Trust is not an association
     taxable as a corporation, and the income of the Trust will be
         treated as the income of the Unitholders. Interest on the Georgia
      Bonds which is exempt from Georgia income tax when received by
       the Trust, and which would be exempt from Georgia income tax if
      received directly by a Unitholder, will retain its status as a
         tax-exempt interest when distributed by the Trust and received by
  the Unitholders. Interest on the Possession Bonds which is
        excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes and
       is exempt from state and local taxation pursuant to federal law
     when received by the Trust will be exempt from Georgia income
      taxation and therefore will not be includible in the income of
       the Unitholder for Georgia income tax purposes when distributed
by the Trust and received by the Unitholders.           

  (2)If the Trustee disposes of a Bond (whether by sale, exchange,
        payment on maturity, retirement or otherwise) or if a Unitholder
        redeems or sells his Unit, the Unitholder will recognize gain or
            loss for Georgia income tax purposes to the same extent that gain or
           loss would be recognized for federal income tax purposes (except in
           the case of Bonds issued before March 11, 1987 issued with original
        issue discount owned by the Trust in which case gain or loss for
         Georgia income tax purposes may differ from the amount recognized
          for federal income tax purposes because original issue discount on
    such Bonds may be determined by accruing said original issue
     discount on a ratable basis). Due to the amortization of bond
   premium and other basis adjustments required by the Code, a
           Unitholder, under some circumstances, may realize taxable gain when
        his or her Units are sold or redeemed for an amount less than or
equal to their original cost.                           

     (3)Amounts paid under an insurance policy or policies issued to the
   Trust, if any, with respect to the Bonds in the Trust which
        represent maturing interest on defaulted obligations held by the
          Trustee will be exempt from State income taxes if, and to the same
         extent as, such interest would have been so exempt if paid by the
           issuer of the defaulted obligations provided that, at the time such
      policies are purchased, the amounts paid for such policies are
            reasonable, customary and consistent with the reasonable expectation
         that the issuer of the obligations, rather than the insurer, will
pay debt service on the obligations.                    

        (4)Neither the Bonds nor the Units will be subject to Georgia sales or
use tax.                                                

  Georgia Counsel did not examine any of the Bonds to be deposited and held in
the Trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of bond   
counsel with respect thereto, and Georgia Counsel expressed no opinion with     
respect to taxation under any other provisions of Georgia law.                  

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other Georgia tax          
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

Kansas Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Kansas is    
affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and   
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the Bonds, are    
affected by numerous factors. The Kansas economy is composed of manufacturing,  
trade, services and agriculture. Severe weather conditions could have a         
significant impact on the Kansas economy.                                       

The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final   
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

Further information concerning Kansas risk factors may be obtained upon   
request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".                

Kansas Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to qualify as "grantor trusts" under
the federal tax laws. For a discussion of the federal tax treatment of income   
earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see "Federal Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts" above.                                                  

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--Kansas Tax Status" are defined solely for purposes of   
this subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other sections of this  
prospectus.                                                                     

 This section summarizes some of the Kansas tax consequences to residents of
the State of Kansas of owning Units of a Kansas Trust (the "Trust") treated as a
grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. Tax laws and interpretations     
change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of the tax           
consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on the advice of   
counsel to the Sponsor. The Kansas taxing authorities could disagree with any   
conclusions set forth in this section.                                          

  At the time of the closing, special Kansas tax counsel ("Kansas Counsel") to
the Trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form below addressing certain
Kansas tax consequences under then-existing Kansas income tax law to Unitholders
subject to Kansas income tax. The assets of the Trust will consist of bonds     
issued by the State of Kansas or a local government of Kansas (the "Bonds"). For
purposes of rendering its opinions at closing, Kansas Counsel assumed that each 
asset of the Trust will be debt, the interest on which is excluded from gross   
income for federal income tax purposes.                                         

Kansas Counsel rendered its opinion to the Trust at closing that, under   
then-existing Kansas law:                                                       

 (1)The Trust is not an association taxable as a corporation for
Kansas income tax purposes;                             

   (2)Each Unitholder of the Trust will be treated as the owner of a
       pro rata portion of the Trust, and the income and deductions of
         the Trust will therefore be treated as income (and deductions) of
the Unitholder under Kansas law;                        

     (3)Interest on Bonds issued after December 31, 1987 by the State of
       Kansas or any of its political subdivisions will be exempt from
            income taxation imposed on individuals, corporations and fiduciaries
(other than banks, trust companies or savings and loan  
            associations). However, interest on Bonds issued prior to January 1,
        1988 by the State of Kansas or any of its political subdivisions
       will not be exempt from income taxation imposed on individuals,
          corporations and fiduciaries (other than banks, trust companies or
      savings and loan associations) unless the laws of the State of
         Kansas authorizing the issuance of such Bonds specifically exempt
      the interest on the Bonds from income taxation by the State of
Kansas;                                                 

  (4)Interest on Bonds issued by the State of Kansas or any of its
           political subdivisions will be subject to the tax imposed on banks,
           trust companies and savings and loan associations under Article 11,
Chapter 79 of the Kansas statutes;                      

      (5)Interest on the Bonds which is exempt from Kansas income taxation
  when received by the Trust will continue to be exempt when
        distributed to a Unitholder (other than a bank, trust company or
savings and loan association);                          

        (6)Each Kansas Unitholder of the Trust will recognize gain or loss for
    Kansas income tax purposes if the Trustee disposes of a Bond
      (whether by sale, exchange, payment on maturity, retirement or
           otherwise) or if the Unitholder redeems or sells Units of the Trust
           to the extent that such transaction results in a recognized gain or
loss for federal income tax purposes;                   

(7)Interest received by the Trust on the Bonds is exempt from 
          intangibles taxation imposed by any counties, cities and townships
pursuant to Kansas law at the time of closing; and      

         (8)No opinion is expressed regarding whether the gross earnings derived
        from the Units is subject to intangibles taxation imposed by any
      counties, cities and townships pursuant to present Kansas law.

 Kansas Counsel did not examine any of the Bonds to be deposited and held in
the Trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of bond   
counsel with respect thereto, and Kansas Counsel expressed no opinion with      
respect to taxation under any other provisions of Kansas law.                   

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other Kansas tax           
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

Kentucky Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Kentucky is
affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and   
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the Bonds, are    
affected by numerous factors. Severe weather conditions, as well as natural     
disasters, may have a significant impact on the State's economy.                

The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final   
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.

request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".                

Kentucky Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to qualify as "grantor trusts" 
under the federal tax laws. For a discussion of the federal tax treatment of    
income earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see "Federal Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts" above.                                                  

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--Kentucky Tax Status" are defined solely for purposes of 
this subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other sections of this  
prospectus.                                                                     

   This section summarizes some of the Kentucky tax consequences to residents of
the Commonwealth of Kentucky of owning Units of a Kentucky Trust (the "Trust")  
treated as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. Tax laws and        
interpretations change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of   
the tax consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on the     
advice of counsel to the Sponsor. The Kentucky taxing authorities could disagree
with any conclusions set forth in this section.                                 

   At the time of the closing, special Kentucky tax counsel ("Kentucky Counsel")
to the Trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form below addressing     
certain Kentucky tax consequences under then-existing Kentucky income tax law to
Unitholders subject to Kentucky income tax.                                     

 The assets of the Trust will consist of interest-bearing obligations issued
by or on behalf of the Commonwealth of Kentucky or counties, municipalities,    
authorities or political subdivisions thereof (the "Kentucky Bonds") and by an  
authority of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (the "Possession Bonds", and       
together with the Kentucky Bonds, the "Bonds").                                 

 Although Kentucky Counsel expressed no opinion with respect to the issuance
of the Bonds, in rendering its opinion at closing it assumed that: (i) the Bonds
were validly issued, (ii) the interest thereon is excludable from gross income  
for federal income tax purposes, (iii) interest on the Bonds, if received       
directly by a Kentucky Unitholder, would be exempt from the income tax imposed  
by the Commonwealth of Kentucky that is applicable to individuals and           
corporations (the "Kentucky Income Tax"), and (iv) the Bonds are exempt from the
ad valorem tax imposed by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Neither the Sponsor, nor
its counsel, nor Kentucky Counsel made any review for the Trust of the          
proceedings relating to the issuance of the Bonds or of the basis for the       
opinions rendered in connection therewith.                                      

 Based upon the foregoing assumptions, Kentucky Counsel rendered its opinion
at closing that, under then-existing Kentucky law:                              

      (1)The Trust is not an association taxable as a corporation and each
      Kentucky Unitholder will be treated as the owner of a pro rata
         portion of the Trust, and the income of such portion of the Trust
          will therefore be treated as the income of the Kentucky Unitholder
for Kentucky Income Tax purposes;                       

     (2)For Kentucky Income Tax purposes, interest on the Bonds which is
          excludable from federal gross income and which is also exempt from
          taxation under the Kentucky Income Tax when received by the Trust,
        and which would be excludable from federal gross income and also
          exempt from Kentucky Income Tax if received directly by a Kentucky
      Unitholder, will retain its status as tax-exempt interest when
 received by the Trust and distributed to the Unitholders.

      (3)Each Kentucky Unitholder of the Trust will recognize gain or loss
          for Kentucky Income Tax purposes if the Trustee disposes of a Bond
     (whether by redemption, sale or otherwise) or if the Kentucky
         Unitholder redeems or sells Units of the Trust to the extent that
       such a transaction results in a recognized gain or loss to such
Unitholder for federal income tax purposes;             

        (4)Tax reduction requirements relating to amortization of bond premium
     may, under some circumstances, result in Kentucky Unitholders
          realizing taxable gain for Kentucky Income Tax purposes when their
            Units are sold or redeemed for an amount equal to or less than their
original cost;                                          

        (5)State law does not permit a deduction for interest paid or incurred
           on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry Units in
            the Trust, the interest on which is exempt from Kentucky Income Tax.

     (6)Units of the Trust, but only to the extent the same represent an
   ownership in obligations of the Commonwealth of Kentucky or
           governmental units of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the interest on
      which is excludable from gross income for federal and Kentucky
         Income Tax purposes will not be subject to ad valorem taxation by
          the Commonwealth of Kentucky or any political subdivision thereof;
and                                                     

        (7)Proceeds, if any, paid under individual insurance policies obtained
   by issuers of the Bonds that represent maturing interest on
        defaulted obligations held by the Trustee will not be subject to
        Kentucky Income Tax if, and to the same extent as, such interest
         would not have been subject to Kentucky Income Tax if paid in the
        normal course by the issuer of the defaulted obligation provided
           that, at the time such policies are purchased, the amounts paid for
        such policies were reasonable, customary and consistent with the
            reasonable expectation that the issuer of the Bonds, rather than the
insurer, will pay debt service on the Bonds.            

   Kentucky Counsel did not examine any of the Bonds to be deposited and held in
the Trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of bond   
counsel with respect thereto, and Kentucky Counsel expressed no opinion with    
respect to taxation under any other provisions of Kentucky law.                 

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other Kentucky tax         
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

  Louisiana Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Louisiana is
affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and   
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the Bonds, are    
affected by numerous factors. Severe weather conditions, as well as natural     
disasters, may have a significant impact on the State's economy.                

The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final   
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

Further information concerning Louisiana risk factors may be obtained upon
request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".                

Louisiana Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to qualify as "grantor trusts"
under the federal tax laws. For a discussion of the federal tax treatment of    
income earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see "Federal Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts" above.                                                  

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--Louisiana Tax Status" are defined solely for purposes of
this subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other sections of this  
prospectus.                                                                     

 This section summarizes some of the Louisiana tax consequences to residents
of the State of Louisiana of owning Units of a Louisiana Trust (the "Trust")    
treated as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. Tax laws and        
interpretations change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of   
the tax consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on the     
advice of counsel to the Sponsor. The Louisiana taxing authorities could        
disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section.                        

At the time of the closing, special Louisiana tax counsel ("Louisiana     
Counsel") to the Trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form below      
addressing certain Louisiana tax consequences under then-existing Louisiana     
income tax law to Unitholders subject to Louisiana income tax.                  

Louisiana Counsel rendered its opinion to the Trust at closing that, under
then-existing Louisiana law:                                                    

  (1)The Trust will be treated as a trust for Louisiana income tax
    purposes and not as an association taxable as a corporation.

         (2)The Louisiana income tax on resident individuals is imposed upon the
          "tax table income" of resident individuals. The calculation of the
       "tax table income" of a resident individual begins with federal
          adjusted gross income. Certain modifications are specified, but no
          such modification requires the addition of interest on obligations
        of the State of Louisiana and its political subdivisions, public
           corporations created by them and constitutional authorities thereof
     authorized to issue obligations on their behalf. Accordingly,
      amounts representing interest excludable from gross income for
         federal income tax purposes received by the Trust with respect to
      such obligations will not be taxed to the Trust, or, except as
            provided below, to the resident individual Unitholder, for Louisiana
          income tax purposes. In addition to the foregoing, interest on the
            respective Securities may also be exempt from Louisiana income taxes
pursuant to the statutes authorizing their issuance.    

         (3)To the extent that gain from the sale, exchange or other disposition
          of obligations held by the Trust (whether as a result of a sale or
          exchange of such obligations by the Trust or as a result of a sale
           or exchange of a Unit by a Unitholder) is includible in the federal
         adjusted gross income of a resident individual, such gain will be
         included in the calculation of the Unitholder's Louisiana taxable
income; and                                             

     (4)Gain or loss on the Unit or as to underlying bonds for Louisiana
          income tax purposes would be determined by taking into account the
           basis adjustments for federal income tax purposes described in this
Prospectus.                                             

As no opinion is expressed regarding the Louisiana tax consequences of    
Unitholders other than individuals who are Louisiana residents, tax counsel     
should be consulted by other prospective Unitholders. The Code contains         
provisions relating to investing in tax-exempt obligations (including, for      
example, corporate minimum tax provisions which treat certain tax-exempt        
interest and corporate book income which may include tax-exempt interest, as tax
preference items, provisions affecting the deductibility of interest expense by 
financial institutions) which could have a corresponding effect on the Louisiana
tax liability of the Unitholders.                                               

In rendering its opinions at closing as described above, Louisiana Cousel 
relied upon the opinion of federal income tax counsel to the Sponsor at such    
time that the Trust is not an association taxable as corporation for federal    
income tax purposes, that each Unitholder of the Trust will be treated as the   
owner of a pro rata portion of such Trust under the Code and that the income of 
the Trust will be treated as income of the Unitholders under the Code.          

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other Louisiana tax        
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

   Maine Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Maine is affected
by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and conditions.
Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on the State and 
its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and other matters may 
constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its local governments
and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to satisfy their        
obligations.                                                                    

The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the Bonds, are    
affected by numerous factors. Maine's economy consists of services, trade,      
government and manufacturing. Severe weather conditions, as well as natural     
disasters, may have a significant impact on the State's economy.                

The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final   
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

Further information concerning Maine risk factors may be obtained upon    
request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".                

Maine Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to qualify as "grantor trusts" under
the federal tax laws. For a discussion of the federal tax treatment of income   
earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see "Federal Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts" above.                                                  

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--Maine Tax Status" are defined solely for purposes of    
this subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other sections of this  
prospectus.                                                                     

This section summarizes some of the Maine tax consequences to residents of
the State of Maine of owning Units of a Maine Trust (the "Trust") treated as a  
grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. Tax laws and interpretations     
change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of the tax           
consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on the advice of   
counsel to the Sponsor. The Maine taxing authorities could disagree with any    
conclusions set forth in this section.                                          

At the time of the closing, special Maine tax counsel ("Maine Counsel") to
the Trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form below addressing certain
Maine tax consequences under then-existing Maine income tax law to Unitholders  
subject to Maine income tax.                                                    

 The assets of the Trust will consist of interest-bearing obligations issued
by or on behalf of the State of Maine or counties, municipalities, authorities  
or political subdivisions thereof (the "Maine Bonds") or by the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, Guam and the United States Virgin Islands (the "Possession Bonds", 
and together with the Maine Bonds, the "Bonds").                                

Neither the Sponsor, nor its counsel, nor Maine Counsel has independently 
examined the Bonds to be deposited in and held in the Maine Trust. However,     
although no opinion is expressed herein regarding such matters, it is assumed   
that: (i) the Bonds were validly issued, (ii) the interest thereon is excludable
from gross income for federal income tax purposes, (iii) interest on the Maine  
Bonds, if received directly by a Unitholder, would be exempt from the Maine     
income tax applicable to individuals, trusts and estates and corporations       
("Maine Income Tax"), and (iv) interest on the Bonds will not be taken into     
account by individuals and corporations in computing an additional tax ("Maine  
Minimum Tax") imposed under the Maine Income Tax. The opinion of Maine Counsel  
did not address the taxation of persons other than full time residents of Maine.

In the opinion of Maine Counsel rendered at closing to the Trust under    
then-existing Maine law, and based upon the assumptions set forth above:        

         (1)The Maine Trust is not an association taxable as a corporation, thus
       each Unitholder of the Trust will be essentially treated as the
        owner of a pro rata portion of the Maine Trust and the income of
            such portion of the Maine Trust will be treated as the income of the
Unitholder for Maine Income Tax purposes;               

         (2)Interest on the Bonds which is exempt from the Maine Income Tax when
       received by the Maine Trust, and which would be exempt from the
            Maine Income Tax and the Maine Minimum Tax if received directly by a
          Unitholder, will retain its status as exempt from the Maine Income
          Tax and the Maine Minimum Tax when received by the Maine Trust and
distributed to the Unitholder;                          

  (4)To the extent that interest derived from the Maine Trust by a
          Unitholder with respect to the Possession Bonds is excludable from
          gross income for federal income tax purposes pursuant to 48 U.S.C.
        Section 745, 48 U.S.C. Section 1423a and 48 U.S.C. Section 1403,
  such interest will not be subject to the Maine Income Tax;

       (5)Each Unitholder of the Maine Trust will recognize gain or loss for
            Maine Income Tax purposes if the Trustee disposes of a bond (whether
         by redemption, sale or otherwise) or if the Unitholder redeems or
            sells Units of the Maine Trust to the extent that such a transaction
           results in a recognized gain or loss to such Unitholder for federal
income tax purposes; and                                

         (6)The Maine Income Tax does not permit a deduction of interest paid or
           incurred on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry
          Units in the Maine Trust, the interest on which is exempt from the
Tax.                                                    

 Prospective purchasers subject to the Maine Franchise Tax should be advised
that for purposes of the Maine Franchise Tax, interest on the Bonds received by 
the Trust and distributed to a Unitholder subject to such tax will be added to  
the Unitholder's federal taxable income and therefore will be taxable.          

Maine Counsel did not examine any of the Bonds to be deposited and held in
the Trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of bond   
counsel with respect thereto, and Maine Counsel expressed no opinion with       
respect to taxation under any other provisions of Maine law.                    

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other Maine tax            
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

Maryland Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Maryland is
affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and   
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the Bonds, are    
affected by numerous factors. Severe weather conditions, as well as natural     
disasters, may have a significant impact on the State's economy.                

The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final   
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

Further information concerning Maryland risk factors may be obtained upon 
request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".                

Maryland Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to qualify as "grantor trusts" 
under the federal tax laws. For a discussion of the federal tax treatment of    
income earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see "Federal Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts" above.                                                  

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--Maryland Tax Status" are defined solely for purposes of 
this subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other sections of this  
prospectus.                                                                     

   This section summarizes some of the Maryland tax consequences to residents of
the State of Maryland of owning Units of the Maryland Quality Trust (the        
"Trust"), which is treated as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes.  
Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these summaries do not      
describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in 
part on the advice of counsel to the Sponsor. The Maryland taxing authorities   
could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section.                  

   At the time of the closing, special Maryland tax counsel ("Maryland Counsel")
to the Trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form below addressing     
certain Maryland tax consequences under then-existing Maryland law to           
Unitholders subject to Maryland income tax.                                     

Maryland Counsel rendered its opinion at closing that, under then-existing
Maryland law:                                                                   

         (1)For Maryland State and local income tax purposes, the Trust will not
            be recognized as an association taxable as a corporation, but rather
         as a fiduciary whose income will not be subject to Maryland state
and local income taxation.                              

    (2)To the extent that interest and accrued original issue discount
           derived from the Trust by a Unitholder with respect to the bonds in
        the Trust is excludable from federal gross income, such interest
    will not be subject to Maryland State or local income taxes.
         Interest paid to a "financial institution" will be subject to the
Maryland Franchise Tax.                                 

      (3)In the case of taxpayers who are individuals, Maryland imposes an
          income tax on items of tax preference with reference to such items
      as defined in the Code for purposes of calculating the federal
          alternative minimum tax. Interest paid on certain private activity
  bonds constitutes a tax preference item for the purpose of
            calculating the federal alternative minimum tax. Accordingly, if the
           Trust holds such bonds, 50% of the interest on such bonds in excess
of a threshold amount is taxable in Maryland.           

   (4)Capital gain, including gain realized by a Unitholder from the
            redemption, sale or other disposition of a Unit, will be included in
           the taxable base of Unitholders for Maryland state and local income
           taxation purposes. However, Maryland defines the taxable net income
    of individuals as federal adjusted gross income with certain
   modifications. Likewise, the Maryland taxable net income of
          corporations is federal taxable income with certain modifications.
            There is available to Maryland income taxpayers a modification which
         allows those taxpayers to subtract from the Maryland taxable base
     the gain included in federal adjusted gross income or federal
      taxable income, as the case may be, which is realized from the
         disposition of obligations issued by the State of Maryland or its
         political subdivisions by the Trust. Consequently, by making that
          modification, a Unitholder who is entitled to make the subtraction
          modification will not be subject to Maryland state or local income
 tax with respect to gain realized upon the disposition of
     obligations issued by the State of Maryland and its political
  subdivisions by the Trust. Profit realized by a "financial
          institution" from the sale or exchange of bonds will be subject to
the Maryland Franchise Tax.                             

The opinion of Maryland Counsel rendered at closing related only to the   
treatment of the Trust and the Units under the Maryland State and local income  
tax laws and Maryland franchise tax laws. For example, no opinion was expressed 
as to the treatment of the Units under the Maryland inheritance and estate tax  
laws.                                                                           

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other Maryland tax         
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

Massachusetts Risk Factors. The financial condition of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts is affected by various national, economic, social and             
environmental policies and conditions. Additionally, limitations imposed by     
statute and voter initiative upon the Commonwealth and its local governments    
concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and other matters may constrain the         
revenue-generating capacity of the Commonwealth and its local governments and,  
therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to satisfy their obligations.

The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the Bonds, are    
affected by numerous factors. Severe weather conditions, as well as natural     
disasters, may have a significant impact on the State's economy.                

The Commonwealth may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse  
final decision could materially affect the Commonwealth's governmental          
operations and consequently, its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.

Further information concerning Massachusetts risk factors may be obtained 
upon request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".           

Massachusetts Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to qualify as "grantor
trusts" under the federal tax laws. For a discussion of the federal tax         
treatment of income earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see     
"Federal Tax Status--Grantor Trusts" above.                                     

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--Massachusetts Tax Status" are defined solely for        
purposes of this subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other       
sections of this prospectus.                                                    

This section summarizes some of the Massachusetts tax consequences to     
residents of the State of Massachusetts of owning Units of a Massachusetts Trust
(the "Trust") treated as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. Tax   
laws and interpretations change frequently, and these summaries do not describe 
all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on  
the advice of counsel to the Sponsor. The Massachusetts taxing authorities could
disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section.                        

   At the time of the closing, special Massachusetts tax counsel ("Massachusetts
Counsel") to the Trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form below      
addressing certain Massachusetts tax consequences under then-existing           
Massachusetts income tax law to Unitholders subject to Massachusetts income tax.

Massachusetts Counsel rendered its opinion to the Trust at closing that,  
under then-existing Massachusetts law:                                          

     (1)For Massachusetts income tax purposes, the Trust will be treated
 as a corporate trust under Section 8 of Chapter 62 of the
   Massachusetts General Laws and not as a grantor trust under
      Section 10(e) of Chapter 62 of the Massachusetts General Laws.

(2)The Trust will not be held to be engaging in business in   
        Massachusetts within the meaning of said Section 8 and will not,
therefore, be subject to Massachusetts income tax.      

      (3)Massachusetts Unitholders who are subject to Massachusetts income
            taxation under Chapter 62 of the Massachusetts General Laws will not
            be required to include their respective shares of the earnings of or
           distributions from the Trust in their Massachusetts gross income to
           the extent that such earnings or distributions represent tax-exempt
         interest for federal income tax purposes received by the Trust on
          obligations issued by Massachusetts, its counties, municipalities,
      authorities, political subdivisions or instrumentalities or by
United States territories or possessions ("Bonds").     

      (4)Massachusetts Unitholders who are subject to Massachusetts income
            taxation under Chapter 62 of the Massachusetts General Laws will not
            be required to include their respective shares of the earnings of or
           distributions from the Trust in their Massachusetts gross income to
       the extent that such earnings or distributions are derived from
           proceeds of insurance obtained by the Trust or by the Sponsor or by
   the issuer or underwriter of an Bond held by the Trust that
         represent maturing interest on defaulted Bonds held by the Trust,
       if, and to the same extent that, such earnings or distributions
          would have been excludable from their gross income if derived from
interest paid by the issuer of the defaulted Bond.      

  (5)The Trust's capital gains and/or capital losses realized upon
            disposition of Bonds held by it will be included pro rata as capital
            gains and/or losses in the gross income of Massachusetts Unitholders
            who are subject to Massachusetts income taxation under Chapter 62 of
    the Massachusetts General Laws, except where capital gain is
         specifically exempted from income taxation under acts authorizing
issuance of said Bonds.                                 

 (6)Gains or losses realized on sales or redemptions of Units by
         Massachusetts Unitholders who are subject to Massachusetts income
           taxation under Chapter 62 of the Massachusetts General Laws will be
           includible in their Massachusetts gross income. In determining such
       gain or loss Massachusetts Unitholders will, to the same extent
        required for federal tax purposes, be required to adjust the tax
       basis for their Units for accrued interest received, if any, on
          Bonds delivered to the Trustee after the Massachusetts Unitholders
         pay for their Units, and for amortization of premiums, if any, on
the Bonds held by the Trust.                            

         (7)The Units of the Trust are not subject to any property tax levied by
      Massachusetts or any political subdivision thereof, nor to any
     income tax levied by any such political subdivision. They are
  includible in the gross estate of a deceased Massachusetts
         Unitholder who is a resident of Massachusetts for purposes of the
Massachusetts Estate Tax.                               

Massachusetts Counsel did not examine any of the Bonds to be deposited and
held in the Trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of
bond counsel with respect thereto, and Massachusetts Counsel expressed no       
opinion with respect to taxation under any other provisions of Massachusetts    
law.                                                                            

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other Massachusetts tax    
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

Michigan Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Michigan is
affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and   
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the Bonds, are    
affected by numerous factors. Severe weather conditions, as well as natural     
disasters, may have a significant impact on the State's economy.                

The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final   
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

Further information concerning Michigan risk factors may be obtained upon 
request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".                

Michigan Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to qualify as "grantor trusts" 
under the federal tax laws. For a discussion of the federal tax treatment of    
income earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see "Federal Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts" above.                                                  

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--Michigan Tax Status" are defined solely for purposes of 
this subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other sections of this  
prospectus.                                                                     

   This section summarizes some of the Michigan tax consequences to residents of
the State of Michigan of owning Units of the Michigan IM-IT Trust (the "Trust") 
treated as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. Tax laws and        
interpretations change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of   
the tax consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on the     
advice of counsel to the Sponsor. The Michigan taxing authorities could disagree
with any conclusions set forth in this section.                                 

   At the time of the closing, special Michigan tax counsel ("Michigan Counsel")
to the Trust rendered an opinion addressing certain Michigan tax consequences   
under then-existing Michigan income tax law to Unitholders subject to Michigan  
income tax. In such opinion of Michigan Counsel at closing, the Trust and the   
owners of Units will be treated for purposes of the Michigan income tax laws in 
substantially the same manner as they are for purposes of the federal income tax
laws.                                                                           

For federal income tax purposes and, thus, for purposes of the income tax 
laws of the State of Michigan, the Michigan IM-IT Trust is not an association   
taxable as a corporation; the income of the Michigan IM-IT Trust will be treated
as the income of the Unitholders and be deemed to have been received by them    
when received by the Michigan IM-IT Trust. Interest on the underlying bonds     
which is exempt from tax under these laws when received by Michigan IM-IT Trust 
will retain its status as tax exempt interest to the Unitholders.               

For purposes of the foregoing Michigan tax laws, each Unitholder will be  
considered to have received his pro rata share of bond interest when it is      
received by the Michigan IM-IT Trust, and each Unitholder will have a taxable   
event when the Michigan IM-IT Trust disposes of a bond (whether by sale,        
exchange, redemption or payment at maturity) or when the Unitholder redeems or  
sells his Certificate to the extent the transaction constitutes a taxable event 
for federal income tax purposes. The tax cost of each unit to a Unitholder will 
be established and allocated for purposes of these Michigan tax laws in the same
manner as such cost is established and allocated for federal income tax         
purposes.                                                                       

The Michigan Intangibles Tax was repealed effective January 1, 1998.      

 The Michigan Single Business Tax was repealed for tax years beginning after
December 31, 2007. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2007, the Michigan
Business Tax ("MBT") applies to all business activity of taxpayers subject to   
the MBT. The MBT is composed of two taxes: a business income tax on every       
taxpayer with business activity in Michigan and a modified gross receipts tax on
every taxpayer with nexus to Michigan. The MBT generally excludes exempt        
interest from obligations issued by Michigan and its political subdivisions.    
However, Unitholders subject to the MBT should consult their tax advisors to    
determine whether, based on such Unitholder's business activity in Michigan or  
other relevant factors under the MBT, such Unitholder would be subject to the   
MBT with respect to distributions from the Trust attributable to interest on the
obligations held by the Trust or to dispositions of Trust assets, or to the     
redemption or other disposition of Units in the Trust, as well as the           
applicability of other Michigan state or local tax laws.                        

   Michigan Counsel did not examine any of the Bonds to be deposited and held in
the Trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of bond   
counsel with respect thereto, and Michigan Counsel expressed no opinion with    
respect to taxation under any other provisions of Michigan law, including the   
MBT.                                                                            

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other Michigan tax         
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

  Minnesota Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Minnesota is
affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and   
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,

affected by numerous factors. Severe weather conditions, as well as natural     
disasters, may have a significant impact on the State's economy.                

The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final   
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.

Minnesota Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to qualify as "grantor trusts"
under the federal tax laws. For a discussion of the federal tax treatment of    
income earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see "Federal Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts" above.                                                  

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--Minnesota Tax Status" are defined solely for purposes of
this subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other sections of this  
prospectus.                                                                     

 This section summarizes some of the Minnesota tax consequences to residents
of the State of Minnesota of owning Units of a Minnesota Trust (the "Trust")    
treated as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. Tax laws and        
interpretations change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of   
the tax consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on the     
advice of counsel to the Sponsor. The Minnesota taxing authorities could        
disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section.                        

At the time of the closing, special Minnesota tax counsel ("Minnesota     
Counsel") to the Trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form below      
addressing certain Minnesota tax consequences under then-existing Minnesota     
income tax law to Unitholders subject to Minnesota income tax.                  

   The assets of the Trust will consist of (i) interest from bonds issued by the
State of Minnesota and its political and governmental subdivisions,             
municipalities and governmental agencies and instrumentalities (the "Minnesota  
Bonds") and bonds issued by possessions of the United States, including bonds   
issued by Puerto Rico authorities (the "Possession Bonds", and together with the
Minnesota Bonds, the "Bonds") which would be exempt from federal and Minnesota  
income taxation when paid directly to an individual, trust or estate, (ii) gain 
on the disposition of such Bonds, and (iii) proceeds paid under certain         
insurance policies issued to the Trustee or to the issuers of the Bonds which   
represent maturing interest or principal payments on defaulted Bonds held by the
Trustee.                                                                        

   Neither the Sponsor, nor its counsel, nor Minnesota Counsel has independently
examined the Bonds to be deposited in and held in the Trust. However, although  
no opinion is expressed herein regarding such matters, it is assumed that: (i)  
the Bonds were validly issued, (ii) the interest thereon is excludable from     
gross income for federal income tax purposes and (iii) the interest thereon is  
exempt from the income tax imposed by Minnesota that is applicable to           
individuals, trusts and estates (the "Minnesota Income Tax"). It should be noted
that interest on the Minnesota Bonds is subject to tax in the case of           
corporations subject to the Minnesota Corporate Franchise Tax or the Corporate  
Alternative Minimum Tax and is a factor in the computation of the Minimum Fee   
applicable to financial institutions. The opinion of Minnesota Counsel issued at
closing did not address the taxation of persons other than full time residents  
of Minnesota. For purposes of such opinion, Minnesota Counsel assumed that at   
the respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions relating to the validity
thereof and to the exemption of interest thereon from federal income tax were   
rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities. In addition,    
Minnesota Counsel assumed that with respect to the Minnesota Bonds, bond counsel
to the issuing authorities rendered opinions that the interest on the Minnesota 
Bonds is exempt from the Minnesota Income Tax and, with respect to the          
Possession Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions that
the Possession Bonds and the interest thereon is exempt from all state and local
income taxation. Neither the Sponsor, nor its counsel nor Minnesota Counsel made
any review for the Trust of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the     
Bonds or of the basis for the opinions rendered in connection therewith.        

  Based upon the foregoing assumptions, Minnesota Counsel rendered its opinion
to the Trust at closing that, under then-existing Minnesota law:                

(1)The Trust is not an association taxable as a corporation;  

   (2)Income on the Bonds which is excludable from Minnesota taxable
            income for purposes of the Minnesota Income Tax when received by the
         Trust and which would be excludable from Minnesota taxable income
          for purposes of the Minnesota Income Tax if received directly by a
       Unitholder will be excludable from Minnesota taxable income for
           purposes of the Minnesota Income Tax when received by the Trust and
distributed to such Unitholder;                         

         (3)To the extent that interest on certain Bonds (except with respect to
          Possession Bonds, as to which no opinion is expressed), if any, is
     includible in the computation of "alternative minimum taxable
           income" for federal income tax purposes, such interest will also be
     includible in the computation of "alternative minimum taxable
     income" for purposes of the Minnesota Alternative Minimum Tax
imposed on individuals, estates and trusts;             

 (4)Each Unitholder of the Trust will recognize gain or loss for
       Minnesota Income Tax purposes if the Trustee disposes of a Bond
       (whether by redemption, sale or otherwise) or if the Unitholder
     redeems or sells Units of the Trust to the extent that such a
           transaction results in a recognized gain or loss to such Unitholder
for federal income tax purposes;                        

      (5)Tax basis reduction requirements relating to amortization of bond
    premium may, under some circumstances, result in Unitholders
           realizing taxable gain for Minnesota Income Tax purposes when their
            Units are sold or redeemed for an amount equal to or less than their
original cost;                                          

        (6)Proceeds, if any, paid under individual insurance policies obtained
            by issuers of Bonds or the Trustee which represent maturing interest
            on defaulted obligations held by the Trustee will be excludable from
         Minnesota net income if, and to the same extent as, such interest
          would have been so excludable from Minnesota net income if paid in
            the normal course by the issuer of the defaulted obligation provided
           that, at the time such policies are purchased, the amounts paid for
       such policies are reasonable, customary and consistent with the
            reasonable expectation that the issuer of the bonds, rather than the
insurer, will pay debt service on the bonds; and        

       (7)To the extent that interest derived from the Trust by a Unitholder
           with respect to any Possession Bonds would be excludable from gross
       income for federal income tax purposes and would be exempt from
          state and local taxation pursuant to federal law if the Unitholder
      directly owned the Possession Bonds, such interest will not be
         subject to the Minnesota Income Tax when distributed by the Trust
          and received by the Unitholders. As noted above, we have expressed
          no opinion as to the treatment of interest on the Possession Bonds
    for purposes of the Minnesota Corporate Franchise Tax or the
            Alternative Minimum Tax or whether it is a factor in the computation
           of the Minimum Fee applicable to financial institutions. Although a
   federal statute currently provides that bonds issued by the
           Government of Puerto Rico, or by its authority, are exempt from all
         state and local taxation, the Supreme Court of Minnesota has held
        that interest earned on bonds issued by the Government of Puerto
            Rico may be included in taxable net income for purposes of computing
         the Minnesota bank excise tax. The State of Minnesota could apply
            the same reasoning in determining whether interest on the Possession
         Bonds is subject to the taxes listed above on which we express no
opinion.                                                

 Minnesota Counsel did not examine any of the Bonds to be deposited and held
in the Trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of bond
counsel with respect thereto, and Minnesota Counsel expressed no opinion with   
respect to taxation under any other provisions of Minnesota law.                

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other Minnesota tax        
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

Missouri Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Missouri is
affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and   
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the state and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the Bonds, are    
affected by numerous factors. Severe weather conditions, as well as natural     
disasters, may have a significant impact on the State's economy.                

The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final   
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.

Missouri Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to qualify as "grantor trusts" 
under the federal tax laws. For a discussion of the federal tax treatment of    
income earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see "Federal Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts" above.                                                  

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--Missouri Tax Status" are defined solely for purposes of 
this subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other sections of this  
prospectus.                                                                     

   This section summarizes some of the Missouri tax consequences to residents of
the State of Missouri of owning Units of the Missouri IM-IT Trust (the "Trust") 
treated as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. Tax laws and        
interpretations change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of   
the tax consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on the     
advice of counsel to the Sponsor. The Missouri taxing authorities could disagree
with any conclusions set forth in this section.                                 

   At the time of the closing, special Missouri tax counsel ("Missouri Counsel")
to the Trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form below addressing     
certain Missouri tax consequences under then-existing Missouri income tax law to
Unitholders subject to Missouri income tax.                                     

The assets of the Trust will consist of debt obligations issued by or on  
behalf of the State of Missouri or counties, municipalities, authorities or     
political subdivisions thereof (the "Missouri Bonds") or by the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico or an authority thereof (the "Possession Bonds", and together with  
the Missouri Bonds, the "Bonds").                                               

  Neither the Sponsor, nor its counsel, nor Missouri Counsel has independently
examined the Bonds to be deposited in and held in the Trust. However, although  
no opinion is expressed herein regarding such matters, it is assumed that: (i)  
the Bonds were validly issued, (ii) the interest thereon is excludable from     
gross income for federal income tax purposes and (iii) interest on the Bonds, if
received directly by a Unitholder, would be exempt from the Missouri income tax 
applicable to individuals and corporations ("Missouri State Income Tax"). It is 
assumed that, at the respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions that   
the Bonds were validly issued and that interest on the Bonds is excluded from   
gross income for federal income tax purposes were rendered by bond counsel to   
the respective issuing authorities. In addition, with respect to the Missouri   
Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions that the       
interest on the Missouri Bonds is exempt from the Missouri State Income Tax and,
with respect to the Possession Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing authorities   
rendered opinions that the Possession Bonds and the interest thereon is exempt  
from all state and local income taxation. Neither the Sponsor, nor its counsel, 
nor Missouri Counsel made any review for the Trust of the proceedings relating  
to the issuance of the Bonds or of the basis for the opinions rendered in       
connection therewith. The opinion rendered by Missouri Counsel at closing did   
not address the taxation of persons other than full time residents of Missouri. 

Missouri Counsel rendered its opinion to the Trust at closing that, under 
then-existing Missouri law:                                                     

 (1)The Trust is not an association taxable as a corporation for
      Missouri income tax purposes, and each Unitholder of the Trust
       will be treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of the Trust
      and the income of such portion of the Trust will be treated as
  the income of the Unitholder for Missouri State Income Tax
purposes.                                               

    (2)Interest paid and original issue discount, if any, on the Bonds
            which would be exempt from the Missouri State Income Tax if received
       directly by a Unitholder will be exempt from the Missouri State
     Income Tax when received by the Trust and distributed to such
     Unitholder; however, no opinion is expressed herein regarding
         taxation of interest paid and original issue discount, if any, on
            the Bonds received by the Trust and distributed to Unitholders under
         any other tax imposed pursuant to Missouri law, including but not
      limited to the franchise tax imposed on financial institutions
pursuant to Chapter 148 of the Missouri Statutes.       

 (3)Each Unitholder of the Trust will recognize gain or loss for
            Missouri State Income Tax purposes if the Trustee disposes of a Bond
          (whether by redemption, sale, payment at maturity or otherwise) or
           if the Unitholder redeems or sells Units of the Trust to the extent
            that such a transaction results in a recognized gain or loss to such
           Unitholder for federal income tax purposes. Due to the amortization
           of bond premium and other basis adjustments required by the Code, a
          Unitholder under some circumstances, may realize taxable gain when
        his or her Units are sold or redeemed for an amount less than or
equal to their original cost.                           

        (4)Any insurance proceeds paid under policies which represent maturing
         interest on defaulted obligations which are excludable from gross
          income for federal income tax purposes will be excludable from the
           Missouri State Income Tax to the same extent as such interest would
           have been so excludable if paid by the issuer of such Bonds held by
    the Trust; however, no opinion is expressed herein regarding
         taxation of interest paid and original issue discount, if any, on
            the Bonds received by the Trust and distributed to Unitholders under
         any other tax imposed pursuant to Missouri law, including but not
      limited to the franchise tax imposed on financial institutions
pursuant to Chapter 148 of the Missouri Statutes.       

 (5)The Missouri State Income Tax does not permit a deduction of
          interest paid or incurred on indebtedness incurred or continued to
      purchase or carry Units in the Trust, the interest on which is
exempt from such tax.                                   

        (6)The Trust will not be subject to the Kansas City, Missouri Earnings
          and Profits Tax and each Unitholder's share of income of the Bonds
           held by the Trust will not generally be subject to the Kansas City,
           Missouri Earnings and Profits Tax or the City of St. Louis Earnings
       Tax (except that no opinion is expressed in the case of certain
         Unitholders, including corporations, otherwise subject to the St.
Louis City Earnings Tax).                               

   Missouri Counsel did not examine any of the Bonds to be deposited and held in
the Trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of bond   
counsel with respect thereto, and Missouri Counsel expressed no opinion with    
respect to taxation under any other provisions of Missouri law.                 

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other Missouri tax         
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

Nebraska Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Nebraska is
affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and   
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.

income earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see "Federal Tax

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--Nebraska Tax Status" are defined solely for purposes of 
this subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other sections of this  
prospectus.                                                                     

   This section summarizes some of the Nebraska tax consequences to residents of
the State of Nebraska of owning Units of a Nebraska Trust (the "Trust") treated 
as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. Tax laws and interpretations
change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of the tax           
consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on the advice of   
counsel to the Sponsor. The Nebraska taxing authorities could disagree with any 
conclusions set forth in this section.                                          

   The assets of the Nebraska Trust will consist of interest-bearing obligations
issued by or on behalf of the State of Nebraska or counties, municipalities,    
authorities or political subdivisions thereof (the "Nebraska Bonds") or by the  
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam and the United States Virgin Islands (the     
"Possession Bonds", and together with the Nebraska Bonds, the "Bonds").         

   Neither the Sponsor, nor its counsel, nor Nebraska Counsel have independently
examined the Bonds to be deposited in and held in the Trust. With respect to    
certain Nebraska Bonds which may be held by the Trust, the opinions of bond     
counsel to the issuing authorities for such Bonds have indicated that the       
interest on such Bonds is included in computing the Nebraska Alternative Minimum
Tax imposed by Section 77-2715 (2) of the Revised Nebraska Statutes (the        
"Nebraska Minimum Taxes") (the "Nebraska AMT Bonds"). However, although Nebraska
Counsel expressed no opinion regarding such matters, it assumed for purposes of 
its opinion rendered at closing that: (i) the Bonds were validly issued, (ii)   
the interest thereon is excludable from gross income for federal income tax     
purposes, (iii) none of the Bonds (other than the Nebraska AMT Bonds, if any)   
are "specified private activity bonds" the interest on which is included as an  
item of tax preference in the computation of the Alternative Minimum Tax for    
federal income tax purposes, (iv) interest on the Nebraska Bonds (other than the
Nebraska AMT Bonds, if any), if received directly by a Unitholder, would be     
exempt from both the Nebraska income tax, imposed by Section 77-2714 et seq. of 
the Revised Nebraska Statutes (other than the Nebraska Minimum Tax) (the        
"Nebraska State Income Tax") and the Nebraska Minimum Tax imposed by Section    
77-2715 (2) of the Revised Nebraska Statutes (the "Nebraska Minimum Tax"), and  
(v) interest on the Nebraska AMT Bonds, if any, if received directly by a       
Unitholder, would be exempt from the Nebraska State Income Tax. The opinion of  
Nebraska Counsel rendered at closing did not address the taxation of persons    
other than full time residents of Nebraska.                                     

Nebraska Counsel rendered its opinion to the Trust at closing that, under 
then-existing Nebraska law:                                                     

   (1)The Trust is not an association taxable as a corporation, each
     Unitholder of the Trust will be treated as the owner of a pro
        rata portion of the Trust, and the income of such portion of the
       Trust will therefore be treated as the income of the Unitholder
   for both Nebraska State Income Tax and Nebraska Minimum Tax
purposes;                                               

       (2)Interest on the Bonds which is exempt from both the Nebraska State
           Income Tax and the Nebraska Minimum Tax when received by the Trust,
         and which would be exempt from both the Nebraska State Income Tax
          and the Nebraska Minimum Tax if received directly by a Unitholder,
         will retain its status as exempt from such taxes when received by
the Trust and distributed to a Unitholder;              

         (3)Interest on the Nebraska AMT Bonds, if any, which is exempt from the
           Nebraska State Income Tax but is included in the computation of the
           Nebraska Minimum Tax when received by the Trust, and which would be
          exempt from the Nebraska State Income Tax but would be included in
           the computation of the Nebraska Minimum Tax if received directly by
        a Unitholder, will retain its status as exempt from the Nebraska
        State Income Tax but included in the computation of the Nebraska
   Minimum Tax when received by the Trust and distributed to a
Unitholder;                                             

       (4)To the extent that interest derived from the Trust by a Unitholder
            with respect to the Possession Bonds is excludable from gross income
          for federal income tax purposes pursuant to 48 U.S.C. Section 745,
         48 U.S.C. Section 1423a and 48 U.S.C. Section 1403, such interest
          will not be subject to either the Nebraska State Income Tax or the
Nebraska Minimum Tax;                                   

      (5)Each Unitholder of the Trust will recognize gain or loss for both
          Nebraska State Income Tax and Nebraska Minimum Tax purposes if the
  Trustee disposes of a Bond (whether by redemption, sale or
           otherwise) or if the Unitholder redeems or sells Units of the Trust
          to the extent that such a transaction results in a recognized gain
   or loss to such Unitholder for federal income tax purposes;

  (6)The Nebraska State Income Tax does not permit a deduction for
          interest paid or incurred on indebtedness incurred or continued to
      purchase or carry Units in the Trust, the interest on which is
exempt from such tax; and                               

(7)In the case of a Unitholder subject to the State financial 
         institutions franchise tax, the income derived by such Unitholder
           from his pro rata portion of the Bonds held by the Trust may affect
     the determination of such Unitholder's maximum franchise tax.

   Nebraska Counsel did not examine any of the Bonds to be deposited and held in
the Trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of bond   
counsel with respect thereto, and Nebraska Counsel expressed no opinion with    
respect to taxation under any other provisions of Nebraska law, including as to 
the exemption from either the Nebraska State Income Tax or the Nebraska Minimum 
Tax of interest on the Nebraska Bonds if received directly by a Unitholder.     

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other Nebraska tax         
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

 New Jersey Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of New Jersey
is affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the Bonds, are    
affected by numerous factors. The State's economic base is diversified,         
consisting of manufacturing, construction and service industries, supplemented  
by rural areas with selective commercial agriculture. Severe weather conditions,
as well as natural disasters, may have a significant impact on the State's      
economy.                                                                        

The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final   
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.

under the federal tax laws. For a discussion of the federal tax treatment of    
income earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see "Federal Tax

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--New Jersey Tax Status" are defined solely for purposes  
of this subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other sections of    
this prospectus.                                                                

  This section summarizes some of the New Jersey tax consequences to residents
of the State of New Jersey of owning Units of the New Jersey IM-IT Trust (the   
"Trust") treated as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. Tax laws   
and interpretations change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all  
of the tax consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on the  
advice of counsel to the Sponsor. The New Jersey taxing authorities could       
disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section.                        

At the time of the closing, special New Jersey tax counsel ("New Jersey   
Counsel") to the Trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form below      
addressing certain New Jersey tax consequences under then-existing New Jersey   
income tax law to Unitholders subject to New Jersey income tax.                 

 New Jersey Counsel rendered its opinion to the Trust at closing that, under
then-existing New Jersey law:                                                   

   (1)The Trust will be recognized as a trust and not an association
      taxable as a corporation. The Trust will not be subject to the
         New Jersey Corporation Business Tax or the New Jersey Corporation
Income Tax.                                             

       (2)With respect to the non-corporate Unitholders who are residents of
           New Jersey, the income of the Trust which is allocable to each such
         Unitholder will be treated as the income of such Unitholder under
         the New Jersey Gross Income Tax. Interest on the underlying bonds
          which would be exempt from New Jersey Gross Income Tax if directly
        received by such Unitholder will retain its status as tax-exempt
   interest when received by the Trust and distributed to such
          Unitholder. Any proceeds paid under the insurance policy issued to
   the Trustee of the Trust with respect to the bonds or under
        individual policies obtained by issuers of bonds which represent
           maturing interest on defaulted obligations held by the Trustee will
      be exempt from New Jersey Gross Income Tax if, and to the same
         extent as, such interest would have been so exempt if paid by the
issuer of the defaulted obligations.                    

     (3)A non-corporate Unitholder will not be subject to the New Jersey
            Gross Income Tax on any gain realized either when the Trust disposes
       of a bond (whether by sale, exchange, redemption, or payment at
         maturity), when the Unitholder redeems or sells his Units or upon
        payment of any proceeds under the insurance policy issued to the
          Trustee of the Trust with respect to the bonds or under individual
      policies obtained by issuers of bonds which represent maturing
        principal on defaulted obligations held by the Trustee. Any loss
        realized on such disposition may not be utilized to offset gains
            realized by such Unitholder on the disposition of assets the gain on
which is subject to the New Jersey Gross Income Tax.    

         (4)Units of the Trust may be taxable on the death of a Unitholder under
            the New Jersey Transfer Inheritance Tax Law or the New Jersey Estate
Tax Law.                                                

(5)If a Unitholder is a corporation subject to the New Jersey 
      Corporation Business Tax or New Jersey Corporation Income Tax,
       interest from the bonds in the Trust which is allocable to such
            corporation will be includible in its entire net income for purposes
            of the New Jersey Corporation Business Tax or New Jersey Corporation
    Income Tax, less any interest expense incurred to carry such
            investment to the extent such interest expense has not been deducted
      in computing federal taxable income. Net gains derived by such
          corporation on the disposition of the bonds by the Trust or on the
          disposition of its Units will be included in its entire net income
      for purposes of the New Jersey Corporation Business Tax or New
            Jersey Corporation Income Tax. Any proceeds paid under the insurance
           policy issued to the Trustee of the Trust with respect to the bonds
       or under individual policies obtained by issuers of bonds which
      represent maturing interest or maturing principal on defaulted
          obligations held by the Trustee will be included in its entire net
         income for purposes of the New Jersey Corporation Business Tax or
        New Jersey Corporation Income Tax if, and to the same extent as,
            such interest or proceeds would have been so included if paid by the
issuer of the defaulted obligations.                    

  New Jersey Counsel did not examine any of the bonds to be deposited and held
in the Trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of bond
counsel with respect thereto, and New Jersey Counsel expressed no opinion with  
respect to taxation under any other provisions of New Jersey law.               

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other New Jersey tax       
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

 New Mexico Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of New Mexico
is affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the Bonds, are    
affected by numerous factors. The State's economy is composed of energy         
resources, services, construction and trade. These industries tend to be highly 
cyclical. Tourism is also one of the State's important industries. Because many 
international travelers visit New Mexico, an increase in the value of the U.S.  
dollar adversely affects this industry. Moreover, New Mexico could be impacted  
by problems in the agricultural sector, including crop failures, severe weather 
conditions or other agricultural-related problems.                              

The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final   
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

 Further information concerning New Mexico risk factors may be obtained upon
request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".                

New Mexico Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to qualify as "grantor trusts"
under the federal tax laws. For a discussion of the federal tax treatment of    
income earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see "Federal Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts" above.                                                  

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--New Mexico Tax Status" are defined solely for purposes  
of this subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other sections of    
this prospectus.                                                                

  This section summarizes some of the New Mexico tax consequences to residents
of the State of New Mexico of owning Units of a New Mexico Trust (the "Trust")  
treated as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. Tax laws and        
interpretations change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of   
the tax consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on the     
advice of counsel to the Sponsor. The New Mexico taxing authorities could       
disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section.                        

At the time of the closing, special New Mexico tax counsel ("New Mexico   
Counsel") to the Trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form below      
addressing certain New Mexico tax consequences under then-existing New Mexico   
income tax law to Unitholders subject to New Mexico income tax.                 

 The assets of the Trust will consist of interest-bearing obligations issued
by or on behalf of the State of New Mexico or counties, municipalities,         
authorities or political subdivisions thereof (the "New Mexico Bonds"), and by  
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, or the Virgin Islands (the "Possession   
Bonds", and together with the New Mexico Bonds, the "Bonds"), the interest on   
which is expected to qualify as exempt from New Mexico income taxes.            

Neither the Sponsor, nor its counsel, nor New Mexico Counsel have         
independently examined the Bonds to be deposited in and held in the New Mexico  
Trust. However, although New Mexico Counsel expressed no opinion with respect to
the issuance of the Bonds, in rendering its opinion it assumed that: (i) the    
Bonds were validly issued, (ii) the interest thereon is excludable from gross   
income for federal income tax purposes and (iii) interest on the Bonds, if      
received directly by a Unitholder, would be exempt from the New Mexico income   
taxes applicable to individuals and corporations (the "New Mexico State Income  
Tax"). At the respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions relating to   
the validity thereof and to the exemption of interest thereon from federal      
income tax were rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities. 
In addition, with respect to the New Mexico Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing  
authorities rendered opinions as to the exemption of interest from the New      
Mexico State Income Tax and, with respect to the Possession Bonds, bond counsel 
to the issuing authorities rendered opinions as to the exemption from all state 
and local income taxation. Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has made any     
review for the Trust of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the Bonds or
of the bases for the opinions rendered in connection therewith. The opinion set 
forth below does not address the taxation of persons other than full time       
residents of New Mexico.                                                        

 New Mexico Counsel rendered its opinion to the Trust at closing that, under
then-existing New Mexico law:                                                   

    (1)The Trust will not be subject to tax under the New Mexico State
Income Tax.                                             

    (2)Interest on the Bonds which is exempt from the New Mexico State
        Income Tax when received by the Trust, and which would be exempt
      from the New Mexico State Income Tax if received directly by a
       Unitholder, will retain its status as exempt from such tax when
         received by the Trust and distributed to such Unitholder provided
         that the Trust complies with the reporting requirements contained
in the New Mexico State Income Tax regulations.         

   (3)To the extent that interest income derived from the Trust by a
            Unitholder with respect to Possession Bonds is excludable from gross
            income for federal income tax purposes pursuant to 48 U.S.C. Section
    745, 48 U.S.C. Section 1423a or 48 U.S.C. Section 1403, such
           interest income will not be subject to New Mexico State Income Tax.

      (4)Each Unitholder will recognize gain or loss for New Mexico Income
  Tax purposes if the Trustee disposes of a bond (whether by
            redemption, sale or otherwise) or if the Unitholder redeems or sells
           Units of the Trust to the extent that such a transaction results in
           a recognized gain or loss to such Unitholder for federal income tax
purposes.                                               

   (5)The New Mexico State Income Tax does not permit a deduction of
    interest paid on indebtedness or other expenses incurred (or
          continued) in connection with the purchase or carrying of Units in
   the Trust to the extent that interest income related to the
          ownership of Units is exempt from the New Mexico State Income Tax.

  New Mexico Counsel did not examine any of the Bonds to be deposited and held
in the Trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of bond
counsel with respect thereto, and New Mexico Counsel expressed no opinion with  
respect to taxation under any other provisions of New Mexico law, including, but
not limited to, the inclusion of income attributable to ownership of the Units  
in "modified gross income" for purposes of determining eligibility for and the  
amount of the low income comprehensive tax rebate, the child day care credit,   
and the elderly taxpayers' property tax rebate, and the applicability of other  
New Mexico taxes, such as the New Mexico estate tax.                            

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other New Mexico tax       
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

New York Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of New York is
affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and   
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the Bonds, are    
affected by numerous factors. The economy of the State continues to be          
influenced by the financial health of the City of New York, which, due to the   
terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, has been     
weakened. The burden of State and local taxation, in combination with the many  
other causes of regional economic dislocation, may have contributed to the      
decisions of some businesses and individuals to relocate outside, or not locate 
within, the State. Severe weather conditions, as well as natural disasters, may 
have a significant impact on the State's economy.                               

The State may be party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final     
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

Further information concerning New York risk factors may be obtained upon 
request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".                

New York Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to qualify as "grantor trusts" 
under the federal tax laws. For a discussion of the federal tax treatment of    
income earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see "Federal Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts" above.                                                  

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--New York Tax Status" are defined solely for purposes of 
this subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other sections of this  
prospectus.                                                                     

   This section summarizes some of the New York tax consequences to residents of
the State of New York of owning Units of the New York IM-IT Trust (the "Trust") 
treated as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. Tax laws and        
interpretations change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of   
the tax consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on the     
advice of counsel to the Sponsor. The New York taxing authorities could disagree
with any conclusions set forth in this section.                                 

   At the time of the closing, special New York tax counsel ("New York Counsel")
to the Trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form below addressing     
certain New York tax consequences under then-existing New York income tax law to
Unitholders subject to New York income tax.                                     

New York Counsel examined the income tax laws of the State of New York and
the City of New York to determine their applicability to the Trust and to the   
holders of Units in the Trust who are full-time residents of New York ("New York
Unitholders"). For purposes of rendering its opinions at closing, New York      
Counsel assumed that each asset of the Trust will be debt, the interest on which
is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes.                  

  Neither the Sponsor, nor its counsel, nor New York Counsel has independently
examined the Bonds to be deposited in and held in the Trust. However, although  
New York Counsel expressed no opinion with respect to the issuance of the Bonds,
in rendering its opinion at closing it assumed that: (i) the Bonds were validly 
issued, (ii) the interest thereon is excludable from gross income for federal   
income tax purposes, and (iii) interest on the Bonds, if received directly by a 
New York Unitholder, would be exempt from the income tax imposed by the State of
New York and the City of New York that are applicable to individuals, trusts and
estates (the "New York Personal Income Tax"). The opinion of New York Counsel   
did not address the taxation of persons other than full time residents of New   
York. New York Counsel assumed that, at the respective times of issuance of the 
Bonds, opinions that the Bonds were validly issued and that interest on the     
Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes were        
rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities. In addition, New
York Counsel assumed that, with respect to the New York Bonds, bond counsel to  
the issuing authorities rendered opinions that the interest on the New York     
Bonds is exempt from the New York Personal Income Tax and, with respect to the  
Possession Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions that
the Possession Bonds and the interest thereon is exempt from all state and local
income taxation. Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel nor New York Counsel made  
any review for the Trust of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the     
Bonds or of the basis for the opinions rendered in connection therewith.        

   Based upon the foregoing, and upon an investigation of such matters of law as
New York Counsel considered to be applicable, New York Counsel rendered its     
opinion to the Trust at closing that, under then-existing New York law:         

         (1)Under existing New York law, the Trust is not an association taxable
           as a corporation and the income of the Trust will be treated as the
            income of the Unitholders under the income tax laws of the State and
City of New York.                                       

         (2)Individuals who reside in New York State or City will not be subject
     to State and City tax on interest income which is exempt from
         federal income tax under Section 103 of the Code and derived from
           obligations of New York State or a political subdivision thereof or
           of the Government of Puerto Rico or a political subdivision thereof
           or of the Government of Guam or its authorities, although they will
           be subject to New York State and City tax with respect to any gains
    realized when such obligations are sold, redeemed or paid at
maturity or when any such Units are sold or redeemed.   

   New York Counsel did not examine any of the Bonds to be deposited and held in
the Trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of bond   
counsel with respect thereto, and New York Counsel expressed no opinion with    
respect to taxation under any other provisions of New York law.                 

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other New York tax         
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

North Carolina Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of North
Carolina is affected by various national, economic, social and environmental    
policies and conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations 
imposed on the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond           
indebtedness and other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of 
the State and its local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers  
of the Bonds to satisfy their obligations.                                      

The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the Bonds, are    
affected by numerous factors. The State's economic base is diversified,         
consisting of manufacturing, construction and service industries, supplemented  
by rural areas with selective commercial agriculture. The State has a relatively
high wage labor market which has resulted in the State's business sector        
becoming more vulnerable to competitive pressures. Severe weather conditions, as
well as natural disasters, may have a significant impact on the State's economy.

The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final   
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

Further information concerning North Carolina risk factors may be obtained
upon request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".           

North Carolina Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to qualify as "grantor
trusts" under the federal tax laws. For a discussion of the federal tax         
treatment of income earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see     
"Federal Tax Status--Grantor Trusts" above.                                     

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--North Carolina Tax Status" are defined solely for       
purposes of this subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other       
sections of this prospectus.                                                    

This section summarizes some of the North Carolina tax consequences to    
residents of the State of North Carolina of owning Units of the North Carolina  
Quality Trust (the "Trust") treated as a grantor trust for federal income tax   
purposes. Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these summaries do
not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based
in part on the advice of counsel to the Sponsor. The North Carolina taxing      
authorities could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section.      

At the time of the closing, special North Carolina tax counsel ("North    
Carolina Counsel") to the Trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form   
below addressing certain North Carolina tax consequences under then-existing    
North Carolina income tax law to Unitholders subject to North Carolina income   
tax.                                                                            

   The portfolio of the North Carolina Quality Trust consists of bonds issued by
the State of North Carolina or municipalities, authorities or political         
subdivisions thereof (the "North Carolina Bonds") or by territories or          
possessions of the United States (the "Possession Bonds", and together with the 
North Carolina Bonds, the "Bonds").                                             

   Based upon the foregoing, and upon an investigation of such matters of law as
North Carolina Counsel considered to be applicable, and relying on the federal  
income tax counsel to the Trust at closing with respect to certain federal      
income tax matters, North Carolina Counsel rendered its opinion to the Trust at 
closing that, under then-existing North Carolina law:                           

     (1)The Trust is not an "association" taxable as a corporation under
           North Carolina law with the result that income of the Trust will be
deemed to be income of the Unitholders.                 

        (2)Interest on the Bonds that is exempt from North Carolina income tax
         when received by the Trust will retain its tax-exempt status when
received by the Unitholders.                            

        (3)Unitholders will realize a taxable event when the Trust disposes of
   a Bond (whether by sale, exchange, redemption or payment at
            maturity) or when a Unitholder redeems or sells his Units (or any of
           them), and taxable gains for federal income tax purposes may result
        in gain taxable as ordinary income for North Carolina income tax
          purposes. However, when a Bond has been issued under an act of the
          North Carolina General Assembly that provides that all income from
            such Bond, including any profit made from the sale thereof, shall be
       free from all taxation by the State of North Carolina, any such
         profit received by the Trust will retain its tax-exempt status in
the hands of the Unitholders.                           

        (4)Unitholders must amortize their proportionate shares of any premium
        on a Bond. Amortization for each taxable year is accomplished by
          lowering the Unitholder's basis (as adjusted) in his Units with no
deduction against gross income for the year.            

 North Carolina Counsel did not examine any of the Bonds to be deposited and
held in the Trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of
bond counsel with respect thereto, and North Carolina Counsel expressed no      
opinion with respect to taxation under any other provisions of North Carolina   
law.                                                                            

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other North Carolina tax   
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

 Ohio Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Ohio is affected
by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and conditions.
Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on the State and 
its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and other matters may 
constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its local governments
and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to satisfy their        
obligations. The State operates on the basis of a fiscal biennium for its       
appropriations and expenditures, and is precluded by law from ending its fiscal 
year or fiscal biennium in a deficit position.                                  

The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the Bonds, are    
affected by numerous factors. The Ohio economy continues to rely in part on     
durable goods manufacturing, largely concentrated in motor vehicles and         
equipment, steel, rubber products and household appliances. Yet, the Ohio       
economy has become more diversified with expansion into the service and other   
non-manufacturing sectors. Severe weather conditions, as well as natural        
disasters, may have a significant impact on the State's economy.                

The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final   
decision could materially affect the State governmental operations and          
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

   Further information concerning Ohio risk factors may be obtained upon request
to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".                        

Ohio Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to qualify as "grantor trusts" under
the federal tax laws. For a discussion of the federal tax treatment of income   
earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see "Federal Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts" above.                                                  

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--Ohio Tax Status" are defined solely for purposes of this
subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other sections of this       
prospectus.                                                                     

The following discussion of Ohio tax consequences assumes that each Ohio  
IM-IT ("Ohio Trust") organized as a grantor trust continues to qualify as a     
grantor trust under Section 676(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as     
amended (the "Code"), that each Ohio Trust organized as a regulated investment  
company continues to qualify as a regulated investment company under Section 851
of the Code, and that at all times at least fifty percent (50%) of the total    
assets of each Ohio Trust will consist of interest-bearing obligations of the   
State of Ohio or its political subdivisions or similar obligations of other     
states or their political subdivisions.                                         

    (1)The Ohio Trust is not taxable as a corporation or otherwise for
           purposes of the Ohio personal income tax, municipal, joint economic
         development district or school district income taxes in Ohio, the
          Ohio corporation franchise tax, or the Ohio dealers in intangibles
tax.                                                    

(2)Distributions with respect to Units of the Ohio Trust      
          ("Distributions") will be treated as the income of the Unitholders
      for purposes of the Ohio personal income tax, municipal, joint
         economic development district and school district income taxes in
         Ohio, and the Ohio corporation franchise tax in proportion to the
respective interest therein of each Unitholder.         

   (3)Distributions properly attributable to interest on obligations
           issued by or on behalf of the State of Ohio, political subdivisions
thereof, or agencies or instrumentalities thereof ("Ohio
     Obligations") held by the Ohio Trust are exempt from the Ohio
      personal income tax, and municipal, joint economic development
           district and school district income taxes in Ohio, and are excluded
           from the net income base of the Ohio corporation franchise tax when
distributed or deemed distributed to Unitholders.       

   (4)Distributions properly attributable to interest on Territorial
           Obligations held by the Ohio Trust (the interest on which is exempt
        from state income taxes under the laws of the United States) are
      exempt from the Ohio personal income tax, and municipal, joint
         economic development district and school district income taxes in
          Ohio, and provided such interest is excluded from gross income for
         federal income tax purposes, such Distributions are excluded from
      the net income base of the Ohio corporation franchise tax when
distributed or deemed distributed to Unitholders.       

         (5)Distributions properly attributable to proceeds of insurance paid to
   the Ohio Trust representing maturing or matured interest on
            defaulted obligations held by the Trust that are excluded from gross
       income for federal income tax purposes will be exempt from Ohio
      personal income tax, and municipal, joint economic development
      district and school district income taxes in Ohio, and will be
           excluded from the net income base of the Ohio corporation franchise
tax.                                                    

(6)Distributions of profit made on the sale, exchange or other
  disposition by the Ohio Trust of Ohio Obligations properly
       attributable to the sale, exchange or other disposition of Ohio
           Obligations are exempt from Ohio personal income tax and municipal,
            joint economic development district and school district income taxes
      in Ohio, and are excluded from the net income base of the Ohio
corporation franchise tax.                              

(7)Receipts by the Ohio Trust of interest, proceeds paid under
         insurance policies that represent maturing or matured interest on
         defaulted obligations held by the Ohio Trust, and any amount from
         the sale, exchange or other disposition of capital assets held by
           the Ohio Trust are not subject to the Ohio commercial activity tax.
            Distributions from the Ohio Trust to the Unitholders are not subject
to the Ohio commercial activity tax.                    

   Ohio Counsel did not examine any of the bonds to be deposited and held in the
Trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of bond       
counsel with respect thereto, and Ohio Counsel expressed no opinion with respect
to taxation under any other provisions of Ohio law.                             

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other Ohio tax consequences
to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult their tax        
advisors.                                                                       

Oklahoma Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Oklahoma is
affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and   
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the Bonds, are    
affected by numerous factors. Oklahoma has broadened its economic base to rely  
less on petroleum and agriculture and has expanded in manufacturing. These      
industries tend to be highly cyclical. Severe weather conditions, as well as    
natural disasters, may have a significant impact on the State's economy.        

The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final   
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

Further information concerning Oklahoma risk factors may be obtained upon 
request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".                

Oklahoma Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to qualify as "grantor trusts" 
under the federal tax laws. For a discussion of the federal tax treatment of    
income earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see "Federal Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts" above.                                                  

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--Oklahoma Tax Status" are defined solely for purposes of 
this subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other sections of this  
prospectus.                                                                     

   This section summarizes some of the Oklahoma tax consequences to residents of
the State of Oklahoma of owning Units of a Oklahoma Trust (the "Trust") treated 
as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. Tax laws and interpretations
change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of the tax           
consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on the advice of   
counsel to the Sponsor. The Oklahoma taxing authorities could disagree with any 
conclusions set forth in this section.                                          

   At the time of the closing, special Oklahoma tax counsel ("Oklahoma Counsel")
to the Trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form below addressing     
certain Oklahoma tax consequences under then-existing Oklahoma income tax law to
Unitholders subject to Oklahoma income tax.                                     

   The assets of the Oklahoma Trust will consist of interest-bearing obligations
issued by or on behalf of the State of Oklahoma or counties, municipalities,    
authorities or political subdivisions thereof (the "Oklahoma Bonds") or by the  
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam and the United States Virgin Islands (the     
"Possession Bonds", and together with the Oklahoma Bonds, the "Bonds"). At the  
respective times of issuance of the Oklahoma Bonds, certain, but not necessarily
all, of the issues of the Oklahoma Bonds may have been accompanied by an opinion
of bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities that interest on such     
Oklahoma Bonds (the "Oklahoma Tax-Exempt Bonds") are exempt from the income tax 
imposed by the State of Oklahoma that is applicable to individuals and          
corporations (the "Oklahoma State Income Tax"). The Trust may include Oklahoma  
Bonds the interest on which is subject to the Oklahoma State Income Tax (the    
"Oklahoma Taxable Bonds"). See "Portfolio" which indicates by footnote which    
Oklahoma Bonds are Oklahoma Tax-Exempt Bonds (all other Oklahoma Bonds included 
in the portfolio are Oklahoma Taxable Bonds).                                   

  Neither the Sponsor, nor its counsel, nor Oklahoma Counsel has independently
examined the Bonds to be deposited in and held in the Oklahoma Trust. However,  
although no opinion is expressed herein regarding such matters, it is assumed   
that: (i) the Bonds were validly issued, (ii) the interest thereon is excludable
from gross income for federal income tax purposes and (iii) interest on the     
Oklahoma Tax-Exempt Bonds and the Possession Bonds, if received directly by a   
Unitholder, would be exempt from the Oklahoma State Income Tax. At the          
respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions relating to the validity    
thereof and to the exemption of interest thereon from federal income tax were   
rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities. In addition,    
with respect to the Oklahoma Tax-Exempt Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing      
authorities rendered opinions as to the exemption of interest from the Oklahoma 
State Income Tax and, with respect to the Possession Bonds, bond counsel to the 
issuing authorities rendered opinions as to the exemption from all state and    
local income taxation. Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has made any review  
for the Trust of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the Bonds or of the
bases for the opinions rendered in connection therewith. The opinion of Oklahoma
Counsel rendered at closing did not address the taxation of persons other than  
full time residents of Oklahoma.                                                

Oklahoma Counsel rendered its opinion to the Trust at closing that, under 
then-existing Oklahoma law:                                                     

(1)For Oklahoma State Income Tax purposes, the Trust is not an
    association taxable as a corporation, each Unitholder of the
       Trust will be treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of the
         Trust and the income of such portion of the Trust will be treated
as the income of the Unitholder.                        

    (2)Interest paid and original issue discount, if any, on the Bonds
            which would be exempt from the Oklahoma State Income Tax if received
       directly by a Unitholder will be exempt from the Oklahoma State
     Income Tax when received by the Trust and distributed to such
            Unitholder. A Unitholder's pro rata portion of any interest paid and
            original issue discount, if any, on the Bonds which would be subject
  to the Oklahoma State Income Tax if received directly by a
           Unitholder, including, for example interest paid and original issue
           discount, if any, on the Oklahoma Taxable Bonds, will be taxable to
            such Unitholder for Oklahoma State Income Tax purposes when received
by the Trust.                                           

     (3)To the extent that interest paid and original issue discount, if
   any, derived from the Trust by a Unitholder with respect to
           Possession Bonds is excludable from gross income for federal income
         tax purposes pursuant to 48 U.S.C. Section 745, 48 U.S.C. Section
          1423a, and 48 U.S.C. Section 1403, such interest paid and original
         issue discount, if any, will not be subject to the Oklahoma State
Income Tax.                                             

 (4)Each Unitholder of the Trust will recognize gain or loss for
            Oklahoma State Income Tax purposes if the Trustee disposes of a Bond
          (whether by redemption, sale, payment at maturity or otherwise) or
           if the Unitholder redeems or sells Units of the Trust to the extent
            that such a transaction results in a recognized gain or loss to such
           Unitholder for federal income tax purposes. Due to the amortization
           of bond premium and other basis adjustments required by the Code, a
           Unitholder, under some circumstances, may realize taxable gain when
          his or her Units are sold or redeemed for an amount equal to their
original cost.                                          

     (5)Although no opinion is expressed herein, we have been informally
          advised by the Oklahoma Tax Commission that any insurance proceeds
          paid under policies which represent maturing interest on defaulted
      obligations which are excludable from gross income for federal
        income tax purposes should be excludable from the Oklahoma State
         Income Tax to the same extent as such interest would have been if
            paid by the issuer of such Bonds held by the Trust provided that, at
       the time such policies are purchased, the amounts paid for such
  policies are reasonable, customary and consistent with the
         reasonable expectation that the issuer of the obligations, rather
   than the insurer, will pay debt service on the obligations.

 (6)The Oklahoma State Income Tax does not permit a deduction of
          interest paid or incurred on indebtedness incurred or continued to
      purchase or carry Units in the Trust, the interest on which is
           exempt from such tax if such interest is not deductible for federal
       income tax purposes. Special rules apply in the case of certain
banks and financial institutions.                       

  Title 68 Section 1201 of the Oklahoma Statutes Annotated imposes a franchise
tax on "corporations" and certain other organizations organized under the laws  
of or qualified to do or doing business in, the State of Oklahoma. Recent       
Oklahoma administrative guidance has indicated that a federal grantor trust (a  
fixed investment trust) is characterized as a business trust and thus a         
corporation for estate tax purposes. Accordingly, the Oklahoma Tax Commission   
may hold that all fixed unit investment trusts are corporations subject to the  
Oklahoma franchise tax. Oklahoma Counsel expressed no opinion with respect to   
taxation of the Trust for Oklahoma franchise tax purposes.                      

  Under Oklahoma law, a pass-through entity must withhold income tax at a rate
of five percent of the Oklahoma share of income of the entity distributed to    
each nonresident member. A "pass-through entity" is defined to include a trust  
that is not taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes and a        
"member" is defined to include a beneficiary of a trust. Oklahoma Counsel has   
expressed no opinion as to the applicability of this provision to amounts       
distributed by the Trust.                                                       

   Oklahoma Counsel did not examine any of the Bonds to be deposited and held in
the Trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of bond   
counsel with respect thereto, and Oklahoma Counsel expressed no opinion with    
respect to taxation under any other provisions of Oklahoma law.                 

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other Oklahoma tax         
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

Oregon Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Oregon is    
affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and   
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the Bonds, are    
affected by numerous factors. Severe weather conditions, as well as natural     
disasters, may have a significant impact on the State's economy.                

The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final   
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

Further information concerning Oregon risk factors may be obtained upon   
request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".                

Oregon Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to qualify as "grantor trusts" under
the federal tax laws. For a discussion of the federal tax treatment of income   
earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see "Federal Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts" above.                                                  

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--Oregon Tax Status" are defined solely for purposes of   
this subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other sections of this  
prospectus.                                                                     

 This section summarizes some of the Oregon tax consequences to residents of
the State of Oregon of owning Units of a Oregon Trust (the "Trust") treated as a
grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. Tax laws and interpretations     
change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of the tax           
consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on the advice of   
counsel to the Sponsor. The Oregon taxing authorities could disagree with any   
conclusions set forth in this section.                                          

  At the time of the closing, special Oregon tax counsel ("Oregon Counsel") to
the Trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form below addressing certain
Oregon tax consequences under then-existing Oregon income tax law to Unitholders
subject to Oregon income tax.                                                   

Oregon Counsel examined the income tax laws of the State of Oregon to     
determine their applicability to the Trust and to the holders of Units in the   
Trust who are full-time residents of the State of Oregon ("Oregon Unitholders").
The assets of the Trust will consist of bonds issued by the State of Oregon or a
local government of Oregon (the "Oregon Bonds") or by the Commonwealth of Puerto
Rico or its authority (the "Possession Bonds", and together with the Oregon     
Bonds, the "Bonds"). Neither the Sponsor, nor its counsel, nor Oregon Counsel   
have independently examined the Bonds to be deposited in and held in the Oregon 
Trust. Although no opinion is expressed herein regarding such matters, it is    
assumed that: (i) the Bonds were validly issued; (ii) the interest thereon is   
excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes; and (iii) interest
on the Bonds, if received directly by an Oregon Unitholder, would be exempt from
the Oregon income tax applicable to individuals (the "Oregon Personal Income    
Tax").                                                                          

OregonCounsel rendered its opinion to the Trust at closing that, under    
then-existing Oregon law:                                                       

 (1)The Trust is not an association taxable as a corporation and
        based upon an administrative rule of the Oregon State Department
of Revenue, each Oregon Unitholder of the Trust will be 
     essentially treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of the
         Trust and the income of such portion of the Trust will be treated
         as the income of the Oregon Unitholder for Oregon Personal Income
Tax purposes;                                           

   (2)Interest on the Bonds which is exempt from the Oregon Personal
        Income Tax when received by the Trust, and which would be exempt
      from the Oregon Personal Income Tax if received directly by an
         Oregon Unitholder, will retain its status as exempt from such tax
           when received by the Trust and distributed to an Oregon Unitholder;

    (3)To the extent that interest derived from the Trust by an Oregon
          Unitholder with respect to the Possession Bonds is excludable from
          gross income for federal income tax purposes pursuant to 48 U.S.C.
        Section 745, 48 U.S.C. Section 1423a and 48 U.S.C. Section 1403,
            such interest will not be subject to the Oregon Personal Income Tax;

        (4)Each Oregon Unitholder of the Trust will recognize gain or loss for
        Oregon Personal Income Tax purposes if the Trustee disposes of a
            bond (whether by redemption, sale, payment at maturity or otherwise)
          or if the Oregon Unitholder redeems or sells Units of the Trust to
          the extent that such a transaction results in a recognized gain or
           loss to such Oregon Unitholder for federal income tax purposes; and

  (5)The Oregon Personal Income Tax does not permit a deduction of
          interest paid or incurred on indebtedness incurred or continued to
      purchase or carry Units in the Trust, the interest on which is
exempt from such tax.                                   

 Oregon Counsel did not examine any of the Bonds to be deposited and held in
the Trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of bond   
counsel with respect thereto, and Oregon Counsel expressed no opinion with      
respect to taxation under any other provisions of Oregon law. In addition,      
prospective purchasers subject to the Oregon corporate income tax should be     
advised that for purposes of the Oregon Corporate Income (Excise) Tax, interest 
on the Bonds received by the Trust and distributed to an Oregon Unitholder      
subject to such tax will be added to the corporate Oregon Unitholder's federal  
taxable income and therefore will be taxable. Oregon Counsel expressed no       
opinion is expressed regarding the Oregon taxation of foreign or domestic       
insurance companies. Oregon Counsel assumed that at the respective times of     
issuance of the Bonds, opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the     
exemption of interest thereon from federal income tax were rendered by bond     
counsel to the respective issuing authorities. In addition, Oregon Counsel      
assumed that, with respect to the Oregon Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing     
authorities rendered opinions as to the exemption of interest from the Oregon   
Income Tax and, with respect to the Possession Bonds, bond counsel to the       
issuing authorities rendered opinions as to the exemption from all state and    
local income taxation of the Possession Bonds and the interest thereon.         

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other Oregon tax           
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

Pennsylvania Risk Factors. The financial condition of the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania is affected by various national, economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations 
imposed on the Commonwealth and its local governments concerning taxes, bond    
indebtedness and other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of 
the Commonwealth and its local governments and, therefore, the ability of the   
issuers of the Bonds to satisfy their obligations.                              

The economic vitality of the Commonwealth and its various regions and,    
therefore, the ability of the Commonwealth and its local governments to satisfy 
the Bonds, are affected by numerous factors. Historically, the economy of the   
Commonwealth has been dependent on heavy industry and manufacturing. Growth in  
the Commonwealth economy has more recently been in the service sector, including
trade, health services and educational institutions. Growth in these sectors may
be affected by federal funding and state legislation. Severe weather conditions,
as well as natural disasters, may have a significant impact on the              
Commonwealth's economy.                                                         

The Commonwealth may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse  
final decision could materially affect the Commonwealth's governmental          
operations and consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations. 

   Further information concerning Pennsylvania risk factors may be obtained upon
request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".                

Pennsylvania Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to qualify as "grantor trusts"
under the federal tax laws. For a discussion of the federal tax treatment of    
income earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see "Federal Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts" above.                                                  

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--Pennsylvania Tax Status" are defined solely for purposes
of this subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other sections of    
this prospectus.                                                                

This section summarizes some of the Pennsylvania tax consequences to      
residents of the State of Pennsylvania of owning Units of the Pennsylvania IM-IT
Trust (the "Trust") treated as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. 
Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these summaries do not      
describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in 
part on the advice of counsel to the Sponsor. The Pennsylvania taxing           
authorities could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section.      

 At the time of the closing, special Pennsylvania tax counsel ("Pennsylvania
Counsel") to the Trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form below      
addressing certain Pennsylvania tax consequences under then-existing            
Pennsylvania income tax law to Unitholders subject to Pennsylvania income tax.  

Pennsylvania Counsel examined the income tax laws of the State of         
Pennsylvania to determine their applicability to the Trust and to the holders of
Units in the Trust who are full-time residents of the State of Pennsylvania     
("Pennsylvania Unitholders"). The assets of the Trust will consist of bonds     
issued by the State of Pennsylvania or a local government of Pennsylvania (the  
"Pennsylvania Bonds") or by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or its authority    
(the "Possession Bonds", and together with the Pennsylvania Bonds, the "Bonds").
For purposes of rendering its opinions at closing, Pennsylvania Counsel assumed 
that each asset of the Trust will be debt, the interest on which is excluded    
from gross income for federal income tax purposes.                              

   Based upon the foregoing, and upon an investigation of such matters of law as
Pennsylvania Counsel considered to be applicable, Pennsylvania Counsel rendered 
its opinion to the Trust at closing that, under then-existing Pennsylvania law: 

      (1)The Trust will have no tax liability for purposes of the personal
        income tax (the "Personal Income Tax"), the corporate income tax
        (the "Corporate Income Tax") and the capital stock-franchise tax
 (the "Franchise Tax"), all of which are imposed under the
        Pennsylvania Tax Reform Code of 1971, or the Philadelphia School
          District Investment Net Income Tax (the "Philadelphia School Tax")
 imposed under Section 19-1804 of the Philadelphia Code of
Ordinances.                                             

       (2)Interest on the Bonds, net of Trust expenses, which is exempt from
          the Personal Income Tax and the Corporate Income Tax when received
            by the Pennsylvania Trust and which would be exempt from such tax if
           received directly by a Unitholder, will retain its status as exempt
          from such taxes when received by the Trust and distributed to such
           Unitholder. Interest on the Pennsylvania Bonds which is exempt from
        the Philadelphia School Tax when received by the Trust and which
           would be exempt from such tax if received directly by a Unitholder,
           will retain its status as exempt from such tax when received by the
            Trust and distributed to such Unitholder. We express no opinion with
respect to the treatment of distributions from the Trust
   attributable to interest on the Puerto Rico Bonds under the
  Philadelphia School Tax, which may be subject to such tax.

(3)Distributions from the Trust attributable to capital gains 
           recognized by the Trust upon its disposition of a Pennsylvania Bond
          issued on or after February 1, 1994 or a Puerto Rico Bond, will be
         taxable for purposes of the Personal Income Tax and the Corporate
           Income Tax. No opinion is expressed with respect to the taxation of
  distributions from the Trust attributable to capital gains
           recognized by the Trust upon its disposition of a Pennsylvania Bond
issued before February 1, 1994.                         

(4)Distributions from the Trust attributable to capital gains 
      recognized by the Trust upon its disposition of a Bond will be
           exempt from the Philadelphia School Tax if the Bond was held by the
          Trust for a period of more than six months and the Unitholder held
       his Unit for more than six months before the disposition of the
         Bond. If, however, the Bond was held by the Trust or the Unit was
         held by the Unitholder for a period of less than six months, then
  distributions from the Trust attributable to capital gains
           recognized by the Trust upon its disposition of a Pennsylvania Bond
          issued on or after February 1, 1994 or a Puerto Rico Bond, will be
          taxable for purposes of the Philadelphia School Tax; no opinion is
expressed with respect to the taxation of any such gains
          attributable to Pennsylvania Bonds issued before February 1, 1994.

    (5)Insurance proceeds paid under policies which represent maturing
           interest on defaulted obligations will be exempt from the Corporate
       Income Tax to the same extent as such amounts are excluded from
   gross income for federal income tax purposes. No opinion is
            expressed with respect to whether such insurance proceeds are exempt
    from the Personal Income Tax or the Philadelphia School Tax.

      (6)Each Unitholder will recognize gain for purposes of the Corporate
           Income Tax if the Unitholder redeems or sells Units of the Trust to
          the extent that such a transaction results in a recognized gain to
        such Unitholder for federal income tax purposes and such gain is
         attributable to Pennsylvania Bonds issued on or after February 1,
1994 or to Puerto Rico Bonds. No opinion is expressed with respect
        to the taxation of gains realized by a Unitholder on the sale or
       redemption of a Unit to the extent such gain is attributable to
Pennsylvania Bonds issued prior to February 1, 1994.    

    (7)A Unitholder's gain on the sale or redemption of a Unit will be
     subject to the Personal Income Tax, except that no opinion is
      expressed with respect to the taxation of any such gain to the
       extent it is attributable to Pennsylvania Bonds issued prior to
February 1, 1994.                                       

   (8)A Unitholder's gain upon a redemption or sale of Units will be
          exempt from the Philadelphia School Tax if the Unitholder held his
           Unit for more than six months and the gain is attributable to Bonds
            held by the Trust for a period of more than six months. If, however,
           the Unit was held by the Unitholder for less than six months or the
            gain is attributable to Bonds held by the Trust for a period of less
           than six months, then the gains will be subject to the Philadelphia
           School Tax; except that no opinion is expressed with respect to the
            taxation of any such gains attributable to Pennsylvania Bonds issued
before February 1, 1994.                                

Unitholders should be aware that, generally, interest on indebtedness     
incurred or continued to purchase or carry Units is not deductible for purposes 
of the Personal Income Tax, the Corporate Income Tax or the Philadelphia School 
Tax.                                                                            

Pennsylvania Counsel did not examine any of the Bonds to be deposited and 
held in the Trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of
bond counsel with respect thereto, and Pennsylvania Counsel expressed no opinion
with respect to taxation under any other provisions of Pennsylvania law.        

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other Pennsylvania tax     
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

South Carolina Risk Factors. The state of South Carolina is affected by   
various national, economic, social and environmental policies and conditions.   
Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on the State and 
its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and other matters may 
constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its local governments
and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to satisfy their        
obligations.                                                                    

The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the Bonds, are    
affected by numerous factors. The State's economic base is diversified,         
consisting primarily of manufacturing, but expanding into the trade and service 
industries, supplemented by rural areas with selective commercial agriculture.  
Severe weather conditions, as well as natural disasters, may have a significant 
impact on the State's economy.                                                  

The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final   
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

Further information concerning South Carolina risk factors may be obtained
upon request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".           

South Carolina Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to qualify as "grantor
trusts" under the federal tax laws. For a discussion of the federal tax         
treatment of income earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see     
"Federal Tax Status--Grantor Trusts" above.                                     

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--South Carolina Tax Status" are defined solely for       
purposes of this subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other       
sections of this prospectus.                                                    

This section summarizes some of the South Carolina tax consequences to    
residents of the State of South Carolina of owning Units of a South Carolina    
Trust (the "Trust") treated as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. 
Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these summaries do not      
describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in 
part on the advice of counsel to the Sponsor. The South Carolina taxing         
authorities could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section.      

At the time of the closing, special South Carolina tax counsel ("South    
Carolina Counsel") to the Trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form   
below addressing certain South Carolina tax consequences under then-existing    
South Carolina income tax law to Unitholders subject to South Carolina income   
tax.                                                                            

The assets of the Trust will consist of bonds issued by the State of South
Carolina or a local government of South Carolina (the "South Carolina Bonds") or
by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or its authority (the "Possession Bonds", and
together with the South Carolina Bonds, the "Bonds"). For purposes of rendering 
its opinions at closing, South Carolina Counsel assumed that each asset of the  
Trust will be debt, the interest on which is excluded from gross income for     
federal income tax purposes.                                                    

Neither the Sponsor, nor its counsel nor South Carolina Counsel made any  
review for the Trust of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the Bonds or
of the basis for the opinions rendered in connection therewith.                 

South Carolina Counsel rendered its opinion to the Trust at closing that, 
under then-existing South Carolina law:                                         

        (1)By the provision of paragraph (j) of Section 3 of Article 10 of the
      South Carolina Constitution (revised 1977) intangible personal
     property is specifically exempted from any and all ad valorem
taxation.                                               

      (2)Pursuant to the provisions of S.C. Code Ann. Section 12-7-430(b),
         recodified as S.C. Code Ann. Section 12 6 1120(1), as interpreted
by South Carolina Revenue Ruling #91 15, interest from  
       obligations issued by the State of South Carolina or any of its
      political subdivisions, as well as interest derived from bonds
      issued by the Governments of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin
        Islands which is exempt from federal income taxes is exempt from
     income taxes and that the exemption so granted extends to all
    recipients of interest paid thereon through the Trust. (This
opinion does not extend to so-called 63-20 obligations.)

(3)The income of the Trust would be treated as income to each 
          Unitholder of the Trust in the proportion that the number of Units
        of the Trust held by the Unitholder bears to the total number of
            Units of the Trust outstanding. For this reason, interest derived by
           the Trust that would not be includible in income for South Carolina
  income tax purposes when paid directly to a South Carolina
          Unitholder will be exempt from South Carolina income taxation when
   received by the Trust and attributed to such South Carolina
Unitholder.                                             

         (4)Each Unitholder will recognize gain or loss for South Carolina state
         income tax purposes if the Trustee disposes of a Bond (whether by
     sale, payment on maturity, retirement or otherwise) or if the
Unitholder redeems or sells his Unit.                   

       (5)The Trust would be regarded, under South Carolina law, as a common
         trust fund and therefore not subject to taxation under any income
tax law of South Carolina.                              

The above described opinion has been concurred in by an informal ruling of
the South Carolina Tax Commission pursuant to Section 12-3-170, recodified as   
Section 12-4-320 of the South Carolina Code, except for the description of the  
South Carolina tax treatment of interest derived from bonds issued by Guam and  
the Virgin Islands in paragraph (2) listed above. While the informal ruling does
not address the South Carolina tax treatment of interest from securities issued 
by those two U.S. territories, South Carolina Revenue Ruling #91-15 specifically
directs that interest derived from bonds issued by the Governments of Guam and  
the Virgin Islands is exempt from South Carolina income taxes.                  

South Carolina Counsel expressed no opinion with respect to taxation under
any other provisions of South Carolina law.                                     

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other South Carolina tax   
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

  Tennessee Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Tennessee is
affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and   
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its
local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to    
satisfy their obligations.                                                      

The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the Bonds, are    
affected by numerous factors. The State's economic base is diversified,         
consisting of manufacturing, construction and service industries, supplemented  
by a diverse agricultural sector. These sectors tend to be more cyclical than   
other sectors. Severe weather conditions, as well as natural disasters, may have
a significant impact on the State's economy.                                    

The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final   
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

Further information concerning Tennessee risk factors may be obtained upon
request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".                

Tennessee Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to qualify as "grantor trusts"
under the federal tax laws. For a discussion of the federal tax treatment of    
income earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see "Federal Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts" above.                                                  

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--Tennessee Tax Status" are defined solely for purposes of
this subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other sections of this  
prospectus.                                                                     

 This section summarizes some of the Tennessee tax consequences to residents
of the State of Tennessee of owning Units of a Tennessee Trust (the "Trust")    
treated as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. Tax laws and        
interpretations change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of   
the tax consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on the     
advice of counsel to the Sponsor. The Tennessee taxing authorities could        
disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section.                        

At the time of the closing, special Tennessee tax counsel ("Tennessee     
Counsel") to the Trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form below      
addressing certain Tennessee tax consequences under then-existing Tennessee     
income tax law to Unitholders subject to Tennessee income tax.                  

The assets of the Trust will consist of bonds issued by the State of      
Tennessee or any county or any municipality or political subdivision thereof    
including any agency, board, authority or commission, the interest on which is  
exempt from the Hall Income Tax imposed by the State of Tennessee (the          
"Tennessee Bonds") or by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (the "Puerto Rico      
Bonds", and together with the Tennessee Bonds, the "Bonds").                    

 Under Tennessee law, a unit investment trust taxable as a grantor trust for
federal income tax purposes is entitled to special Tennessee State tax treatment
(as more fully described below) with respect to its proportionate share of      
interest income received or accrued with respect to the Tennessee Bonds.        
Tennessee law also provides an exemption for distributions made by a unit       
investment trust or mutual fund that are attributable to "bonds or securities of
the United States government or any agency or instrumentality thereof" ("U.S.   
Government, Agency or Instrumentality Bonds"). If it were determined that the   
Tennessee Trust held assets other than Tennessee Bonds or U.S. Government,      
Agency or Instrumentality Bonds, a proportionate share of distributions from the
Tennessee Trust would be taxable to Unitholders for Tennessee Income Tax        
purposes.                                                                       

Further, because this provision appears only to provide an exemption for  
distributions that relate to interest income, distributions by the Trust that   
relate to capital gains realized from the sale or redemption of Tennessee Bonds 
or U.S. Government, Agency or Instrumentality Bonds are likely to be treated as 
taxable dividends for purposes of the Hall Income Tax. However, capital gains   
realized directly by a Unitholder when the Unitholder sells or redeems his Unit 
will not be subject to the Hall Income Tax. The opinion set forth below assumes 
that the interest on the Tennessee Bonds, if received directly by a Unitholder, 
would be exempt from the Hall Income Tax under Tennessee State law. This opinion
does not address the taxation of persons other than full-time residents of the  
State of Tennessee.                                                             

Because this provision only provides an exemption for distributions       
attributable to interest on Tennessee Bonds or U.S. Government, Agency or       
Instrumentality Bonds, it must be determined whether bonds issued by the        
Government of Puerto Rico qualify as U.S. Government, Agency or Instrumentality 
Bonds. For Hall Income Tax purposes, there is currently no published            
administrative interpretation or opinion of the Attorney General of Tennessee   
dealing with the status of distributions made by unit investment trusts such as 
the Tennessee Trust that are attributable to interest paid on bonds issued by   
the Government of Puerto Rico. However, in a letter dated August 14, 1992 (the  
"Commissioner's Letter"), the Commissioner of the State of Tennessee Department 
of Revenue advised that Puerto Rico would be an "instrumentality" of the U.S.   
Government and treated bonds issued by the Government of Puerto Rico as U.S.    
Government, Agency or Instrumentality Bonds. Based on this conclusion, the      
Commissioner advised that distributions from a mutual fund attributable to      
investments in Puerto Rico Bonds are exempt from the Hall Income Tax. Both the  
Sponsor and Tennessee Counsel, for purposes of its opinion (as set forth below),
have assumed, based on the Commissioner's Letter, that bonds issued by the      
Government of Puerto Rico are U.S. Government, Agency or Instrumentality Bonds. 
However, it should be noted that the position of the Commissioner is not        
binding, and is subject to change, even on a retroactive basis.                 

 The Sponsor cannot predict whether new legislation will be enacted into law
affecting the tax status of Tennessee Trusts. The occurrence of such an event   
could cause distributions of interest income from the Trust to be subject to the
Hall Income Tax. Investors should consult their own tax advisors in this regard.
It is assumed for purposes of the discussion and opinion below that the Bonds   
constitute debt for federal income tax purposes.                                

Tennessee Counsel rendered its opinion to the Trust at closing that, under
then-existing Tennessee law:                                                    

  (1)For purposes of the Hall Income Tax, the Tennessee Excise Tax
        imposed by Section 67-4-2005 (the "State Corporate Income Tax"),
         and the Tennessee Franchise Tax imposed by Section 67-4-2105, the
Trust will not be subject to such taxes.                

(2)For Hall Income Tax purposes, a proportionate share of such
  distributions from the Trust to Unitholders, to the extent
     attributable to interest on the Tennessee Bonds (based on the
           relative proportion of interest received or accrued attributable to
     Tennessee Bonds) will be exempt from the Hall Income Tax when
            distributed to such Unitholders. Based on the Commissioner's Letter,
  distributions from the Trust to Unitholders, to the extent
       attributable to interest on the Puerto Rico Bonds (based on the
           relative proportion of interest received or accrued attributable to
           the Puerto Rico Bonds) will be exempt from the Hall Income Tax when
 distributed to such Unitholders. A proportionate share of
          distributions from the Trust attributable to assets other than the
          Bonds would not, under current law, be exempt from the Hall Income
Tax when distributed to Unitholders.                    

    (3)For State Corporate Income Tax Purposes, Tennessee law does not
         provide an exemption for interest on Tennessee Bonds and requires
      that all interest excludable from federal gross income must be
   included in calculating "net earnings" subject to the State
            Corporate Income Tax. No opinion is expressed regarding whether such
          tax would be imposed on the earnings or distributions of the Trust
  (including interest on the Bonds or gain realized upon the
          disposition of the Bonds by the Trust) attributable to Unitholders
            subject to the State Corporate Income Tax. However, based upon prior
         written advice from the Tennessee Department of Revenue, earnings
   and distributions from the Trust (including interest on the
    Tennessee Bonds or gain realized upon the disposition of the
            Tennessee Bonds by the Trust) attributable to the Unitholders should
          be exempt from the State Corporate Income Tax. The position of the
         Tennessee Department of Revenue is not binding, and is subject to
change, even on a retroactive basis.                    

(4)Each Unitholder will realize taxable gain or loss for State
          Corporate Income Tax purposes when the Unitholder redeems or sells
         his Units, at a price that differs from original cost as adjusted
        for accretion or any discount or amortization of any premium and
          other basis adjustments, including any basis reduction that may be
     required to reflect a Unitholder's share of interest, if any,
      accruing on Bonds during the interval between the Unitholder's
           settlement date and the date such Bonds are delivered to the Trust,
           if later. Tax basis reduction requirements relating to amortization
            of bond premium may, under some circumstances, result in Unitholders
         realizing taxable gain when the Units are sold or redeemed for an
amount equal to or less than their original cost.       

         (5)For purposes of the Tennessee Property Tax, the Trust will be exempt
    from taxation with respect to the Bonds it holds. As for the
          taxation of the Units held by the Unitholders, although intangible
            personal property is not presently subject to Tennessee taxation, no
          opinion is expressed with regard to potential property taxation of
           the Unitholders with respect to the Units because the determination
          of whether property is exempt from such tax is made on a county by
county basis.                                           

       (6)The Bonds and the Units held by the Unitholder will not be subject
to Tennessee sales and use taxes.                       

 Tennessee Counsel expressed no opinion regarding whether insurance proceeds
paid in lieu of interest on the Bonds held by the Trust (including the Tennessee
Bonds) are exempt from the Hall Income Tax. Distributions of such proceeds to   
Unitholders may be subject to the Hall Income Tax.                              

 Tennessee Counsel did not examine any of the Bonds to be deposited and held
in the Trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of bond
counsel with respect thereto, and Tennessee Counsel expressed no opinion with   
respect to taxation under any other provisions of Tennessee law.                

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other Tennessee tax        
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

   Texas Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Texas is affected
by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and conditions.
Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on the State and 
its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and other matters may 
constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its local governments
and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to satisfy their        
obligations.                                                                    

The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the Bonds, are    
affected by numerous factors. The Texas labor force is concentrated in oil and  
gas extraction, pipelines and petroleum production. These industries tend to be 
highly cyclical. Texas's largest industries in terms of earnings have           
traditionally been services, government and trade. There is no assurance that   
these industries will continue to grow. Severe weather conditions, as well as   
natural disasters, may have a significant impact on the State's economy.        

The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final   
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

Further information concerning Texas risk factors may be obtained upon    
request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".                

Texas Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to qualify as "grantor trusts" under
the federal tax laws. For a discussion of the federal tax treatment of income   
earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see "Federal Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts" above.                                                  

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--Texas Tax Status" are defined solely for purposes of    
this subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other sections of this  
prospectus.                                                                     

This section summarizes some of the Texas tax consequences to residents of
the State of Texas of owning Units of a Texas Trust (the "Trust") treated as a  
grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. Tax laws and interpretations     
change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of the tax           
consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on the advice of   
counsel to the Sponsor. The Texas taxing authorities could disagree with any    
conclusions set forth in this section.                                          

At the time of the closing, special Texas tax counsel ("Texas Counsel") to
the Trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form below addressing certain
Texas tax consequences under then-existing Texas law to Unitholders.            

Texas Counsel rendered its opinion to the Trust at closing that, under    
then-existing Texas law:                                                        

   (1)Neither Texas nor any political subdivision of Texas currently
      imposes an income tax on individuals. Therefore, no portion of
    any distribution received by an individual Unitholder of the
      Trust in respect of his Units, including a distribution of the
     proceeds of insurance in respect of such Units, is subject to
       income taxation by Texas or any political subdivision of Texas;

         (2)Except in the case of certain transportation businesses, savings and
          loan associations and insurance companies, no Unit of the Trust is
taxable under any property tax levied in Texas;         

      (3)The "inheritance tax" of Texas, imposed upon certain transfers of
     property of a deceased resident individual Unitholder, may be
         measured in part upon the value of Units of the Trust included in
the estate of such Unitholder; and                      

       (4)With respect to any Unitholder which is subject to Texas corporate
      franchise tax, Units in the Trust held by such Unitholder, and
     distributions received therein, will be taken into account in
      computing the "taxable capital" of the Unitholder allocated to
        Texas, one of the bases by which such franchise tax is currently
     measured (the other being a corporation's "net capital earned
    surplus," which is, generally, its net corporate income plus
officers and directors income).                         

 The opinion set forth in clause (2), above, was limited by Texas Counsel to
the extent that Units of the Trust may be subject to property taxes levied in   
Texas if held on the relevant date: (i) by a transportation business described  
in V.T.C.A., Tax Code, Subchapter A, Chapter 24; (ii) by a savings and loan     
association formed under the laws of the State (but only to the extent described
in section 11.09 of the Texas Savings and Loan Act, Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. art. 
852a); or (iii), by an insurance company incorporated under the laws of Texas   
(but only to the extent described in V.A.T.S., Insurance Code, Art. 4.01). Each 
Unitholder described in the preceding sentence should consult its own tax       
advisor with respect to such matters.                                           

For Texas tax reports due on or after January 1, 2008, Texas enacted the  
franchise margin tax, which reformed the Texas franchise tax and extended the   
tax to certain active businesses, broadened the tax base and lowered the tax    
rate. An entity subject to the franchise margin tax generally uses federal gross
income (which would not include interest on obligations exempt from tax for     
federal income tax purposes or exempt-interest dividends derived therefrom) as  
the starting point for calculating its net taxable margin, which is then reduced
by three possible calculations the lowest of which is the entity's net taxable  
margin. It is not likely that exempt interest distributed by the Trust would    
increase a Unitholder's franchise margin tax liability. However, Unitholders    
subject to the franchise margin tax should consult their tax advisors to        
determine whether, based on such Unitholder's individual circumstances, such    
Unitholder would be subject to the franchise margin tax with respect to respect 
to distributions from the Trust attributable to interest on the obligations held
by the Trust or to dispositions of Trust assets, or to the redemption or other  
disposition of Units in the Trust, as well as the applicability of other Texas  
state or local tax laws.                                                        

 Texas Counsel expressed no opinion with respect to taxation under any other
provisions of Texas law. Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently  
examined the bonds or the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with  
the issuance of the bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other  
Texas tax consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should   
consult their tax advisors.                                                     

Virginia Risk Factors. The financial condition of the Commonwealth of     
Virginia is affected by various national, economic, social and environmental    
policies and conditions. Constitutional and statutory limitations concerning    
taxes, bond indebtedness and other matters may constrain the revenue-generating 
capacity of the Commonwealth and its local governments and, therefore, the      
ability of the issuers of the Bonds to satisfy their obligations.               

The economic vitality of the Commonwealth and its various regions and,    
therefore, the ability of the Commonwealth and its local governments to satisfy 
the Bonds, are affected by numerous factors. Severe weather conditions, as well 
as natural disasters, may have a significant impact on the State's economy.     

The Commonwealth may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse  
final decision could materially affect the Commonwealth's governmental          
operations and consequently, its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.

Further information concerning Virginia risk factors may be obtained upon 
request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".                

Virginia Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to qualify as "grantor trusts" 
under the federal tax laws. For a discussion of the federal tax treatment of    
income earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see "Federal Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts" above.                                                  

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--Virginia Tax Status" are defined solely for purposes of 
this subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other sections of this  
prospectus.                                                                     

   This section summarizes some of the Virginia tax consequences to residents of
the State of Virginia of owning Units of a Virginia Trust (the "Trust") treated 
as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. Tax laws and interpretations
change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of the tax           
consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on the advice of   
counsel to the Sponsor. The Virginia taxing authorities could disagree with any 
conclusions set forth in this section.                                          

   At the time of the closing, special Virginia tax counsel ("Virginia Counsel")
to the Trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form below addressing     
certain Virginia tax consequences under then-existing Virginia income tax law to
Unitholders subject to Virginia income tax.                                     

 The assets of the Trust will consist of interest-bearing obligations issued
by or on behalf of the Commonwealth of Virginia or counties, municipalities,    
authorities or political subdivisions thereof (the "Virginia Bonds") and certain
bonds issued by Puerto Rico authorities (the "Possession Bonds", and together   
with the Virginia Bonds, the "Bonds").                                          

  Neither the Sponsor, nor its counsel, nor Virginia Counsel has independently
examined the Bonds to be deposited in and held in the Trust. However, although  
Virginia Counsel expressed no opinion with respect to the issuance of the Bonds,
in rendering its opinion at closing it assumed that: (i) the Bonds were validly 
issued, (ii) the interest thereon is excludable from gross income for federal   
income tax purposes, and (iii) interest on the Bonds, if received directly by a 
Virginia Unitholder, would be exempt from the income tax imposed by the State of
Virginia that is applicable to individuals, trusts and estates (the "Virginia   
Personal Income Tax"). The opinion of Virginia Counsel did not address the      
taxation of persons other than full time residents of Virginia. Virginia Counsel
assumed that, at the respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions that   
the Bonds were validly issued and that interest on the Bonds is excluded from   
gross income for federal income tax purposes were rendered by bond counsel to   
the respective issuing authorities. In addition, Virginia Counsel assumed that, 
with respect to the Virginia Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing authorities     
rendered opinions that the interest on the Virginia Bonds is exempt from the    
Virginia Personal Income Tax and, with respect to the Possession Bonds, bond    
counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions that the Possession Bonds  
and the interest thereon is exempt from all state and local income taxation.    
Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel nor Virginia Counsel made any review for the
Trust of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the Bonds or of the basis  
for the opinions rendered in connection therewith.                              

  Based upon the foregoing, Virginia Counsel rendered its opinion to the Trust
at closing that, under then-existing Virginia law:                              

 (1)The Trust is not an association taxable as a corporation for
            purposes of the Virginia Income Tax and each Unitholder of the Trust
         will be treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of each of the
      assets held by the Trust and the income of such portion of the
      Virginia Trust will be treated as income of the Unitholder for
purposes of the Virginia Income Tax.                    

        (2)Interest on the Virginia Bonds which is exempt from Virginia Income
      Tax when received by the Trust, and which would be exempt from
      Virginia Income Tax if received directly by a Unitholder, will
            retain its status as exempt from such tax when received by the Trust
and distributed to such Unitholder.                     

    (3)Interest on the Possession Bonds which is excludable from gross
           income for federal income tax purposes and is exempt from state and
         local taxation pursuant to federal law when received by the Trust
           will be exempt from Virginia income taxation and therefore will not
         be includible in the income of the Unitholder for Virginia income
      tax purposes when distributed by the Trust and received by the
Unitholders.                                            

        (4)The Virginia legislature has enacted a law, effective July 1, 1997,
            that would exempt from the Virginia Income Tax income derived on the
          sale or exchange of obligations of the Commonwealth of Virginia or
           any political subdivision or instrumentality of the Commonwealth of
     Virginia. However, Virginia law does not address whether this
          exclusion would apply to gains recognized through entities such as
        the Virginia Trust. Accordingly, we express no opinion as to the
      treatment for Virginia Income Tax purposes of any gain or loss
   recognized by a Unitholder for federal income tax purposes.

         (5)The Virginia Income Tax does not permit a deduction of interest paid
           on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry Units in
   the Trust to the extent that interest income related to the
  ownership of Units is exempt from the Virginia Income Tax.

In the case of Unitholders subject to the Virginia Bank Franchise Tax, the
income derived by such a Unitholder from his pro rata portion of the Bonds held 
by the Trust may affect the determination of such Unitholder's Bank Franchise   
Tax. Prospective investors subject to the Virginia Bank Franchise Tax should    
consult their tax advisors.                                                     

Virginia Counsel expressed no opinion with respect to taxation under any  
other provisions of Virginia law. Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has       
independently examined the bonds or the opinions of bond counsel rendered in    
connection with the issuance of the bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may  
result in other Virginia tax consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective 
investors should consult their tax advisors.                                    

West Virginia Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of West  
Virginia is affected by various national, economic, social and environmental    
policies and conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations 
imposed on the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond           
indebtedness and other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of 
the State and its local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers  
of the Bonds to satisfy their obligations.                                      

The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the Bonds, are    
affected by numerous factors. West Virginia's primary employment is in the      
services, trade and government. These sectors tend to be cyclical and can cause 
problems for the economy. West Virginia has historically had a higher           
unemployment rate than the U.S. which also affects the economy. Severe weather  
conditions, as well as natural disasters, may have a significant impact on the  
State's economy.                                                                

The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final   
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

Further information concerning West Virginia risk factors may be obtained 
upon request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".           

West Virginia Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to qualify as "grantor
trusts" under the federal tax laws. For a discussion of the federal tax         
treatment of income earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see     
"Federal Tax Status--Grantor Trusts" above.                                     

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--West Virginia Tax Status" are defined solely for        
purposes of this subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other       
sections of this prospectus.                                                    

This section summarizes some of the West Virginia tax consequences to     
residents of the State of West Virginia of owning Units of a West Virginia Trust
(the "Trust") treated as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. Tax   
laws and interpretations change frequently, and these summaries do not describe 
all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on  
the advice of counsel to the Sponsor. The West Virginia taxing authorities could
disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section.                        

   At the time of the closing, special West Virginia tax counsel ("West Virginia
Counsel") to the Trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form below      
addressing certain West Virginia tax consequences under then-existing West      
Virginia income tax law to Unitholders subject to West Virginia income tax.     

The assets of the West Virginia Trust will consist of interest-bearing    
obligations issued by or on behalf of the State of West Virginia or counties,   
municipalities, authorities or political subdivisions thereof the interest on   
which is expected to qualify as exempt from West Virginia income taxes (the     
"West Virginia Bonds") or by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam or the United
States Virgin Islands (the "Possession Bonds", and together with the West       
Virginia Bonds, the "Bonds").                                                   

Neither the Sponsor, nor its counsel, nor West Virginia Counsel has       
independently examined the Bonds to be deposited in and held in the Trust.      
However, although West Virginia Counsel expressed no opinion regarding such     
matters, it is assumed that: (i) the Bonds were validly issued, (ii) the        
interest thereon is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes
and (iii) interest on the Bonds, if received directly by a Unitholder would be  
exempt from the West Virginia personal income tax applicable to individuals (the
"West Virginia Personal Income Tax"). At the respective times of issuance of the
Bonds, opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the exemption of        
interest thereon from federal income tax were rendered by bond counsel to the   
respective issuing authorities. In addition, with respect to the West Virginia  
Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions as to the      
exemption of interest from the West Virginia Personal Income Tax and, with      
respect to the Possession Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing authorities        
rendered opinions as to the exemption from all state and local income taxation. 
Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has made any review for the Trust of the    
proceedings relating to the issuance of the Bonds or of the bases for the       
opinions rendered in connection therewith. The opinion set forth below does not 
address the taxation of persons other than full-time residents of West Virginia.

At the time of closing for each Trust, West Virginia Counsel to the Trust 
rendered an opinion, based upon the assumptions set forth above, under then     
existing West Virginia law substantially to the effect that:                    

 (1)The Trust will not be subject to tax under the West Virginia
        Corporation Net Income Tax, the West Virginia Business Franchise
Tax, or the West Virginia Personal Income Tax.          

 (2)Interest on the Bonds which is exempt from the West Virginia
          Personal Income Tax when received by the Trust, and which would be
     exempt from the West Virginia Personal Income Tax if received
            directly by a Unitholder, will retain its status as exempt from such
          tax when received by the Trust and distributed to such Unitholder.

        (3)For Unitholders subject to the West Virginia Corporation Net Income
         Tax, income of the Trust received by them (except interest income
   with respect to Possession Bonds, as to which no opinion is
       expressed) is not exempt from the West Virginia Corporation Net
         Income Tax. However, such Unitholders may be entitled to a credit
       against the tax imposed under the West Virginia Corporation Net
      Income Tax Law based on their ownership of Units in the Trust.
   Unitholders should consult their own advisors regarding the
applicability and computation of any such credit.       

  (4)Each Unitholder will recognize gain or loss for West Virginia
      Personal Income Tax purposes if the Trustee disposes of a bond
          (whether by redemption, sale, payment at maturity or otherwise) or
           if the Unitholder redeems or sells Units of the Trust to the extent
            that such a transaction results in a recognized gain or loss to such
Unitholder for federal income tax purposes.             

    (5)Insurance proceeds paid under policies which represent maturing
         interest on defaulted obligations which are excludable from gross
            income for federal income tax purposes should be excludable from the
    West Virginia Personal Income Tax to the same extent as such
            interest would have been if paid by the issuer of such Bonds held by
the Trust.                                              

         (6)The West Virginia Personal Income Tax does not permit a deduction of
          interest paid on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or
           carry Units in the Trust to the extent that interest income related
           to the ownership of Units is exempt from the West Virginia Personal
Income Tax.                                             

West Virginia Counsel did not examine any of the Bonds to be deposited and
held in the Trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of
bond counsel with respect thereto, and West Virginia Counsel expressed no       
opinion with respect to taxation under any other provisions of West Virginia    
law.                                                                            

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other West Virginia tax    
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

Regulated Investment Companies

California Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to elect and to qualify annually
as "regulated investment companies" under the federal tax laws. For a discussion
of the federal tax treatment of income earned on Units of a Trust that is a     
regulated investment company, see "Federal Tax Status--Regulated Investment
Companies" above.                                                               

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Regulated Investment Companies--California Tax Status" are defined      
solely for purposes of this subsection and not are not defined terms applicable 
to other sections of this prospectus.                                           

  This section summarizes some of the California tax consequences to residents
of the State of California of owning Units of a California Trust (the "Trust")  
treated as a regulated investment company for federal income tax purposes. Tax  
laws and interpretations change frequently, and these summaries do not describe 
all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on  
the advice of counsel to the Sponsor. The California taxing authorities could   
disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section.                        

Unitholders of the Trust that are individuals may exclude from income for 
purposes of the California Personal Income Tax dividends received from the Trust
that are properly designated by the Trust in a written notice mailed to the     
Unitholders as California exempt-interest dividends. The portion of the Trust's 
dividends designated as California exempt-interest dividends may not exceed the 
amount of interest the Trust receives during its taxable year on obligations the
interest on which, if held by an individual, is exempt from taxation by the     
State of California, reduced by certain non-deductible expenses. The Trust may  
designate California exempt-interest dividends only if the Trust qualifies as a 
regulated investment company under the Code, and, if at the close of each       
quarter of its taxable year, at least 50 percent of the value of the total      
assets consists of obligations the interest on which when held by an individual,
is exempt from taxation by the State of California. Distributions from the      
Trust, other than California exempt-interest dividends, will generally be       
subject to the California Personal Income Tax. Please note that California      
exempt-interest dividends received by a Unitholder subject to the California    
Corporation Tax Law may be includible its gross income for purposes of          
determining its California franchise tax and its California income tax.         

  Interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry Units of
the Trust, if the Trust distributes California exempt-interest dividends during 
a year, is not deductible for purposes of the California Personal Income Tax.   

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other California tax       
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

Colorado Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to elect and to qualify annually
as "regulated investment companies" under the federal tax laws. For a discussion
of the federal tax treatment of income earned on Units of a Trust that is a     
regulated investment company, see "Federal Tax Status--Regulated Investment
Companies" above.                                                               

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Regulated Investment Companies--Colorado Tax Status" are defined solely 
for purposes of this subsection and not are not defined terms applicable to     
other sections of this prospectus.                                              

   This section summarizes some of the Colorado tax consequences to residents of
the State of Colorado of owning Units of a Colorado Trust (the "Trust") treated 
as a regulated investment company for federal income tax purposes. Tax laws and 
interpretations change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of   
the tax consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on the     
advice of counsel to the Sponsor. The Colorado taxing authorities could disagree
with any conclusions set forth in this section.                                 

 The assets of the Trust will consist of interest-bearing obligations issued
by or on behalf of the State or political subdivisions thereof (the "Colorado   
Bonds") or by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (the "Puerto Rico Bonds", and     
together with the Colorado Bonds, the "Bonds").                                 

   The discussion in this section is based on the assumption that: (i) the Bonds
were validly issued by the State or a political subdivision thereof, or by the  
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico as the case may be, (ii) the interest on the Bonds  
is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes, (iii) with     
respect to the Colorado Bonds, such Colorado Bonds were either issued on or     
after May 1, 1980, or were issued before May 1, 1980 but the interest is        
specifically exempt from income taxation under the Colorado state laws          
authorizing the issuance of such obligations, (iv) with respect to the Puerto   
Rico Bonds, the Puerto Rico Bonds and the interest thereon are exempt from all  
state and local taxation, and (v) the Trust will be eligible to distribute      
exempt-interest dividends. This disclosure does not address the taxation of     
persons other than full-time residents of Colorado.                             

Under existing Colorado law:                                              

         (1)Exempt-interest dividends distributed by the Trust that are excluded
 from gross income for federal income tax purposes and are
           attributable to interest on the Bonds will be excluded from taxable
    income for purposes of the Colorado personal income tax (the
         "Personal Income Tax") and the Colorado corporate income tax (the
    "Corporate Income Tax"), both of which are imposed under the
        Colorado Revised Statutes; however, some of such exempt-interest
       dividends may be taken into account in determining the Colorado
alternative minimum tax.                                

       (2)Distributions from the Trust, other than exempt-interest dividends
           attributable to interest on the Bonds, will generally be subject to
the Personal Income Tax and the Corporate Income Tax.   

        (3)Each Unitholder will be subject to tax for purposes of the Personal
         Income Tax and the Corporate Income Tax on the gain recognized on
the sale or redemption of a Share.                      

Unitholders should be aware that, generally, interest on indebtedness     
incurred or continued to purchase or carry Units is not deductible for purposes 
of the Personal Income Tax or the Corporate Income Tax.                         

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other Colorado tax         
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

Florida Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to elect and to qualify annually as
"regulated investment companies" under the federal tax laws. For a discussion of
the federal tax treatment of income earned on Units of a Trust that is a        
regulated investment company, see "Federal Tax Status--Regulated Investment
Companies" above.                                                               

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Regulated Investment Companies--Florida Tax Status" are defined solely  
for purposes of this subsection and not are not defined terms applicable to     
other sections of this prospectus.                                              

  This section summarizes some of the Florida tax consequences to residents of
the State of Florida of owning Units of a Florida Trust (the "Trust") treated as
a regulated investment company for federal income tax purposes. Tax laws and    
interpretations change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of   
the tax consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on the     
advice of counsel to the Sponsor. The Florida taxing authorities could disagree 
with any conclusions set forth in this section.                                 

Florida does not currently impose an income tax on individuals. Florida   
formerly imposed an annual tax on intangible personal property held by          
individuals as of the first day of the calendar year. However, Florida repealed 
the annual intangible personal property tax effective January 1, 2007.          

  Florida does impose an income tax on corporations and certain other entities
and distributions from the Trust may be subject to this income tax.             

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other Florida tax          
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

Michigan Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to elect and to qualify annually
as "regulated investment companies" under the federal tax laws. For a discussion
of the federal tax treatment of income earned on Units of a Trust that is a     
regulated investment company, see "Federal Tax Status--Regulated Investment
Companies" above.                                                               

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Regulated Investment Companies--Michigan Tax Status" are defined solely 
for purposes of this subsection and not are not defined terms applicable to     
other sections of this prospectus.                                              

   This section summarizes some of the Michigan tax consequences to residents of
the State of Michigan of owning Units of a Michigan Trust (the "Trust") treated 
as a regulated investment company for federal income tax purposes. Tax laws and 
interpretations change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of   
the tax consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on the     
advice of counsel to the Sponsor. The Michigan taxing authorities could disagree
with any conclusions set forth in this section.                                 

  At the time of closing, special Michigan tax counsel ("Michigan Counsel") to
the Trust rendered an opinion addressing certain Michigan tax consequences under
then-existing Michigan income tax law to Unitholders subject to Michigan income 
tax. In such opinion of Michigan Counsel at closing, the Trust and the owners of
Units will be treated for purposes of the Michigan income tax laws in           
substantially the same manner as they are for purposes of the federal income tax
laws.                                                                           

  The Michigan Intangibles Tax was totally repealed effective January 1, 1998.

 Michigan Unitholders who are subject to the Personal Income Tax will not be
taxed on exempt-interest dividends to the extent such dividends are attributable
to interest on obligations of Michigan and its political subdivisions. To the   
extent the distributions from the Trust are attributable to other sources, such 
distributions (including, but not limited to, long-term and short-term capital  
gains, interest on other obligations, and investment company taxable income, if 
any) may be subject to the Personal Income Tax. Michigan Unitholders should     
consult their tax advisors regarding the applicability of the Personal Income   
Tax to such distributions based on their individual circumstances.              

 The Michigan Single Business Tax was repealed for tax years beginning after
December 31, 2007. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2007, the Michigan
Business Tax ("MBT") applies to all business activity of taxpayers subject to   
the MBT. The MBT is composed of two taxes: a business income tax on every       
taxpayer with business activity in Michigan and a modified gross receipts tax on
every taxpayer with nexus to Michigan. The MBT generally excludes               
exempt-interest dividends derived from obligations of the Trust issued by       
Michigan and its political subdivisions. However, Unitholders subject to the MBT
should consult their tax advisors to determine whether, based on such           
Unitholder's business activity in Michigan or other relevant factors under the  
MBT, such Unitholder would be subject to the MBT with respect to distributions  
from the Trust attributable to interest on the obligations held by the Trust,   
other income or gains of the trust (including long-term or short-term capital   
gains, interest, and other investment company taxable income, if any), or to the
redemption or other disposition of Units in the Trust, as well as the           
applicability of other Michigan state or local tax laws.                        

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other Michigan tax         
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

Missouri Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to elect and to qualify annually
as "regulated investment companies" under the federal tax laws. For a discussion
of the federal tax treatment of income earned on Units of a Trust that is a     
regulated investment company, see "Federal Tax Status--Regulated Investment
Companies" above.                                                               

   This section summarizes some of the Missouri tax consequences to residents of
the State of Missouri of owning Units of a Missouri Trust (the "Trust") treated 
as a regulated investment company for federal income tax purposes. Tax laws and 
interpretations change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of   
the tax consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on the     
advice of counsel to the Sponsor. The Missouri taxing authorities could disagree
with any conclusions set forth in this section.                                 

 The assets of the Trust will consist of interest-bearing obligations issued
by or on behalf of the State of Missouri or political subdivisions thereof (the 
"Missouri Bonds") or by the government of Puerto Rico, Guam or the Virgin       
Islands (the "Possession Bonds" and together with the Missouri Bonds, the       
"Bonds").                                                                       

   The discussion in this section is based on the assumption that: (i) the Bonds
were validly issued by the State of Missouri or a political subdivision thereof,
or by the government of Puerto Rico, Guam or the Virgin Islands as the case may 
be, (ii) the interest on the Bonds is excludable from gross income for federal  
income tax purposes, (iii) with respect to the Possession Bonds, the Possession 
Bonds and the interest thereon are exempt from all state and local taxation, and
(iv) the Trust will be eligible to distribute exempt-interest dividends. This   
disclosure does not address the taxation of persons other than full-time        
residents of Missouri.                                                          

Under existing Missouri law:                                              

         (1)Exempt-interest dividends distributed by the Trust that are excluded
 from gross income for federal income tax purposes and are
           attributable to interest on the Bonds will be excluded from taxable
 income for purposes of the Missouri income tax imposed on
        individuals, trusts, estates (the "Personal Income Tax") and the
         income tax imposed on certain corporations (the "Corporate Income
       Tax") (not including banking institutions, credit institutions,
            credit unions and savings and loan associations), provided the Trust
            designates such dividends in an annual notice mailed to Unitholders.

       (2)Distributions from the Trust, other than exempt-interest dividends
           attributable to interest on the Bonds, generally will be subject to
the Personal Income Tax.                                

      (3)Distributions from the Trust, including exempt-interest dividends
    attributable to interest on the Bonds, may be subject to the
franchise taxes imposed on banking institutions, credit 
          institutions, credit unions and savings and loan associations (the
"Franchise Taxes").                                     

         (4)Each Unitholder generally will be subject to tax for purposes of the
          Personal Income Tax and the Franchise Taxes on the gain recognized
on the sale or redemption of a Unit.                    

Unitholders should be aware that, generally, interest on indebtedness     
incurred or continued to purchase or carry Units is not deductible for purposes 
of the Personal Income Tax and the Corporate Income Tax.                        

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other Missouri tax         
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

New York Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to elect and to qualify annually
as "regulated investment companies" under the federal tax laws. For a discussion
of the federal tax treatment of income earned on Units of a Trust that is a     
regulated investment company, see "Federal Tax Status--Regulated Investment
Companies" above.                                                               

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Regulated Investment Companies--New York Tax Status" are defined solely 
for purposes of this subsection and not are not defined terms applicable to     
other sections of this prospectus.                                              

This section summarizes some of the New York State and New York City tax  
consequences to residents of the State of New York and New York City of owning  
Units of a New York Trust (the "Trust") treated as a regulated investment       
company for federal income tax purposes. Tax laws and interpretations change    
frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to  
all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the    
Sponsor. The New York taxing authorities could disagree with any conclusions set
forth in this section.                                                          

 The assets of the Trust will consist of interest-bearing obligations issued
by or on behalf of the State of New York or political subdivisions thereof (the 
"New York Bonds") or by the government of Puerto Rico, Guam or the Virgin       
Islands (the "Possession Bonds", and together with the New York Bonds, the      
"Bonds").                                                                       

   The discussion in this section is based on the assumption that: (i) the Bonds
were validly issued by the State of New York or a political subdivision thereof,
or by the government of Puerto Rico, Guam or the Virgin Islands, as the case may
be, (ii) the interest on the Bonds is excludable from gross income for federal  
income tax purposes, (iii) with respect to the Possession Bonds, the Possession 
Bonds and the interest thereon are exempt from all state and local taxation, and
(iv) the Trust will be eligible to distribute exempt-interest dividends. This   
disclosure does not address the taxation of persons other than full-time        
residents of the State of New York and New York City.                           

Under existing New York law:                                              

         (1)Exempt-interest dividends distributed by the Trust that are excluded
 from gross income for federal income tax purposes and are
           attributable to interest on the Bonds will be excluded from taxable
     income for purposes of the New York State personal income tax
       imposed by Article 22 of the New York State Tax Law (the "State
        Personal Income Tax") and the personal income tax imposed by the
         City of New York under Section 11-1701 of the Administrative Code
(the "City Personal Income Tax").                       

       (2)Distributions from the Trust, other than exempt-interest dividends
           attributable to interest on the Bonds, will generally be subject to
       the State Personal Income Tax and the City Personal Income Tax.

       (3)Distributions, including exempt-interest dividends, distributed by
           the Trust will generally be subject to the New York State franchise
          tax imposed on domestic and foreign corporations by Article 9-A of
      the New York State Tax Law (the "State Corporate Tax") and the
           general corporation tax imposed by the City of New York on domestic
           and foreign corporations under Section 11-603 of the Administrative
Code of the City of New York (the "City Corporate Tax").

         (4)Each Unitholder generally will be subject to tax for purposes of the
          State Personal Income Tax, the City Personal Income Tax, the State
          Corporate Tax and the City Corporate Tax on the gain recognized on
the sale or redemption of a Unit.                       

Unitholders should be aware that, generally, interest on indebtedness     
incurred or continued to purchase or carry Units is not deductible for purposes 
of the State Personal Income Tax, the City Personal Income Tax, the State       
Corporate Tax and the City Corporate Tax.

the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other New York State or New
York City tax consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors

Ohio Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to elect and to qualify annually as
"regulated investment companies" under the federal tax laws. For a discussion of
the federal tax treatment of income earned on Units of a Trust that is a        
regulated investment company, see "Federal Tax Status--Regulated Investment
Companies" above.                                                               

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Regulated Investment Companies--Ohio Tax Status" are defined solely for 
purposes of this subsection and not are not defined terms applicable to other   
sections of this prospectus.                                                    

   This section summarizes some of the Ohio tax consequences to residents of the
State of Ohio of owning Units of the Ohio IM-IT (the "Trust"), which is treated 
as a regulated investment company for federal income tax purposes. Tax laws and 
interpretations change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of   
the tax consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on the     
advice of counsel to the Sponsor. The Ohio taxing authorities could disagree    
with any conclusions set forth in this section.                                 

In the opinion of Squire, Sanders & Dempsey L.L.P., special counsel to the
Trust for Ohio tax matters ("Ohio Counsel") assuming the Trust continues to     
qualify as a regulated investment company under Section 851 of the Code, and    
that at all times at least fifty percent (50%) of the total assets of the Trust 
will consist of interest-bearing obligations of the State of Ohio or its        
political subdivisions or similar obligations of other states or their political
subdivisions, then under existing law:                                          

        (1)The Trust is not taxable as a corporation or otherwise for purposes
  of the Ohio personal income tax, municipal, joint economic
         development district or school district income taxes in Ohio, the
          Ohio corporation franchise tax, or the Ohio dealers in intangibles
tax.                                                    

       (2)Distributions with respect to Units of the Trust ("Distributions")
            will be treated as the income of the Unitholders for purposes of the
       Ohio personal income tax, municipal, joint economic development
       district and school district income taxes in Ohio, and the Ohio
          corporation franchise tax in proportion to the respective interest
therein of each Unitholder.                             

   (3)Distributions properly attributable to interest on obligations
           issued by or on behalf of the State of Ohio, political subdivisions
thereof, or agencies or instrumentalities thereof ("Ohio
         Obligations") held by the Trust are exempt from the Ohio personal
          income tax, and municipal, joint economic development district and
           school district income taxes in Ohio, and are excluded from the net
          income base of the Ohio corporation franchise tax when distributed
or deemed distributed to Unitholders.                   

   (4)Distributions properly attributable to interest on Territorial
           Obligations held by the Trust (the interest on which is exempt from
          state income taxes under the laws of the United States) are exempt
        from the Ohio personal income tax, and municipal, joint economic
          development district and school district income taxes in Ohio, and
        provided such interest is excluded from gross income for federal
         income tax purposes, such Distributions are excluded from the net
          income base of the Ohio corporation franchise tax when distributed
or deemed distributed to Unitholders.                   

         (5)Distributions properly attributable to proceeds of insurance paid to
        the Trust representing maturing or matured interest on defaulted
         obligations held by the Trust that are excluded from gross income
         for federal income tax purposes will be exempt from Ohio personal
          income tax, and municipal, joint economic development district and
           school district income taxes in Ohio, and will be excluded from the
net income base of the Ohio corporation franchise tax.  

(6)Distributions of profit made on the sale, exchange or other
disposition by the Trust of Ohio Obligations, including 
       Distributions of "capital gain dividends" as defined in Section
    852(b)(3)(C) of the Code, properly attributable to the sale,
         exchange or other disposition of Ohio Obligations are exempt from
          Ohio personal income tax and municipal, joint economic development
           district and school district income taxes in Ohio, and are excluded
       from the net income base of the Ohio corporation franchise tax.

     (7)Receipts by the Trust of interest, proceeds paid under insurance
         policies that represent maturing or matured interest on defaulted
    obligations held by the Trust, and any amount from the sale,
         exchange or other disposition of capital assets held by the Trust
          are not subject to the Ohio commercial activity tax. Distributions
     from the Trust to the Unitholders are not subject to the Ohio
commercial activity tax.                                

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other Ohio tax consequences
to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult their tax        
advisors.                                                                       

Pennsylvania Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to elect and to qualify    
annually as "regulated investment companies" under the federal tax laws. For a  
discussion of the federal tax treatment of income earned on Units of a Trust    
that is a regulated investment company, see "Federal Tax Status--Regulated
Investment Companies" above.                                                    

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Regulated Investment Companies--Pennsylvania Tax Status" are defined    
solely for purposes of this subsection and not are not defined terms applicable 
to other sections of this prospectus.                                           

This section summarizes some of the Pennsylvania state and local tax      
consequences to residents of the State of Pennsylvania of owning Units of a     
Pennsylvania Trust (the "Trust") treated as a regulated investment company for  
federal income tax purposes. Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and
these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers.   
This summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the Sponsor. The      
Pennsylvania taxing authorities could disagree with any conclusions set forth in
this section.                                                                   

 The assets of the Trust will consist of interest-bearing obligations issued
by or on behalf of the State, any public authority, commission, board or other  
agency created by the State or a political subdivision of the State, or         
political subdivisions thereof (the "Pennsylvania Bonds") or by the Commonwealth
of Puerto Rico (the "Puerto Rico Bonds," and, collectively with the Pennsylvania
Bonds, the "Bonds").                                                            

   The discussion in this section is based on the assumption that: (i) the Bonds
were validly issued by the State or its municipalities, or by the Commonwealth  
of Puerto Rico as the case may be, (ii) the interest thereon is excludable from 
gross income for federal income tax purposes, (iii) the interest thereon is     
exempt from Pennsylvania State and local taxes, (iv) with respect to the Puerto 
Rico Bonds, the Puerto Rico Bonds and the interest thereon are exempt from all  
state and local taxation, and (iv) the Trust will be eligible to distribute     
exempt-interest dividends. This disclosure does not address the taxation of     
persons other than full-time residents of Pennsylvania.                         

 Under existing Pennsylvania law at the time of closing, based on the advice
of special Pennsylvania tax counsel to the Trust ("Pennsylvania Counsel"):      

       (1)Exempt-interest dividends distributed by the Trust attributable to
         interest on the Bonds, net of Trust expenses, will be exempt from
   the personal income tax (the "Personal Income Tax") and the
            corporate income tax (the "Corporate Income Tax"), both of which are
        imposed under the Pennsylvania Tax Reform Code of 1971, provided
     certain reporting requirements are satisfied. Exempt-interest
          dividends distributed by the Trust attributable to interest on the
          Pennsylvania Bonds, net of Trust expenses, will be exempt from the
   Philadelphia School District Investment Net Income Tax (the
       "Philadelphia School Tax") imposed under Section 19-1804 of the
   Philadelphia Code of Ordinances, provided certain reporting
            requirements are satisfied. Exempt-interest dividends distributed by
          the Trust attributable to interest on the Puerto Rico Bonds may be
subject to the Philadelphia School Tax.                 

       (2)Distributions from the Trust, other than exempt-interest dividends
           attributable to interest on the Bonds, will generally be subject to
          the Personal Income Tax and the Corporate Income Tax. Capital gain
  dividends distributed by the Trust will be exempt from the
         Philadelphia School Tax. Distributions from the Trust, other than
 exempt-interest dividends attributable to interest on the
        Pennsylvania Bonds and capital gain dividends, will generally be
subject to the Philadelphia School Tax.                 

        (3)Each Unitholder will be subject to tax for purposes of the Personal
         Income Tax and the Corporate Income Tax on the gain recognized on
     the sale or redemption of a Share. A Unitholder's gain upon a
        redemption or sale of Units will be exempt from the Philadelphia
     School Tax if the Unitholder held his Share for more than six
         months. If, however, the Share was held by the Unitholder for six
          months or less, then the gains will be subject to the Philadelphia
School Tax.                                             

Unitholders should be aware that, generally, interest on indebtedness     
incurred or continued to purchase or carry Units is not deductible for purposes 
of the Personal Income Tax, the Corporate Income Tax or the Philadelphia School 
Tax.                                                                            

Neither the Sponsor, nor its counsel, nor Pennsylvania Counsel has        
independently examined the bonds or the opinions of bond counsel rendered in    
connection with the issuance of the bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may  
result in other Pennsylvania state or local tax consequences to certain         
taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult their tax advisors.         

EXPENSES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General. The Trustee will periodically deduct from the Interest Account and,
to the extent funds are not sufficient therein, from the Principal Account,     
amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the Trusts. The Trustee also may       
withdraw from these Accounts such amounts, if any, as it deems necessary to     
establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of the Trusts.     
Amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a Trust's assets until   
such time as the Trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the    
appropriate Accounts. All costs and expenses incurred in creating and           
establishing the Trusts, including the cost of the initial preparation, printing
and execution of the Trust Agreement and the certificates, legal and accounting 
expenses, advertising and selling expenses, expenses of the Trustee, initial    
evaluation fees and other out-of-pocket expenses have been borne by the Sponsor 
at no cost to the Trusts.                                                       

 Sponsor, Supervisor, Evaluator and Trustee. The Sponsor and the Supervisor,
which is an affiliate of the Sponsor, will receive the annual fees indicated    
under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I for     
providing bookkeeping and administrative services and for providing portfolio   
supervisory services for the Trusts. These fees may exceed the actual costs of  
providing these services for a Trust but the total amount received for providing
these services to all Van Kampen unit investment trusts will not exceed the     
total cost of providing the services in any calendar year. The Evaluator will   
receive the annual evaluation fee indicated under "Summary of Essential         
Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I for evaluating each Trust's         
portfolio. For its services the Trustee will receive the fee indicated under    
"Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I (which may be 
reduced as described therein). Part of the Trustee's compensation for its       
services is expected to result from the use of the funds being held in the      
Principal and Interest Accounts for future distributions, payment of expenses   
and redemptions since these Accounts are non-interest bearing to Unitholders.   
These fees are based on the outstanding principal amount of bonds and Units on  
the Date of Deposit for the first year and as of the close of business on       
January 1 for each year thereafter.                                             

Insurance. Premiums for any portfolio insurance are obligations of each   
Insured Trust and are payable monthly by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust. As 
bonds covered by a portfolio insurance policy in an Insured Trust are redeemed  
by their respective issuers or are sold by the Trustee, the amount of the       
premium will be reduced in respect of those bonds. If the Trustee exercises the 
right to obtain permanent insurance, the premiums payable for such permanent    
insurance will be paid solely from the proceeds of the sale of the related      
bonds.                                                                          

Miscellaneous Expenses. The following additional charges are or may be    
incurred by the Trusts: (a) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary services, (b) 
expenses of the Trustee (including legal and auditing expenses) and of counsel  
designated by the Sponsor, (c) various governmental charges, (d) expenses and   
costs of any action taken by the Trustee to protect the Trusts and the rights   
and interests of Unitholders, (e) indemnification of the Trustee for any loss,  
liability or expenses incurred by it in the administration of the Trusts without
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part, (f) any special        
custodial fees payable in connection with the sale of any of the bonds in a     
Trust, (g) expenditures incurred in contacting Unitholders upon termination of  
the Trusts and (h) costs incurred to reimburse the Trustee for advancing funds  
to the Trusts to meet scheduled distributions (which costs may be adjusted      
periodically in response to fluctuations in short-term interest rates). Each    
Trust will pay the costs associated with updating its registration statement    
each year. The fees and expenses set forth herein are payable out of the Trusts.
When such fees and expenses are paid by or owing to the Trustee, they are       
secured by a lien on the portfolio of the applicable Trust. If the balances in  
the Interest and Principal Accounts are insufficient to provide for amounts     
payable by a Trust, the Trustee has the power to sell bonds to pay such amounts.

Investments                                                                     

 Municipal Bond Risk Factors

The Trusts include certain types of bonds described below. Accordingly, an
investment in a Trust should be made with an understanding of the               
characteristics of and risks associated with such bonds. The types of bonds     
included in each Trust are described under "Portfolio" in the related Prospectus
Part I. Neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee shall be liable in any way for any  
default, failure or defect in any of the bonds.                                 

General Obligation Bonds and Revenue Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be   
general obligations of a governmental entity that are backed by the taxing power
of such entity. All other bonds in the Trusts are revenue bonds payable from the
income of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuer's 
power to levy taxes. General obligation bonds are secured by the issuer's pledge
of its faith, credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest.
However, the taxing power of any governmental entity may be limited by          
provisions of state constitutions or laws and an entity's credit will depend on 
many factors. Some such factors are the entity's tax base, the extent to which  
the entity relies on federal or state aid, and other factors which are beyond   
the entity's control. Revenue bonds, on the other hand, are payable only from   
the revenues derived from a particular facility or class of facilities or, in   
some cases, from the proceeds of a special excise tax or other specific revenue 
source. There are, of course, variations in the security of the different bonds 
in a Trust, both within a particular classification and between classifications,
depending on numerous factors.                                                  

Housing Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be obligations which derive their 
payments from mortgage loans. Certain of such housing bonds may be FHA insured. 
Multi-family housing revenue bonds are payable primarily from mortgage loans to 
housing projects for low to moderate income families. Single family mortgage    
revenue bonds are issued for the purpose of acquiring from originating financial
institutions notes secured by mortgages on residences located within the        
issuer's boundaries and owned by persons of low or moderate income. The ability 
of housing issuers to make debt service payments on their obligations may be    
affected by various economic and non-economic factors. Such factors include:    
occupancy levels, adequate rental income in multi-family projects, the rate of  
default on mortgage loans underlying single family issuers and the ability of   
mortgage insurers to pay claims. Mortgage loans are generally partially or      
completely prepaid prior to their final maturities as a result of events such as
sale of the mortgaged premises, default, condemnation or casualty loss. Because 
these bonds are subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption in whole or in    
part from such prepayments of mortgage loans, a substantial portion of such     
bonds will probably be redeemed prior to their scheduled maturities or even     
prior to their ordinary call dates. Extraordinary mandatory redemption without  
premium could also result from the failure of the originating financial         
institutions to make mortgage loans in sufficient amounts within a specified    
time period. Additionally, unusually high rates of default on the underlying    
mortgage loans may reduce revenues available for the payment of principal of or 
interest on such mortgage revenue bonds. These bonds were issued under Section  
103A of the Internal Revenue Code, which Section contains certain requirements  
relating to the use of the proceeds of such bonds in order for the interest on  
such bonds to retain its tax-exempt status. In each case the issuer of the bonds
has covenanted to comply with applicable requirements and bond counsel to such  
issuer has issued an opinion that the interest on the bonds is exempt from      
federal income tax under existing laws and regulations. Certain issuers of      
housing bonds have considered various ways to redeem bonds they have issued     
prior to the stated first redemption dates for such bonds. In connection with   
the housing bonds held by a Trust, the Sponsor at the Date of Deposit is not    
aware that any of the respective issuers of such bonds are actively considering 
the redemption of such bonds prior to their respective stated initial call      
dates.                                                                          

Health Care Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be health care revenue bonds. 
Ratings of bonds issued for health care facilities are often based on           
feasibility studies that contain projections of occupancy levels, revenues and  
expenses. A facility's gross receipts and net income available for debt service 
may be affected by future events and conditions including, among other things,  
demand for services and the ability of the facility to provide the services     
required, physicians' confidence in the facility, management capabilities,      
competition with other health care facilities, efforts by insurers and          
governmental agencies to limit rates, legislation establishing state            
rate-setting agencies, expenses, the cost and possible unavailability of        
malpractice insurance, the funding of Medicare, Medicaid and other similar third
party payor programs, government regulation and the termination or restriction  
of governmental financial assistance, including that associated with Medicare,  
Medicaid and other similar third party payor programs. It also may be necessary 
for a hospital or other health care facility to incur substantial capital       
expenditures or increased operating expenses to effect changes in its           
facilities, equipment, personnel and services. Hospitals and other health care  
facilities are additionally subject to claims and legal actions by patients and 
others in the ordinary course of business. There can be no assurance that a     
claim will not exceed the insurance coverage of a health care facility or that  
insurance coverage will be available to a facility.                             

Public Utility and Wholesale Electric Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be  
obligations of public utility issuers, including those selling wholesale and    
retail electric power and gas. General problems of such issuers would include   
the difficulty in financing large construction programs in an inflationary      
period, the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays            
attributable to environmental considerations, the difficulty of the capital     
market in absorbing utility debt, the difficulty in obtaining fuel at reasonable
prices and the effect of energy conservation. In addition, federal, state and   
municipal governmental authorities may from time to time review existing, and   
impose additional, regulations governing the licensing, construction and        
operation of nuclear power plants, which may adversely affect the ability of the
issuers of certain of the bonds to make payments of principal and/or interest on
such bonds.                                                                     

Water and Sewer Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers 
whose revenues are derived from the sale of water and/or sewerage services. Such
bonds are generally payable from user fees. The problems of such issuers include
the ability to obtain timely and adequate rate increases, population decline    
resulting in decreased user fees, the difficulty of financing large construction
programs, the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays          
attributable to environmental considerations, the increasing difficulty of      
obtaining or discovering new supplies of fresh water, the effect of conservation
programs and the impact of "no-growth" zoning ordinances.                       

Industrial Revenue Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be industrial revenue  
bonds ("IRBs"). IRBs have generally been issued under bond resolutions pursuant 
to which the revenues and receipts payable under the arrangements with the      
operator of a particular project have been assigned and pledged to purchasers.  
In some cases, a mortgage on the underlying project may have been granted as    
security for the IRBs. Regardless of the structure, payment of IRBs is solely   
dependent upon the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project or 
corporate guarantor. Corporate operators or guarantors may be affected by many  
factors which may have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the particular
company or industry. These include cyclicality of revenues and earnings,        
regulatory and environmental restrictions, litigation resulting from accidents  
or environmentally-caused illnesses, extensive competition and financial        
deterioration resulting from a corporate restructuring pursuant to a leveraged  
buy-out, takeover or otherwise. Such a restructuring may result in the operator 
of a project becoming highly leveraged which may impact on such operator's      
creditworthiness which in turn would have an adverse impact on the rating and/or
market value of such bonds. Further, the possibility of such a restructuring may
have an adverse impact on the market for and consequently the value of such     
bonds, even though no actual takeover or other action is ever contemplated or   
effected.                                                                       

Lease Obligation Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be obligations that are  
secured by lease payments of a governmental entity (hereinafter called "lease   
obligations"). Lease obligations are often in the form of certificates of       
participation. Although the lease obligations do not constitute general         
obligations of the municipality for which the municipality's taxing power is    
pledged, a lease obligation is ordinarily backed by the municipality's covenant 
to appropriate for and make the payments due under the lease obligation.        
However, certain lease obligations contain "nonappropriation" clauses which     
provide that the municipality has no obligation to make lease payments in future
years unless money is appropriated for such purpose on a yearly basis. A        
governmental entity that enters into such a lease agreement cannot obligate     
future governments to appropriate for and make lease payments but covenants to  
take such action as is necessary to include any lease payments due in its       
budgets and to make the appropriations therefore. A governmental entity's       
failure to appropriate for and to make payments under its lease obligation could
result in insufficient funds available for payment of the obligations secured   
thereby. Although "non-appropriation" lease obligations are secured by the      
leased property, disposition of the property in the event of foreclosure might  
prove difficult.                                                                

Higher Educations and Public Education Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be 
obligations of issuers which are, or which govern the operation of, schools,    
colleges and universities and whose revenues are derived mainly from ad valorem 
taxes or for higher education systems, from tuition, dormitory revenues, grants 
and endowments. General problems relating to school bonds include litigation    
contesting the state constitutionality of financing public education in part    
from ad valorem taxes, thereby creating a disparity in educational funds        
available to schools in wealthy areas and schools in poor areas. Litigation or  
legislation on this issue may affect the sources of funds available for the     
payment of school bonds in the Trusts. General problems relating to college and 
university obligations include the prospect of a declining percentage of the    
population consisting of "college" age individuals, possible inability to raise 
tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover increased operating costs, the          
availability and restrictions on the use of endowments and other funds, the     
uncertainty of continued receipt of federal grants and state funding, and       
government legislation or regulations which may adversely affect the revenues or
costs of such issuers.                                                          

Airport and Transportation Bonds. Certain of the bonds in certain of the  
Trusts may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived
from the ownership and operation of facilities such as airports, bridges,       
turnpikes, port authorities, convention centers and arenas. The major portion of
an airport's gross operating income is generally derived from fees received from
signatory airlines pursuant to use agreements which consist of annual payments  
for leases, occupancy of certain terminal space and service fees. Airport       
operating income may therefore be affected by the ability of the airlines to    
meet their obligations under the use agreements. From time to time the air      
transport industry has experienced significant variations in earnings and       
traffic, due to increased competition, excess capacity, increased costs,        
deregulation, traffic constraints, acts of terrorism and other factors, and     
several airlines have experienced severe financial difficulties. Similarly,     
payment on bonds related to other facilities is dependent on revenues from the  
projects, such as user fees from ports, tolls on turnpikes and bridges and rents
from buildings. Therefore, payment may be adversely affected by reduction in    
revenues due to such factors as increased cost of maintenance, decreased use of 
a facility, lower cost of alternative modes of transportation, scarcity of fuel 
and reduction or loss of rents.                                                 

Waste Disposal Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be obligations which are   
payable from and secured by revenues derived from the operation of resource     
recovery facilities. Resource recovery facilities are designed to process solid 
waste, generate steam and convert steam to electricity. Resource recovery bonds 
may be subject to extraordinary optional redemption at par upon the occurrence  
of certain circumstances, including but not limited to: destruction or          
condemnation of a project; contracts relating to a project becoming void,       
unenforceable or impossible to perform; changes in the economic availability of 
raw materials, operating supplies or facilities necessary for the operation of a
project or technological or other unavoidable changes adversely affecting the   
operation of a project; and administrative or judicial actions which render     
contracts relating to the projects void, unenforceable or impossible to perform 
or impose unreasonable burdens or excessive liabilities. The Sponsor cannot     
predict the causes or likelihood of the redemption of resource recovery bonds in
a Trust prior to the stated maturity of the bonds.                              

   Original Issue Discount Bonds. Certain of the bonds may have been acquired at
a market discount from par value at maturity. The coupon interest rates on      
discount bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in a Trust were    
lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of          
comparable rating and type. If such interest rates for newly issued comparable  
bonds increase, the market discount of previously issued bonds will become      
greater, and if such interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds decline,  
the market discount of previously issued bonds will be reduced, other things    
being equal. Investors should also note that the value of bonds purchased at a  
market discount will increase in value faster than bonds purchased at a market  
premium if interest rates decrease. Conversely, if interest rates increase, the 
value of bonds purchased at a market discount will decrease faster than bonds   
purchased at a market premium. In addition, if interest rates rise, the         
prepayment risk of higher yielding, premium Securities and the prepayment       
benefit for lower yielding, discount bonds will be reduced. A bond purchased at 
a market discount and held to maturity will have a larger portion of its total  
return in the form of taxable income and capital gain and less in the form of   
tax-exempt interest income than a comparable bond newly issued at current market
rates. See "Federal Tax Status" in Prospectus Part II. Market discount          
attributable to interest changes does not indicate a lack of market confidence  
in the issue.                                                                   

Zero Coupon Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be "zero coupon" bonds. Zero  
coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer receives only   
the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond and does not   
receive any periodic interest payments. The effect of owning deep discount bonds
which do not make current interest payments (such as the zero coupon bonds) is  
that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also, in   
effect, on all discount earned during the life of such obligation. This implicit
reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates the risk of being unable to
reinvest the income on such obligation at a rate as high as the implicit yield  
on the discount obligation, but at the same time eliminates the holder's ability
to reinvest at higher rates in the future. For this reason, zero coupon bonds   
are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of       
changing market interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which  
pay interest.                                                                   

  "When, as and if Issued" Bonds. Certain of the bonds may have been purchased
on a "when, as and if issued" or "delayed delivery" basis. The delivery of any  
such bonds may be delayed or may not occur. Interest on these bonds begins      
accruing to the benefit of Unitholders on their respective dates of delivery. To
the extent any bonds are actually delivered to a Trust after their respective   
expected dates of delivery, Unitholders who purchase their Units prior to the   
date such bonds are actually delivered to the Trustee would be required to      
adjust their tax basis in their Units for a portion of the interest accruing on 
such bonds during the interval between their purchase of Units and the actual   
delivery of such bonds. As a result of any such adjustment, the Estimated       
Current Returns during the first year would be slightly lower than those stated 
in the prospectus which would be the returns after the first year, assuming the 
portfolio of a Trust and estimated annual expenses other than that of the       
Trustee (which may be reduced in the first year only) do not vary from that set 
forth in Prospectus Part I. Unitholders will be "at risk" with respect to all   
bonds in the portfolios including "when, as and if issued" and "delayed         
delivery" bonds (i.e., may derive either gain or loss from fluctuations in the  
evaluation of such bonds) from the date they commit for Units.                  

  Redemption or Sale Prior to Maturity. Certain of the bonds may be subject to
redemption prior to their stated maturity date pursuant to sinking fund         
provisions, call provisions or extraordinary optional or mandatory redemption   
provisions or otherwise. A sinking fund is a reserve fund accumulated over a    
period of time for retirement of debt. A callable debt obligation is one which  
is subject to redemption or refunding prior to maturity at the option of the    
issuer. A refunding is a method by which a debt obligation is redeemed, at or   
before maturity, by the proceeds of a new debt obligation. In general, call     
provisions are more likely to be exercised when the offering side valuation is  
at a premium over par than when it is at a discount from par. The exercise of   
redemption or call provisions will (except to the extent the proceeds of the    
called bonds are used to pay for Unit redemptions) result in the distribution of
principal and may result in a reduction in the amount of subsequent interest    
distributions; it may also affect the current return on Units of the Trust      
involved. Each Trust portfolio contains a listing of the sinking fund and call  
provisions, if any, with respect to each of the debt obligations. Extraordinary 
optional redemptions and mandatory redemptions result from the happening of     
certain events. Generally, events that may permit the extraordinary optional    
redemption of bonds or may require the mandatory redemption of bonds include,   
among others: a final determination that the interest on the bonds is taxable;  
the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project  
for which the proceeds of the bonds were used; an exercise by a local, state or 
federal governmental unit of its power of eminent domain to take all or         
substantially all of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used; 
changes in the economic availability of raw materials, operating supplies or    
facilities or technological or other changes which render the operation of the  
project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used uneconomic; changes in law
or an administrative or judicial decree which renders the performance of the    
agreement under which the proceeds of the bonds were made available to finance  
the project impossible or which creates unreasonable burdens or which imposes   
excessive liabilities, such as taxes, not imposed on the date the bonds are     
issued on the issuer of the bonds or the user of the proceeds of the bonds; an  
administrative or judicial decree which requires the cessation of a substantial 
part of the operations of the project financed with the proceeds of the bonds;  
an overestimate of the costs of the project to be financed with the proceeds of 
the bonds resulting in excess proceeds of the bonds which may be applied to     
redeem bonds; or an underestimate of a source of funds securing the bonds       
resulting in excess funds which may be applied to redeem bonds. The issuer of   
certain bonds in a Trust may have sold or reserved the right to sell, upon the  
satisfaction of certain conditions, to third parties all or any portion of its  
rights to call bonds in accordance with the stated redemption provisions of such
bonds. In such a case the issuer no longer has the right to call the bonds for  
redemption unless it reacquires the rights from such third party. A third party 
pursuant to these rights may exercise the redemption provisions with respect to 
a bond at a time when the issuer of the bond might not have called a bond for   
redemption had it not sold such rights. The Sponsor is unable to predict all of 
the circumstances which may result in such redemption of an issue of bonds. See 
also the discussion of single family mortgage and multi-family revenue bonds    
above for more information on the call provisions of such bonds.                

To the best knowledge of the Sponsor, there is no litigation pending as of
the Date of Deposit in respect of any bonds which might reasonably be expected  
to have a material adverse effect upon any of the Trusts.                       

At any time after the Date of Deposit, litigation may be initiated on a   
variety of grounds with respect to bonds in a Trust. Such litigation, as, for   
example, suits challenging the issuance of pollution control revenue bonds under
environmental protection statutes, may affect the validity of such bonds or the 
tax-free nature of the interest thereon. While the outcome of litigation of such
nature can never be entirely predicted, each Trust has received or will receive 
opinions of bond counsel to the issuing authorities of each bond on the date of 
issuance to the effect that such bonds have been validly issued and that the    
interest thereon is exempt from federal income tax. In addition, other factors  
may arise from time to time which potentially may impair the ability of issuers 
to meet obligations undertaken with respect to the bonds.                       

Insurance on the Bonds in the Insured Trusts

  Insurance has been obtained by each Insured Trust, by the issuer of bonds in
certain Trusts, by a prior owner of such bonds, or by the Sponsor prior to the  
deposit of such bonds in a Trust guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and    
principal, when due, in respect of the bonds in such Trust. See "The
Trusts--Objectives and Bond Selection" in Prospectus Part II. The Portfolio     
Insurers, if any, and the Preinsured Bond Insurers are described under          
"Portfolio" and "Notes to Portfolio" in Prospectus Part I. The Portfolio        
Insurers, if any, are set forth in the prospectus. An insurance policy obtained 
by an Insured Trust, if any, is non-cancelable and will continue in force so    
long as such Trust is in existence, the respective Portfolio Insurer is still in
business and the bonds described in such policy continue to be held by such     
Trust (see "Portfolio" for the respective Insured Trust in Prospectus Part I).  
Any portfolio insurance premium for an Insured Trust, which is an obligation of 
such Trust, is paid by such Trust on a monthly basis. Non-payment of premiums on
a policy obtained by an Insured Trust will not result in the cancellation of    
insurance but will force the insurer to take action against the Trustee to      
recover premium payments due it. The Trustee in turn will be entitled to recover
such payments from such Trust. Premium rates for each issue of bonds protected  
by a policy obtained by an Insured Trust, if any, are fixed for the life of the 
Trust. The premium for any Preinsured Bond insurance has been paid by such      
issuer, by a prior owner of such bonds or the Sponsor and any such policy or    
policies are non-cancelable and will continue in force so long as the bonds so  
insured are outstanding and the respective Preinsured Bond Insurer remains in   
business. If the provider of an original issuance insurance policy is unable to 
meet its obligations under such policy or if the rating assigned to the         
claims-paying ability of any such insurer deteriorates, the Portfolio Insurers  
have no obligation to insure any issue adversely affected by either of the above
described events.                                                               

  The aforementioned portfolio insurance obtained by an Insured Trust, if any,
guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on the bonds when they  
fall due. For the purposes of insurance obtained by an Insured Trust, "when due"
generally means the stated payment or maturity date for the payment of principal
and interest. However, in the event (a) an issuer of a bond defaults in the     
payment of principal or interest on such bond, (b) such issuer enters into a    
bankruptcy proceeding or (c) the maturity of such bond is accelerated, the      
affected Portfolio Insurer has the option, in its sole discretion, after        
receiving notice of the earliest to occur of such a default, bankruptcy         
proceeding or acceleration to pay the outstanding principal amount of such bond 
plus accrued interest to the date of such payment and thereby retire the bond   
from the affected Trust prior to such bond's stated maturity date. The insurance
does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the Units.     
Insurance obtained by an Insured Trust, if any, is only effective as to bonds   
owned by and held in such Trust. In the event of a sale of any such bond by the 
Trustee, such insurance terminates as to such bond on the date of sale.         

   Pursuant to an irrevocable commitment of the Portfolio Insurers, the Trustee,
upon the sale of a bond covered under a portfolio insurance policy obtained by  
an Insured Trust, has the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to   
such bond (i.e., insurance to maturity of the bond regardless of the identity of
the holder thereof) (the "Permanent Insurance") upon the payment of a single    
predetermined insurance premium and any expenses related thereto from the       
proceeds of the sale of such bond. Accordingly, any bond in an Insured Trust is 
eligible to be sold on an insured basis. It is expected that the Trustee would  
exercise the right to obtain Permanent Insurance only if upon such exercise the 
affected Trust would receive net proceeds (sale of bond proceeds less the       
insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the Permanent Insurance) 
from such sale in excess of the sale proceeds if such bonds were sold on an     
uninsured basis. The insurance premium with respect to each bond eligible for   
Permanent Insurance would be determined based upon the insurability of each bond
as of the Date of Deposit and would not be increased or decreased for any change
in the creditworthiness of each bond.                                           

The Sponsor believes that the Permanent Insurance option provides an      
advantage to an Insured Trust in that each bond insured by a Trust insurance    
policy may be sold out of the affected Trust with the benefits of the insurance 
attaching thereto. Thus, the value of the insurance, if any, at the time of     
sale, can be realized in the market value of the bond so sold (which is not the 
case in connection with any value attributable to an Insured Trust's portfolio  
insurance). See "Public Offering--Offering Price" in Prospectus Part II. Because
any such insurance value may be realized in the market value of the bond upon   
the sale thereof upon exercise of the Permanent Insurance option, the Sponsor   
anticipates that (a) in the event an Insured Trust were to be comprised of a    
substantial percentage of bonds in default or significant risk of default, it is
much less likely that such Trust would need at some point in time to seek a     
suspension of redemptions of Units than if such Trust were to have no such      
option (see "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units" in Prospectus Part II) 
and (b) at the time of termination of an Insured Trust, if such Trust were      
holding defaulted bonds or bonds in significant risk of default such Trust would
not need to hold such Securities until their respective maturities in order to  
realize the benefits of such Trust's portfolio insurance (see "Trust            
Administration--Termination of Trust Agreement" in Prospectus Part II).         

Except as indicated below, insurance obtained by an Insured Trust has no  
effect on the price or redemption value of Units. It is the present intention of
the Evaluator to attribute a value for such insurance (including the right to   
obtain Permanent Insurance) for the purpose of computing the price or redemption
value of Units if the bonds covered by such insurance are in default in payment 
of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default. The value of   
the insurance will be the difference between (i) the market value of a bond     
which is in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk  
of such default assuming the exercise of the right to obtain Permanent Insurance
(less the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the purchase of
Permanent Insurance) and (ii) the market value of such bonds not covered by     
Permanent Insurance. See "Public Offering--Offering Price" in Prospectus Part   
II. It is also the present intention of the Trustee not to sell such bonds to   
effect redemptions or for any other reason but rather to retain them in the     
portfolio because value attributable to the insurance cannot be realized upon   
sale. See "Public Offering--Offering Price" in Prospectus Part II for a more    
complete description of an Insured Trust's method of valuing defaulted bonds and
bonds which have a significant risk of default. Insurance obtained by the issuer
of a bond is effective so long as such bond is outstanding. Therefore, any such 
insurance may be considered to represent an element of market value in regard to
the bonds thus insured, but the exact effect, if any, of this insurance on such 
market value cannot be predicted.                                               

 The portfolio insurance policy or policies obtained by an Insured Trust, if
any, with respect to the bonds in such Trust were issued by one or more of the  
Portfolio Insurers. Any other Preinsured Bond insurance policy (or commitment   
therefore) was issued by one of the Preinsured Bond Insurers. See "The
Trusts--Objectives and Bond Selection" in Prospectus Part II.                   

  ACA Financial Guaranty Corporation ("ACA Financial Guaranty"). ACA Financial
Guaranty is an insurance subsidiary of ACA Capital Holding, Inc. that is        
organized in the State of Maryland. ACA Financial Guaranty assumes credit risk  
through the issuance of financial guaranty insurance policies across all of its 
business lines. While ACA is subject to Standard & Poor's Rating Services       
("S&P") guidelines and capital adequacy tests which must be met in order to     
maintain a rating, as well as internal risk management parameters, its insured  
risk portfolio contains exposures of various credit qualities.                  

As of March 31, 2008, ACA Financial Guaranty had a CCC financial strength 
rating from S&P with a CreditWatch outlook. This rating is crucial to ongoing   
business strategy. This rating is subject to periodic review by S&P, and S&P may
revise or withdraw its rating at any time at its sole discretion. Such an action
may be based on factors which are entirely outside of the company's control,    
such as changes in the views or the policies of the rating agencies in relation 
to the financial guaranty industry, changes to the risk profile of ACA Financial
Guaranty's insurance portfolio or to other factors considered by S&P in         
providing such rating, or adverse developments in general economic conditions or
the financial condition or results of operations of ACA Financial Guaranty. In  
addition, the financial strength rating of financial guaranty companies is based
in part on the maintenance of specified amounts of resources available to pay   
claims.                                                                         

As of December 31, 2006, ACA Financial Guaranty noted that it had met its 
capital requirement with statutory capital of $387.1 million, and further noted 
that S&P had rated the company as A-rated. At the time, the company recognized  
that any change in applicable capital requirements or the incurrence of losses  
in excess of expectations could diminish capital below required rating agency   
levels. For instance, in 2004, the company had to raise capital in response to  
an increase in S&P capital requirements. It may be difficult or costly to raise 
the additional capital necessary to satisfy the rating agency levels in the     
future. The company currently intends to operate the business in a manner that  
maintains an "A" rating, but is under no obligation to do so, is not currently  
able to do so, and may not be able to do so going forward. An S&P downgrade of  
the financial strength rating, and/or placement of the company on its           
CreditWatch negative list or a change in its outlook to negative, could cause   
the reputation and financial performance in the structured credit and public    
finance industries to be materially adversely affected, which in turn could     
materially adversely impact financial performance. In addition, under the terms 
of a credit agreement, to the extent the company had outstanding borrowings     
under this facility, these borrowings would become due immediately, and would be
unable to make future borrowings, when the financial strength rating falls below
"A-."

   Ambac Assurance Corporation ("Ambac Assurance"). Ambac Financial Group, Inc.,
headquartered in New York City, is a holding company incorporated on April 29,  
1991. Ambac's activities are divided into two business segments: (i) Financial  
Guarantee and (ii) Financial Services. Ambac provides financial guarantee       
insurance for public and structured finance obligations through its principal   
operating subsidiary, Ambac Assurance Corporation. Ambac Assurance is the       
successor to the founding financial guarantee insurance company, which wrote the
first bond insurance policy in 1971. As a holding company, Ambac is largely     
dependent on dividends from Ambac Assurance to pay dividends on its common      
stock, to pay principal and interest on its indebtedness and to pay its         
operating expenses.                                                             

As of June 19, 2008, Ambac Assurance has financial strength ratings of Aa3
from Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") and AA from S&P. These ratings 
are an essential part of Ambac Assurance's ability to provide credit enhancement
and are essential to Ambac Assurance's ability to compete in the financial      
guarantee business. Considering the high levels of delinquencies and defaults   
within residential mortgage loans, each of these rating agencies began a review 
of the capital adequacy of the financial guarantee industry in the fall of 2007.
In late December 2007, following the rating agency reviews, Ambac Assurance's   
triple-A rating was affirmed by both S&P (with "negative outlook") and Moody's; 
however, Fitch Ratings, Inc. ("Fitch") placed Ambac's triple-A rating on "rating
watch negative" and stated that Ambac Assurance had a modeled $1 billion capital
shortfall. On January 16, 2008, Moody's put Ambac Assurance's triple-A rating on
review for possible downgrade. On January 18, 2008, S&P placed Ambac Assurance's
triple-A financial strength rating on Credit Watch Negative. On January 18,
2008, Fitch downgraded Ambac Assurance's insurance financial strength rating to 
double-A ("rating watch negative"). On February 25, 2008, S&P reaffirmed Ambac  
Assurance's triple-A rating, but kept it on Credit Watch Negative. On February
29, 2008, Moody's publicly announced that it is continuing a review for possible
downgrade that was initiated on January 16, 2008. On June 4, 2008, Moody's      
placed its Aaa rating of Ambac Assurance's insurance financial strength on      
review for possible downgrade. On June 5, 2008, S&P downgraded Ambac Assurance's
insurance financial strength rating to AA from AAA, and placed the rating on    
CreditWatch with negative implications. On June 19, 2008, Moody's downgraded    
Ambac Assurance's insurance financial strength rating from Aaa to Aa3, with a   
negative outlook. Moody's June 19, 2008, downgrade of Ambac Assurance's         
insurance financial strength rating reflects Ambac Assurance's overall credit   
profile in the current environment, including its significantly constrained new 
business prospects, its impaired financial flexibility and increased expected   
and stress loss projections among its mortgage-related risk exposures relative  
to previous estimates. Moody's noted, however, that these risks are mitigated   
somewhat by Ambac Assurance's substantive capital cushion at the current rating 
level and that this was an important consideration in arriving at the Aa3       
insurance financial strength rating.                                            

There have been a number of recent developments with respect to ratings   
actions by the rating agencies. In light of the ongoing nature of ratings       
actions or announcements by the rating agencies, one should consult             
announcements by the rating agencies, the websites of the rating agencies and   
Ambac's website for the then current publicly available information. These      
ratings actions have had a significant impact on Ambac Assurance's ability to   
compete in the financial guarantee business. As a result of the rating agency   
actions described above, as well as significant disruption in the capital       
markets and investor concern with respect to our financial position, Ambac has  
been able to write only a limited amount of new financial guarantee business    
since November 2007.                                                            

   Ambac Assurance is subject to insurance regulatory requirements of the States
of Wisconsin and New York, and the other jurisdictions in which it is licensed  
to conduct business. Statutory capital and surplus was $3,316,143 and $3,696,876
at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Qualified statutory capital was    
$6,422,486 and 6,382,490 at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Statutory 
net income for Ambac Assurance was $53,964, $788,989 and $707,402 for 2007, 2006
and 2005, respectively. Statutory capital and surplus differs from stockholders'
equity determined under GAAP principally due to statutory accounting rules that 
treat loss reserves, premiums earned, policy acquisition costs and deferred     
income taxes differently.

 Assured Guaranty Corp. ("Assured Guaranty"). Assured Guaranty, an insurance
subsidiary of Assured Guaranty Ltd., is organized in the State of Maryland.     
Assured Guaranty is a financial guaranty insurance company licensed in all 50   
states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, focused on providing triple-A 
rated credit enhancement to the mortgage- and asset-backed securities, public   
finance, structured finance and structured credit markets.                      

   On June 18, 2008, S&P affirmed its AAA rating of Assured Guaranty's insurance
financial strength, with a stable outlook. This rating is crucial to ongoing    
business strategy. This rating is subject to periodic review by S&P, and S&P may
revise or withdraw its rating at any time at its sole discretion. Such an action
may be based on factors which are entirely outside of the company's control,    
such as changes in the views or the policies of the rating agencies in relation 
to the financial guaranty industry, changes to the risk profile of Assured      
Guaranty's insurance portfolio or to other factors considered by S&P in         
providing such rating, or adverse developments in general economic conditions or
the financial condition or results of operations of Assured Guaranty. In        
addition, the financial strength rating of financial guaranty companies is based
in part on the maintenance of specified amounts of resources available to pay   
claims.                                                                         

On March 14, 2008, Moody's affirmed its Aaa rating of Assured Guaranty's  
insurance financial strength, with a stable outlook. Moody's noted that this    
rating reflects Moody's assessment of the capital adequacy and strengthened     
market position of Assured Guaranty. On July 21, 2008, Moody's placed the Aaa   
insurance financial strength ratings of Assured Guaranty and its affiliates on  
review for possible downgrade.                                                  

 As of December 31, 2007, Assured Guaranty was in compliance with applicable
financial covenants requiring the insurer to maintain qualified statutory       
capital of at least 75% of its statutory capital as of its fiscal quarter prior 
to November 6, 2006. Net statutory income for Assured Guaranty was $71.6 million
in 2007, up from $64.3 million in 2006, mostly due to a larger investment       
portfolio and a loss recovery of $14.5 million. In view of Assured Guaranty's   
expansion, underwriting expenses increased 15.2% from 2006, to $84.8 million.   
Net premiums earned were $107.1 million, which were basically flat with 2006.   
Financial leverage at the holding company is modest, with debt to capital of    
9.8% as of December 31, 2007. Operating return on average equity for Assured    
Guaranty Ltd. was 9.8%. Statutory investment income rose to $57.9 million from  
$53.1 million in 2006. Cash and invested assets at December 31, 2007, rose to   
$1.3 billion, from $1.2 billion at December 31, 2006. A 26.5% growth in the     
unearned premium reserve to $302.3 million contributed to this gain.

  Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Corp ("BHAC"). BHAC is a bond insurance company
created by Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. ("Berkshire") in December 2007, to insure   
municipal and state bonds initially in New York, and later in states including  
California, Texas, Illinois, Florida and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. On    
February 12, 2008, CEO Warren Buffett announced a plan to add up to $5 billion  
in capital to BHAC to enable it to provide reinsurance on municipal bonds       
currently guaranteed by other bond insurance companies.                         

Berkshire is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of 
diverse business activities. The most important of these are insurance          
businesses conducted on both a primary basis and a reinsurance basis. Berkshire 
also owns and operates a large number of other businesses engaged in a variety  
of activities, as identified herein. Berkshire is domiciled in the State of     
Delaware, and its corporate headquarters is located in Omaha, Nebraska.         

Berkshire's insurance companies maintain capital strength at exceptionally
high levels. This strength differentiates Berkshire's insurance companies from  
their competitors. Collectively, the aggregate statutory surplus of Berkshire's 
U.S. based insurers was approximately $62 billion at December 31, 2007. On April
11, 2008, S&P assigned an initial rating of AAA to BHAC's insurance financial   
strength, with a stable outlook. On April 25, 2008, Moody's assigned an initial 
rating of Aaa to BHAC's insurance financial strength, with a stable outlook.    

   As of December 31, 2007, Berkshire had total assets of $273 billion and total
liabilities of $150 billion. The information relating to BHAC and its affiliates
contained above has been furnished by BHAC or the rating agencies. No           
representation is made herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such            
information, or as to the existence of any adverse changes in such information  
subsequent to the date hereof.                                                  

CIFG Assurance North America, Inc. ("CIFG"). CIFG, through its operating  
companies CIFG Assurance North America, Inc., a New York corporation, and CIFG  
Europe, provides financial guarantees for transactions in the public finance,   
structured finance, and infrastructure finance markets in the United States,    
Europe and around the world. Founded as CDC IXIS Financial Guaranty in 2002, the
company changed its name to CIFG in 2003.                                       

   On March 6, 2008, Moody's downgraded to A1, from Aaa, the insurance financial
strength ratings of CIFG. These rating actions reflect Moody's assessment of    
CIFG's weakened capitalization, impaired business opportunities, and uncertain  
strategic direction, as a result, in part, of its exposures to the US           
residential mortgage market. The rating outlook is stable. Moody's believes that
CIFG's significant exposure to the mortgage sector, especially ABS CDOs is      
indicative of a risk posture far greater than would be consistent with a Aaa    
rating going forward. The company's participation in several mezzanine ABS CDOs,
in particular, contributed to this view. The rating agency noted that CIFG is   
implementing significant changes to its governance and risk management to       
address some of the shortcomings of its prior strategy. Moody's added that CIFG,
as the smallest and most recent entrant to the financial guaranty sector, has   
not yet established a market position on par with its larger competitors and    
that the ongoing credit stress at the firm significantly weakened its franchise,
raising questions about the degree to which it will be able to regain market    
traction within a reasonable timeframe. CIFG's profitability is likely to remain
weak over the near to intermediate term, particularly given the losses that are 
likely to be generated by its insurance portfolio, the expected reduced issuance
volume, and the limited in-force book of business, said Moody's.                

 On June 6, 2008, S&P lowered its financial strength, financial enhancement,
and issuer credit ratings on CIFG to `A-' from `A+'. The outlooks remain        
negative, reflecting reservations regarding the company's ability to maintain   
its position as a viable competitor in the bond insurance industry, given its   
current staffing levels and its below average earnings and return on earnings.  

On March 31, 2008, Fitch downgraded its ratings of CIFG to `A-' from `AA-'
and removed CIFG from rating watch negative, where it was originally placed on  
Feb. 5, 2008. The rating outlook is negative. Fitch believes that it will be    
very difficult to stabilize the ratings of CIFG until the company can more      
effectively limit the downside risk from its SF CDOs through reinsurance or     
other risk mitigation initiatives. Fitch does not anticipate removing the       
negative rating outlook over the near- to intermediate-term until the ultimate  
risk of loss on the SF CDO portfolio can be more definitively quantified.       

As of December 31, 2007, CIFG had admitted assets of $238 million, total  
liabilities of $205 million, and total surplus as regards policyholders of $66  
million.                                                                        

  The information relating to CIFG and its affiliates contained above has been
furnished by CIFG or the rating agencies. No representation is made herein as to
the accuracy or adequacy of such information, or as to the existence of any     
adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date hereof.              

Financial Guaranty Insurance Company ("FGIC"). FGIC is a wholly owned     
subsidiary of FGIC Corporation. The company provides financial guaranty         
insurance and other forms of credit enhancement for public finance and          
structured finance obligations. FGIC typically guarantees the scheduled payments
of principal and interest on an issuer's obligations when due. FGIC is licensed 
to write financial guaranty insurance in all 50 states, the District of         
Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and, through
a branch, the United Kingdom.                                                   

The recent deterioration in the U.S. housing and mortgage markets and the 
global credit markets, which accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2007, has     
adversely affected the company's business, results of operations and financial  
condition. The company's financial strength and credit ratings were recently    
downgraded by various rating agencies. For the fourth quarter of 2007           
significant loss reserves were established for the exposure to certain          
collateralized debt obligations of asset-backed securities, which are backed    
primarily by subprime residential mortgage-backed securities, and to certain    
residential mortgage-backed securities, primarily backed by second-lien         
mortgages. As a result of these developments, the company has ceased writing new
business for a period of time to preserve capital and is considering various    
alternatives to enhance its capital, restructure its operations and mitigate    
losses. However, no assurance can be given that any action taken by the company 
will improve its current ratings, that further rating downgrades will not occur,
or that the company will be able to recommence writing new business in the near 
term or at all.                                                                 

Prior to the fourth quarter of 2007, FGIC's financial strength was rated  
"Aaa" by Moody's "AAA" by S&P, and "AAA" by Fitch. Moody's, S&P and Fitch have  
since completed several assessments of FGIC's capital adequacy in relation to   
the Company's exposure to ABS CDOs which are backed primarily by subprime RMBS, 
and its exposure to first-lien and second-lien RMBS. As a result of these       
assessments, Moody's, S&P and Fitch downgraded the financial strength ratings of
FGIC. As of March 31, 2008, Fitch had downgraded FGIC from AA to BBB (rating    
watch negative); Moody's had downgraded FGIC from A3 to Baa3 and the Company    
remains on review for possible downgrade; and S&P had downgraded FGIC from A to 
BB and the Company remains on CreditWatch with negative implications. On June
20, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of FGIC    
from Baa3 to B1, reflecting FGIC's severely impaired financial flexibility and  
proximity to minimum regulatory capital requirements relative to Moody's        
estimates of expected case losses. The financial strength ratings downgrades    
have adversely impacted the Company's ability to generate new business and,     
unless restored, will impact the Company's future business, operations and      
financial results.                                                              

 As of December 31, 2007, FGIC had net admitted assets of approximately $6.3
billion, total liabilities of approximately $5.5 billion. Statutory-basis       
surplus of FGIC at December 31, 2007 was $260,909. Copies of FGIC's most recent 
generally accepted accounting principles and statutory accounting practices

Financial Security Assurance, Inc. ("FSA"). Financial Security Assurance  
Holdings Ltd., through its insurance company subsidiaries, is primarily engaged 
in the business of providing financial guaranty insurance on public finance and 
asset-backed obligations in domestic and international markets. The company's   
principal insurance company subsidiary is Financial Security Assurance Inc., a  
wholly owned New York insurance company. FSA wholly owns FSA Insurance Company  
("FSAIC"). FSAIC is an Oklahoma insurance company that primarily provides       
reinsurance to FSA. FSA is a subsidiary of Dexia Holdings, Inc. ("Dexia"),      
which, in turn, is owned 90% by Dexia Credit Local S.A. and 10% by Dexia S.A.   
Dexia is a Belgian corporation whose shares are traded on the Euronext Brussels 
and Euronext Paris markets as well as on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Dexia is
primarily engaged in the business of public finance, banking and investment     
management in France, Belgium, Luxembourg and other European countries, as well 
as in the United States. Dexia Credit Local is a wholly owned subsidiary of     
Dexia.                                                                          

  FSA's financial statements have been materially adversely impacted by `'mark
to market" adjustments that reflect the current market dislocation rather than  
management's expectation of credit losses or asset impairment. Downgrades of    
FSA's Triple-A financial strength ratings could have a material adverse effect  
on its long-term competitive position and prospects for future business         
opportunities as well as its results of operations and financial condition. If  
FSA were downgraded, the Company might be required to post incremental          
collateral to its investment agreement and derivative counterparties,           
introducing liquidity risk. In such event, the Company would be required to     
raise cash to fund such withdrawals by selling assets, in some cases realizing  
substantial market value loss, or to borrow against the value of such assets.   

  As of March 31, 2008, all three rating agencies have affirmed FSA's Triple-A
rating with a stable outlook. S&P, Moody's and Fitch periodically make an       
assessment of FSA, which may include an assessment of the credits insured by FSA
and of the reinsurers and other providers of capital support to FSA, to confirm 
that FSA continues to satisfy the rating agencies' capital adequacy criteria    
necessary to maintain FSA's Triple-A ratings. Rating agency capital models, the 
assumptions used in the models and the components of the capital adequacy       
calculations, including ratings and, in the case of S&P, capital charges, are   
subject to change by the rating agencies at any time. Any of Fitch, Moody's or  
S&P may conclude that FSA will need to raise additional capital or take other   
measures to maintain its Triple-A ratings, regardless of whether losses actually
occur. As a result, the Company may be required to take measures to preserve or 
raise capital, including through, among other things, increased use of          
reinsurance, capital contributions from Dexia or the issuance of debt           
securities. Management believes that, subject to market conditions, FSA has the 
ability to take the measures necessary to maintain its Triple-A ratings, but    
there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so, as requirements imposed
by the rating agencies are outside the control of the Company. On July 21, 2008,
Moody's placed the Aaa insurance financial strength ratings of FSA and its      
affiliated insurance operating companies on review for possible downgrade.      

As of December 31, 2007, FSA had consolidated shareholder equity of $1.6  
billion, and total claims paying resources of $6.7 billion.

MBIA Insurance Corporation ("MBIA"). MBIA is the principal operating      
subsidiary of MBIA, Inc., a Connecticut corporation. MBIA Corp. is the successor
to the business of the Municipal Bond Insurance Association, which began writing
financial guarantees for municipal bonds in 1974. MBIA Corp. is the parent of   
MBIA Insurance Corp. of Illinois ("MBIA Illinois") and Capital Markets Assurance
Corporation ("CapMAC"), both financial guarantee insurance companies that were  
acquired by MBIA Corp. At present, no new financial guarantee insurance is being
offered by MBIA Illinois or CapMAC, but it is possible that either of those     
entities may insure transactions in the future.                                 

On January 17, 2008, Moody's placed the Aaa insurance financial strength  
ratings of MBIA Corp. and its insurance affiliates on watch list negative. On   
January 31, 2008, S&P placed the AAA insurance financial strength ratings of    
MBIA Corp. and its insurance affiliates on CreditWatch negative. On February 5,
2008, Fitch placed the AAA insurer financial strength ratings of MBIA Corp. and 
its insurance affiliates on rating watch negative. On February 25, 2008, S&P    
affirmed the AAA insurance financial strength ratings of MBIA Corp. and its     
insurance affiliates, the AA- rating of MBIA Inc.'s senior debt and the AA      
ratings of MBIA Corp.'s North Castle Custodial Trusts I-VIII, with a negative   
outlook. On February 26, 2008, Moody's affirmed the Aaa insurance financial     
strength ratings of MBIA Corp. and its insurance affiliates, the Aa2 ratings of 
MBIA Corp.'s Surplus Notes and the Aa3 ratings of the junior obligations of MBIA
Corp. and the senior debt of MBIA Inc., with a negative rating outlook. On June
4, 2008, Moody's placed its Aaa rating of MBIA's insurance financial strength on
review for possible downgrade. On June 5, 2008, S&P downgraded MBIA's insurance 
financial strength rating to AA from AAA, and placed the rating on CreditWatch  
with negative implications. On June 19, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance  
financial strength ratings of MBIA and its insurance affiliates from Aaa to A2. 
In the same rating action, Moody's also downgraded MBIA Corp.'s Surplus Notes   
from Aa2 to Baa1, and MBIA Inc.'s senior debt rating from Aa3 to Baa2. Moody's  
June 19, 2008, downgrade of MBIA and its insurance affiliates reflects MBIA's   
limited financial flexibility and impaired franchise, as well as the substantial
risk within its portfolio of insured exposures and a movement toward more       
aggressive capital management within the group. MBIA Corp.'s ability to attract 
new business and to compete with other financial guarantors has been adversely  
affected by these rating agency actions. MBIA Corp's ability to attract new     
business and to compete with other triple-A rated financial guarantors and its  
results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely     
affected by any actual reduction, or additional suggested possibility of a      
reduction, in its ratings.                                                      

On February 25, 2008, the MBIA, Inc. announced a plan to implement several
initiatives in connection with the restructuring of MBIA's business over the    
next few years. A significant aspect of the plan will be the creation of        
separate legal operating entities for MBIA's public, structured and asset       
management businesses. This is intended to be accomplished as soon as feasible, 
with a goal of within five years. The objective behind this initiative is to    
retain the highest ratings possible for both the public finance and structured  
finance businesses. The implementation of this initiative is subject to various 
contingencies, including regulatory approval. There are also a number of other  
initiatives that are effective immediately, including: (i) the suspension of    
writing new structured finance business for an estimated six month period in    
order to both increase capital safety margins and to evaluate and revise the    
credit and risk management criteria and policies; (ii) the ceasing of issuing   
insurance policies for new credit derivative transactions except in transactions
related to the reduction of existing derivative exposure; and (iii) the         
elimination of the current MBIA dividend to provide an additional $174 million  
of capital flexibility per year. In addition, MBIA, Inc. will now declare       
dividends on an annual basis rather than a quarterly basis.                     

Virtually all of the insurance policies issued by MBIA Corp. provide an   
unconditional and irrevocable guarantee of the payment to a designated paying   
agent for the holders of the insured obligations of an amount equal to the      
payment of the principal of, and interest or other amounts owing on, insured    
obligations when due or, in the event that the MBIA Corp. has the right, at its 
discretion, to accelerate insured obligations upon default or otherwise, upon   
such acceleration by MBIA Corp. In addition, certain of MBIA Corp.'s insurance  
policies guarantee payments due under credit or other derivatives, including    
termination payments that may become due upon the occurrence of certain events. 
On February 25, 2008, MBIA Corp. announced that it ceased insuring new credit   
derivative contracts within its insurance operations except in transactions     
related to the reduction of existing derivative exposure. In the event of a     
default in payment of principal, interest or other insured amounts by an issuer,
MBIA Corp. promises to make funds available in the insured amount generally on  
the next business day following notification. MBIA Corp. generally has an       
agreement with a bank which provides for this payment upon receipt of proof of  
ownership of the obligations due, as well as upon receipt of instruments        
appointing the insurer as agent for the holders and evidencing the assignment of
the rights of the holders with respect to the payments made by the insurer.     

Because MBIA Corp. generally guarantees to the holder of the underlying   
obligation the timely payment of amounts due on such obligation in accordance   
with its original payment schedule, in the case of a default on an insured      
obligation, payments under the insurance policy cannot be accelerated against   
MBIA Corp., except in certain limited circumstances, unless MBIA Corp. consents 
to the acceleration. In the event of a default, however, MBIA Corp. may have the
right, in its sole discretion, to accelerate the obligations and pay them in    
full. Otherwise, MBIA Corp. is required to pay principal, interest or other     
amounts only as originally scheduled payments come due. Typically, even if the  
holders are permitted by the terms of the insured obligations to have the full  
amount of principal, accrued interest or other amounts due, declared due and    
payable immediately in the event of a default, MBIA Corp. is required to pay    
only the amounts scheduled to be paid, but not in fact paid, on each originally 
scheduled payment date. MBIA Corp.'s payment obligations after a default vary by
deal and by insurance type. There are three primary types of policy payment     
requirements: i) timely interest and ultimate principal; ii) ultimate principal 
only at final maturity; and iii) payments upon settlement of individual         
collateral losses as they occur upon erosion of deal deductibles.               

  At December 31, 2007, the net par amount outstanding on MBIA Corp.'s insured
obligations (including insured obligations of MBIA Illinois, MBIA UK, MBIA      
Mexico and CapMAC, but excluding $25.5 billion of MBIA insured investment       
agreements and MTNs for MBIA Asset Management) was $678.7 billion. Net insurance
in force, which includes all insured debt service, at December 31, 2007 was     
$1,022 billion. Net insurance in force, which is net of cessions to reinsurers, 
is also net of other reimbursement agreements that relate to certain contracts  
under which MBIA Corp. is entitled to reimbursement of losses on its insured    
portfolio but which do not qualify as reinsurance under accounting principles   
generally accepted in the United States of America.                             

As of December 31, 2007, MBIA, Inc. had admitted assets of $47 billion    
(unaudited), total liabilities of $43 billion (unaudited), and total capital and
surplus of $3.6 billion (unaudited), determined in accordance with statutory    
accounting practices prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory            
authorities.                                                                    

  The information relating to MBIA and its affiliates contained above has been

the accuracy or adequacy of such information, or as to the existence of any     
adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date hereof.              

   Radian Asset Assurance, Inc. ("Radian"). Radian Group Inc. is a global credit
risk management company headquartered in Philadelphia with significant          
operations in New York and London. Financial guaranty insurance typically       
provides an unconditional and irrevocable guaranty to the holder of a financial 
obligation of full and timely payment of principal and interest when due.       

Radian Group currently has been assigned a senior debt rating of A-       
(CreditWatch with negative implications) by S&P and Aa3 (stable) by Moody's. On 
May 2, 2008, Fitch withdrew its rating of A+. On February 26, 2008, S&P         
downgraded Radian Insurance to A- from AA-. Radian Insurance remains on         
CreditWatch with negative implications. The rating change was based on the fact 
that Radian Insurance is no longer considered by S&P to be a strategic entity to
Radian mainly because of the decision in 2007 to discontinue writing insurance  
on NIMS and second-liens. Radian Insurance had eight active international       
transactions at the time of the S&P downgrade. Of these transactions, five have 
early termination clauses that were triggered as a result of the downgrade which
allow counterparties to terminate these transactions. On March 4, 2008, Standard
Chartered Bank in Hong Kong informed Radian that they wished to terminate their 
contract with Radian Insurance, effective immediately. There is a possibility   
that Radian Insurance could be required to return to Standard Chartered Bank, or
to transfer to another insurer, unearned premium related to this transaction.   
Unless extended, this transaction was expected to expire at the end of 2009. On 
January 31, 2008, Moody's announced that the ratings of the mortgage insurance  
subsidiaries would remain on review for possible downgrade while it evaluated   
the capital adequacy of all mortgage insurers. On February 25, 2008, Fitch      
affirmed the AA- financial strength ratings of Radian Guaranty and its          
operational affiliates and the A- long-term issuer ratings of Radian Group, but 
placed these ratings on rating watch negative as compared to the previous status
of negative outlook. Fitch cited growing losses and a potential capital         
shortfall, which, if not addressed within the next several months, could result 
in a one notch downgrade.                                                       

As of December 31, 2007, Radian had total assets of $8.2 billion, total   
liabilities of $5.5 billion, and had statutory policyholders' surplus of $1.1   
billion and a contingency reserve of $433.3 million.                            

The information relating to Radian and its affiliates contained above has 
been furnished by Radian or the rating agencies. No representation is made      
herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information, or as to the         
existence of any adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date     
hereof.                                                                         

XL Capital Assurance Inc. ("XLCA"). XL Capital Ltd ("XL Capital") was     
incorporated with limited liability under the Cayman Islands Companies Act on   
March 16, 1998. To better align XL Capital's operating and reporting structure  
with its current strategy, it revised its segment structure during the second   
quarter of 2007. Depending on the nature of the business written, the following 
product lines or transactions previously managed by and reported as part of the 
Financial Lines segment are now managed as part of the Insurance and Reinsurance
segments and reported therewith: (i) structured indemnity products managed      
through XL Capital's financial solutions operations ("XLFS"), (ii) political    
risk products, (iii) weather and energy management products, and (iv) legacy    
financial guarantee business. Given the changes in XL Capital's operating and   
reporting structure as described above, it is organized into four operating     
segments: Insurance, Reinsurance, Life Operations, and Other Financial Lines -- 
in addition to a corporate segment that includes the general investment and     
financing operations of XL Capital.                                             

  XL Capital's ability to underwrite business is dependent upon the quality of
its claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent    
rating agencies. In January 2008, A.M. Best Company, Inc. ("A.M. Best") revised 
the financial strength rating of XL Capital's leading property and casualty     
operating subsidiaries to "A" from "A+" and affirmed them with a `stable'       
outlook. The downgrade by A.M. Best was primarily due to their concerns         
regarding XL Capital's historic earnings volatility. As of February 27, 2008,   
A.M. Best gave XL Capital a rating of A with stable outlook. In March 2008,     
Fitch revised the financial strength rating of XL Capital's leading property and
casualty operating subsidiaries to "BB" from "A" and affirmed them with a       
`stable' outlook. In February 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial  
strength ratings of XL Capital's leading property and casualty operating        
companies to "Aaa3" from "A3". In December 2007, S&P, affirmed XL Capital's     
leading property and casualty operating companies' financial strength ratings at
"A+" with a `stable' outlook. As of mid-June 2008, S&P maintained a BBB- rating 
on XL Capital's financial strength rating. On June 20, 2008, Moody's downgraded 
the insurance financial strength rating of XLCA from A3 to B2, reflecting XLCA's
severely impaired financial flexibility and proximity to minimum regulatory     
capital requirements relative to Moody's estimates of expected case losses.     

   As XLCA's ability to underwrite business is dependent upon the quality of its
claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by these independent  
rating agencies, a further downgrade by any of these institutions could cause   
its competitive position in the insurance and reinsurance industry to suffer and
make it more difficult for XLCA to market its products. A downgrade could also  
result in a substantial loss of business for XLCA as ceding companies and       
brokers that place such business may move to other insurers and reinsurers with 
higher ratings. A downgrade of the A.M. Best financial strength rating of XL    
Capital Ltd, XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd or XL Re Ltd below "A-," which is       
currently two notches below XL Capital's current A.M. Best rating of "A" ("A+"  
as at December 31, 2007), would constitute an event of default under XLCA's     
letter of credit and revolving credit facilities. As well, similar downgrades by
A.M. Best or S&P have the ability to trigger cancellation provisions in the     
majority of assumed reinsurance contracts.                                      

  The majority of XLCA's assumed reinsurance contracts contain provisions that
would allow its clients to cancel the contract in the event of a downgrade in   
its ratings below specified levels by one or more rating agencies. Based on     
premium value, approximately 60% of XLCA's reinsurance contracts that incepted  
at January 1, 2007, contained provisions allowing clients additional rights upon
a decline in XL Capital's ratings. Typically, the cancellation provisions in    
XLCA's assumed reinsurance contracts would be triggered if S&P or A.M. Best were
to downgrade XL Capital's financial strength ratings below "A-," which is       
currently three levels below its current S&P rating of "A+" and two levels below
its current A.M. Best rating of "A." Whether a client would exercise its        
cancellation rights after such a downgrade would likely depend, among other     
things, on the reasons for the downgrade, the extent of the downgrade, the      
prevailing market conditions, the degree of unexpired coverage, and the pricing 
and availability of replacement reinsurance coverage. In the event of such a    
downgrade, XLCA cannot predict whether or how many of XLCA's clients would      
actually exercise such cancellation rights or the extent to which any such      
cancellations would have a material adverse effect on XLCA's financial condition
or future prospects.                                                            

As of December 31, 2007, XLCA had total assets of $58 billion, total      
liabilities of $48 billion, and had statutory policyholders' surplus of $12.7   
billion.

  The information relating to XLCA and its affiliates contained above has been

The extent of state insurance regulation and supervision varies by        
jurisdiction, but New York and most other jurisdictions have laws and           
regulations prescribing permitted investments and governing the payment of      
dividends, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, acquisitions  
or sales of assets and incurrence of liabilities for borrowings.                

In order to be in an Insured Trust, bonds must be insured by one of the   
Preinsured Bond Insurers or be eligible for the insurance being obtained by such
Trust. In determining eligibility for insurance, the Preinsured Bond Insurers   
and the Portfolio Insurers, if any, have applied their own standards which      
correspond generally to the standards they normally use in establishing the     
insurability of new issues of municipal bonds and which are not necessarily the 
criteria used in the selection of bonds by the Sponsor. To the extent the       
standards of the Preinsured Bond Insurers and the Portfolio Insurers are more   
restrictive than those of the Sponsor, the previously stated Trust investment   
criteria have been limited with respect to the bonds. This decision is made     
prior to the Date of Deposit, as debt obligations not eligible for insurance are
not deposited in an Insured Trust. Thus, all of the bonds in the portfolios of  
the Insured Trusts are insured either by the respective Trust or by the issuer  
of the bonds, by a prior owner of such bonds or by the Sponsor prior to the     
deposit of such bonds in a Trust.                                               

  An objective of portfolio insurance obtained by an Insured Trust, if any, is
to obtain a higher yield on the portfolio of such Trust than would be available 
if all the bonds in such portfolio had an S&P "AAA" rating and yet at the same  
time to have the protection of insurance of prompt payment of interest and      
principal, when due, on the bonds. There is, of course, no certainty that this  
result will be achieved. Preinsured Bonds in an Insured Trust (all of which are 
rated "AAA" by S&P) may or may not have a higher yield than uninsured bonds     
rated "AAA" by S&P. In selecting such bonds for an Insured Trust, the Sponsor   
has applied the criteria hereinbefore described.                                

  In the event of nonpayment of interest or principal, when due, in respect of
a bond, a Portfolio Insurer shall make such payment after the respective insurer
has been notified that such nonpayment has occurred or is threatened (but not   
earlier than the date such payment is due). The insurer, as regards any payment 
it may make, will succeed to the rights of the Trustee in respect thereof. All  
policies issued by the Portfolio Insurers and the Preinsured Bond Insurers, if  
any, are substantially identical insofar as obligations to an Insured Trust are 
concerned.                                                                      

   The Internal Revenue Service has issued a letter ruling which holds in effect
that insurance proceeds representing maturing interest on defaulted municipal   
obligations paid to holders of insured bonds, under policy provisions           
substantially identical to the policies described herein, will be excludable    
from federal gross income under Section 103(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code  
to the same extent as if such payments were made by the issuer of the municipal 
obligations. Holders of Units in an Insured Trust should discuss with their tax 
advisers the degree of reliance which they may place on this letter ruling.     
However, counsel for the Sponsor at the time of the closing of the Insured      
Trust, had given an opinion to the effect such payment of proceeds would be     
excludable from federal gross income to the extent described under "Federal Tax
Status" in Prospectus Part II.                                                  

Each Portfolio Insurer is subject to regulation by the department of      
insurance in the state in which it is qualified to do business. Such regulation,
however, is no guarantee that each Portfolio Insurer will be able to perform on 
its contract of insurance in the event a claim should be made thereunder at some
time in the future. At the date hereof, it is reported that no claims have been 
submitted or are expected to be submitted to any of the Portfolio Insurers which
would materially impair the ability of any such company to meet its commitment  
pursuant to any contract of bond or portfolio insurance.                        

The information relating to each Portfolio Insurer, if any, has been      
furnished by such companies. The financial information with respect to each     
Portfolio Insurer appears in reports filed with state insurance regulatory      
authorities and is subject to audit and review by such authorities. No          
representation is made herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information
or as to the absence of material adverse changes in such information subsequent 
to the dates thereof.                                                           

Portfolio Administration

   The Trustee is empowered to sell, for the purpose of redeeming Units tendered
by any Unitholder, and for the payment of expenses for which funds may not be   
available, such of the bonds designated by the Supervisor as the Trustee in its 
sole discretion may deem necessary. The Supervisor, in designating such bonds,  
will consider a variety of factors including (a) interest rates, (b) market     
value and (c) marketability. The Sponsor may direct the Trustee to dispose of   
bonds upon default in payment of principal or interest, institution of certain  
legal proceedings, default under other documents adversely affecting debt       
service, default in payment of principal or interest or other obligations of the
same issuer, decline in projected income pledged for debt service on revenue    
bonds or decline in price or the occurrence of other market or credit factors,  
including advance refunding (i.e., the issuance of refunding securities and the 
deposit of the proceeds thereof in trust or escrow to retire the refunded       
securities on their respective redemption dates), so that in the opinion of the 
Supervisor the retention of such bonds would be detrimental to the interest of  
the Unitholders. In connection with the Insured Trusts to the extent that bonds 
are sold which are current in payment of principal and interest in order to meet
redemption requests and defaulted bonds are retained in the portfolio in order  
to preserve the related insurance protection applicable to said bonds, the      
overall quality of the bonds remaining in such Trust's portfolio will tend to   
diminish. Except as described in this section and in certain other unusual      
circumstances for which it is determined by the Trustee to be in the best       
interests of the Unitholders or if there is no alternative, the Trustee is not  
empowered to sell bonds from an Insured Trust which are in default in payment of
principal or interest or in significant risk of such default and for which value
has been attributed for the insurance obtained by such Insured Trust. Because of
restrictions on the Trustee under certain circumstances, the Sponsor may seek a 
full or partial suspension of the right of Unitholders to redeem their Units in 
an Insured Trust. See "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units" in Prospectus
Part II. The Sponsor is empowered, but not obligated, to direct the Trustee to  
dispose of bonds in the event of an advanced refunding.                         

 The Sponsor is required to instruct the Trustee to reject any offer made by
an issuer of any of the bonds to issue new obligations in exchange or           
substitution for any bond pursuant to a refunding or refinancing plan, except   
that the Sponsor may instruct the Trustee to accept or reject such an offer or  
to take any other action with respect thereto as the Sponsor may deem proper if 
(1) the issuer is in default with respect to such bond or (2) in the written    
opinion of the Sponsor the issuer will probably default with respect to such    
bond in the reasonably foreseeable future. Any obligation so received in        
exchange or substitution will be held by the Trustee subject to the terms and   
conditions of the Trust Agreement to the same extent as bonds originally        
deposited thereunder. Within five days after the deposit of obligations in      
exchange or substitution for underlying bonds, the Trustee is required to give  
notice thereof to each Unitholder of the Trust thereby affected, identifying the
bonds eliminated and the bonds substituted therefore. Except as stated herein   
and under "Fund Administration--Replacement Bonds" in Prospectus Part II        
regarding the substitution of Replacement Bonds for Failed Bonds, the           
acquisition by a Trust of any securities other than the bonds initially         
deposited is not permitted.                                                     

If any default in the payment of principal or interest on any bonds occurs
and no provision for payment is made therefore within 30 days, the Trustee is   
required to notify the Sponsor thereof. If the Sponsor fails to instruct the    
Trustee to sell or to hold such bonds within 30 days after notification by the  
Trustee to the Sponsor of such default, the Trustee may in its discretion sell  
the defaulted bond and not be liable for any depreciation or loss thereby       
incurred.

potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct   
with respect to your Trust.                                                     

If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust    
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs 
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a        
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be          
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the SEC, (ii) terminate the  
Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trusts as provided therein or (iii) continue  
to act as Trustee without terminating the Trust Agreement.                      

 Trustee Information

 The Trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company organized under
the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its principal unit        
investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn, New
York 11217, telephone (800) 221-7668. The Bank of New York Mellon is subject to 
supervision and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New  
York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits 
are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent permitted
by law.                                                                         

The duties of the Trustee are primarily ministerial in nature. It did not 
participate in the selection of bonds for the portfolios of any of the Trusts.  
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall keep proper books of  
record and account of all transactions at its office for the Trusts. Such       
records shall include the name and address of, and the certificates issued by   
the Trusts to, every Unitholder of the Trusts. Such books and records shall be  
open to inspection by any Unitholder at all reasonable times during the usual   
business hours. The Trustee shall make such annual or other reports as may from 
time to time be required under any applicable state or federal statute, rule or 
regulation. The Trustee is required to keep a certified copy or duplicate       
original of the Trust Agreement on file in its office available for inspection  
at all reasonable times during the usual business hours by any Unitholder,      
together with a current list of the bonds held in the Trusts.                   

Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of the trusts created by the Trust Agreement by executing an  
instrument in writing and filing the same with the Sponsor. The Trustee or      
successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of resignation to all          
Unitholders then of record, not less than 60 days before the date specified in  
such notice when such resignation is to take effect. The Sponsor upon receiving 
notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a successor trustee promptly.
If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has been appointed and has      
accepted the appointment within 30 days after notification, the retiring Trustee
may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a         
successor. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee as
provided in the Trust Agreement at any time with or without cause. Notice of    
such removal and appointment shall be mailed to each Unitholder by the Sponsor. 
Upon execution of a written acceptance of such appointment by such successor    
trustee, all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of the original trustee 
shall vest in the successor. The resignation or removal of a Trustee becomes    
effective only when the successor trustee accepts its appointment as such or    
when a court of competent jurisdiction appoints a successor trustee. Any        
corporation into which a Trustee may be merged or with which it may be          
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to  
which a Trustee shall be a party, shall be the successor trustee. The Trustee   
must be a banking corporation organized under the laws of the United States or  
any state and having at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided   
profits of not less than $5,000,000.                                            

Termination of the Trust Agreement

   A Trust may be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders of 51% of the
Units of such Trust then outstanding (or with respect to Van Kampen Unit Trusts,
Municipal Series 654 and subsequent series, by consent of Unitholders of 75% of 
the Units of such Trust then outstanding) or by the Trustee when the value of   
such Trust, as shown by any semi-annual evaluation, is less than 20% of the     
original principal amount of bonds. A Trust will be liquidated by the Trustee in
the event that a sufficient number of Units not yet sold are tendered for       
redemption by the Underwriters, including the Sponsor, so that the net worth of 
such Trust would be reduced to less than 40% of the initial principal amount of 
such Trust. If a Trust is liquidated because of the redemption of unsold Units  
by the Underwriters, the Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units the     
entire sales charge paid by such purchaser. The Trust Agreement provides that   
each Trust shall terminate upon the redemption, sale or other disposition of the
last bond held in such Trust, but in no event shall it continue beyond the end  
of the year preceding the fiftieth anniversary of the Trust Agreement in the    
case of an IM-IT, Investment Grade Municipal, IMIT Discount, a U.S. Territorial 
IM-IT, a Long-Term State or a National Quality Trust, or beyond the end of the  
year preceding the twentieth anniversary of the Trust Agreement in the case of  
Strategic Municipal, IM-IT Limited Maturity, IM-IT Intermediate, State          
Intermediate Laddered Maturity and IM-IT Short Intermediate Trusts. In the event
of termination of any Trust, written notice thereof will be sent by the Trustee 
to each Unitholder of such Trust at his address appearing on the registration   
books of such Trust maintained by the Trustee. Within a reasonable time         
thereafter the Trustee shall liquidate any bond then held in such Trust and     
shall deduct from the funds of such Trust any accrued costs, expenses or        
indemnities provided by the Trust Agreement, including estimated compensation of
the Trustee and costs of liquidation and any amounts required as a reserve to   
provide for payment of any applicable taxes or other government charges. The    
sale of bonds in the Trust upon termination may result in a lower amount than   
might otherwise be realized if such sale were not required at such time. For    
this reason, among others, the amount realized by a Unitholder upon termination 
may be less than the principal amount or par amount of bonds represented by the 
Units held by such Unitholder. The Trustee shall then distribute to each        
Unitholder his share of the balance of the Interest and Principal Accounts. With
such distribution the Unitholder shall be furnished a final distribution        
statement of the amount distributable. At such time as the Trustee in its sole  
discretion shall determine that any amounts held in reserve are no longer       
necessary, it shall make distribution thereof to Unitholders in the same manner.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with final distributions to  
Unitholders of an Insured Trust, it should be noted that because the portfolio  
insurance obtained by an Insured Trust, if any, is applicable only while bonds  
so insured are held by such Trust, the price to be received by such Trust upon  
the disposition of any such bond which is in default, by reason of nonpayment of
principal or interest, will not reflect any value based on such insurance.      
Therefore, in connection with any liquidation, it shall not be necessary for the
Trustee to, and the Trustee does not currently intend to, dispose of any bond or
bonds if retention of such bond or bonds, until due, shall be deemed to be in   
the best interest of Unitholders, including, but not limited to, situations in  
which a bond or bonds so insured have deteriorated market prices resulting from 
a significant risk of default. Since the Preinsured Bonds will reflect the value
of the related insurance, it is the present intention of the Sponsor not to     
direct the Trustee to hold any of such Preinsured Bonds after the date of       
termination. All proceeds received, less applicable expenses, from insurance on 
defaulted bonds not disposed of at the date of termination will ultimately be   
distributed to Unitholders of record as of such date of termination as soon as  
practicable after the date such defaulted bond or bonds become due and          
applicable insurance proceeds have been received by the Trustee.                

Description of Ratings

Standard & Poor's, A Division of the McGraw-Hill Companies. A Standard &  
Poor's municipal bond rating is a current assessment of the creditworthiness of 
an obligor with respect to a specific debt bond. This assessment of             
creditworthiness may take into consideration obligors such as guarantors,       
insurers or lessees.                                                            

The bond rating is not a recommendation to purchase or sell a security,   
inasmuch as it does not comment as to market price.                             

 The ratings are based on current information furnished to Standard & Poor's
by the issuer and obtained by Standard & Poor's from other sources it considers 
reliable. The ratings may be changed, suspended or withdrawn as a result of     
changes in, or unavailability of, such information.                             

 The ratings are based, in varying degrees, on the following considerations:

     I.   Likelihood of payment--capacity and willingness of the obligor to meet
          its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms
of the obligation.                                          

II.  Nature of and provisions of the obligation.                      

III. Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the bond in the
       event of bankruptcy, reorganization or other arrangements under the
  laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.

  AAA--This is the highest rating assigned by Standard & Poor's. The obligor's
capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong.

  AA--An obligation rated "AA" differs from the highest-rated obligations only
in small degree. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the 
obligation is very strong.                                                      

   A--An obligation rated "A" is somewhat more susceptible to adverse effects of
changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in            
higher-rated categories. However, the obligor's capacity to meet its financial  
commitment on the obligation is still strong.                                   

BBB--An obligation rated "BBB" exhibits adequate protection parameters.   
However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely  
to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment  
on the obligation.                                                              

  Plus (+) or Minus (-): The ratings from "AA" to "BBB" may be modified by the
addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major     
rating categories.                                                              

Provisional Ratings: A provisional rating ("p") assumes the successful    
completion of the project financed by the debt being rated and indicates that   
payment of debt service requirements is largely or entirely dependent upon the  
successful and timely completion of the project. This rating, however, while    
addressing credit quality subsequent to completion of the project, makes no     
comment on the likelihood of or the risk of default upon failure of such        
completion. The investor should exercise his own judgment with respect to such  
likelihood and risk.                                                            

   Moody's Investors Service, Inc. A brief description of the applicable Moody's
rating symbols and their meanings follows:                                      

  Aaa--Bonds which are rated Aaa are judged to be the best quality. They carry
the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as "gilt   
edge". Interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable 
margin and principal is secure. While the various protective elements are likely
to change, such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the    
fundamentally strong position of such issues.                                   

Aa--Bonds which are rated Aa are judged to be of high quality by all      
standards. Together with the Aaa group they comprise what are generally known as
high grade bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of   
protection may not be as large as in Aaa securities or fluctuations of          
protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements  
present which make the long-term risks appear somewhat larger than in Aaa       
securities.                                                                     

 A--Bonds which are rated A possess many favorable investment attributes and
are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations. Factors giving security 
to principal and interest are considered adequate, but elements may be present  
which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future.            

Baa--Bonds which are rated Baa are considered as medium grade obligations;
i.e., they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured. Interest payment and
principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective       
elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great  
length of time. Such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in   
fact have speculative characteristics as well.                                  

Moody's(R) applies numerical modifiers, 1, 2 and 3 in each generic rating 
classification from Aa through B in its corporate bond rating system. The       
modifier 1 indicates that the security ranks in the higher end of its generic   
rating category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 
3 indicates that the issue ranks in the lower end of its generic rating         
category.                                                                       

Arizona Risk Factors

  Economic Condition and Outlook. The Arizona Department of Economic Security,
Research Administration's (RA's) forecast update for 2007-08 shows Arizona's    
economy is expected to continue adding jobs over the two-year period. This      
forecast update calls for growth of 113,700 nonfarm jobs, with growth rates of  
2.40% in 2007 and 1.70% in 2008. This suggests that the economy is slowing more 
than RA's earlier forecasts had predicted. RA's forecast in April was 3.70% for 
2007 and 3.00% for 2008. Arizona's economy is nevertheless expected to perform  
better than the national economy over the two-year period. Global Insight,      
national economic consultant, forecasts that the nation's nonfarm jobs will grow
by 1.40% in 2007 and by 1.10% in 2008.                                          

Economic expansion outside of the United States helps maintain growth in  
Arizona industries dependent on exports, such as natural resources and mining   
and tourism-related industries. Arizona's population growth is expected to      
continue at about the same pace of 6.10% over two years, according to RA's      
Population Statistics Unit.                                                     

While job growth rates are projected to decrease during 2007-08, Arizona's
economy is expected to experience improving growth trends as some of the affects
subside in the housing and finance (mortgage) industries. Population growth will
eventually remove the surplus of unsold homes on the current market and provide 
the impetus of increasing demand for housing.                                   

   Natural resources and mining is projected to continue its strong growth, with
13.30% in 2007 and 6.00% in 2008. Almost 2,000 new jobs are expected to be added
in Arizona's fastest growing industry. Demand for copper and other natural      
resource material is expected to remain strong in both the United States and    
abroad. In Arizona's rural areas and smaller urban counties, mining activity is 
projected to bolster other parts of the local economy.                          

Construction was projected to lose 2,400 jobs in 2007 and 12,100 jobs in  
2008. The slowdown in the housing market and a tightening lending market hastens
the construction employment losses. Much of the recent impacts from the         
sub-prime lending and adjustable-rate mortgage loans are expected to cause      
various private sector driven adjustments to lending practices.                 

 Manufacturing forecasts called for a loss of about 900 jobs in 2007 and 300
in 2008. At .60% of its overall employment, manufacturing's losses over the     
two-year forecast period are relatively small. Recent losses in this sector have
been the result of Arizona factory closures and consolidations in the computer  
and electronic parts sector. Continued military demand is expected to support   
aerospace product and parts and fabricated metal job growth.                    

 Trade, transportation, and utilities employment were expected to have lower
job growth than forecast in April 2007 as a result of the reduction in the      
growth rate of consumer spending and wavering consumer confidence. Despite this 
slowdown, trade, transportation, and utilities is forecast to add the largest   
number of jobs of any major industry group - 27,000 during the forecast period. 
As has been the case for several earlier years, higher fuel and energy process  
are expected to continue to challenge transportation companies and consumers.   

 Information technology and related industries are forecast to lose slightly
more than 600 jobs in 2007 and then gain 300 jobs in 2008. Recent employment    
trends in this industry have begun to shift away from several years of losses.  

   Job growth in the financial activities industry was projected to slow in 2007
as the financial industry adjusts with credit tightening and restructuring. In  
2008, economic and population growth is forecast to bolster this industry       
despite weakness in the housing market. The financial activities group is       
forecast to add 2,200 jobs in 2007 and 3,300 jobs in 2008.                      

Professional and business services were projected to add 24,400 jobs, with
3.90% growth in 2007 and 2.20% next year. The slowing rates of growth are a     
result of the overall slowdown in the economy. Job growth is expected to be     
fairly good in professional, scientific, and technical services, while the other
sectors will bear more of the brunt of the economic slowdown.                   

   Educational and health services were projected to gain 23,000 jobs during the
forecast period. The forecast for this industry is only slightly below that of  
the April 2007 figures. New health care facilities and schools continue to need 
staffing and will be necessary to meet population demands.                      

Leisure and hospitality are projected to add more than 21,500 jobs. This  
industry is projected to do well from the domestic traveler seeking to explore  
Arizona and the Southwest, and from travelers from foreign markets taking       
advantage of the lower value of the U.S. dollar. This industry reached new      
record highs in 2006 and 2007, despite drought-related weather conditions in the
Southwest.                                                                      

Other services is projected to add almost 8,700 jobs during the forecast  
period and represents the second largest percentage gain of any major industry  
group with increases of 5.10% in 2007 and 3.30% in 2008.                        

Government job growth is projected to slow slightly, as demand for public 
services continues from a growing population. Government is forecast to add more
than 17,500 jobs over the forecast period.                                      

In conclusion, Arizona's economy showed considerable job growth in 2006 --
the fastest job growth state in the nation at 5.40%. However, considerable signs
of a slowing national and local economy have caused RA's forecast update to show
downward revisions to growth in 2007 and 2008. Regardless, over the forecast    
period, Arizona's economy is expected to outpace the national economy, which is 
expected to grow by 1.40% in 2007 and 1.10% in 2008, compared to Arizona's 2.50%
and 1.70% growth, respectively.                                                 

   Major Initiatives. The Governor's fiscal year 2007 Budget reflects a balanced
approach. It emphasizes strategic tax relief and economic incentives that offer 
enduring benefits to taxpayers and to the State at large. It also modernizes    
State assets and strengthens vital programs that, during the last three years,  
bore the brunt of the State's fiscal austerity.                                 

Children. The fiscal year 2007 Budget provided additional funding of; (1) 
$7.850 million to increase Child Care provider rates to the 75th percentile of  
the 2000 Market Rate Survey; (2) $19.530 million for KidsCare Outreach, to reach
young, needy children and provide them with proper medical insurance; and (3)   
$2.149 million for Adoptions Services caseload growth.                          

   Education. The fiscal year 2007 Budget provided additional funding of $80.000
million to expand Voluntary Full Day Kindergarten to all school districts and   
$43.875 million to comply with court orders for English language learners.      

 Law Enforcement. The fiscal year 2007 Budget provided additional funding of
$38.400 million for salary increases for law enforcement personnel within the   
Department of Corrections, Department of Public Safety, and the Department of   
Juvenile Corrections; this funding is in addition to the Statewide salary       
increase for State workers.                                                     

   College Students. The fiscal year 2007 Budget sought to improve access to and
the quality of University education by raising the match for financial aid to   
2:1, increasing the State's contribution from $2.161 million to $7.161 million  
to help more Arizonans afford a college degree and minimize tuition.            

 Healthcare. The fiscal year 2007 Budget provided additional funding of; (1)
$61.089 million for growth in the Arizona Long-Term Care System; (2) $17.400    
million for an increase in the developmentally disabled population receiving    
long-term care services; (3) $8.184 million for the purchase of vaccines for    
children and for first time, high-risk, low-income adults; and (4) $1.565       
million for Dual Eligible Medicare Part-D co-pays for physical and mental health
medications, to ensure that elderly low-income persons continue to receive      
medication.                                                                     

  Public Safety. The fiscal year 2007 Budget provided $10.000 million from the
General Fund to expand multi-jurisdiction immigration control efforts, including
local law enforcement grants; and $7.000 million from the General Fund for an   
additional 100 sworn officer positions in the Gang and Immigration Intelligence 
Team Enforcement Mission, of which 50 are for border security and immigration.  

Tax Reductions. The fiscal year 2007 Budget provided total tax and other  
revenue reductions of $448.000 million primarily including; (1) a 5.00%         
reduction ($156.000 million) in individual income tax rates; (2) a three year   
elimination (fiscal year07 impact of $215.000 million) of a 42 cent property    
tax, the County Equalization Tax; (3) an increase in the threshold for          
businesses to pay Transaction Privilege Tax estimated payments from $100        
thousand to $1.000 million, resulting in a one-time revenue loss of $55.000     
million; and (4) other new tax reductions of $18.000 million, primarily         
including a $10.000 million corporate income tax credit for donations to private
school tuition organizations and a $5.000 million health insurance premium tax  
credit.                                                                         

Businesses. The fiscal year 2007 Budget provided $35.000 million to fund  
Innovation Arizona, which will invest in science-based research with strategic  
value to Arizona's long-term competitiveness and quality of life.               

   Transportation. The fiscal year 2007 Budget increased transportation spending
by $345.00 million including; (1) $245.00 million from the General Fund         
deposited to the Statewide Transportation Acceleration Needs Account (STAN); (2)
$62.00 million from the State Highway Fund deposited into the STAN; and (3)     
$38.00 million in additional Highway User Revenue Fund monies distributed to    
local jurisdictions.                                                            

Arizona Veterans. The fiscal year 2007 Budget provided $10.000 million to 
build the Southern Arizona State Veterans' Home and $1.125 million for 25 new   
veteran benefit counselors, support staff, and veteran outreach programs        
statewide.                                                                      

 State Employees. The operation of State government is made possible through
the 70,500 State employees who devote their working lives to public service. The
fiscal year 2007 Budget recognized the value of State employees and provided;   
(1) $129.687 million for a $1,650 per FTE salary adjustment and a 2.50%         
performance adjustment; (2) pay raises for law enforcement personnel at the     
Department of Public Safety ($2.768 million), Department of Juvenile Corrections
($1.510 million), and Department of Corrections ($25.751 million); (3) $3.100   
million in pay raises for psychiatrists and nurses at the Arizona State         
Hospital; and (4) $28.700 million to cover increased health insurance premium   
costs for State employees.                                                      

Initiatives such as those discussed above clearly illustrate the dynamic  
impact that can occur when State Government optimizes its existing resources for
the benefit of the people it serves and makes the most prudent investments in   
its infrastructure.                                                             

General Fund. The General Fund ended the June 30, 2007, fiscal year with $1.1
billion in unreserved fund balance and an $841.391 million reserved fund balance
for a total fund balance of $1.9 billion. The previous year's total fund balance
was $2.3 billion. Included in the $841.391 million reserved fund balance is     
$673.531 million for the Budget Stabilization Fund. The Budget Stabilization    
Fund is a form of Rainy Day Fund established by the Legislature in 1991.        

Cash Management. The responsibility for cash management of the State is   
shared by the Office of the Treasurer (Treasurer) and the General Accounting    
Office of the Department of Administration, Financial Services Division (GAO).  
The Treasurer is responsible for the depository, custodial and investment       
functions of cash. The GAO is responsible for drawing down monies available for 
State functions and the expenditure or disbursement of those monies. The State  
requires that Treasurer's deposits and investments with financial institutions  
be entirely covered by federal depository insurance or alternatively            
collateralized with surety equal to 102% of the deposit or investment. Component
units may have collateralization policies that differ from those of the         
Treasurer. The Legislature has passed statutes authorizing State investments.   
The Treasurer deposits receipts in accordance with applicable statutes and      
invests excess cash of the General Fund and various other funds. All interest,  
not otherwise apportioned by law, is deposited in the General Fund.             

Budgetary Controls. Budgetary control is maintained through legislative   
appropriation and the executive branch allotment process. The Governor is       
required to submit an annual budget to the Legislature. The budget is legally   
required to be adopted through passage of appropriation bills by the Legislature
and approval by the Governor. The appropriated funds are controlled by the      
executive branch through an allotment process. This process generally allocates 
the appropriation into quarterly allotments by legal appropriation level. The   
State also maintains an encumbrance accounting system to further enhance        
budgetary control. Encumbered amounts generally lapse as of the end of the      
fiscal year, with the exception of capital outlay and other continuing          
appropriations. These appropriations and their encumbrances continue from year  
to year.                                                                        

   The State is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control
structure designed to ensure that the assets of the State are protected from    
loss, theft or misuse and to ensure that adequate accounting data are compiled  
to allow for the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.    
GAAP. Internal accounting controls are designed to provide reasonable, but not  
absolute, assurance that these objectives are met. The concept of reasonable    
assurance recognizes that: (1) the cost of a control should not exceed the      
benefits likely to be derived and (2) the valuation of costs and benefits       
requires estimates and judgments by management. In the opinion of management,   
the State's internal controls are adequate to provide reasonable assurance that 
these objectives are met.                                                       

   Risk Management. The State purchases property and liability coverage whenever
available on reasonable terms. The State is insured by an approved property     
insurer for claims in excess of $3.500 million, but less than $450.000 million, 
and liability claims in excess of $2.000 million for the Universities and the   
School for the Deaf and Blind and $7.000 million for all other state agencies,  
but less than $100.000 million. The State also maintains first dollar aircraft  
liability, hull, and airport liability coverage up to $200.000 million. Other   
purchased coverages include fidelity, foreign liability, medical malpractice    
(limited to the University of Arizona's medical professional staff), nuclear    
property, nuclear liability, and employment practices. The State's              
self-insurance fund provides property and liability coverage for claims less    
than or in excess of this coverage, or whenever coverage, such as workers'      
compensation and medical malpractice for non-University of Arizona professional 
staff, is unavailable on reasonable terms.                                      

The Risk Management Fund (RMF) deficit of $299.841 million in fiscal year 
2007 is primarily due to the RMF receiving annual funding only for expected paid
claims (self-insured and excess insurance expenditures, legal and other claim   
related expenditures, and administrative expenditures), and not being funded for
non-current accrued insurance losses. Accrued insurance losses of the RMF are   
not considered when determining funding for each fiscal year.                   

  Ratings. As of July 2008, Arizona was assigned an issuer credit rating of AA
by S&P and Aa3 by Moody's. Any explanation concerning the significance of such  
ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies. There is no assurance that   
any ratings will continue for any period of time or that they will not be       
revised or withdrawn.                                                           

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Arizona issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of     
obligations issued by the State of Arizona, and there is no obligation on the   
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Arizona IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of
all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject.    
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Arizona IM-IT, the 
market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective    
issuers of such bonds acquired by the Arizona IM-IT to pay interest on or       
principal of such bonds.                                                        

   The Arizona IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory factors
affecting issuers of Arizona municipal obligations (the "Arizona Municipal      
Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain Arizona    
constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and other    
matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief      
summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in Arizona and 
is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and are       
believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the       
accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing information. It is based in    
part on information obtained from various State and local agencies in Arizona or
contained in Official Statements for various Arizona Municipal Obligations.     

 Arkansas Risk Factors

 Economic Outlook. Arkansas is a noted leader in the South for its favorable
business climate and low cost of doing business. The average cost of living for 
all of Arkansas' Metropolitan Statistical Areas is consistently below the       
national average. Businesses also enjoy low tax obligations through a variety of
incentives, exemptions, credits and refunds. Targeted business incentives       
provide start-up companies a 33 percent transferable income tax credit for      
research and development, a 10 percent payroll tax credit for up to 5 years, and
sales and use tax refunds for equipment and building materials. Targeted        
businesses are those that grow knowledge-based businesses from the intellectual 
property generated by Arkansas' research universities.                          

   In fiscal year 2007, wage and salary employment in Arkansas rose to 1,204,660
jobs. This represented an increase of 14,390 jobs or 1.2 percent compared to    
fiscal year 2006. In fiscal year 2008, wage and salary employment is expected to
reach 1,215,740 jobs. This represents a projected increase of 11,070 jobs or 0.9
percent from fiscal year 2007.                                                  

  In fiscal year 2007, actual net available general revenues collected totaled
$4,467.9 million, of which $4,058.6 million was distributed to state agencies   
and a $409.3 million surplus was deposited to the Arkansas General Revenue      
Allotment Reserve Fund. This amount is $233.6 million, or 6.1 percent above the 
net available distribution of fiscal year 2006. The general revenue distribution
included a one-time transfer of $22.0 million from the Arkansas Property Tax    
Relief Trust Fund.                                                              

 Fiscal year 2008 net available general revenue collections are estimated at
$4,346.1 million, an increase of $287.5 million or 7.1 percent over fiscal year 
2007. The net general revenues distributed for fiscal year 2008 will not include
transfers in from the Property Tax Relief Trust Fund or Revenue Allotment       
Reserve Fund that was the case in fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2007.        

 Major Initiatives. The Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department
maintained over 16,000 miles of highways and completed construction projects    
such as resurfacing of existing highways, replacing bridges, adding passing     
lanes, and building new roads during fiscal year 2007. As a result of the       
projects over half of Arkansas' interstate system has been rehabilitated and in 
2006, 72 percent of Arkansas' interstates were rated "good."                    

The National Math and Science Initiative (NMSI) awarded Arkansas a $13.2  
million, six-year grant in August 2007 to allow schools to implement            
research-proven training and incentive methods to improve the performance of    
students in Advanced Placement (AP) and Pre-AP courses so that they are better  
prepared for college-level work in math, science and engineering. Only seven    
states received the NMSI grants. The U.S. Department of Education recognized    
Arkansas in 2007 as being at the forefront in implementing rigorous learning    
standards for students.                                                         

 Act 1954 of 2005 merged the Arkansas Department of Health with the Arkansas
Department of Human Services to create the Arkansas Department of Health and    
Human Services. The consolidation of the two departments created the largest    
state agency in Arkansas, with a workforce of 10,000 employees. During fiscal   
year 2007, the Department of Health and Human Services launched several core    
initiatives that will, over time, have a profound impact on the consumer and the
cost of health care. These include several new technology initiatives that will 
enable better access to services for consumers and maximize limited state       
resources. Act 386 of 2007 reversed the merger and returned the two agencies    
back to separate agencies. The two agencies will continue to work cooperatively 
to address the health and human service needs of the citizens of Arkansas and to
carry out the initiatives that have been put into place.                        

   Revenues and Expenditures. Deficit spending has been prohibited by statute in
Arkansas since 1945. The Revenue Stabilization Act controls spending by state   
agencies and prohibits deficit spending. The Revenue Stabilization Act requires 
that, before any state spending can take place, the Arkansas General Assembly   
must make an appropriation and funds must be available in the fund from which   
the appropriation has been made. The State is prohibited from borrowing money to
put into any state fund from which appropriations can be paid.                  

   Act 750 of 1973, as amended, established Arkansas' Revenue Stabilization Law.
This law and related legislation govern the administration and distribution of  
state revenues. Pursuant to the Stabilization Law, all general and special      
revenues are deposited into the Arkansas General Revenue Allotment Account and  
the Arkansas Special Revenue Allotment Account according to the type of revenue 
being deposited. From the General Revenue Allotment Account, 3% of all revenues 
are first distributed to the Constitutional Officers Fund and the Central       
Services Fund to provide support for the States' elected officials and their    
staffs and the Department of Finance and Administration.                        

   The balance, net of income tax refunds, is then distributed to separate funds
proportionately as established by the Stabilization Law. From the Arkansas      
Special Revenue Fund, 3% of all special revenues collected by the Department of 
Finance and Administration and 1.5% of all special revenues collected by other  
agencies are first distributed to provide support for the State's elected       
officials, their staffs, and DFA. The balance is then distributed to the funds  
for which the special revenues were collected. Special revenues, which are      
primarily user taxes, are generally earmarked for the program or agency         
providing the related services. General revenues are transformed into funds     
established and maintained by the treasurer for major programs and agencies of  
the State in accordance with fund priorities established by the Arkansas General
Assembly.                                                                       

   According to the Stabilization Law, the Arkansas General Assembly establishes
three levels of priority for general revenue spending, levels "A," "B," and "C."
Successive levels of appropriations are funded only in the event sufficient     
revenues have been generated to fully fund any prior level. Accordingly,        
appropriations made to programs and agencies are only maximum authorizations to 
spend. Actual expenditures are limited to the lesser of (1) moneys flowing to a 
program or agencies' fund maintained by the treasurer or (2) the maximum        
appropriation by the Arkansas General Assembly. Because state revenues are not  
collected throughout the year in a pattern consistent with program and agency   
expenditures, a budget revolving fund, which receives interest earnings for     
Arkansas fund investments, has been established and is utilized to assure proper
cash flow during any period.                                                    

   Debt Management. The Constitution of the State of Arkansas does not limit the
amount of general obligation bonds, which may be issued by the State; however,  
no such bonds may be issued unless approved by the voters of the State at a     
general election or special election held for that purpose. Although the State  
of Arkansas defaulted on some of its general obligation debt during the         
depression in the late 1930s, it has not failed to pay the principal and        
interest on any of its general obligations when due since that time.            

  Act 496 of 1981, as amended, the Arkansas Water Resources Development Act of
1981 ("Act 496"), authorizes the issuance of Arkansas Water Resources           
Development General Obligation Bonds by the State of Arkansas, acting by and    
through the Arkansas Soil and Water Conservation Commission. The issuance of    
bonds pursuant to Act 496 was approved by the electors of the State at the      
general election on November 2, 1982. All bonds issued under the authority of   
this act are direct general obligations of the State and are secured by an      
irrevocable pledge of the full faith, credit, and resources of the State. The   
total principal amount of bonds issued during any fiscal biennium may not exceed
$15 million, and the total principal of all bonds issued under Act 496 may not  
exceed $100 million. The bonds were issued to provide financing for the         
development of water resources projects in the State of Arkansas approved and   
implemented by the Arkansas Soil and Water Conservation Commission. Repayment of
financial assistance provided for the development of the projects is first used 
to repay the bonds; any remaining debt service requirement is paid from general 
revenues. No bonds were issued under this act in fiscal year 2007.              

Act 686 of 1987, as amended, the Arkansas Waste Disposal and Pollution    
Abatement Facilities Financing Act of 1987 ("Act 686"), authorizes the issuance 
of Arkansas Waste Disposal and Pollution Abatement Facilities General Obligation
Bonds by the State of Arkansas, acting by and through the Arkansas Soil and     
Water Conservation Commission. The issuance of bonds pursuant to Act 686 was    
approved by the electors of the State at the general election on November 8,    
1988. All bonds issued under the authority of this act are direct general       
obligations of the State and are secured by an irrevocable pledge of the full   
faith, credit, and resources of the State. The total principal amount of bonds  
issued during any fiscal biennium may not exceed $50 million, and the total     
principal of all bonds issued under Act 686 may not exceed $250 million unless  
the General Assembly by law authorizes a greater amount to be issued. The bonds 
are issued to provide financing for the development of waste disposal and       
pollution abatement facilities projects in the State of Arkansas. Repayment of  
financial assistance provided for the development of the projects is first used 
to repay the bonds; any remaining debt service requirement is paid from general 
revenues. Arkansas did not issue any bonds under Act 686 in fiscal year 2007.   

 Act 683 of 1989, as amended, the Arkansas College Savings Bond Act of 1989,
as amended ("Act 683"), authorizes the State to issue College Savings General   
Obligation Bonds. All bonds issued under the authority of this act are direct   
general obligations of the State and are secured by an irrevocable pledge of the
full faith, credit, and resources of the State. The act limited the total       
principal amount to approximately $300 million with no more than $100 million   
being issued in any fiscal biennium unless the General Assembly of the State    
shall, by law, authorize a greater principal amount thereof to be issued. The   
College Series bonds were issued to provide funds to finance capital            
improvements projects at state institutions of higher education. The bonds are  
payable from the net general revenues of the State and investment earnings on   
the proceeds of the bonds. No bonds were issued under this act in the 2007      
fiscal year.                                                                    

Act 607 of 1997 authorized the Arkansas Soil and Water Conservation       
Commission (subsequently the Arkansas Natural Resources Commission) to issue    
Water, Waste Disposal, and Pollution Abatement Facilities General Obligation    
Bonds. All bonds issued under the authority of this act are general obligations 
of the State and are secured by an irrevocable pledge of the full faith, credit,
and resources of the State. The act limited the total principal amount to       
approximately $300 million with no more than $60 million being issued during any
fiscal biennium for nonrefunding purposes unless the General Assembly by law    
authorizes a greater amount to be issued. The bonds were issued to provide      
financing for the development of water, waste disposal, pollution abatement,    
drainage and flood control, irrigation, and wetland preservation facilities     
projects in the State. Repayment of financial assistance provided for the       
development of the projects is first used to repay the bonds; any remaining debt
service requirement is paid from general revenues. In fiscal year 2007, $12.4   
million of bonds were issued under this act.                                    

   Act 1027 of 1999 and a statewide election conducted June 15, 1999, authorized
the State to issue Federal Highway Grant Anticipation and Tax Revenue General   
Obligation Bonds. All bonds issued under the authority of this act are general  
obligations of the State and are secured by an irrevocable pledge of the full   
faith, credit, and resources of the State. The act limited the total principal  
amount to $575 million to be issued in several series of various principal      
amounts. The bonds were issued to pay the cost of reconstructing and renovating 
the interstate highways and related facilities in the State of Arkansas. The    
bonds are payable primarily from Federal Interstate Maintenance Funds and by    
state revenues derived from the tax on diesel fuel at the rate of 4 cents per   
gallon.                                                                         

Act 1282 of 2005 authorized the State to issue Higher Education General   
Obligation Bonds. All bonds issued under the authority of this act are direct   
general obligations of the State and are secured by an irrevocable pledge of the
full faith, credit, and resources of the State. The act limited the total       
principal amount to approximately $250 million. However, the total outstanding  
principal amount of Higher Education General Obligation Bonds issued under Act  
1282 of 2005 and the College Savings Bond Act of 1989 shall not have scheduled  
debt service payments on a combined basis in excess of $24 million in any one   
fiscal year. The Higher Education General Obligation Bonds were issued to       
provide funds to finance technology and facility improvements for state         
institutions of higher education and to refund certain outstanding bonds. The   
bonds are payable from the net general revenues of the State and investment     
earnings on the proceeds of the bonds. In fiscal year 2007, $242.9 million of   
bonds were issued under this act.                                               

 Counties and municipalities may issue general obligation bonds (pledging an
ad valorem tax), special obligation bonds (pledging other specific tax revenues)
and revenue bonds (pledging only specific revenues from sources other than tax  
revenues). School districts may issue general obligation bonds (pledging ad     
valorem taxes). Revenue bonds may also be issued by agencies and                
instrumentalities of counties, municipalities and the State of Arkansas but, as 
in all cases of revenue bonds, neither the full faith and credit nor the taxing 
power of the State of Arkansas or any municipality or county thereof is pledged 
to the repayment of those bonds. Revenue bonds can be issued only for public    
purposes, including, but not limited to, industry, housing, health care         
facilities, airports, port facilities and water and sewer projects.             

In November 2004, Arkansas voters approved Amendment 82 to the Arkansas   
Constitution to allow the State to issue general obligation bonds for projects  
that create 500 jobs and have an investment of $500 million. Pursuant to        
Amendment 82, bond issuance is limited to 5 percent of state general revenues   
during the most recent year, which currently would allow an issuance of         
approximately $191 million in bonds. Changes to legislation governing threshold 
limits and allowing the director the discretion to increase incentives in highly
competitive situations by approving rebates have provided Arkansas additional   
tools to attract industry.                                                      

The General Assembly has enacted Act 1981 of 2007, which is implementing  
legislation for Amendment 82. Under Act 1981, the Governor and the General      
Assembly will approve or disapprove each proposed issuance of bonds under       
Amendment 82. As of June 30, 2007, no proposed issue of any such bonds had been 
considered. The State is unable to predict the timing or amount of any such     
future issuance.                                                                

  Arkansas engaged in two significant bond issues during fiscal year 2007. The
Arkansas Natural Resources Commission issued $12 million of Pollution Revenue   
Bonds and the Department of Higher Education issued $243 million of general     
obligation bonds. The total outstanding general obligation bonded indebtedness, 
including special obligation and other debt instruments, of the governmental    
fund types of Arkansas as of June 30, 2007, was approximately $970 million.     
Arkansas had approximately $248 million in debt service funds as of June 30,
2007 so Arkansas' net bonded debt was $724,050 million.                         

Ratings. As of July 2008, all outstanding general obligation bonds of the 
State of Arkansas are rated AA by S&P and Aa2 by Moody's. Any explanation       
concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating    
agency. There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of  
time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.                             

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Arkansas issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of    
obligations issued by the State of Arkansas, and there is no obligation on the  
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Arkansas IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description  
of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject. 
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Arkansas IM-IT, the
market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective    
issuers of such bonds acquired by the Arkansas IM-IT to pay interest on or      
principal of such bonds.                                                        

The Arkansas IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory    
factors affecting issuers of Arkansas municipal obligations (the "Arkansas      
Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain  
Arkansas constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and 
other matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief
summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in Arkansas and
is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and are       
believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the       
accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing information. It is based in    
part on information obtained from various state and local agencies in Arkansas  
or contained in Official Statements for various Arkansas Municipal Obligations. 

 California Risk Factors

 Economic Outlook. Economic growth in the State slowed considerably in 2007,
with much lower job growth than in the prior several years, and with the        
unemployment rate in the State rising to over 5.9 percent at the end of 2007.   
The slowdown was caused in large part by a dramatic downturn in the housing     
industry in most of the State. As 2008 began, turmoil continued to rile the     
stock and bond markets as the problems of risky debt enveloped more parts of the
financial community. Both the Federal Reserve and Congress have stepped in to   
try to give a floor to the damage done by the credit crisis. The Federal Reserve
reduced interest rates by an unprecedented 1.25% in January 2008. A federal tax 
rebate, approved by Congress, should reach taxpayers beginning in May 2008. Also
to help the housing market, especially in California, the caps on Freddie Mac   
and Fannie Mae loans were raised for one year. It is hoped that these actions   
will be enough of an economic stimulus to avoid a national recession in 2008. As
of mid-2008, it appears the housing market has still not reached the bottom, and
economic growth in the State is expected to remain slow in the second half of   
2008 and in 2009.                                                               

In the 2007-08 fiscal year, the State has lost jobs in eight out of ten   
months, with losses over the period totaling 49,600 (0.3%), an average of 5,000 
jobs a month. While indicative of an economy functioning at less than full      
potential, the magnitude of recent job losses are far from recessionary in      
scale. The data continues to show that the housing and real estate sector has   
been the key source of the slowdown in the State's job growth over the last two 
years. Although the pace of year-over job growth slowed in May 2008, the        
non-housing segment of the economy has sustained job growth despite the ongoing 
housing slump, rapidly rising energy and food costs and the weakening national  
economy. Personal income growth is expected to be only 3.5%, compared to 5.6% in
the 2007. Employment growth for California is expected to be only 0.5% and the  
unemployment rate will average 6.0%.                                            

Net Assets. The State government's net assets as of June 30, 2007, were $46.6
billion. After the total net assets were reduced by $81.6 billion for investment
in capital assets (net of related debt) and by $19.1 billion for restricted net 
assets, the resulting unrestricted net assets were a negative $54.1 billion.    
Restricted net assets are dedicated for specified uses and are not available to 
fund current activities. Two-thirds of the negative $54.1 billion consisted of  
$36.3 billion in outstanding bonded debt issued to build capital assets for     
school districts and other local governmental entities. The bonded debt reduces 
the unrestricted net assets; however, local governments, not the State, record  
the capital assets that would offset this reduction.                            

 Changes in Net Assets. The State government's total net assets decreased by
$1.2 billion (2.6%) during the year ended June 30, 2007. Net assets of          
governmental activities decreased by $1.1 billion (3.0%), while net assets of   
business-type activities decreased by $140 million (1.2%).                      

As the 2006-07 fiscal year began, the economy was slowing down, but still 
moving. Several of the indicators of the slowdown were signaling the way:       
interest rates had been rising as a result of tightening in the previous year by
the Federal Reserve, oil and gasoline prices were continuing a general rise, and
residential construction was down 38% from the prior year. Surprisingly though, 
the overall employment appeared relatively solid. In July 2006, California's    
year-over-year employment growth was 1.7%, while the State's unemployment rate, 
at 4.8%, was the lowest since March of 2001. In December 2006, employment was   
still growing by 1.3% on a year-over-year comparison, but problems in the real  
estate market had started to emerge. Housing sales were down 22% compared to    
December 2005, but statewide prices continued to rise--though by only a modest  
3.5% increase. In some regions of California, and particularly in San Diego,    
prices were beginning to decline. More troubling signs were also being seen, as 
foreclosures in California more than doubled in the last quarter of 2006        
compared to the last quarter of 2005. The problems were concentrated in the     
subprime portion of the market--loans made to high-risk borrowers. In           
particular, those subprime loans that were experiencing a "reset" to higher     
interest rates were seeing escalating delinquency rates.                        

   Evidence of a major crack in the foundations of the real estate boom appeared
in February 2007, and California was at the center of the real estate and       
financial turmoil as the fiscal year ended in June 2007. The California         
Association of Realtors reported that in the second quarter of 2007, an         
estimated 15% of all mortgages in California were subprime. Around the same time
period, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that California represented   
17% of subprime loans and over 19% of the foreclosure starts on subprime loans. 
Nevertheless, it still appeared that the damage from real estate activities     
would be confined to real estate sales, construction, and the subprime market.  
As the 2006-07 fiscal year ended, employment was growing at 1.1%; unemployment  
was increasing, but was still low at 5.3%. Most of the employment growth was in 
education and health services, leisure and hospitality services, and            
professional and business services. As 2007 closed, employment growth in        
California was slowing and unemployment was rising. By the end of December 2007,
employment growth in California had fallen to 0.6% from the 1.1% seen in July   
2007, while unemployment had risen to 5.9% from the 5.4% of July.               

Since the beginning of the 2007-08 fiscal year, the problems of the real  
estate market have spread into the larger U.S. financial market and even into   
global financial markets.                                                       

  Infrastructure Planning. Maintaining and improving the highly valued quality
of life and economic growth in California will require additional investments in
the State's infrastructure. The administration proposes to place bond measures  
on the ballot in the 2008 and 2010 general elections for voters to consider     
authorizing $48.1 billion of new general obligation bonds for various education,
water management, transportation, court and state facility infrastructure       
projects. The creation of a Strategic Growth Council is also proposed to        
coordinate activities and investment of funds in state-owned and state-funded   
infrastructure.                                                                 

Budget Outlook. The 2007 Budget Act was enacted on August 24, 2007, and   
authorized total spending of $145.5 billion: $102.2 billion from the General    
Fund, $29.2 billion from special funds, and $14.1 billion from bond funds. Total
General Fund resources in this budget are projected to be $105.6 billion.       
Kindergarten through Grade 12 education spending remains the largest area of the
budget. However, the bulk of new education spending is for a 4.53%              
cost-of-living adjustment. The fastest growing area is correctional programs    
spending. New costs are necessary to comply with various health care court cases
and implementation of Proposition 83, also known as "Jessica's Law", which      
addresses monitoring of high-level sex offenders. Since enactment of the budget,
negative budgetary developments, declining receipts and increasing expenditures 
have significantly eroded the planned General Fund budgetary reserve of $4.1    
billion to an estimated $872 million. In February 2008, the State sold $3.2     
billion of Economic Recovery Bonds to help keep a positive budget reserve.      
Nevertheless, the administration now estimates that there will be a $14.5       
billion General Fund deficit by the end of the 2008-09 fiscal year if no actions
are taken to reduce spending.                                                   

The Governor's Budget for the 2008-09 fiscal year, released on January 10,
2008, seeks total spending (before proposed budget balancing reductions) of     
$151.7 billion: $110.1 billion from the General Fund, $27.7 billion from special
funds, and $13.9 billion from bond funds. The proposed 2008-09 General Fund     
expenditures are $6.5 billion higher (6.3%) than 2007-08 fiscal year enacted    
budget amounts. The Administration proposes a 10% across-the-board budget       
reduction to agencies, departments, and programs which, if adopted, would amount
to approximately $9.1 billion in reduced spending in 2008-09. Concurrent with   
the release of his budget proposal, the Governor declared a fiscal emergency and
called for a special session of the Legislature, as authorized by the State     
Constitution pursuant to Proposition 58 (March 2004), to address the projected  
2008-09 budget shortfall and to prevent a cash shortage. To date, total approved
budget solutions enacted during fiscal year 2007-08 amount to $4.8 billion,     
including the $3.2 billion additional revenues obtained from the February 14,
2008, sale of deficit financing bonds.                                          

Debt Administration. As of June 30, 2007, the State government had total  
bonded debt outstanding of $83.2 billion. Of this amount, $52.2 billion (62.8%) 
represents general obligation bonds, which are backed by the full faith and     
credit of the State. Included in the $52.2 billion of general obligation bonds  
is $9.0 billion of Economic Recovery Bonds that are secured by a pledge of      
revenues derived from dedicated sales and use taxes. The current portion of     
general obligation bonds outstanding is $2.2 billion and the long-term portion  
is $50.0 billion. The remaining $31.0 billion (37.2%) of bonded debt outstanding
represents revenue bonds, which are secured solely by specified revenue sources.
The current portion of revenue bonds outstanding is $1.2 billion and the        
long-term portion is $29.8 billion. The State government's total long-term      
obligations increased during the year ended June 30, 2007. The largest change in
governmental activities' long-term obligations is an increase of $3.3 billion in
general obligation bonds payable.                                               

Budgetary Control. California's annual budget is prepared primarily on a  
modified accrual basis for governmental funds. The Governor recommends a budget 
for approval by the California Legislature each year. This recommended budget   
includes estimated revenues; however, revenues are not included in the annual   
budget bill adopted by the California Legislature. Under state law, the State   
cannot adopt a spending plan that exceeds estimated revenues. Under the State   
Constitution, money may be drawn from the treasury only through a legal         
appropriation. The appropriations contained in the Budget Act, as approved by   
the California Legislature and signed by the Governor, are the primary sources  
of annual expenditure authorizations and establish the legal level of control   
for the annual operating budget. The budget can be amended throughout the year  
by special legislative action, budget revisions by the California Department of 
Finance, or executive orders of the Governor.                                   

  Appropriations are generally available for expenditure or encumbrance either
in the year appropriated or for a period of three years if the legislation does 
not specify a period of availability. At the end of the availability period, the
encumbering authority for the unencumbered balance lapses. Some appropriations  
continue indefinitely, while others are available until fully spent. Generally, 
encumbrances must be liquidated within two years from the end of the period in  
which the appropriation is available. If the encumbrances are not liquidated    
within this additional two-year period, the spending authority for these        
encumbrances lapses. State agencies are responsible for exercising basic        
budgetary control and ensuring that appropriations are not overspent. The State 
Controller's Office is responsible for overall appropriation control and does   
not allow expenditures in excess of authorized appropriations. Financial        
activities are mainly controlled at the appropriation level but can vary,       
depending on the presentation and wording contained in the Budget Act. Certain  
items that are established at the category, program, component, or element level
can be adjusted by the California Department of Finance. For example, an        
appropriation for support may have detail accounts for personal services,       
operating expenses and equipment, and reimbursements. The California Department 
of Finance can authorize adjustments between the detail accounts but cannot     
increase the amount of the overall support appropriation. While the financial   
activities are controlled at various levels, the legal level of budgetary       
control, or the extent to which management may amend the budget without seeking 
approval of the governing body, has been established in the Budget Act for the  
annual operating budget.                                                        

Cash Management. Cash temporarily idle during the year is invested in the 
Pooled Money Investment Account ("PMIA"). Investment of PMIA moneys is          
restricted by law to the following categories: U.S. government securities,      
Federal agency securities, negotiable certificates of deposit, bankers'         
acceptances, commercial paper, corporate bonds, bank notes, other debt          
securities, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and other      
investments. The average daily investment balance for the year ended June 30,
2007, amounted to $58.2 billion, with an average effective yield of 5.12%,      
compared to $55.7 billion and 3.87% for the year ended June 30, 2006. The total 
earnings of the PMIA for the year ended June 30, 2007, amounted to $2.98        
billion, which was distributed as follows: $536 million to the general fund,    
$1.6 million to the Fish and Game Preservation Fund, $1.5 billion to the Surplus
Money Investment Fund, $870 million to local governments, $4.5 million to       
CalPERS, and $2.85 million to CalSTRS. California's cash management program for 
the general fund regularly issues short-term obligations to meet cash flow      
needs. California issues revenue anticipation notes ("RANs") to partially fund  
timing differences between revenues and expenditures. A significant portion of  
the general fund revenues are received in the second half of the fiscal year,   
while disbursements are paid more evenly throughout the fiscal year. If         
additional external cash flow borrowing is required, California issues revenue  
anticipation warrants ("RAWs").                                                 

  Risk Management. The State government has elected, with a few exceptions, to
be self-insured against loss or liability. Generally, the exceptions are when a 
bond resolution or a contract requires the State government to purchase         
commercial insurance for coverage against property loss or liability. There have
been no significant reductions in insurance coverage from the prior year. In    
addition, no insurance settlement in the last three years has exceeded insurance
coverage. The State government generally does not maintain reserves. Losses are 
covered by appropriations from each fund responsible for payment in the year in 
which the payment occurs. All claim payments are on a "pay as you go" basis,    
with workers' compensation benefits for self-insured agencies being initially   
paid by the State Compensation Insurance Fund. The potential amount of loss     
arising from risks other than workers' compensation benefits is not considered  
material in relation to the State government's financial position.              

   The discounted liability for unpaid self-insured workers' compensation losses
is estimated to be $2.3 billion as of June 30, 2007. This estimate is based on  
actuarial reviews of the State's employee workers' compensation program and     
includes indemnity payments to claimants, as well as all other costs of         
providing workers' compensation benefits, such as medical care and              
rehabilitation. The estimate also includes the liability for unpaid services    
fees, industrial disability leave benefits, and incurred-but-not-reported       
amounts. The estimated total liability of approximately $3.5 billion is         
discounted to $2.3 billion using a 5% interest rate. Of the total, $326 million 
is a current liability, of which $203 million is included in the General Fund,  
$122 million in the special revenue funds, and $1 million in the internal       
service funds. The remaining $2.0 billion is reported as other noncurrent       
liabilities in the government-wide Statement of Net Assets.                     

Proposed Budget 2008-2009. The Governor released his proposed budget on   
January 10, 2008. The 2008-09 proposed spending plan (assuming all proposed     
budget reductions are enacted) totals $141 billion. This spending plan          
represents estimated General Fund expenditures of $101 billion, special fund    
expenditures of $26.2 billion, and bond fund expenditures of $13.8 billion.     
Proposed General Fund expenditures are 2.3% less than the $103.4 billion        
expenditures estimated for the 2007-08 fiscal year.                             

The Governor's budget projects to end the 2007-08 fiscal year with a $2.8 
billion General Fund reserve in the Special Fund for Economic Uncertainties. The
Governor suspended the annual transfer to the Budget Stabilization Account      
required by Proposition 58, passed by California's voters in 2004. Proposition  
58 requires that, beginning in the 2007-08 fiscal year, the State transfer into 
the Budget Stabilization Account by September 30 of each year a specified       
portion of estimated General Fund revenues until the account balance reaches $8 
billion or 5% of the estimated General Fund revenues, whichever is greater,     
absent an executive order by the Governor.                                      

 In the 2008-09 Overview of the Governor's Budget, the Legislative Analyst's
Office (LAO) states that the Governor's budget revenue forecast is generally    
reasonable and the spending proposals are built upon solid assumptions about    
caseload and program requirements. However, the LAO added that, considering     
recent cash trends and economic reports, there are some risks in the Governor's 
assumptions. The proposed budget continues to demonstrate an annual operating   
shortfall, whereby the General Fund's operating expenses exceed its revenue.    

Proposed budget-balancing solutions include issuing $3.2 billion of       
additional deficit-financing bonds (actually issued on February 14, 2008);      
suspending the planned supplementary payments for early redemption of $1.5      
billion of outstanding deficit-financing bonds; accruing in fiscal year 2008-09 
$2.0 billion of the personal income and corporation tax revenue that will be    
received in fiscal year 2009-10; reducing K-14 education spending by $400       
million and suspending the Proposition 98 minimum-funding guarantee, resulting  
in $4.0 billion additional savings in education spending; and reducing spending 
in most state programs through $4.0 billion in across-the-board reductions.     

Ratings. As of July 2008, all outstanding general obligation bonds of the 
State of California are rated A+ by S&P and A1 by Moody's. Any explanation      
concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating    
agencies. There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of
time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.                             

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local California issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of  
obligations issued by the State of California, and there is no obligation on the
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

   Litigation. The State is a party to numerous legal proceedings, many of which
normally occur in governmental operations. In addition, the State is involved in
certain other legal proceedings that, if decided against the State might require
the State to make significant future expenditures or impair future revenue      
sources. Because of the prospective nature of these proceedings, it is not      
presently possible to predict the outcome of such litigation or estimate the    
potential impact on the ability of the State to pay debt service costs on its   
obligations.                                                                    

On March 31, 2008, the Court of Appeal, First Appellate District, ruled in
Computer Service Tax Cases (Dell, Inc. v. State Board of Equalization) that the 
State Board of Equalization improperly collected sales and use tax on optional  
service contracts that Dell, Inc. sold with computers. The decision will lead to
a judgment requiring the Board to refund the tax with interest. The amount of   
the refund has not been determined, but with interest may exceed $250 million,  
which would be made in the 2008-09 fiscal year.                                 

   On August 8, 2005, a lawsuit titled California Teachers Association et al. v.
Arnold Schwarzenegger et al. was filed. Plaintiffs - California Teachers        
Association, California Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack O'Connell, and
various other individuals - alleged that the California Constitution's minimum  
school funding guarantee was not followed for the 2004-2005 fiscal year and the 
2005-06 fiscal year in the aggregate amount of approximately $3.1 billion.      
Plaintiffs sought a writ of mandate requiring the State to recalculate the      
minimum-funding guarantee in compliance with the California Constitution. On May
10, 2006, counsel for all parties executed a settlement agreement, and the      
action was stayed pending implementation legislation. On September 29, 2006, the
Governor signed into law the Quality Education Investment Act ("QEIA") of 2006  
for the purposes of implementing the terms of the settlement. Under the QEIA,   
appropriations will provide certain school districts with approximately $268    
million in fiscal year 2007-08 and $402 million for each fiscal year thereafter 
until 2013-14.                                                                  

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
California IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description
of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject. 
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the California IM-IT,  
the market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective
issuers of such bonds acquired by the California IM-IT to pay interest on or    
principal of such bonds.                                                        

The California IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory  
factors affecting issuers of California municipal obligations (the "California  
Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain  
California constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives   
and other matters that are described. The information provided above is only a  
brief summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in       
California and is derived from the State of California Comprehensive Annual     
Financial Report For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2007 by The Office of the   
State Controller, dated March 28, 2008, and the State of California Financial   
Report for the Year Ended June 30, 2007 by the California State Auditor, dated  
March 28, 2008. These sources are generally available to investors and are      
believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the       
accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing information. It is based in    
part on information obtained from various State and local agencies in California
or contained in official statements for various California Municipal            
Obligations.                                                                    

 Colorado Risk Factors

General. The Colorado legislature's otherwise plenary power is checked by the
requirement for the Governor's signature of its legislation and by specific     
limitations placed in the State Constitution by voters. The most significant    
fiscal limitation is the restriction related to issuing debt, raising taxes, and
changing existing spending limits. From a fiscal perspective, the Joint Budget  
Committee of the legislature, because of its preparation of the annual budget   
and supplemental appropriations bills, holds the most important power vested in 
the legislature. The committee is bipartisan with members drawn from each of the
houses of the legislature. The Governor's Office of State Planning and Budgeting
(OSPB) develops an executive branch budget proposal, but there is no requirement
for the Joint Budget Committee to adopt that proposal.                          

Economic Outlook. Colorado's economy continues to outperform the national 
economy in most major benchmarks such as income growth, employment growth, the  
unemployment rate and inflation. According to the US Department of Commerce's   
Bureau of Economic Analysis, Colorado's economy grew 2.0 percent in 2007 in     
inflation-adjusted terms, to $198.4 billion, good for 20th out of the 50 states.
In per capita terms, Colorado has the 10th largest economy of the 50 states.    

Although not immune to national and global economic problems, current     
macroeconomic circumstances have impacted Colorado far less than other states,  
for several reasons. Colorado's high country experienced one of its snowiest    
winters in recorded history. This allowed ski resorts to open earlier, close    
later and open more terrain. According to Colorado Ski Country USA, skiers and  
snowboarders from all over the world spent their vacations at Colorado resorts  
this past winter, nearly matching the single season record of 12.5 million      
visits set just one year ago.                                                   

Global supply and demand dynamics conspired to push wholesale and retail  
energy prices ever higher, with oil prices projected by the investment bank     
Goldman Sachs to reach $150 per barrel during the summer of 2008. While the     
short-run impact to Colorado consumers is negative, the impact to the energy    
production sector, both conventional and renewable, has been far more positive. 
Oil prices have also made renewable energy producers more economically          
competitive. The cluster of major research universities and federal laboratories
on the Front Range has become a magnet for private-sector ventures in renewable 
energy. It appears this sector will lead the way for economic growth in Colorado
for the foreseeable future.                                                     

Due to economic concerns at the national level and an imbalance in real   
interest rates compared to other developed nations, the value of the dollar has 
fallen dramatically against benchmark currencies such as the Euro, the pound    
sterling and the Yen. This has hurt consumers by exacerbating price increases in
energy, food and other commodities. However, it has been a boon for exporters   
and for foreign direct investment. The weak dollar made a good ski season even  
better, as additional foreign tourists visited Colorado. In addition, the weak  
dollar makes land, buildings and labor relatively inexpensive for foreign       
companies and has recently encouraged significant high-profile investment in    
Colorado by foreign firms such as Siemens AG, Vestas Wind Systems A/S, Brisa, BP
PLC, Royal Dutch/Shell, EnCana, and Brookfield Properties.                      

 In 2007, Colorado employment rose 2.2 percent, a net increase of 51,100 new
jobs. Employment growth continues to be positive, but not at a rate sufficient  
to reduce the number of Coloradans actively searching for a job. Employment     
growth in Colorado is projected to be 1.4 percent in 2008 and 1.6 percent in    
2009. These figures are 0.0 and 0.2 percentage points lower than the March 2008 
forecast for 2008 and 2009, respectively.                                       

The 2007 Colorado unemployment rate dropped to 3.8 percent, the lowest    
reading since 2000. Although Colorado continues to fare better than other       
states, the employment outlook has softened somewhat since the March forecast.  
The most recent data from the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment shows 
an unemployment rate of 4.4 percent in April, which remains low by historical   
standards but portends some slack in the labor market. The unemployment rate is 
projected by OSPB to rise to 4.7 percent in 2008 and then gradually decline to  
4.1 percent by 2012.                                                            

During 2007, consumer prices in the Denver-Boulder-Greeley area increased 
only 2.2 percent - a relatively low rate of inflation by historical standards.  
However, due to continued increases in the three largest components of CPI      
(fuel, retail goods and rent-equivalent housing costs) since 2007, this OSPB    
forecast projects that local inflation will be 3.0 percent in 2008 and 3.2      
percent in 2009, an increase of 0.3 percentage points over the March 2008       
forecast in both years. This increase reflects the strong market for residential
apartments in the Denver area, which posted a vacancy rate of 2.7 percent in the
first quarter of 2008 according to the Colorado Department of Local Affairs, and
fuel prices that are anticipated to remain around the $4 per gallon mark for the
next couple of years, according to the US Department of Energy. Local consumer  
price index (CPI) data, released by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics      
semiannually, represents the average change in price over time for a market     
basket of goods and services.                                                   

 Personal income grew 6.0 percent in 2007. After adjusting for inflation and
population growth, real per capita income growth was 1.7 percent. Personal      
income is projected by OSPB to grow 6.1 percent in 2008 and 6.2 percent in 2009.
While these figures appear to be high with regard to a relatively soft economy, 
they incorporate increased inflationary pressures and do not reflect            
expectations of improved purchasing power for Colorado consumers.               

 Colorado wage and salary income rose 6.3 percent through 2007, reflecting a
relatively strong labor market, growth in the labor force and inflation. Wage   
and salary income is projected by OSPB to increase 5.6 percent in 2008 and 5.8  
percent in 2009. Compared to the March 2008 forecast of 5.5 percent growth in   
2008 and 5.6 percent growth in 2008, the June 2008 forecast essentially expects 
inflation to be priced into wage and salary demands with no significant increase
to real incomes.                                                                

 Population and Migration. In 2007, net in-migration to Colorado was 51,800,
which contributed to total population growth of 2.0 percent. OSPB projects net  
in-migration to grow slightly to 60,300 in 2008 and 61,000 in 2009, with total  
population growth of 2.0 percent in 2008 and 2.0 percent in 2009.               

  Construction. In 2007, residential construction permits dropped 22.6 percent
to 30,400, the third consecutive annual decline. Big-company inventory          
reductions suggest a trend among large and small developers alike: a turn away  
from expanding new subdivisions on the outskirts of metropolitan areas, and a   
turn inward where small, attached multifamily units, renovation and remodeling, 
and "walkable urbanity" both are on the rise. Multifamily permits are still     
growing slightly; however, it is not enough to offset the decline of            
single-family permits, 43.2 percent, for the first quarter of 2008 according to 
the US Census Bureau. Based on a total decline of 30 percent for all residential
permits through the first quarter of 2008, housing permits are projected by OSPB
to decline 14.9 and 1.0 percent in 2008 and 2009, respectively, putting further 
upward pressure on rents and inflation measures.                                

The total value of nonresidential construction permits statewide grew 10.4
percent to $4.3 billion in 2007. However, this growth is not anticipated to be  
sustainable in the current economy. Given there was a reported decline of 2.2   
percent in nonresidential construction permits just one year prior in 2006, the 
current OSPB forecast projects the growth of nonresidential permits to be a     
modest 2.2 percent in 2008 and 2.8 percent in 2009.                             

Retail Trade. In 2007, retail trade sales in Colorado rose 7.0 percent.   
Retail sales growth is projected to continue growing, but at a slower rate of   
4.3 percent in 2008 and 5.3 percent in 2009 due to rising consumer debt         
payments. These projected growth rates are down from the 5.4 and 5.5 percent    
figures forecast in March.                                                      

Debt Management. The State is constitutionally prohibited from issuing    
general obligation debt. However, the State has issued Certificates of          
Participation (COPs) secured by buildings and vehicles and has issued revenue   
bonds that are secured by pledges of future revenues. In some instances the     
debt-financed asset generates the pledged revenue stream; in other instances,   
such as the Transportation Revenue Anticipation Notes, the pledged revenue      
stream is future federal revenues and state highway users taxes. The State has  
other forms of borrowing that are small in relation to the revenue bonds and    
COPs.                                                                           

Except for exempt enterprises, the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights (TABOR)      
amendment requires a vote of the people for the creation of any debt unless     
existing cash reserves are irrevocably pledged to service the debt. The         
amendment does allow debt issuance to refinance a borrowing at a lower interest 
rate. These requirements limit management's ability to address revenue          
shortfalls by borrowing for capital expenditures.                               

Risk Management. The State self-insures its agencies, officials, and      
employees against the risk of loss related to general liability, motor vehicle  
liability, and workers' compensation. Property claims are not self-insured, as  
the State has purchased insurance. The State uses the General Fund to account   
for the risk management function including operations and all matured claims or 
judgments. Medical claims for officials and employees are managed through the   
Group Benefits Plan Fund, a Pension and Employee Benefits Trust Fund that also  
became self-insured during the 2005-06 fiscal year. The Regents of the          
University of Colorado, the Board of Governors of the Colorado State University 
System, and the Board of Trustees of University of Northern Colorado            
individually manage the risks to which they are exposed and do not participate  
in the State's risk management fund.                                            

 Risks to the Colorado Forecast. Although Colorado will fare better than the
rest of the country, it cannot be totally insulated from broader economic       
issues. Ongoing corrections in local real estate markets outside Colorado will  
indirectly impact Colorado, as fewer people will be able to afford to travel to 
or buy second homes in Colorado.                                                

   The ongoing re-pricing of risk will impact Colorado in subtle ways by raising
the interest rates at which local governments can float bonds, raising the costs
to start or expand a business and raising the costs to finance the purchase of a
home. Experts contend that the true magnitude of the subprime problem is vastly 
larger than what has already been announced through the writedown of hundreds of
billions of dollars worth of bad debts. Further weakness in the banking sector  
could cause businesses and consumers in Colorado to find it more difficult to   
borrow money, which would definitely have a negative impact on Colorado's       
economy.                                                                        

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Colorado issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of    
obligations issued by the State of Colorado, and there is no obligation on the  
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

Ratings. As of July 2008, all outstanding general obligation bonds of the 
State of Colorado are rated AA by S&P and unrated by Moody's. Any explanation   
concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating    
agencies. There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of
time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.                             

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in each     
Colorado Trust and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description  
of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject. 
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in each Colorado Trust,   
the market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective
issuers of such bonds acquired by each Colorado Trust to pay interest on or     
principal of such bonds.                                                        

Each Colorado Trust is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory   
factors affecting issuers of Colorado municipal obligations (the "Colorado      
Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain  
Colorado constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and 
other matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief
summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in Colorado and
is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and are       
believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the       
accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing information. It is based in    
part on information obtained from various State and local agencies in Colorado  
or contained in Official Statements for various Colorado Municipal Obligations. 

Connecticut Risk Factors

General. Connecticut has no system of county government. Below the State  
level, governing units consist of 169 municipalities. The General Statutes of   
Connecticut provide procedures for the creation of many types of local special  
purpose authorities, districts and similar bodies. Under Connecticut law, all   
municipal governmental bodies have only the powers specifically granted to them 
by the State and the ancillary powers that are necessarily implied by the powers
explicitly granted.                                                             

Economic Condition and Outlook. After almost eight years of solid economic
growth, Connecticut began to experience job losses in Fiscal Year 2001. Between 
fiscal years 2001 and 2003 the State lost over 60,000 payroll jobs. After three 
successive years of job losses, in Fiscal Year 2004 the State again experienced 
gains in payroll employment and by the end of Fiscal Year 2007 had regained most
of the jobs lost during the recession. Connecticut ended Fiscal Year 2007 with a
relatively low unemployment rate of 4.6 percent.                                

  Business, professional and financial services account for over 20 percent of
total employment in the State and retail and wholesale trade account for an     
additional 20 percent. These job sectors experienced solid growth during Fiscal 
Year 2007. Strong job growth was also seen in the leisure and hospitality       
sector. Manufacturing employment has continued to decline following a trend that
began over a decade ago, although the sector still accounts for over 10 percent 
of total payroll employment.                                                    

 Connecticut continues to lead the nation with per capita income of $53,827,
which is almost 40 percent above the national level. Connecticut's personal     
income has been growing at a rate of close to 6 percent and in Fiscal Year 2007 
hourly wages increased by 4.7 percent. Connecticut's strong income growth has   
helped fuel the tax revenues that created budget surpluses over the past four   
fiscal years.                                                                   

  Like most other states, Connecticut has been experiencing a recent slow down
in housing activities with permits and new home sales declining. As at the      
national level, Connecticut's economy is expected to slow in 2008 with stagnant 
employment and modest income growth. Connecticut is expected to slightly        
outperform the national economy due to its strong income base and the           
diversification of its industries. The Fiscal Year 2008 budget submitted by the 
Governor recognizes this slowing growth trend.                                  

Major Policy Initiatives and Priorities.                                  
 Tax Cuts. Enacted tax cuts reduced fiscal year 2007 General Fund revenue by
over $125 million. The tax cuts were targeted to individuals and businesses. The
largest dollar tax reductions were on the individual income tax. The property   
tax credit that could be claimed on the income tax was raised from a maximum of 
$400 to $500 and a deduction was added for contributions to the Connecticut     
Higher Education Trust Fund. The sales tax free period for residential          
weatherization purchases was extended by two months. Business taxes were reduced
by eliminating a 15 percent corporation tax surcharge. Tax credits were also    
added to encourage businesses to locate in Connecticut and to hire displaced    
workers.                                                                        

  Reducing Long-Term Liabilities with Surplus Dollars. The State has committed
in excess of half a billion dollars of fiscal year 2006 and 2007 surplus to     
reducing the unfunded liability in the Teachers' Retirement Fund, a state       
sponsored retirement program for municipal and state teachers. The percentage of
liabilities covered by assets in the fund had slipped over time from just over  
80 percent to just below 60 percent. These additional contributions are intended
to increase the funding level and reduce the State's long-term liability in this
area. The State also committed $10 million of fiscal year 2007 surplus to       
pre-fund the Other Post Employment Benefits ("OPEB") liability that will be     
reported on the financial statements beginning in fiscal year 2008. These       
liabilities relate to health insurance benefits extended by the State to its    
retirees. In fiscal year 2008 all states will be required to report such        
liabilities as they do now with pension obligations. This is a first step by the
State to acknowledge the need to advance fund these benefits.                   

   Long-term planning. Future spending plans include several major projects that
are on the horizon. For example, at the beginning of the new fiscal year, the   
State bond commission granted approval to sell bonds to build new infrastructure
throughout the State. The Governor and legislature have committed long-term     
funding to improve the State's roads and highways and public transportation     
systems. This commitment resulted in the sale, by the Treasurer in October 2007,
of Special Tax Obligation bonds in the amount of $250 million. It is expected   
that special legislation will continue to empower the State bond commission to  
authorize additional financing of the infrastructure program each year. Other   
bond commission approvals were granted that provide for better housing, school  
facilities, and the continuation work on waste and drinking water control       
projects.                                                                       

 Budgetary and Other Control Systems. In November 1992, electors approved an
amendment to the State Constitution providing that the amount of general budget 
expenditures authorized for any fiscal year shall not exceed the estimated      
amount of revenue for such fiscal year.                                         

This amendment also provided a framework for placing a cap on budgeted    
appropriations. Annual budgeted appropriations are capped at a percentage       
increase that is based on either the five-year average annual growth in the     
State's personal income or inflation, whichever is higher. Debt service         
payments, certain statutory grants to distressed municipalities, and            
appropriations required by federal mandate or court order are excluded from the 
limits of the cap.                                                              

The spending cap can be lifted if the Governor declares the existence of  
extraordinary circumstances and the General Assembly by a three-fifths vote     
approves appropriations in excess of the cap. This has occurred in several      
fiscal years to allow direct appropriations of surplus to be substituted for    
debt financing, and other permit other spending initiatives from surplus funds. 

   Budget control is maintained at the individual appropriation account level by
agency as established in authorized appropriation bills. The allotment process  
exercises control over obligations or commitments. The Governor, through his    
budget office, allots funds for both budgeted and non-budgeted accounts and     
funds. The Governor is permitted to modify appropriations through the allotment 
process under certain circumstances and within percentage limitations specified 
by the General Assembly.                                                        

Elected officials, agency commissioners, directors of public benefit      
corporations and agency managers are responsible for establishing internal      
control structures. Good internal control systems ensure that: resource use is  
consistent with laws, regulations and policies; resources are safeguarded       
against waste, loss and misuse; and reliable data are obtained, maintained and  
fairly disclosed in reports. The Office of the State Comptroller has worked to  
improve the overall internal control environment in state government. This work 
has included improvements to the central state accounting system that advance   
internal control efforts.                                                       

Revenues and Expenses. Total revenues for the governmental activities     
increased, by $0.8 billion, to $19.2 billion. This increase was due mainly to an
increase in tax revenue of $0.9 billion being offset by a decrease in operating 
and capital grants of $0.2 billion. Total expenses increased by $0.7 billion to 
$18.1 billion. This increase can be attributed mainly to increases in general   
government and education expenses of $0.5 billion. Even though total revenues   
exceeded total expenses by $1,098 million, this excess was reduced by transfers 
of $866 million, resulting in an increase of net assets of $232 million.        

  As noted above, total revenue increased by 4 percent during the fiscal year,
reflecting continued economic growth. Both State and national economic          
indicators were generally positive during the fiscal year. Preliminary estimates
showed that 20,400 jobs were added to the State economy during the fiscal year, 
and the unemployment rate was a relatively low 4.3 percent. In the third quarter
of the fiscal year, the State had the second highest personal income growth in  
the nation with a 3.5 percent increase. Annualized personal income growth       
through the same quarter was over 5 percent. Retail sales grew 3.8 percent,     
while major stock indexes grew at double digit rates and corporate profit growth
was solid during the fiscal year. The housing market continued to show signs of 
weakness during the fiscal year both nationally and in the State.               

Total revenues and expenses of business-type activities were virtually    
unchanged between fiscal years 2007 and 2006. Although, total expenses exceeded 
total revenues by $545 million, this deficiency was offset by transfers of $866 
million, resulting in an increase in net assets of $321 million.                

Capital Assets. As of June 30, 2007 the State had an investment in total  
capital assets (net of accumulated depreciation) of $13.2 billion. During the   
fiscal year, capital assets of governmental activities and business-type        
activities increased by $197 million and $33 million, respectively. Depreciation
charges for the fiscal year totaled $1.0 billion.                               

  Debt. The State, pursuant to various public and special acts, has authorized
a variety of types of debt which fall into the following categories: direct     
general obligation debt, which is payable from the State's general fund; special
tax obligation debt, which is payable from the debt service fund; and revenue   
debt, which is payable from specific revenues of enterprise funds.              

In fiscal year 2007 the State increased outstanding bonds by $189 million.
Bonds of governmental activities increased by $148 million while bonds of       
business-type activities increased by $41 million. The State's General          
Obligation bonds are rated Aa3, AA and AA by Moody's, S&P and Fitch             
respectively. Special Tax Obligation bonds are rated Aaa, AAA, AAA by Moody's,  
S&P and Fitch respectively.                                                     

Section 3-21 of the Connecticut General Statutes provides that the total  
amount of bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness payable from General  
fund tax receipts authorized by the General Assembly but have not been issued   
and the total amount of such indebtedness which has been issued and remains     
outstanding shall not exceed 1.6 times the total estimated General fund tax     
receipts of the State for the current fiscal year. In computing the indebtedness
at any time, revenue anticipation notes, refunded indebtedness, bond            
anticipation notes, tax increment financing, budget deficit bonding, revenue    
bonding, balances in debt retirement funds and other indebtedness pursuant to   
certain provisions of the General Statutes shall be excluded from the           
calculation. As of February 2007, the State had a debt-incurring margin of $4.5 
billion.                                                                        

Ratings. As of July 2008, all outstanding general obligation bonds of the 
State of Connecticut are rated AA by S&P and Aa3 by Moody's. Any explanation    
concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating    
agencies. There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of
time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.                             

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Connecticut issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of 
obligations issued by the State of Connecticut, and there is no obligation on   
the part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of 
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in each     
Connecticut Trust and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive           
description of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations  
are subject. Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and 
environmental policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the  
issuers of such bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the      
financial condition of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions
thereof. The Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors
or other factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in each          
Connecticut Trust, the market value or marketability of such bonds or the       
ability of the respective issuers of such bonds acquired by each Connecticut    
Trust to pay interest on or principal of such bonds.                            

Each Connecticut Trust is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory
factors affecting issuers of Connecticut municipal obligations (the "Connecticut
Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain  
Connecticut constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives  
and other matters that are described. The information provided is only a brief  
summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in Connecticut 
and is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and are   
believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the       
accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing information. It is based in    
part on information obtained from various state and local agencies in           
Connecticut or contained in Official Statements for various Connecticut         
Municipal Obligations.                                                          

Florida Risk Factors

State Profile. Florida's government provides a full range of services     
including education, health and family services, transportation, law and        
corrections, natural resources, and environmental and other services. The       
financial reporting entity of Florida includes the primary government as well as
component units for which the State is financially accountable. Florida law     
strictly prohibits overspending and requires budgetary control to be maintained 
at the individual appropriation account level. Florida's budget focuses on the  
needs of the State and its citizens, as well as desired results of programs and 
services. Chapter 216 of the Florida Statutes promulgates the process used to   
develop the budget for Florida. Florida's conservative fiscal policies include  
reserves that may be utilized to meet Florida's tax revenue shortfalls. The fund
balance reserved for budget stabilization is intended to cover revenue          
shortfalls and emergencies as defined by law.                                   

Economic Outlook. Florida's economy is currently experiencing a decline in
overall rates of growth and a significant downturn in its housing market. The   
rate of job creation outside the agricultural sector has slowed by almost two   
percent compared to the prior year. Population growth, the historical major     
driving force behind Florida's economy, is showing signs of leveling off for the
first time in decades. Rates of unemployment have increased slightly. Downward  
trends in consumer spending and real estate sales are resulting in either flat  
or declining general tax revenues to the State government. Property insurance   
bills for Florida homeowners have not decreased as expected when lawmakers      
passed legislation to shift a portion of catastrophic risk from private         
insurance markets to the State government. Homeowners are also feeling pressure 
from higher property tax bills as local governments generated revenues to handle
the needs of rapidly increasing populations in the past.                        

   General fund tax collections for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 were 3.8
percent lower than the prior fiscal year. Sales tax collections, the State's    
primary source of general revenue, were essentially flat, showing only minor    
growth from the prior year. This is primarily due to a decline in consumer      
spending related to rebuilding after the hurricane events of 2004 and 2005 as   
well as declining spending levels related to record-level rates of housing      
construction, which peaked in 2006. Collections of documentary stamp taxes,     
which result from sales of real estate, declined significantly compared to the  
prior fiscal year.                                                              

Although Florida's housing market reflects national trends, it has proven 
more vulnerable to the real-estate market downturn due to the popularity of     
second homes and speculative investment activity in recent years. The overall   
trend for other sources of general fund revenues, such as corporate income taxes
and intangible taxes, show either consistency with the prior fiscal year or     
decline. Despite the pressure on general fund revenues, the State was able to   
slightly improve its cash reserves during the year.                             

   A special legislative session was held in October 2007 to address anticipated
revenue shortfalls predicted by revenue estimates prepared in August 2007. The  
resulting action, Chapter 2007-326, Laws of Florida, permanently reduced        
Florida's budget by over $1 billion for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2008.   
The most recent revenue estimate prepared in November 2007 reduces estimated    
general fund revenue collections by an additional $1 billion for the fiscal     
ending June 30, 2008. The November estimate is lower than fiscal year 2006-07   
collections by 3.5 percent, or $933 million. Future legislative action may be   
required to make spending reductions to offset any fiscal year 2007-08 revenue  
shortfalls which can't be absorbed by the State's working capital balance. State
agencies have been advised that they should plan to reduce discretionary        
spending as well as delay the implementation of new or improved programs with   
recurring costs, until reduction plans are finalized for the 2007-2008 and      
2008-2009 fiscal years.                                                         

   Florida's underlying economic fundamentals remain sound as evidenced by lower
but continued population growth and good growth in personal incomes. Six years  
of above-average economic growth yielded strong revenue growth and consistent   
operating surpluses. The State's audited financial reports consistently show    
significant unreserved fund balances which are available for use for the        
purposes of the various funds. The unreserved fund balance for all governmental 
funds was approximately $9.2 billion at June 30, 2007. Despite downward trends  
in general revenue tax collections, the State was able to increase the fund     
balance of the budget stabilization fund by 14 percent to $1.2 billion for the  
fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The budget stabilization fund is reserved for  
use to offset general fund deficits and other purposes. Maintenance of this     
reserve is an indication of fiscal strength. Florida continues to follow        
conservative fiscal management practices as evidenced by the quick response to  
reduce spending for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2008.                       

 Financial Trends. These trends help assess how Florida's financial position
has changed over time. For fiscal year 2006-07 (ended June 30, 2007) the net    
assets invested in governmental activities increased 4.48 percent as compared to
10.87 percent in fiscal year 2005-06. The net assets invested in business-type  
activities increased 37.40 percent as compared to a 30.28 percent decrease in   
fiscal year 2005-06. This significant increase follows a decrease that was      
primarily a result of reimbursements for losses associated with four hurricanes 
in 2004. The net assets invested in the total primary government (which includes
governmental activities and business-type activities) increased 7.89 percent in 
fiscal year 2006-07 as compared to 4.49 percent in fiscal year 2005-06.         

  Revenues and Expenditures. This information relates to Florida's significant
revenue sources and can assist with evaluating the government's ability to      
produce its own source revenues. Governmental funds include general, special    
revenue, capital projects and debt service funds. Revenues are recognized when  
they are both measurable and available to finance current expenditures.         
Florida's revenues totaled approximately $34.66 billion while the expenses      
totaled approximately $65.22 billion. The total governmental fund balance was   
approximately $19.43 billion.                                                   

  The net expense is the difference between the program revenues and expenses.
It indicates the degree to which a function or program is supported with its own
fees and program-specific grants and its reliance upon funding from general     
revenues. The total primary government net expense for fiscal year 2006-07 was  
$30.55 billion as compared to $33.58 billion resulting in a decrease in the     
expense of 9.0%.                                                                

  Debt Management. This information will provide an understanding of Florida's
outstanding debt and its ability to issue new debt. Florida's Constitution and  
statutes require that Florida not run a deficit in its budget as a whole, or in 
any separate fund within its budget. Rather, its budget and funds must be kept  
in balance from currently available revenues each fiscal year. If the Governor  
of Florida or the Comptroller of Florida believes a deficit will occur in any   
fund, by statute, he must certify his opinion to Florida's Administrative       
Commission, which then is authorized to reduce all Florida agency budgets and   
releases by a sufficient amount to prevent a deficit in any fund. Additionally, 
the Florida Constitution prohibits Florida from borrowing by issuing bonds to   
fund its operations.                                                            

 Section 11 of Article VII of the Florida Constitution authorizes Florida to
issue general obligation bonds and revenues bonds to finance or refinance the   
cost of state fixed capital outlay projects authorized by law. General          
obligation bonds are secured by the full faith and credit of Florida and payable
from the proceeds of various taxes. Revenue bonds are payable from funds that   
receive legally restricted revenues. The Florida Division of Bond Finance of the
Florida State Board of Administration has the responsibility to issue all state 
bonds.                                                                          

Florida's outstanding general obligation bonds at June 30, 2007, totaled  
approximately $23.9 billion and were issued to finance such capital outlays as  
educational projects of local school districts, community colleges and state    
universities, environmental protection and highway construction. During the     
fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, the State took advantage of favorable          
conditions and issued bonds for the purpose of refunding previously issued      
bonds. The refundings of these bond series were made in order to obtain lower   
interest rates and the resulting savings in debt service payments over the life 
of the bonds. Also, the legal debt margin calculated for fiscal year 2006-07 is 
$166 million as compared to $298 million fiscal year 2005-06.                   

Declining revenue collections recently resulted in a key debt ratio of the
State moving near a target limit set by the legislature as a component of       
conservative fiscal policies. As long as revenue collections available to pay   
debt service remain lower than anticipated, the State does not have additional  
bonding capacity beyond already authorized programs while staying below this    
target. Any long-term borrowings not already authorized must be evaluated with a
higher threshold for justification considering the importance of maintaining    
Florida's excellent bond ratings, which serve to keep the cost of borrowing low.

 Litigation. Currently under litigation are several issues relating to state
actions or state taxes that put at risk a portion of General Revenue Fund       
monies. There is no assurance whether any such matters, individually or in the  
aggregate, will have a materially adverse effect on Florida's financial         
position.                                                                       

The Future. Challenges lay ahead as compromises are made to reduce state  
spending in light of declining general revenues. The Florida Legislature has    
already reduced planned spending by over $1 billion for the fiscal year ending  
June 30, 2008. Now it appears that additional spending reductions are needed as 
revenue collections continue to be below projections.                           

Ratings. As of July 2008, all outstanding general obligation bonds of the 
State of Florida are rated AAA by S&P and Aa1 by Moody's. Any explanation       
concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating    
agencies. There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of
time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.                             

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Florida issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of     
obligations issued by the State of Florida, and there is no obligation on the   
part of Florida to make payment on such local obligations in the event of       
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Florida IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of
all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject.    
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of Florida and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The Sponsor 
is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other factors may
affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Florida IM-IT, the market value
or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective issuers of such 
bonds acquired by the Florida IM-IT to pay interest on or principal of such     
bonds.                                                                          

   The Florida IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory factors
affecting issuers of Florida municipal obligations (the "Florida Municipal      
Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain Florida    
constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and other    
matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief

accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing information. It is based in

contained in Official Statements for various Florida Municipal Obligations.     

Georgia Risk Factors

State Profile. Georgia is an economic hub of the southeast. The capital in
Atlanta is the major economic and population center of the State with major     
regional economic and population centers in Augusta, Savannah, and Macon.       
Georgia's economic base is diverse with major port facilities on the coast,     
agricultural resources throughout the State, manufacturing and service          
industries, and is a major transportation hub with the busiest airport in the   
nation. Georgia is the ninth largest state with a population of 9.54 million    
people.                                                                         

Economic Condition and Outlook. Georgia's economy in fiscal year 2007     
continued its recent rapid growth following the recession of 2001. Key          
components of the tax stream most closely associated with the State's economic  
trends and conditions continued to experience year over year revenue growth in  
fiscal year 2007. These include the individual income tax, sales and use tax,   
and corporate income tax. Based on revenues reported on a statutory basis,      
fiscal year 2007 individual income tax revenues grew 10 percent over fiscal year
2006. Fiscal year 2007 sales and use tax revenues grew by 3.6 percent, while    
corporate income tax revenues grew by 18.1 percent. This is the third           
consecutive year in which corporate income tax revenues have experienced growth 
rates in excess of 10 percent. Estimated payments by corporations grew by 20.5  
percent; this growth reflects, in part, the high growth rate in corporate       
profits reported by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Refunds to corporate  
taxpayers were up 19.8 percent, and assessments to corporate taxpayers were down
20.9 percent for the fiscal year.                                               

Economic indicators for Georgia demonstrate that the State's economy      
continues to grow although growth has moderated since fiscal year 2006.         

The unemployment rate remains low in Georgia at 4.6 percent for September 
2007. This compares to the U.S. unemployment rate of 4.7 percent the same month.
An unemployment rate of approximately 5 percent is generally considered to      
constitute full employment. The number of establishments reporting employment   
activity that are located in Georgia continues to expand. For the fourth quarter
of 2006, the latest data available, the number of establishments in Georgia     
increased by 4.5 percent over the prior year. This compares to 3 percent for the
U.S. as a whole.                                                                

   The economic outlook for Georgia is clouded by the national housing downturn,
high energy prices and slowing consumer spending. The housing slowdown is       
affecting the economy directly through lower construction activity and          
indirectly through its impact on consumers' financial situations due to         
declining prices in some regions and tougher mortgage lending standards. In     
addition, drought conditions in Georgia and other parts of the southeast could  
have an impact on agriculture and manufacturing activity in Georgia.            

Economic Factors. The trend for economic recovery in the U. S. has been   
similar for the State of Georgia. On January 11, 2008, the Department of Revenue
announced that net revenue collections during the month of December for fiscal  
year 2008, increased by $470 thousand or less than 1 percent from the same      
period in fiscal year 2007. The year-to-date collections for December 2007      
increased by $348 million or 4.2 percent from the prior year.                   

  The Georgia Department of Labor reported the November 2007 unemployment rate
to be 4.2 percent, or 205,722 of a civilian labor force of 4.9 million, down    
from the prior month's rate of 4.7 percent. The November 2007 rate also         
indicated a decrease of 0.2 percent from the same month of the prior year.      

Total non-farm employment continues to expand in Georgia. Job additions as
measured by the increase in total non-farm employment from September 2006       
through September 2007 as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics totaled    
74,300 jobs, an increase of 1.8 percent. This compares to the U.S. employment   
growth rate of about 1.2 percent for the same period.                           

  The housing sector in Georgia has slowed. Home permits issued in August 2007
were approximately 30 percent below the number of permits issued in August 2006 
calculated on a three month moving average basis. Although construction activity
has slowed, housing price indicators show that overall home prices in the State 
are not falling as they are in many regional markets. The Office of Federal     
Housing Enterprise Oversight index indicates that the median price of homes in  
Georgia increased about 4.7 percent in the second quarter of 2007 over the prior
year compared to 3.2 percent for the U.S. The S&P/Case Shiller repeat purchase  
index indicates that prices in the metropolitan Atlanta area increased 1.2      
percent in July 2007 over July 2006. For a composite of twenty metropolitan     
areas, this index decreased 3.9 percent over this period.                       

Major Initiatives                                                         

   Educated Georgia. A major focus, demonstrated through continuous improvements
to the quality of education in the State, is to ensure that Georgia students are
well prepared for the future. The State, which provided nearly $7.4 billion in  
funding for enrollment of over 1.6 million students, a 2.65 percent increase    
over fiscal year 2006, is committed to strategic initiatives designed to        
increase the graduation rate and to improve student achievement.                

 Healthy Georgia. Emphasis is being placed on services in community settings
and serving individuals in homes as opposed to institutional settings. Child    
care and safety are being addressed with technology and programs to improve     
service delivery. Care management, eligibility verification, and utilization    
controls have reduced the rate of growth in both Medicaid and PeachCare for     
Kids. In addition, the Department of Community Health has implemented strategic 
premium pricing in the State Health Benefit Plan to help drive employees towards
lower-cost consumer-driven health plans. The State's cost containment           
initiatives are estimated to save $4.2 billion over 5 years.                    

   Safe Georgia. The State continues to address a growing prison population with
increased funding for facilities and rehabilitation and drug treatment programs.
Funding targets law enforcement, DUI courts, drug enforcement and prevention    
programs continue to receive attention and funding.                             

  Best Managed. The State continues to focus on efforts to place Georgia on an
efficient and effective foundation. The Commission for a New Georgia is an      
innovative public-private partnership formed to create breakthrough ideas to    
help Georgia become a better-managed state and to envision Georgia's strategic  
future. Initiatives to improve government operations are focused on procurement 
processes, facilities and fleet asset management, customer service, employee    
management, financial management and strategic planning. In maintaining the     
State's pursuit of fiscal responsibility, the Governor and legislature have     
taken steps to fund the State's annual required contributions for retired state 
employees' health care with an initial appropriation of $147 million in fiscal  
year 2008 with additional increases in fiscal year 2009.                        

   Growing Georgia. Georgia continues to be one of the fastest growing states in
the nation with a population increase of 2.2 percent between July 2006 and July 
2007, the fastest growth in the South. Meeting demands of an ever increasing    
population requires major investment in infrastructure maintenance and          
development. The State continues to invest in transportation to improve highways
around its rapidly growing cities and to spur economic development around the   
State.                                                                          

Budgetary Highlights. The final budget exceeded original appropriations by
approximately $8.4 billion. This increase resulted primarily from $2.9 billion  
of federal revenues, and $4.9 billion of other revenues being amended into the  
budget by the State organizations that anticipated earning the funds.           
Additionally, the State's Supplementary Appropriations Act increased budgeted   
state general revenues by $504 million.                                         

   At fiscal year end, funds available were approximately $2.4 billion less than
final budgetary estimates and expenditures were approximately $3.5 billion less 
than final budgetary estimates, resulting in an excess of funds available over  
expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion.                                     

Excesses of state funds existing as of the end of each fiscal year are    
reserved and added to the budgetary Revenue Shortfall Reserve. The reserve      
cannot exceed 10 percent of the previous fiscal year net budgetary revenue for  
any given fiscal year and up to 1 percent of the preceding fiscal year's        
budgetary net revenue collections may be appropriated from the reserve to fund  
increased educational needs. The State's economic growth contributed to an      
increase of $767 million in the Revenue Shortfall Reserve for the current year, 
resulting in the fiscal year 2007 balance of $1.73 billion. The reserve amount  
was 9.2 percent of budgetary net revenue collections and $188 million of the    
reserve is available fund increased educational needs.                          

 Debt Administration. The Georgia State Financing and Investment Commission,
an agency of the State, is empowered by law to receive the proceeds from the    
issuance of State of Georgia general obligation and guaranteed revenue debt, to 
provide for the proper application of use of the debt proceeds, and to establish
the procedures for protecting the holders of such debt. At the end of the       
current fiscal year, the State had total bonded debt outstanding of $8.8        
billion.                                                                        

  Cash Management. The State's investment policy is to maximize the protection
of State funds on deposit while accruing an advantageous yield of interest by   
investing the funds in excess of those required for current operating expenses. 
Cash is managed in pooled funds to maximize interest earnings. Types of         
investments are dictated by legislation and are reviewed quarterly. The State   
Depository Board is designated by State law as the oversight Board for Georgia's
cash management and investment policies. The Office of Treasury and Fiscal      
Services ("OTFS") acts as the administrative agent of the Board. OTFS invests   
temporarily idle cash in statewide investment pools. All such funds are invested
considering first the probable safety of capital and then probable income, while
meeting daily cash flow requirements and conforming to all statutes governing   
the investment of public funds.                                                 

Risk Management. The State is self-insured against certain property and   
liability claims, including workers' compensation and unemployment compensation.
The Risk Management Funds accumulate reserves for certain property and liability
risks and pay for commercial insurance coverage. Revenues are generated from    
premiums charged to state and local government organizations. Various risk      
control techniques are utilized to minimize accident-related losses; risk       
managers also identify unique loss exposures and develop strategies to reduce   
the cost of risk associated with individual business operations.                

Ratings. As of July 2008, all outstanding general obligation bonds of the 
State of Georgia are rated AAA by S&P and Aaa by Moody's. Any explanation       
concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating    
agencies. There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of
time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.                             

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Georgia issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of     
obligations issued by the State of Georgia, and there is no obligation on the   
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Georgia IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of
all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject.    
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Georgia IM-IT, the 
market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective    
issuers of such bonds acquired by the Georgia IM-IT to pay interest on or       
principal of such bonds.                                                        

   The Georgia IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory factors
affecting issuers of Georgia municipal obligations (the "Georgia Municipal      
Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain Georgia    
constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and other    
matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief      
summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in Georgia and 
is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and are       
believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the       
accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing information. It is based in    
part on information obtained from various State and local agencies in Georgia or
contained in Official Statements for various Georgia Municipal Obligations.     

 Kansas Risk Factors

State Profile. The annual budget serves as the foundation of the State's  
financial planning and control. On or before October 1, agencies are required to
submit annually or biennially budget estimates for the next fiscal year to the  
Division of Budget. These estimates are used in preparing the Governor's budget 
report. On or before the eighth calendar day of each regular legislative        
session, the Governor is required to submit the budget report to the            
Legislature. However in the case of the regular legislative session immediately 
following the election of a governor who was elected to the Office of Governor  
for the first time, that governor must submit the budget report to the          
Legislature on or before the 21st calendar day of that regular session.         

 Economic Factors and Next Year's Budgets and Rates. According to the Kansas
Department of Labor Kansas Labor Market Information News Release for July 2007, 
employment for nonfarm jobs in the State of Kansas for June 2007 is improving.  
Compared to June 2006, employment increased by 32,800 jobs for a total of 1.4   
million nonfarm jobs. Kansas has had 12 consecutive months of over-the-year job 
growth. The unemployment rate was 4.8% for June 2007, compared to 4.7% in June  
2006.                                                                           

Net assets may serve over time as a useful indicator of the financial     
position of a government. The combined net assets of the State (government and  
business-type activities) totaled $11.1 billion at the end of 2007, compared to 
$10.5 billion at the end of the previous year, an increase of 5.1%.             

  The largest portion of net assets reflects investment in capital assets such
as land, buildings, equipment, and infrastructure (roads, bridges, and other    
immovable assets), less any related debt used to acquire those assets that are  
still outstanding. The State uses these capital assets to provide services to   
citizens; consequently, these assets are not available for future spending.     
Although investment in its capital assets is reported net of related debt, it   
should be noted that the resources needed to repay this debt must be provided   
from other sources, since the capital assets themselves cannot be used to       
liquidate these liabilities.                                                    

Financial Highlights. The assets of the State exceeded its liabilities at 
fiscal year ending June 30, 2007 by $11.1 billion (presented as "net assets").  
Of this amount, $338.7 million was reported as unrestricted net assets, which   
represents the amount available to be used to meet ongoing obligations to       
citizens and creditors.                                                         

 Total net assets increased by $536.5 million (5.1% increase) in fiscal year
2007. Net assets of governmental activities increased by $413.4 million (4.3%   
increase), and net assets of the business-type activities increased $123.1      
million (12.7% increase).                                                       

Fund Highlights. For fiscal year 2007, the governmental funds reported a  
combined ending fund balance of $1.4 billion, an increase of $35.8 million in   
comparison with the prior year. Of the total amount, $620.5 million represents  
the fund balance of the Transportation Fund. There is $120.3 million in the     
"unreserved fund balances". The reserved balances of $1.3 billion include the   
reserve for advances to other funds of $102.9 million and the reserve for       
encumbrances of $1.1 billion.                                                   

Revenues and Expenditures. During 1990, the Kansas legislature enacted    
legislation-establishing minimum ending balances for the State General Fund to  
ensure financial solvency for the State. The act established targeted year-end  
State General Fund balances as a percentage of state expenditures for the       
forthcoming fiscal year. This act was phased in over several years and currently
requires an ending balance of at least 7.5% of expenditures and demand          
transfers.                                                                      

  Estimates for the State General Fund are developed using a consensus revenue
estimate approach. Pursuant to K.S.A. 75-6701, on or before each December 4 or  
each April 4, the Director of the Budget and the Director of the Legislative    
Research Department shall prepare a joint estimate of revenue to the State      
General Fund for the current and the ensuing fiscal year. If legislation is     
passed affecting State General Fund revenue, the two directors prepare a joint  
estimate of such revenue. If the two directors are unable to agree on the joint 
estimates, the Legislature must use the estimate of the Director of Legislative 
Research and the Governor must use the estimate of the Director of the Budget.  
(To date, the two directors have successfully reached agreement on these revenue
estimates.)                                                                     

The focus of the State's governmental funds is to provide information on  
near-term inflows, outflows, and balances of expendable resources. Such         
information is useful in assessing the financing requirements. In particular,   
unreserved fund balance may serve as a useful measure of a government's net     
resources available for spending at the end of the fiscal year.                 

  For fiscal year 2007, the governmental funds reported a combined ending fund
balance of $1.4 billion, an increase of $35.8 million in comparison with the    
prior year. Part of this fund balance is reserved to indicate that it is not    
available for new spending because it has already been committed to liquidate   
contracts and purchase orders of the prior fiscal year in the amount of $1.1    
billion and for advances in the amount of $144.3 million.                       

  The General Fund is the chief operating fund of the State. At the end of the
current fiscal year, unreserved fund balance of the General Fund was $792       
million, while the total fund balance reached $820.9 million. As a measure of   
liquidity of the General Fund, it may be useful to compare both unreserved fund 
balance and total fund balance to total fund expenditures. Unreserved fund      
balance represents 12.8% of total General Fund expenditures, while total fund   
balance represents 13.3% of that same amount. The fund balance in the General   
Fund increased by $148.9 million during the current fiscal year.                

Cash Management. On a daily basis, the State monitors receipts to, and    
expenditures out of, the State Treasury. It also employs cash flow tools and    
techniques that maximize revenues without incurring undue risk. The State       
invests idle funds to match anticipated cash flow needs by using government     
securities, collateralized bank deposits, and high grade commercial paper to    
provide safety, liquidity, and yield, in that order. As a cash flow management  
policy, the State seeks to avoid borrowing from its own idle funds to meet      
expenditure obligations of the State General Fund.                              

Debt Management. The State of Kansas finances a portion of its capital    
expenditures with various debt instruments. Revenue bonds and loans from the    
Pooled Money Investment Board finance most debt-financed capital improvements   
for buildings, while "master lease" and "third-party" financing pays for most   
capital equipment. The State of Kansas does not have the statutory authority to 
issue general obligation bonds. The Legislature has authorized the issuance of  
specific purpose revenue bonds and other forms of long-term obligations. The    
Kansas Finance Development Authority ("KDFA") is a public body politic and      
corporate, constituting an independent instrumentality of the State of Kansas.  
It was created to enhance the ability of the State to finance capital           
improvements and improve access to long-term financing for State agencies,      
political subdivisions, public and private organizations, and businesses. The   
total long-term bond debt obligations decreased by $51.7 million during the     
current fiscal year. The key factor in this decrease was the scheduled and early
principal paid on bonds exceeded the bonds issued during the year. Bonds issued 
during the year include $13.2 million for State of Kansas Projects, KDFA Series 
2006L, $24.8 million for Transportation Revolving Funds, KDFA Series 2006 TR,   
$27.8 million for KSU Housing System, KDFA Series 2007A, $6.3 million for KU    
Recreation Center Expansion, KFDA 2007E, and $34.5 million for the IMPACT       
program, KDFA Series 2007F.                                                     

The State's total long-term debt obligation showed a net decrease of $13.7
million (0.3%) during the current year. This decrease was primarily due to a    
$37.8 million decrease in revenue bonds, a $13.9 million decrease in STAR bonds,
and a $38 million increase in other long-term obligations.                      

   Ratings. The State of Kansas has no general obligation debt rating because it
issues no general obligations debt by Constitutional law; however, as of July   
2008, S&P and Moody's assigned an issuer credit rating of AA+ and Aa1           
respectively, to the State of Kansas. Any explanation concerning the            
significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies. There   
can be no assurances that such ratings will be maintained in the future.        

   Litigation. The State is a defendant in numerous legal proceedings pertaining
to matters incidental to the performance of routine governmental operations.    
Such litigation includes, but is not limited to, claims asserted against the    
State arising from alleged torts, alleged breaches of contracts, condemnation   
proceedings and other alleged violations of State and Federal laws. Known       
claims, asserted and unasserted, have been evaluated for the likelihood of an   
unfavorable outcome. After review, it is the State's opinion, according to the  
State's financial report, that its ultimate liability in these cases, if any, is
not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the 
State, except for potential litigation involving the Kansas Department of Social
and Rehabilitation Services ("SRS") versus the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services ("CMS"). CMS deferred $58.3 million of child welfare Medicaid claims   
for the period April 1, 2004 to December 31, 2006. Counsel is optimistic that   
the State will ultimately be successful in any action against CMS involving this
matter.                                                                         

As a result of an Office of Inspector General (OIG) audit finding, the    
Disability Determination Services disallowed SRS $4.9 million of indirect costs 
for fiscal years 1998 through fiscal year 2002 which were allocated through the 
SRS approved cost allocation plan. The SRS is currently appealing this finding. 
The Kansas Department of Revenue has potential liabilities of $9.6 million in   
for corporate income tax credits including accrued interest, $10.2 million of   
sales tax refunds and $6 million in tax assessments.                            

Risk Management. The State maintains a combination of commercial insurance
and self-insurance to cover the risk of losses to which it may be exposed. This 
is accomplished through risk management and various outside entity commercial   
insurance providers. It is the policy of the State to cover the risk of certain 
losses to which it may be exposed through risk management activities. In        
general, the State is self-insured for certain health care claims (prescription 
drug and dental plus three of eight medical health plan options), State employee
workers' compensation, long-term disability, tort liability, personal property, 
and real estate property losses up to $500,000 (except where separate coverage  
is required by bond covenant). The State has commercial vehicle liability       
coverage on all vehicles, and a statewide commercial policy on real property    
valued at $500,000 or more (except where separate coverage is required by bond  
covenant). Insurance settlements have not exceeded insurance coverage for the   
past three fiscal years. Risk is managed by positively addressing various       
benefits and liabilities through review, legislation and administration to      
assure that claims are promptly and correctly adjudicated and that appropriate  
and fair benefits and liabilities are reflected in the statutes and regulations.
Where cost effective and appropriate, such as limiting the impact of a          
catastrophic occurrence to the State buildings, the State has limited its       
exposure through high deductible catastrophic loss insurance.                   

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Kansas issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of      
obligations issued by the State of Kansas, and there is no obligation on the    
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Kansas IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of 
all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject.    
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Kansas IM-IT, the  
market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective    
issuers of such bonds acquired by the Kansas IM-IT to pay interest on or        
principal of such bonds.                                                        

  The Kansas IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory factors
affecting issuers of Kansas municipal obligations (the "Kansas Municipal        
Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain Kansas     
constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and other    
matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief      
summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in Kansas and  
is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and are       
believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the       
accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing information. It is based in    
part on information obtained from various State and local agencies in Kansas or 
contained in Official Statements for various Kansas Municipal Obligations.      

 Kentucky Risk Factors

   Economic Condition and Outlook. Kentucky's economy has shown strong gains for
the last three years, but in terms of both personal income and employment these 
gains have been less than the national average. Kentucky's substantial reliance 
on manufacturing jobs is the primary cause for the lower growth. Excess         
manufacturing capacity abroad and increased productivity--without a concomitant 
increase in wages--has kept income from growing.                                

In fiscal year 2007, personal income is estimated to have increased by 5.6
percent to $128.6 billion. Wages and salaries comprise about 53 percent of total
income. These were up by 5.2 percent during the year. Kentucky's personal income
is expected to be up by 5.4 percent in fiscal year 2008 and then grow at lower  
rates of 4.6 and 5.3 percent in fiscal year 2009 and fiscal year 2010. The lower
growth rates are tied to the general economic slowdown related to the subprime  
lending crisis and the spike in energy prices.                                  

 Nonfarm employment in Kentucky increased by 1.5 percent in fiscal year 2006
resulting in the addition of 26,600 jobs. During fiscal year 2007, the job      
market weakened substantially with employment increasing by 0.7 percent and the 
creation of just 12,900 jobs.                                                   

 The service-providing sectors posted the largest gains during the year with
an increase of 1.1 percent compared to decline of 0.8 percent for the           
goods-producing sector. Government jobs account for 17 percent of total non-farm
employment and were up 1.0 percent for the year.                                

Kentucky's employment composition has changed over the last decade and has
converged closer to the national average. However, employment is still dominated
by manufacturing and construction. The goods-producing sector accounts for 20   
percent of all jobs in Kentucky compared to the national average of 16 percent. 
In the last few years this has been to Kentucky's disadvantage as manufacturing 
facilities have moved to low-cost centers abroad, and the ones that remain have 
seen a surge in productivity.                                                   

The subprime meltdown has had some impact on Kentucky, but not at the same
scale as states like California or Florida. However, Kentucky will feel the     
impact of a prolonged financial crisis at the national level. For the next three
years overall employment growth is expected to average 0.9 percent annually. The
sliding dollar is expected to help Kentucky's exports, but the wage differential
between newly industrialized economies and the U.S. is difficult to bridge. This
means manufacturing employment in Kentucky will continue to decline in fiscal   
year 2008 and for both years of the next biennium.                              

   Long-Term Financial Planning. Kentucky has by statute (KRS 48.705) a set goal
of maintaining a Budget Reserve Trust Fund (BRTF) balance of 5 percent of       
general fund revenues. As of June 30, 2007, the BRTF has a balance of $231.5    
million which was maintained throughout the fiscal year.                        

  Major Initiatives. Fiscal year 2007 was the first year of the Commonwealth's
budget biennial period. The fiscal year 2007 General Fund budget included a     
three percent spending increase over the budget for fiscal year 2006. Education 
spending increased four percent, mainly for elementary and secondary education. 
Human services were also a primary focus of increased spending. Funding for     
mental health and mental retardation programs increased by ten percent, and     
programs aimed at improved aging services were increased by over 30 percent.    
Economic development programs aimed at spurring entrepreneurship and economic   
growth in high technology areas were increased substantially. Within the        
criminal justice system, efforts were made to contend with growing probation and
parole caseloads, as well as prosecutorial and public defender caseloads. Public
pension funding was also a major initiative: funding for employer contributions 
to Kentucky's employee pension funds increased by 32 percent, and by over 20    
percent for the teachers' pension system. Nearly half of the increase in General
Fund spending over the prior year was devoted to debt service supporting a      
significant amount of new capital investment.                                   

The Commonwealth's capital program in fiscal year 2007 was budgeted at an 
unprecedented level. The majority of it was financed through the issuance of    
debt. The capital budget for fiscal year 2007 included $2 billion in bond       
financed projects. The largest proportion of new project activity was directed  
to the Commonwealth's nine postsecondary education institutions. The second     
largest commitment of support is for local water and sewer infrastructure       
projects, over $250 million. The School Facilities Construction Commission,     
which aids local school districts in new construction and renovation projects,  
received $150 million in new bonds from the 2006 General Assembly to support    
offers of assistance to local school districts. Also funded was a $60 million   
Parks Development program and $37.5 million in economic development investments.

 During fiscal year 2007, the Commonwealth began its Medicaid reform effort,
entitled Kentucky Health Choices, becoming one of the first states to take      
advantage of the new flexibility included in the federal Deficit Reduction Act  
passed by Congress in 2006. The fiscal year 2007 budget incorporated a lower    
growth rate of increased spending based upon program improvements resulting from
the reform effort, only one percent. The Commonwealth also implemented          
self-insurance in fiscal year 2007 for over 190,000 state employees, school     
district employees, and retirees.                                               

   For the third year in a row, General Fund revenues exceeded original budgeted
estimates, reflecting an improved fiscal climate compared to the four years     
before. General Fund revenues were budgeted to grow by two percent, though the  
economic growth assumptions underneath were about twice that growth rate. Actual
revenues grew by 2.4 percent, or about $182 million higher than budgeted. The   
Commonwealth ended the fiscal year 2007 with a budgeted surplus in the General  
Fund of $145 million, and $21 million in the Road Fund. Remaining portions of   
the 2005 Tax Modernization legislation, the JOBS for Kentucky program, began to 
be implemented during fiscal year 2007. The legislation included a major        
restructuring of corporate and business taxes; repealing the corporate license  
tax, broadening the base of entities paying the corporate income tax, and       
lowering the corporation income tax rate. The personal income tax rate was      
reduced, a low-income tax credit was established, the intangible property tax   
was repealed, the cigarette tax was raised, wholesale alcohol taxes were        
increased, communications taxes were restructured, and a number of tax credits  
were established. In the spring of 2006, in a special session of the General    
Assembly, the corporate income tax changes made in 2005 were modified further.  
The primary focus was on relief to small businesses comprising of no liability  
for gross receipts or gross profits under $3 million, and reduced liability for 
those between $3 and $6 million. The changes also established a new limited     
liability entity tax with a $175 minimum; and returns to conformity on federal  
treatment. On January 16, 2008, the Consensus Forecasting Group revised the     
official General Fund revenue estimate for the Fiscal Year 2008 to $8.633       
billion, which is $132.2 million below the estimated levels on which the Fiscal 
Year 2008 budget was enacted. The Fiscal Year General Fund actual revenues total
$6.216 billion through March 2008.                                              

Assets. Net assets may serve as a useful indicator of a government's      
financial position. The Commonwealth's combined net assets (governmental and    
business-type activities) totaled $17.4 billion at the end of 2007, as compared 
to $17.9 billion at the end of the previous year.                               

The largest portion of the Commonwealth's net assets, $18.2 billion, is   
invested in capital assets (e.g. land, infrastructures, buildings and           
improvements and machinery and equipment), and minus any related debt, which is 
still outstanding and used to acquire those assets. The Commonwealth uses these 
capital assets to provide services to its citizens; therefore, these assets are 
not available for future spending.                                              

The second largest portion of the Commonwealth's net assets, totaling $1.6
billion, is restricted and represents resources that are subject to either      
external restrictions or legislative restrictions on how they may be used. The  
remaining balance is unrestricted net assets. The unrestricted net assets, if   
they have a positive value, could be used at the Commonwealth's discretion.     
However, the unrestricted balance is a negative $2.4 billion; therefore funds   
are not available for discretionary purposes.                                   

Debt Administration. The Office of Financial Management, as established in
KRS 42.4201, is responsible for the oversight of the Commonwealth's debt. The   
Office develops a long-term debt plan including criteria for the issuance of    
debt and an evaluation of the total state debt to be incurred. Debt is issued   
through the State Property and Buildings Commission and the Kentucky            
Asset/Liability Commission.                                                     

  The Commonwealth of Kentucky's bonded debt decreased by $104 million to $3.4
billion, a 2.93% decrease during the current fiscal year. The major factor in   
this decrease was the maturity of bonds outstanding and the issuance of notes   
for interim financing, rather than bonds. No general obligation bonds were      
authorized or outstanding at June 30, 2007.                                     

   Cash Management. The Commonwealth's investments are governed by KRS 42.500 et
seq. and KAR Title 200 Chapter 14. The State Investment Commission, comprised of
the Governor, the Treasurer, Secretary of the Finance and Administration Cabinet
and gubernatorial appointees of the Kentucky Banker's Association, is charged   
with the oversight of the Commonwealth's investment activities. The Commission  
is required to meet at least quarterly, and delegates day-to-day investment     
management to the Office of Financial Management.                               

 At March 31, 2008, the Commonwealth's operating portfolio was approximately
$4.0 billion in cash and securities. The composition of investments was as      
follows: U.S. Treasury securities (14%); securities issued by agencies and      
instrumentalities of the United States Government (19%); mortgage backed        
securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (13%); repurchase agreements 
collateralized by the aforementioned (21%); municipal securities (7%); and      
corporate and asset backed securities, including money market securities (26%). 

The Commonwealth's investments are currently categorized into three       
investment pools: Short-term, Intermediate-term, Long-term and Bond Proceeds    
Pools. The purpose of these pools is to provide economies of scale that enhance 
yield, ease administration and increase accountability and control. The         
Short-term Pool consists primarily of General Fund cash balances and provides   
liquidity to the remaining pools. The Intermediate-term Pool represents Agency  
Fund investments, state held component unit funds and fiduciary fund accounts   
held for the benefit of others by the Commonwealth. The Bond Proceeds Pool is   
where bond proceeds for capital construction projects are deposited until       
expended for their intended purpose.                                            

The Commonwealth engages in selective derivative transactions. These      
transactions are entered into only with an abundance of caution and for specific
hedge applications to minimize yield volatility in the portfolio. The State     
Investment Commission expressly prohibits the use of margin or other leveraging 
techniques. The Commonwealth executes a variety of transactions which may be    
considered derivative transactions, which include: the securities lending       
program, over-the-counter treasury options, interest rate swaps, mortgage backed
securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and asset backed securities.    

The Commonwealth has used over-the-counter treasury options since the     
mid-1980s to hedge and add value to the portfolio of treasury securities. These 
transactions involve the purchase and sale of put and call options on a covered 
basis, holding either cash or securities sufficient to meet the obligation      
should it be exercised. The State Investment Commission limits the total option 
commitment to no more than twenty percent of the total portfolio of treasury and
agency securities. Historically, actual commitments have been less than ten     
percent of the portfolio. The Commonwealth has had a securities lending program 
since the mid-1980s. The Commonwealth is able to enter into either a principal  
relationship or an agent relationship. In a principal relationship the          
Commonwealth reverses its treasury and agency securities in exchange for 102% of
eligible collateral, marked to market daily. Eligible Collateral is defined as  
securities authorized for purchase pursuant to KRS 42.500. In an agent program  
the agent lends the Commonwealth's treasuries and agencies, takes the cash      
received from the loan and invests it in securities authorized for purchase     
pursuant to KRS 42.500. The income generated by these transactions is split     
between the agent and the Commonwealth. At the present time the Commonwealth has
entered into an agent agreement that has a guarantee of 10 basis points of the  
average market value of securities in the program.                              

 On June 20, 2003, the State Investment Commission adopted Resolution 03-03,
which amended the Commonwealth's investment policy concerning asset-based       
interest rate swaps. The change modifies the exposure limits from a $200 million
notional amount to a net market value approach, the absolute value of which     
cannot exceed $50 million for all counter-parties. The Commonwealth engages in  
asset-based interest rate swaps to better manage its duration and to stabilize  
the volatility of interest income.                                              

House Bill 5 of the First Extraordinary Session of 1997 was enacted on May
30, 1997. The Bill amended KRS 42.500 to authorize the purchase of additional   
investment securities with excess funds available for investment. The new       
classes of investment securities include: United States dollar denominated      
corporate securities, issued by foreign and domestic issuers, including         
sovereign and supranatural governments, rated in one of the three highest       
categories by a nationally recognized rating agency, and asset backed securities
rated in the highest category by a nationally recognized rating agency.         

KAR Title 200 Chapter 14 provides, among other things that: corporate     
securities, inclusive of Commercial Paper, Banker's Acceptances and Certificates
of Deposit are limited to twenty-five million per issuer and a stated final     
maturity of five years or less. Money market securities rated A1-P1 or higher   
are limited to 20% of any investment pool and when combined with corporate and  
asset backed securities (ABS) must not exceed 25% of any investment pool. United
States Agency Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) and Collateralized Mortgage      
Obligations (CMO) are also limited to a maximum of 25% of any investment        
portfolio. ABS, MBS and CMO must have a weighted-average-life of four years or  
less at time of purchase.                                                       

Ratings. As of July 2008, the Commonwealth of Kentucky was given an issuer
credit rating of AA- by S&P and Aa2 by Moody's. Any explanation concerning the  
significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies. There is
no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of time or that they 
will not be revised or withdrawn.                                               

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Kentucky issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of    
obligations issued by the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and there is no obligation  
on the part of the Commonwealth to make payment on such local obligations in the
event of default.                                                               

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Kentucky IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description  
of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject. 
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the Commonwealth and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Kentucky IM-IT, the
market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective    
issuers of such bonds acquired by the Kentucky IM-IT to pay interest on or      
principal of such bonds.                                                        

The Kentucky IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory    
factors affecting issuers of Kentucky municipal obligations (the "Kentucky      
Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain  
Kentucky constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and 
other matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief
summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in Kentucky and
is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and are       
believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the       
accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing information. It is based in    
part on information obtained from various Commonwealth and local agencies in    
Kentucky or contained in Official Statements for various Kentucky Municipal     
Obligations.                                                                    

Louisiana Risk Factors

Economic Outlook. The State provides a variety of services to citizens    
including education, health care, public safety, road and highway development   
and maintenance, and recreation. These services are financed primarily through  
taxes, fees, mineral royalties and federal revenues, which are accounted for by 
various funds (general fund, special revenue funds, capital project funds,      
etc.).                                                                          

   Major industries in Louisiana include agriculture, fishing, and processing of
mineral resources. The State leads the nation in the production of salt and     
sulfur and ranks high in the production of crude petroleum, natural gas, and    
natural gas liquids. The State rapidly industrialized in the 1960's and 70's and
has giant oil refineries, petrochemical plants, foundries, and lumber and paper 
mills. Four of the ten busiest U.S. ports are located in Louisiana along the    
lower Mississippi River (New Orleans, South Louisiana, Baton Rouge, and         
Plaquemines). The State financial reporting entity includes 51 active component 
units, which are reported discretely in the financial statements. These         
component units include colleges and universities, boards and commissions,      
ports, levee districts, and other special purpose authorities.                  

   The State of Louisiana is working very diligently on closing the gap that was
caused by the catastrophic hurricanes and bringing itself above and beyond the  
pre-hurricane levels. Even though 2005's hurricanes shuffled its demographics   
and caused it to revert back to 1997's economic numbers, Louisiana is showing   
optimistic growth. It is already predicted that Louisiana should be within 3,400
jobs of its pre-storm employment level at the end of 2007 and should surpass    
pre-storm employment sometime in 2008.                                          

The State's efforts to close the gap will depend on a number of factors   
beyond the control of policy makers in the State. Therefore, the State will base
them on the following expectations in 2008-09: (1) the national economy will    
avoid a recession and the real gross domestic product (RGDP) growth rate will   
rise approximately 3.0%; (2) interest rates will stabilize with the 30-year     
fixed mortgage rate rising only one- half percentage point; (3) the pressures on
natural gas prices are taking a more downward approach; and (4) demographic     
changes in Louisiana's population will create an intensifying labor market      
shortage over the rest of the decade, driving up wage rates, incentivizing older
workers to stay in the workforce, and encouraging both more out-sourcing and    
immigration. The problem will be especially intense in the State's construction 
industry due to a remarkable number of large construction projects planned over 
2008-09.                                                                        

The oil and gas industry is expected to continue to be an exceptional     
extraction sector with oil prices varying from $58 to $72 a barrel for 2008-09, 
though recent prices have spiked to the upward $80s. The State has a positive   
outlook for the construction industry due to over $16 billion in proposed       
construction spending which will keep the economy going over the next two years.

The economic prospects are varying across Louisiana's eight metropolitan  
statistical areas (MSAs), and are contributing to the growth of its economy by  
attracting big business and major manufacturing plants. The MSAs of New Orleans,
Lake Charles, and various others are overcoming past projections and showing    
exceptional growth.                                                             

A massive revision to the employment data has changed the outlook on New  
Orleans MSA. According to the revision New Orleans MSA did not lose as many jobs
as a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita as estimated earlier; only 134,900   
jobs were lost as opposed to 215,100 previously estimated. New Orleans will     
continue to add jobs at a rate of about 1,000 a month, a growth rate of about   
2.4%, and the city's economy will be buoyed by billions of dollars in planned   
projects.                                                                       

  From an employment standpoint, the Lake Charles MSA has fully recovered from
the effects of Hurricane Rita and is now setting record levels of employment. A 
total of 2,800 new jobs are forecasted for Lake Charles over 2008-09. A $300    
million project at Westlake Chemicals and expansions at the Chennault Airpark   
will provide the foundation for growth for the next two years. If obtained, the 
$1.4 billion Leucadia synthetic gas manufacturing plant could be the largest    
single capital investment in the region's history.                              

 Baton Rouge MSA census data show that it has leveled out with approximately
35,192 new residents from the influx of evacuees after the storms. Construction 
is projected to be a major player in the area's economic future with an estimate
of over $5 billion in construction projects planned. Minor expansions in the    
region's large chemical sector, along with gains from the two major call centers
(Direct General and Staples), and smaller gains in other manufacturing firms    
will promote further job growth. A total of 14,800 new jobs are projected over  
2008-09, a growth rate of 2.0% per year.                                        

High energy prices and the rebuilding of the Gulf of Mexico infrastructure
have created a nice spike in employment in the energy-dependent Lafayette MSA.  
Discovery of the lower tertiary oil field in the Gulf virtually assured an      
excellent economic future for Lafayette. Lafayette will leverage an expanding   
energy economy and hospital and retail growth to create 6,300 new jobs over the 
next two years, making it one of the top metro areas.                           

   Shreveport/Bossier MSA was hammered for three straight years (2001-03) by the
national recession but has responded with four straight years of growth. A new  
paper recycling plant at the port, a proposed new $50 million power plant by    
SWEPCO, and a vibrant, expanding film industry will provide economic growth for 
this region. A total of 5,800 new jobs are projected over 2008-09, despite a    
threat to the area's large Casino business from new Indian Casino openings in   
Oklahoma, employee buyouts by General Motors, and the threat of downsizing the  
number of airplanes flying out of the Barksdale Air Force Base.                 

 The MSA of Houma is now the fastest growing in the State in 2007 because of
high energy prices and rebuilding activities in the Gulf. This distinction is   
expected to continue into 2008-09, and the area is expected to grow about 2.7% a
year adding 5,200 new jobs. Oil and gas is doing well, but major employment     
expansions will occur at Edison Chouest and Bollinger Shipyards and at Gulf     
Island Fabricators that will boost the economy as well.                         

Significant new dollars have been pumped into Alexandria's MSA due to the 
construction of the Union Tank Car plant and its initial hiring drive up to 670 
permanent employees, and due to beginning work on the $1 billion retrofit of    
Cleco's Rodemacher power plant. Job growth is expected to slow down in this MSA 
over the next two years with the Union Tank Car plant topping out at 100 new    
jobs in 2008. An increase of only 1,700 jobs are projected over 2008-09 (about  
1.5% in 2008 and 1.0% in 2009). The construction of various projects, Cleco's   
Rodemacher power plant, 2 area hospitals, city and state infrastructure         
improvements and England Airpark, will boost Alexandria's economic growth for   
the upcoming years.                                                             

   Monroe's MSA is still projected to show the weakest performance in the State.
It has not bounced back from the closure of several manufacturing plants over   
the past four years, but stabilized somewhat by the attraction of the 550-person
Accent Marketing call center at the old State Farm Building. That trend is      
projected to continue over 2008-09 with an additional 1,300 jobs (less than 1%  
per year).                                                                      

 The employment rate in Louisiana's 35 "rural" parishes is projected to rise
by more than 6,800 jobs in 2008 (1.8% increase) and more than 6,200 jobs in 2009
(1.6% increase). Most of that growth will be focused in two parishes: Tangipahoa
with Capital One Bank adding a new 1,120-person check processing facility and   
St. Mary with the expansion at the J. Ray McDermott fabricating yard and the    
addition of the Amelia Belle Casino.                                            

  The State as a whole is projected to add 37,200 jobs in 2008 (1.9% increase)
and another 37,800 jobs in 2009 (1.9% increase). If these forecasts hold up,    
Louisiana will begin to set new employment records sometime in 2008.            

Fund Highlights. The major governmental funds are the General Fund, Bond  
Security and Redemption Fund, and Louisiana Education Quality Trust Fund. The   
General Fund is the chief operating fund of the State. The Bond Security and    
Redemption Fund receives all money deposited into the State Treasury except     
federal funds, donations, or other forms of assistance when otherwise required, 
and out of this fund all obligations secured by the full faith and credit of the
State which are due and payable in the current fiscal year are paid. The        
Louisiana Education Quality Trust Fund uses funds received from the federal     
government from mineral production or leases on the outer continental shelf for 
various purposes aimed at improving the quality of education in Louisiana.      

   The overall performance of the General Fund increased by $996 million and the
unreserved/undesignated fund balance increased by $716 million to a balance of  
$1.2 billion (162%). Most of the increase in revenues of $3.6 billion (40%)     
resulted from the increased funding made available to the State as Community    
Development Block Grant Disaster funds for the Road Home program. In addition,  
the recovery and rebuilding effort steadily fueled sustained economic activity  
throughout fiscal year 2007, resulting in gains in individual and corporate     
income and general sales taxes. Higher than expected oil prices led to increases
in severance taxes, royalties, and mineral bonuses. The increase in insurance   
premiums following the 2005 hurricanes resulted in higher insurance premium tax 
collections from the prior year.                                                

General Fund expenditures have increased by $2.8 billion (14%). The major 
portion of this increase can be attributed to expenditures relating to the Road 
Home program.                                                                   

The Bond Security and Redemption Fund revenues increased by $1.6 billion  
(14%) in fiscal year 2007, mainly because of an increase in tax revenue. The    
Louisiana Education Quality Trust Fund reported interest earnings of $20.5      
million (a 13% increase) and market gains of $11.2 million.                     

Assets. The overall financial position for the State improved from the    
previous year as reflected in the increase in net assets to $20.1 billion (20%).
Net assets for governmental activities increased by $2.9 billion (20%), while   
net assets for business-type activities increased by $507 million (27%). The    
largest portion of the net assets of the State, $11.9 billion (59%), reflects   
investment in capital assets (e.g., land, roads, buildings, machinery, and      
equipment). These assets are used to provide services to residents of the State,
and consequently are not available for future spending. Capital assets increased
by $1 billion (8%), due mainly to infrastructure improvements under the         
Louisiana Transportation Infrastructure Model for Economic Development (TIMED)  
Program.                                                                        

  In contrast, current and other assets (e.g., cash, investments, receivables,
and inventory) totaled $19.3 billion (58% of total assets) at fiscal year end,  
and the State uses these resources to repay debt associated with capital assets.
The current and other assets of the State at June 30, 2007 represent an increase
of 31% from the prior fiscal year. Cash has increased by $3 billion (50%), in   
part due to an increase in cash in the Capital Outlay Escrow fund of $1.2       
billion, which reflects the proceeds of a $500 million bond sale during fiscal  
year 2007. The Coastal Protection and Restoration Fund (previously the Wetlands 
Conservation and Restoration Fund), with a cash balance of $323 million,        
received additional funding during fiscal year 2007, in part from the proceeds  
of the tobacco settlement securitization, to further the development and        
implementation of a program to protect and restore Louisiana's coastal area     
which was severely damaged by the 2005 hurricanes. The 2004 Overcollections     
Fund, with a cash balance of $553 million, received $380 million from the FEMA  
Reimbursement Fund for State FEMA match funds which was forgiven by the U.S.    
Congress. In addition, the State has created the Louisiana Mega-Project         
Development Fund, with a cash balance of $150 million, to provide for economic  
development mega-projects for the State.                                        

  Restricted net assets represent those assets not available for spending as a
result of legislative or constitutional requirements, donor agreements, or grant
requirements. Restricted net assets decreased by $1.5 billion (21%) from the    
previous fiscal year for governmental activities, reflecting in part a decrease 
in the restricted for other purposes component of net assets of $3.6 billion.   
This decrease reflects the guidance found in GASB Statement No. 46, Net Assets  
Restricted by Enabling Legislation, which clarifies which assets should be      
restricted by enabling legislation. Enabling legislation authorizes a government
to assess, levy, charge, or otherwise mandate payment of resources from external
resource providers, and includes a legally enforceable requirement that those   
resources be used only for the specific purposes stipulated in the legislation. 
Although GASB Statement 46 was implemented last year, additional research was   
performed and a more restrictive set of criteria now has to be met for an asset 
to be considered restricted by enabling legislation. As a result of the         
research, the State has classified net assets as unrestricted that previously   
were determined to be restricted. The decrease in restricted net assets was     
offset by an increase in restricted for capital projects of $2 billion,         
reflecting increased funding in the Capital Outlay fund for the State's highway 
program.                                                                        

Restricted net assets increased by $69 million (5%) for business-type     
activities, caused by an increase in the Unemployment Trust Fund restricted for 
unemployment compensation over last year. Balances are higher this year as a    
result of a decrease in the number of unemployment claims compared to last year,
and an increase in the tax rates on employers to build up the unemployment trust
fund after depletion caused by the large increase in unemployment claims        
following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.                                          

For fiscal year 2007, unrestricted net assets increased by $3.8 billion   
(111%) from 2006 for governmental activities. A significant portion of this     
increase is due to an increase in capital grants and contributions revenue of $3
billion reflecting the large influx of federal Community Development Block Grant
(CDBG) funds for the Road Home program. In addition, income tax revenue         
increased by $1 billion, reflecting higher wages in response to labor shortages 
after the hurricanes. Unrestricted net assets increased by $438 million (94%)   
for business-type activities, reflecting an unrestricted balance of $399 million
in the Louisiana Gulf Opportunity Zone Loan Fund. This fund was created to      
provide debt service assistance under the federal Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of  
2005 for local government entities which suffered catastrophic losses of tax and
other revenues after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.                               

   Cash Management. The State Treasurer is responsible for managing all cash and
investments, with the exception of certain component units included in the      
reporting entity that have independent powers to manage and invest their funds. 
During fiscal year 2007, cash management and investment transactions managed by 
the State Treasurer included checking accounts, certificates of deposit, U.S.   
government and agency obligations, commercial paper, repurchase agreements, and 
security lending agreements.                                                    

For fiscal year 2007, the Treasury earned $309,444,296 on its fixed-income
investments for the General Fund. The investments earned a cash rate of return  
of 3.18% during fiscal year 2007, which is a 22.9% increase from the 2.59% rate 
that earned $161,324,115 in the previous year. By comparison, the thirty-day    
Treasury Bill yield averaged 5.0% and the two-year Treasury Note averaged 5.04% 
during the same period.                                                         

  The investments of the Louisiana Education Quality Trust Fund earned a fixed
income rate of return of 6.8% and a 17.89% return on equities for the 2007      
fiscal year.                                                                    

Debt Administration. The Louisiana Constitution of 1974 provides that the 
State shall have no power, directly or indirectly, through any state board,     
agency, commission or otherwise to incur debt or issue bonds except by law      
enacted by two-thirds of the elected members of each house of the legislature.  
The State authorizes, issues, and sells debt obligations. General obligation    
bonds issued by the State are backed by the full faith and credit of the State. 
The State also issues revenue obligations, which are secured by a pledge of     
revenues or property derived from the operations of a program funded by the     
issuance of the obligations.                                                    

 Louisiana Revised Statutes 39:1365(25) limits the legislative authorization
of general obligation bonds and other general obligations secured by the full   
faith and credit of the State by prohibiting total authorized bonds from        
exceeding an amount equal to two times the average annual revenues of the Bond  
Security and Redemption Fund for the last three fiscal years prior to such      
authorization.                                                                  

On September 21, 2006, the State issued General Obligation Bonds, Series  
2006-C in the amount of $500 million for lines of credit reimbursements that    
were used to finance approved capital outlay projects. In response to the need  
to assist local political subdivisions as the result of Hurricanes Katrina and  
Rita, the State issued General Obligation Gulf Tax Credit bonds, Series 2006-A, 
and General Obligation Match Bonds, Series 2006-B, in the amounts of $200       
million and $194.5 million respectively, for the purpose of providing loans to  
political subdivisions of the State affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The
State sold $1.1 billion of Gasoline and Fuels Tax Revenue Bonds Series 2006-A in
November 2006. In addition, the State entered into a forward delivery contract  
for a Gasoline and Fuels Tax Revenue Bond Series 2008-A in the amount of $485   
million in December 2006.                                                       

Risk Management. The primary government, through the Office of Risk       
Management, retains risk for property, casualty, and worker's compensation      
insurance, as well as coverage for all State property, with virtually no upper  
limits. Auto liability, comprehensive, and collision coverage is provided for   
the State fleet and other coverage, such as bonds, crime, aviation, and marine  
insurance, is provided as needed.                                               

Ratings. As of July 2008, all outstanding general obligation bonds of the 
State of Louisiana are rated A+ by S&P and A2 by Moody's. Any explanation       
concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating    
agencies. There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of
time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.                             

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Louisiana issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of   
obligations issued by the State of Louisiana, and there is no obligation on the 
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Louisiana IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description 
of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject. 
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Louisiana IM-IT,   
the market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective
issuers of such bonds acquired by the Louisiana IM-IT to pay interest on or     
principal of such bonds.                                                        

The Louisiana IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory   
factors affecting issuers of Louisiana municipal obligations (the "Louisiana    
Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain  
Louisiana constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and
other matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief
summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in Louisiana   
and is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and are   
believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the       
accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing information. It is based in    
part on information obtained from various State and local agencies in Louisiana 
or contained in Official Statements for various Louisiana Municipal Obligations.

Maine Risk Factors

 Economic Outlook. The State is home to many renowned institutions of higher
education, both public and private, industries, vacation areas, and world famous
retailers, keeping the economy relatively stable and an incubator for new ideas 
and growth. Unemployment has remained close to the national average due to these
stabilization factors. The State of Maine with an international reputation for  
recreational, cultural, historical and educational institutions remains a       
significant spoke of the New England economy. Maine's economy remains           
diversified.                                                                    

Inflation continued to rise though the past year. The Consumer Price Index
rose by 2.6 percent from July 2006 to July 2007; however, fuel and utilities    
prices rose much faster. The rise in oil prices to over $90 a barrel in late    
fall has put pressure on both household and government budgets. Sustained oil   
prices in excess of $90 per barrel will impose significant challenges to both   
households and governments during the winter heating season.                    

 Personal income continues to rise in Maine faster than inflation. According
to the latest statistics available, personal income is estimated to have risen  
by 3.9 percent in calendar year 2007. The moderate growth in 2007 and 2006 is in
contrast to the much slower growth in 2005 when the State was affected by a     
number of events, the most significant of which was the Base Realignment and    
Closure Commission (BRAC) process. Unemployment has hovered around the national 
average throughout the year. The rate in Maine stood at 4.8 percent in September
of 2007, which is slightly above the national rate of 4.7 percent.              

Major Initiatives. The First Regular Session of the 123rd Legislature as a
part of Public Law 2007, Chapter 240, enacted the Governor's initiative making  
sweeping reform in the administrative structure of local school districts. The  
legislation will have long lasting effects on the delivery of administrative    
service to schools. The reform known as "School Consolidation" proposed to      
reduce the number of local school districts from 240 to no more than 80         
districts. The consolidation of school administrative districts is the most far 
reaching and significant legislation proposed or enacted since the Sinclair Act 
of 1957 that created the School Administrative District system.                 

Also enacted in Public Law 2007, Chapter 240, was the establishment of an 
irrevocable trust to account for and invest funds set aside to amortize the     
unfunded liabilities of the State employee, teachers, and county and municipal  
firefighters and law enforcement personnel participating in the plan. The       
initial deposit to the trust is expected to amount to $90.0 million.            

Budgetary Highlights. For the 2007 fiscal year, the final legally adopted 
budgeted expenditures for the General Fund amounted to $3.1 billion, an increase
of about $166 million from the original legally adopted budget of approximately 
$2.9 billion. Actual expenditures on a budgetary basis amounted to approximately
$62.9 million less than those authorized in the final budget; however, after    
deducting the encumbered obligations and other commitments that will come due in
fiscal year 2008, $17.1 million of unobligated funds remained as a result of a  
continuing concerted effort to control spending, primarily in the broad         
categories of education and social services. Actual revenues exceeded final     
budget forecasts by $33.7 million. As a part of the final budget adjustment for 
Fiscal Year 2007, the Legislature approved a direct appropriation to the State's
Budget Stabilization Fund in the amount of $35.6 million. The additional        
appropriation increased the balance in the Fund to $115.5 million as of June 30,
2007. This item is further explained in Note 2 of Notes to the Financial        
Statements.                                                                     

Debt Management. The Constitution of the State of Maine provides that the 
Legislature shall not create any debt which exceeds $2,000,000 except to        
suppress insurrection, to repel invasion or for purposes of war except when     
two-thirds of the Legislature and a majority of the voters authorize the        
issuance of debt. The Constitution also provides that tax anticipation loans    
must be repaid during the fiscal year of issuance. Constitutional amendments    
have been adopted which also allow the Legislature to authorize the issuance of 
bonds to insure payments on revenue bonds of up to $4,800,000 for local public  
school building projects; in the amount of up to $4,000,000 to guarantee student
loans; to insure payments on up to $1,000,000 of mortgage loans for Indian      
housing; to insure payments on up to $4,000,000 of mortgage loans or small      
business loans to war veterans; and to insure payments on up to $90,000,000 of  
mortgage loans for industrial, manufacturing, fishing, agricultural, and        
recreational enterprises. This last authorization has been limited statutorily  
to a maximum of $87,500,000 available for issue through the Finance Authority of
Maine.                                                                          

When issuing General Obligation Bonds, the State of Maine pledges its full
faith and credit to repay the financial obligation. Unless certain tax revenue  
streams are specifically restricted, states typically pledge all of their       
tax-raising powers to secure the obligations. The major bond rating agencies    
regularly assess the capacity and willingness of the State to repay its general 
obligation debt. Moody's, S&P, and Fitch make their assessments, in large part, 
by examining four basic analytical areas: economy, financial performance and    
flexibility, debt burden, and administration. The economic base is the most     
critical element in determining the rating. Growth and diversity in the         
demographics, tax base, and employment base of the State over the last decade   
are indicators of future growth prospects and debt repayment capabilities.      
Generally, states with higher income levels and diverse economic bases have     
superior debt repayment capabilities and are better protected from sudden shocks
or unexpected volatility in the economy. Because a strong economy does not      
always ensure a state's ability to meet debt payments, the State's financial    
management and performance are also key factors.                                

Financial analysis involves several factors, including: accounting and    
reporting methods; revenue and expenditure patterns; annual operating and       
budgetary performance; leverage and equity positions; budget and financial      
planning; and contingency obligations. These factors present a clear indication 
of the financial strengths and weaknesses of the State. The rating agencies'    
analyses of these factors provide the framework for judging Maine's capacity to 
manage economic, political, and financial uncertainties.                        

At year-end, the State had $920 million in general obligation and other   
long-term debt outstanding. During the year, the State reduced outstanding      
long-term obligations by $79.8 million for outstanding general obligation bonds 
and $227.5 million for other long-term debt. Also during fiscal year 2007, the  
State incurred $318.3 million of additional long-term obligations.              

Risk Management. In general, the State is "self-insured" for health and   
dental insurance, worker's compensation, tort liability, vehicle liability,     
marine and aircraft, property losses, and retiree health insurance for State    
employees and teachers. The Risk Management Division's activities include       
analysis of and control over insurance coverage and risk exposure. Risk         
Management funds the cost of providing claims servicing and claims payment by   
charging premiums to agencies based on a review of past losses and estimated    
losses for the current period.                                                  

Ratings. As of July 2008, all outstanding general obligation bonds of the 
State of Maine are rated AA-by S&P and Aa3 by Moody's. Any explanation          
concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating    
agencies. There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of
time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.                             

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Maine issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of       
obligations issued by the State of Maine, and there is no obligation on the part
of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of default. 

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the Maine
IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of all    
adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject.        
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Maine IM-IT, the   
market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective    
issuers of such bonds acquired by the Maine IM-IT to pay interest on or         
principal of such bonds.                                                        

 The Maine IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory factors
affecting issuers of Maine municipal obligations (the "Maine Municipal          
Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain Maine      
constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and other    
matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief      
summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in Maine and is
derived from sources that are generally available to investors and are believed 
to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the accuracy or    
completeness of any of the foregoing information. It is based in part on        
information obtained from various State and local agencies in Maine or contained

 Maryland Risk Factors

 State Government. Maryland's employment is based largely in services, trade
and government. These sectors, along with finance, insurance and real estate are
the largest contributors to the gross state product. The Maryland Constitution  
requires the Governor to submit to the General Assembly a balanced budget for   
the following year. The General Assembly cannot increase the budget except in   
certain organizational units. The budget currently uses a legally mandated      
budgetary fund structure. Each state agency is provided appropriations at a     
program level, which is the level at which expenditures cannot legally exceed   
the appropriations. The State also utilizes an encumbrance system to serve as a 
tool for managing available appropriations. Maryland maintains its accounts to  
conform with the legally mandated budget and also to comply with generally      
accepted accounting principles. Financial control is generally exercised under  
the budgetary system.                                                           

There is a Spending Affordability Committee which consists of certain     
designated officers of the General Assembly and other members as may be         
appointed by the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of        
Delegates. Each year the Committee must submit a report to the General          
Assembly's Legislative Policy Committee and to the Governor recommending the    
level of State spending, the level of new debt authorization, the level of State
personnel and the use of any anticipated surplus funds.                         

Also, the General Assembly created a Capital Debt Affordability Committee,
the members of which are the Treasurer, the Comptroller, the Secretary of Budget
and Management, the Secretary of Transportation, and one person appointed by the
Governor. This Committee is required to submit to the Governor by September 10  
of each year an estimate of the maximum amount of new general obligation debt   
that prudently may be authorized. The Committee's recent reports encompass all  
tax supported debt, including in addition to general obligation debt, bonds     
issued by the Department of Transportation, bonds issued by the Maryland Stadium
Authority and capital lease transactions. Although the Committee's              
responsibilities are advisory only, the Governor is required to give due        
consideration to the Committee's finding in preparing a preliminary allocation  
of new general obligation debt authorizations for the next ensuing fiscal year. 

Economy and Outlook. All of the uncertainties and drags at the national   
level-energy prices, credit concerns, financial market volatility, declining    
consumer confidence and especially the troubled housing market-are affecting the
State's economy. But the economy has to date absorbed all of the bad news, and  
expectations of future bad news, and continued to expand. The key question at   
this point is whether future expectations regarding the housing market are      
accurate. It appears that most economists have chased the bad news, adjusting   
forecasts downward with every new release of data. Direct and indirect effects  
of the housing market downturn and the impact of resets of adjustable rate      
mortgages, which had been expected for some time and have been unfolding since  
late 2005, have now had a measurable impact on the State's economy and are      
likely to pose an increasingly formidable challenge to economic growth through  
the end of next year and perhaps beyond.                                        

At present, fallout from the housing market seems likely to hold back the 
State's economy through 2008, directly or indirectly affecting virtually every  
industry. The possibility exists that these issues will develop to such an      
extent that the national or State economies slip into recession. The housing    
market in Maryland has deteriorated rapidly in recent months--sales of existing 
homes in September were down 38% from September 2006, and are now nearly 60%    
below 2004 levels. September was the third lowest sales month since January     
2000. For the first time on record, sales in September were lower than sales the
prior January and February, which does not bode well for the near term. The     
median sales price of existing homes sold dropped 9.3% from June to September,  
more than twice the seasonal decline experienced in any other year this decade. 
As a result of a sharp decline in sales and apparently falling prices, the      
active inventory of existing homes for sale has increased nearly 12,000 units   
over the course of this year to just over 50,000, a record high.                

  The first effects of the deteriorating housing market on the broader economy
have shown themselves in the construction industry. Employment in residential   
construction dropped noticeably in the first quarter of 2007 (the latest        
detailed data available).                                                       

Employment at single-family housing contractors was down 12.9%, while     
multi-family contractors experienced an 8.8% contraction, both dropping at      
faster rates than the fourth quarter, when they fell 10.2% and 0.9%. Altogether,
residential construction jobs dropped 5.4% in the first quarter after falling   
0.9% in the fourth quarter of 2006. Developments in the housing market since    
then give no hope for recovery in the near future.                              

   Some of the jobs lost on the residential side may shift to the nonresidential
side of the construction industry. The high demand in Maryland for school       
construction, facilities at community colleges and public institutions of higher
education, new roads and maintenance of existing transportation facilities will 
not be satisfied in the near future, and thus at least half of the              
nonresidential construction sector has at worst a very stable outlook. With the 
State's Capital Debt Affordability Committee recommending a 15% increase for the
fiscal year 2009 capital program and the recent court decision allowing         
construction of the inter-county connector, the outlook for public construction 
could be one of accelerating growth, absorbing some of the downturn in the      
residential sector. Likewise, the outlook for commercial construction is        
moderately positive. Rents for commercial property in Bethesda are currently 40%
of those in the District of Columbia and 60% of those in Northern Virginia,     
providing an attractive alternative. The Base Realignment and Closure Commission
(BRAC) activity, which may also absorb some of the excess residential capacity, 
will help to support commercial rents and construction in the Baltimore region. 

   The financial services industry will also be directly affected by the housing
slowdown. Two mortgage brokerages have already reported layoffs totaling 250    
employees, and more are likely to follow. In addition, resets of adjustable rate
mortgages are expected to continue at very high levels through the end of 2008. 
These factors, along with volatility in the stock markets, the loss of spending 
power from those in the construction and finance industries who have lost their 
jobs, and high and once again rising energy prices (which have diverted up to   
2.5% of personal income from other spending over the past two years), may keep  
consumer spending from strengthening appreciably in the near term. The only     
significant counterbalances are low interest rates and a relatively tight labor 
market in Maryland.                                                             

Weak consumer spending--as demonstrated by growth in State sales tax      
collections of just 1.9% in fiscal year 2007--translates into low profit growth 
and flat employment for the trade industry, particularly retail trade. Car sales
have been flat for more than two years, and may have recently resumed the       
longer-term downward trend.                                                     

  Weak consumer spending will also affect the leisure and hospitality services
sector, although the weak dollar may help to cushion the blow by encouraging    
international tourism. Passenger traffic at BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport       
surpassed pre-September 11 levels in 2006, due partly to the continuing         
expansion of Southwest and AirTran Airlines.                                    

 Government, which has acted as a stabilizing factor for the State's economy
for some time, will also be affected by the housing market through the effect on
tax revenues. At the federal level, individual income tax revenues from capital 
gains on both owner occupied and non-owner occupied residential property will   
decline; that factor will also affect State income tax revenues. State revenues 
will also be affected through the estate tax, sales tax, and certain            
court-related revenues, while local governments will largely be affected through
recordation and transfer taxes (property tax growth will be largely unaffected  
due to the homestead property tax credits, which cap growth in the taxable      
assessment at 10% or less annually for owner-occupied property; given the       
enormous run-up in prices, it will be quite some time before taxable assessments
reach market values, even if prices fall 10%).                                  

These fiscal pressures may cause a belt-tightening at the State and local 
levels, although the outcome of the special session of the General Assembly may 
provide the State, in particular, more flexibility. Federal employment in the   
State will have declined five consecutive years by the end of 2007, but the     
federal fiscal situation has improved in recent years. Federal spending in the  
State on science and technology dropped in the second half of 2006, but spending
on defense and homeland security continues at high levels. Maryland received    
less than 5% of total federal procurement spending in 1997, a share that has    
grown by over a full percentage point since then. BRAC aside, government may not
be an engine of growth over the next several years, but it should continue to be
a large stabilizing presence for the State's economy.                           

   Another stabilizing sector over the near term, and one that will provide some
growth, is the health and education services industry. Federal spending does    
support this sector, with a disproportionately large 5% of federal health       
spending coming to the State. Over 90% of that funding is focused in Baltimore. 
More broadly, Maryland receives the third highest amount of science and         
engineering funding from the federal government (over three-quarters of which is
health and education related), behind only California and New York. The health  
research/services infrastructure which has built up around Baltimore City and   
the Washington suburbs will continue to have additional resources funneled to   
it.                                                                             

   Risks to the forecast are clearly on the downside. The largest negative risk,
particularly in Maryland, is the development of a self-reinforcing downward     
cycle in the housing market. There is a possibility that, as the economy slows  
and ARMs continue to reset, foreclosures will increase. As the supply of homes  
expands, further downward pressure will be exerted on prices. In turn, more     
potential buyers will delay purchases, while at the same time it becomes more   
difficult for those facing resets to refinance before the higher payments (often
30% higher) come due, further expanding the supply. The impact of such a vicious
cycle on the broader economy would be substantial, even more so if              
mortgage-related risks are currently mispriced in the stock and bond markets.   
Longer-term risks for the State's economy include slowing population growth.    
Current Census estimates show decelerating growth each year since 2001 in       
Maryland, with 2006 growth of under 0.5%, the weakest since 1979. This trend may
be reversed over the next several years due to BRAC activity, but growth in     
population seems unlikely to exceed 1.0% any time in the foreseeable future.    

There are positive factors working in Maryland's favor. Of the 50 states, 
Maryland has the highest median household income, the fifth-highest per capita  
personal income, the fourth-lowest poverty rate and the fourth-highest          
percentage of residents with a bachelor's degree, all of which make Maryland a  
desirable location for both employers and employees. The concentration of       
high-tech and bioscience companies around Baltimore and Washington, including   
Northern Virginia, will act as a long-term catalyst for growth. And upcoming    
BRAC activity will, at the very least, provide an extra boost to the State's    
economy as it resumes stronger growth in 2009. Maryland is well-positioned for  
future economic growth, once the imbalances caused by the housing market have   
worked through the system.                                                      

   Major Budgetary Initiatives. The State's budget for fiscal year 2008 grows by
2.5% over the current year. The budget includes $400 million for public school  
construction and an increase of more than $680 million in kindergarten through  
grade twelve education. In addition, funding for higher education is increased  
by $192 million.                                                                

Budgetary initiatives for public safety include funding to hire additional
correctional officers and investment in technology and forensic scientists for  
DNA testing. Also, $289 million in funding is provided for land preservation    
programs, and $138 million is provided to improve local water and wastewater    
systems to help clean the Chesapeake Bay. For healthcare initiatives, the State 
is providing $25 million for stem cell research, expanding the Senior Drug      
Assistance program and restoring healthcare benefits to legal immigrant         
families. In addition, for Transportation, the State is investing more than $1  
billion in highway projects, $500 million in transit and $124 million in the    
Port.                                                                           

 Because the governor is required by law to submit a balanced budget and the
fiscal year 2009 budget was anticipated to have an approximately $1.5 billion   
deficit, the governor convened a special legislative session in October, 2007 to
address this issue. The session increased various taxes to provide sufficient   
revenues when combined with anticipated spending cuts to eliminate the projected
deficit.                                                                        

   Financial Highlights. Maryland reported net assets of $18.6 billion in fiscal
years 2007 and 2006. Of this amount in fiscal year 2007, a balance of $1.2      
billion was reported as total unrestricted net assets, which includes a $559    
million deficit balance in governmental activities and a $1.7 billion balance in
business-type activities.                                                       

The State's total net assets decreased by $14 million as a result of this 
year's operations. The net assets for governmental activities decreased by $313 
million (2.3%). Net assets of business-type activities increased by $299 million
(6.1%). The State's governmental activities had total expenses of $24.7 billion,
total revenues of $24.0 billion and net transfers from business-type activities 
of $350 million for a net decrease of $313 million. Business-type activities had
total expenditures of $2.2 billion, program revenues of $2.9 billion, and       
transfers out of $350 million for a net increase in net assets of $299 million. 
Total State revenues were $26.9 billion, while total costs for all programs were
$26.9 billion.                                                                  

Financial Analysis of the State's Funds. Governmental funds reported a    
combined fund balance of $3.9 billion, a decrease of $358 million (8.4%) from   
the prior year.                                                                 

The General Fund reported an unreserved fund balance of $885 million and a
reserved fund balance of $2.4 billion, compared to an unreserved fund balance of
$2.0 billion and reserved fund balance of $1.5 billion last year. This          
represents a net decrease of $274 million in general fund, fund balance. The    
total unreserved fund balance in the governmental funds was $1.0 billion,       
compared to the unreserved fund balance of $2.2 billion in the prior year.      

  Governmental funds reported a total reserved fund balance of $2.9 billion in
2007, compared to $2.1 billion in the prior year. Of this amount, $1.6 billion  
was in the "State Reserve Fund" and available for future needs, an increase of  
$784 million over the prior year.                                               

Debt Management. Total bonds, obligations under long-term leases and other
nontraditional Transportation debt at year end was $11.6 billion, a net increase
of $1.6 billion (15.4%) over the prior year. $679 million General Obligation    
Bonds and $100 million Transportation Bonds were issued during the year.        

  As of June 30, 2007, the State had outstanding bonds totaling $10.3 billion.
Of this amount $5.1 billion were general obligation bonds, backed by the full   
faith and credit of the State. The remaining $5.2 billion was secured solely by 
the specified revenue sources.                                                  

Ratings. As of July 2008, all outstanding general obligation bonds of the 
State of Maryland are rated AAA by S&P and Aaa by Moody's. Any explanation      
concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating    
agencies. There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of
time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.                             

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Maryland issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of    
obligations issued by the State of Maryland, and there is no obligation on the  
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.

Massachusetts Risk Factors

 Economic Outlook. During fiscal year 2006, for the first time since June of
1995, the Commonwealth's unemployment rate exceeded that of the United States as
a whole. This lag continued into fiscal year 2007. The Commonwealth's rate was  
above the national rate by 1.3% to 1.4% during the fall of 2006. In April 2007, 
Massachusetts was less than the country, but only by 0.1%. As of October of     
2007, the Commonwealth's rate was 4.3%, 0.2% less than it was a year earlier.   
The Commonwealth continues to contain a large employment base of education,     
health and human services positions that stabilize the economy. Per capita net  
income remains at least 26% ahead of the national average. However, concerns are
long held in the Commonwealth about housing affordability costs.                

  The Comptroller General of the United States, David Walker, has elevated the
discussion of fiscal sustainability to a national debate. The Federal           
government, the States and local governments all will face sustainability issues
in the future. Walker paints an ominous picture showing that federal            
discretionary spending - where the Commonwealth receives its federal revenues - 
has dropped from 67% in 1966 to 38% of the federal budget in 2006. The 38%      
includes the costs of defense. The costs of social insurance programs and the   
net interest charges of the federal government will constrain state and local   
levels in the future to the point where the fiscal burden of these programs,    
according to Walker, is $440,000 per person. The Commonwealth reported in       
October that on a statutory basis, it spent more than it received in its budget 
of approximately $308 million in fiscal year 2007. Similarly, the fiscal year   
2008 budget relies on one time funding and is currently projected to end the    
year with an operating loss of $395.4 million. The Commonwealth, like most      
governments, relies heavily on federal revenues. Finding either new streams of  
revenue or ways to streamline spending in the future is the only way to start to
prepare for the downturn in federal revenues that is surely coming in the       
future.                                                                         

   Massachusetts continues to recover economically from the recession that ended
in fiscal year 2003. The Commonwealth is home to many world renowned            
institutions of higher education, both public and private, keeping the economy  
relatively stable and an incubator for new ideas and growth. Unemployment has   
dropped due to this stabilization. The Commonwealth, with an international      
reputation for medical, cultural, historical and educational institutions       
remains the economic and educational hub of New England. The Commonwealth's     
economy remains diversified, but its strongest component is its knowledge -     
based technology and service industries. The Commonwealth is home to 16 S&P 500 
companies, among them six Fortune 500 headquarters.                             

Massachusetts' infrastructure provides strong support for this            
knowledge-based economy. There are over 120 colleges and universities located in
Massachusetts, and the 2000 US Census, updated in March of 2005, estimated that 
40.4% of the residents over age 25 have earned bachelor's degrees, compared to  
an estimate of 28% for the United States as a whole. In the same survey, nearly 
90% of residents over age 25 at least have a high school diploma. In primary    
education, the National Assessment of Education Progress ranks Massachusetts    
first in 4th and 8th grade mathematics and reading, second in writing and fourth
and sixth in science in grades 4 and 8, respectively. This shows that           
Massachusetts school children are consistently among the best educated in the   
nation.                                                                         

Per capita net income actually dropped 0.6% in fiscal year 2007, lagging  
behind the 0.2% drop nationally. For the Commonwealth, this is the first drop   
since fiscal year 2002 (a drop of 0.1%), which was entirely due to the events of
September 11, 2001. This is a caution sign nationwide. On a dollar basis, per   
capita net income is over $9,600 higher than the national average. Unemployment 
during the year declined overall, beginning the year at 5.2% and ending slightly
lower as of June at 5.0%. During most of the year, the federal rate was slightly
lower, but recently, the Commonwealth's rate improved to 4.3% and dropped below 
the national rate once again.                                                   

Net Assets. The liabilities of the Commonwealth exceeded its assets at the
end of fiscal year 2007 by over $5.2 billion, an improvement of over $1.3       
billion during the fiscal year. Of the $5.2 billion deficit amount,             
"unrestricted net assets" is reported as a negative $10.4 billion, offset by    
$3.3 billion in "restricted net assets". There are two primary reasons for      
negative unrestricted net assets. Upon completion, the Central Artery / Third   
Harbor Tunnel (CA/T) will be owned by the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority and  
the Massachusetts Port Authority. The Commonwealth, however, is paying for the  
construction of these assets and retains a large amount of related debt.        
Similarly, the Commonwealth has a liability of $4.5 billion for its share of the
construction costs of schools owned and operated by municipalities through the  
Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA). MSBA will begin approving grants
in fiscal year 2008. Because of the statutory prohibition of the MSBA from      
accepting applications for new school construction until July 1, 2007, this     
overall liability of $4.5 billion decreased by $1.8 billion during fiscal year  
2007 due to grant payments made to municipalities during the year and reductions
of grant payment obligations due to audits done by MSBA. During the fiscal year,
significant restricted net asset balances were set aside for unemployment       
benefits and debt retirement.                                                   

   Changes in Net Assets. The Commonwealth's net assets increased by nearly $1.4
billion in fiscal year 2007. Net assets of governmental activities increased by 
about half of this $1.4 billion. The increase in net assets is primarily        
attributable to the aforementioned school construction activity and increased   
tax revenues. Tax revenues rose by nearly $1.4 billion above prior year         
collections. Expenses of governmental activities were nearly $36 billion. This  
increase from fiscal year 2006's $34.3 billion is attributable to increase in   
Local Aid expenses of $400 million and Medicaid expenses of over $890 million.  
However, major categories of expenses rose, led by Medicaid costs. General      
revenue for the Commonwealth, net of transfers, but including taxes, investment 
income and tobacco settlement income from governmental activities was nearly    
$21.7 billion. Net assets of the business-type activities showed an increase of 
nearly $663 million.                                                            

   Governmental Fund Balances. At June 30, 2007, the Commonwealth's governmental
funds reported a combined ending fund balance of over $7.7 billion. Of the $7.7 
billion, over $6.6 billion represents unreserved or undesignated fund balance.  
This is primarily due to an increase in the School Building Authority's balance 
of over $598 million, less a $23 million decrease in the General Fund balance   
and an increase deficit in the Highway Fund. The Highway Fund maintains a       
cumulative deficit of nearly $1.3 billion. The Highway Fund's deficit increased 
by $224 million from the prior year. The unreserved and undesignated fund       
balance of over $6.6 billion includes the highway fund deficit. Similar to last 
year, $145.0 million has been declared as a receivable in the governmental funds
related to anticipated tobacco settlement proceeds in fiscal year 2008. As      
previously mentioned, the Lottery had an operating deficit of $118 million. The 
MSBA's fund balance of $1.9 billion is blended into the Commonwealth. Within    
this fund balance are financing sources of bond proceeds and bond premium of    
nearly $1.6 billion and expenditures of nearly $1.4 billion for grant payments  
to municipalities. Another $562.2 million was transferred to the MSBA from the  
Commonwealth from sales taxes. Governmental reserved fund balances total over   
$1.0 billion. The vast majority of this is nearly $941 million reserved for     
retirement of indebtedness, the vast majority of which is held in escrows       
related to refunding bonds and to pay grant anticipation notes. Of the remaining
portion, $100 million is reserved for the CA/T owner controlled insurance       
program for workers' compensation and general liability and $52 million is      
reserved for amounts due from cities and towns.                                 

 Debt Administration. The Commonwealth issues short-term and long-term debt.
Debt that is general obligation in nature is backed by the full faith and credit
of the Commonwealth and paid from governmental funds. Additionally, short-term  
notes are issued and redeemed annually.                                         

   Exclusive of MSBA, the Commonwealth issued over $1.6 billion in new debt this
year. An additional $1.4 billion was sold in the form of refunding bonds, taking
advantage of interest rate changes on previously issued debt. MSBA continued to 
sell debt this year, issuing $1.6 billion in bonds in the fiscal year.          
Subsequent to year end, the Commonwealth issued three series of bonds, including
$1.3 billion of general obligation bonds. These bonds are the first bonds the   
Commonwealth has sold ahead of time. It is anticipated that the proceeds of     
these bonds will fund capital expenditures for all of fiscal year 2008. The     
majority of bond sales were for transportation purposes, as well as for the     
MSBA. During fiscal year 2007, nearly $1.2 billion in bond principal was repaid,
with nearly $1.4 billion refunded.                                              

Ratings. As of July 2008, all outstanding general obligation bonds of the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts are rated AA by S&P and Aa2 by Moody's. Any       
explanation concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from   
the rating agencies. There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for   
any period of time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.               

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Massachusetts issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness  
of obligations issued by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and there is no     
obligation on the part of the Commonwealth to make payment on such local        
obligations in the event of default.                                            

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Massachusetts IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive         
description of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations  
are subject. Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and 
environmental policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the  
issuers of such bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the      
financial condition of the Commonwealth and various agencies and political      
subdivisions thereof. The Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent
such factors or other factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in  
the Massachusetts IM-IT, the market value or marketability of such bonds or the 
ability of the respective issuers of such bonds acquired by the Massachusetts   
IM-IT to pay interest on or principal of such bonds.                            

 The Massachusetts IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory
factors affecting issuers of Massachusetts municipal obligations (the           
"Massachusetts Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse      
effects of certain Massachusetts constitutional amendments, legislative         
measures, voter initiatives and other matters that are described. The           
information provided above is only a brief summary of the complex factors       
affecting the financial situation in Massachusetts and is derived from sources  
that are generally available to investors and are believed to be accurate. No   
independent verification has been made of the accuracy or completeness of any of
the foregoing information. It is based in part on information obtained from     
various Commonwealth and local agencies in Massachusetts or contained in        
Official Statements for various Massachusetts Municipal Obligations.            

 Michigan Risk Factors

Economic Condition and Outlook. Michigan's economy relies heavily on the  
performance of the manufacturing sector, in general, and the auto industry,     
specifically. Given weak manufacturing employment performance, declining vehicle
production, continued declines in Big 3 market share, and continued supply      
rationalization among vehicle suppliers, Michigan's employment performance has  
been below the national average. Substantial productivity gains in the          
manufacturing sector and vehicle industry have also contributed to Michigan's   
below average employment performance.                                           

For 2007, Michigan employment is estimated to have declined by 65,000 jobs
(1.5 percent) - the seventh straight year that Michigan employment has declined.
From Michigan's employment peak in June 2000, Michigan has lost approximately   
420,000 jobs. In contrast, Michigan employment had increased approximately      
490,000 jobs above its pre-recession peak by this time after the 1990-1991      
recession.                                                                      

   Personal income was up an estimated 1.9 percent and wages and salaries income
fell an estimated 0.1 percent in 2007. Both personal income and wages and       
salaries failed to keep pace with the increase in consumer prices as measured by
the Detroit consumer price index (2.1 percent).                                 

   Several factors are weighing on the national economy including sharp declines
in the housing market, worsening credit markets and near record                 
inflation-adjusted oil prices. As a result, the U.S. economic growth will remain
tepid. Given this, Michigan employment is expected to decline in 2008 - although
less so than in 2007, with 2008 employment falling by 1.2 percent. In 2008,     
Michigan personal income is projected to rise 2.3 percent, while wages and      
salaries are expected to increase 0.7 percent. With 2.0 percent inflation, real 
(inflation adjusted) personal income is forecast to increase while real wages   
and salaries are expected to decline in 2008.                                   

   Revenues and Expenditures. In recent years, the State of Michigan has, except
as described below, reported its financial results in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. During fiscal year 2007, the State was again    
faced with difficult budget challenges. In March 2007, Executive Order 2007-3   
was issued authorizing expenditure reductions totaling $274.2 million and       
transfers of unexpended balances and excess revenue from restricted revenue     
sources totaling $70.4 million to be used as general fund - general purpose     
revenues. In addition to the executive order reductions, the original budget was
amended by various supplemental appropriations and appropriation reductions.    
General-purpose tax revenues of $8.5 billion were $254.8 million more than the  
original estimate of $8.3 billion. Restricted revenue inflows of $14.6 billion  
were $435.3 million less than the estimated $15.1 billion. The General Fund     
received transfers of $508.0 million from other appropriated funds. The largest 
transfer was from the Michigan Tobacco Settlement Finance Authority, totaling   
$207.2 million and from the Liquor Purchase Revolving Fund, totaling $162.4     
million. In addition, the General Fund received one-time transfers from the     
Civilian Conservation Endowment Fund, totaling $20 million and another $50      
million from the 21st Century Jobs Fund. Differences between the final budget   
and actual spending result from spending authority lapses of $137.6 million and 
restricted revenue authorized, but not spent, of $8.2 million. At fiscal        
year-end, excess restricted revenues of $395.6 million carried forward into     
fiscal year 2008 and are available upon appropriation. All agencies finished the
year with net lapses. However, Human Services and State Police reported line    
item over-expenditures of $1.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively.          

   In November of 1997, the State Legislature adopted legislation to provide for
the funding of claims of local school districts, some of whom had alleged in a  
lawsuit, Durant v. State of Michigan, that the State had, over a period of      
years, paid less in school aid than required by the State's Constitution. Under 
this legislation, the State paid to school districts which were plaintiffs in   
the suit approximately $212 million from the Budget Stabilization Fund on April
15, 1998, and will be required to pay to other school districts an estimated    
amount of $632 million over time. Those payments, which commenced in fiscal year
1998-99, are being paid from the Budget Stabilization Fund and the General Fund,
half in annual payments over 10 years and half in annual payments over 15 years.

  The Michigan Constitution of 1963 limits the amount of total revenues of the
State raised from taxes and certain other sources to a level for each fiscal    
year equal to a percentage of the State's personal income for the prior calendar
year. In the event that the State's total revenues exceed the limit by 1 percent
or more, the Michigan Constitution of 1963 requires that the excess be refunded 
to taxpayers. There can be no assurance that any financial difficulties the     
State may experience will not adversely affect the market value or marketability
of the Bonds or the ability of the respective obligors to pay interest on or    
principal of the Bonds, particularly in view of the dependency of local         
governments and other authorities upon State aid and reimbursement programs and,
in the case of bonds issued by the State Building Authority, the dependency of  
the State Building Authority on the receipt of rental payments from the State to
meet debt service requirements upon such bonds. In the 1991 fiscal year, the    
State deferred certain scheduled cash payments to municipalities, school        
districts, universities and community colleges. While such deferrals were made  
up at specified later dates, similar future deferrals could have an adverse     
impact on the cash position of some local governmental units. Additionally, the 
State reduced revenue sharing payments to municipalities below that level       
otherwise provided under formulas in each of those years.                       

 The Trust may contain general obligation bonds of local units of government
pledging the full faith and credit of the local unit which are payable from the 
levy of ad valorem taxes on taxable property within the jurisdiction of the     
local unit. Such bonds issued prior to December 22, 1978, or issued after       
December 22, 1978 with the approval of the electors of the local unit, are      
payable from property taxes levied without limitation as to rate or amount. With
respect to bonds issued after December 22, 1978, and which were not approved by 
the electors of the local unit, the tax levy of the local unit for debt service 
purposes is subject to constitutional, statutory and charter tax rate           
limitations. In addition, several major industrial corporations have instituted 
challenges of their ad valorem property tax assessments in a number of local    
municipal units in the State. If successful, such challenges could have an      
adverse impact on the ad valorem tax bases of such units which could adversely  
affect their ability to raise funds for operation and debt service requirements.

Assets. The State's combined net assets decreased $575.5 million (3.4     
percent) over the course of this fiscal year's operations. The net assets of the
governmental activities decreased $309.2 million (1.9 percent) and business-type
activities had a decrease of $266.3 million (42.3 percent). The largest         
component of the State's net assets ($15.7 billion) reflects its investment in  
capital assets (e.g. land, buildings, equipment, infrastructure, and others),   
less any related debt outstanding that was needed to acquire or construct the   
assets. Restricted net assets are the next largest component, comprising $2.7   
billion. These represent resources that are subject to external restrictions,   
constitutional provisions, or enabling legislation on how they can be used. The 
State's unrestricted net assets were ($2.2) billion as of the close of the year.
A positive balance in unrestricted net assets represents excess assets available
to meet ongoing obligations. A negative balance means that it would be necessary
to convert restricted assets to unrestricted assets if all ongoing obligations  
were immediately due and payable.                                               

Debt Management. The State Constitution authorizes general obligation     
long-term borrowing, subject to approval by the Legislature and a majority of   
voters at a general election. During the year, the State issued general         
obligation refunding bonds to retire older bonds as well as issued              
revenue-dedicated bonds to retire grant anticipation notes and to secure more   
favorable interest rates and reduce certain debt service payments. In addition, 
the Michigan Tobacco Settlement Finance Authority issued taxable tobacco        
settlement asset backed bonds of $527.9 million to fund General Fund and School 
Aid Fund programs.                                                              

Ratings. As of July 2008, State of Michigan general obligation bonds are  
rated AA- by S&P and Aa3 by Moody's. Any explanation concerning the significance
of such ratings must be obtained from the rating agencies. There can be no      
assurance that such ratings will be maintained in the future.                   

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Michigan issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of    
obligations issued by the State of Michigan, and there is no obligation on the  
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Michigan IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description  
of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject. 
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Michigan IM-IT, the
market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective    
issuers of such bonds acquired by the Michigan IM-IT to pay interest on or      
principal of such bonds.                                                        

The Michigan IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory    
factors affecting issuers of Michigan municipal obligations (the "Michigan      
Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain  
Massachusetts constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives
and other matters that are described. The information provided above is only a  
brief summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in       
Michigan and is derived from sources that are generally available to investors  
and are believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of   
the accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing information. It is based in
part on information obtained from various State and local agencies in Michigan  
or contained in Official Statements for various Michigan Municipal Obligations. 

Minnesota Risk Factors

 Economic Outlook. Minnesota's economy grew during the 2007 fiscal year, but
it failed to keep pace with the national averages on a number of key measures.  
Payroll employment increased by 35,000 between June 2006 and June 2007. This    
amount was almost identical to that seen in fiscal year 2006, leaving the State 
with 1.3 percent more jobs than at the start of the fiscal year. However, U.S.  
payroll employment is currently reported to have grown by 1.4 percent over that 
same period. Minnesota's unemployment rate was identical to the U.S. rate of 4.5
percent in June 2007, an increase of 9.7 percentage points from the 3.8 percent 
rate reported for the State for June 2006. The U.S. rate fell 0.1 percentage    
point during that same period.                                                  

   Personal income growth during fiscal year 2007 again failed to keep pace with
the U.S. average. Personal income in Minnesota grew by 5.2 percent between the  
second quarter of 2006 and the second quarter of 2007. The U.S. average growth  
rate was 6.4 percent. Personal income growth in Minnesota has been slipping     
compared lo its national counterpart for more than two years. In calendar year  
2006, the most recent year for which data is available, Minnesota personal      
income was $200.2 billion, 2.83 percent of the U.S. total. During calendar year 
2006, personal income grew by 5.1 percent, 1.5 percentage points less than the  
comparable national growth rate of 6.6 percent. Per capita personal income in   
Minnesota was $38,751 in calendar year 2005, 5.8 percent more than the U.S.     
average. In calendar year 2005, per capita personal income in Minnesota was 7.1 
percent more than the U.S. average. In calendar year 2003 and in calendar year  
2004, personal income was 9.0 percent more than its U.S. counterpart.           

  Most forecasters expect slower than trend growth for the national economy in
fiscal year 2008. Global Insight, the State's national economic consultant,     
calls for real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to grow at a 2.3 percent annual rate
over the fiscal year. Much of that growth occurred during the first quarter of  
the fiscal year when a real GDP growth rate of 4.9 percent was reported. Global 
Insight's November baseline forecast calls for growth during the remaining three
quarters of the fiscal year to average just 1.2 percent at an annual rate.      
Extended weakness in the housing sector, credit problems, and higher energy     
prices are the reasons for the slow growth forecast.                            

  The Minnesota outlook for fiscal year 2008 is slightly more pessimistic than
the national outlook. State employment is projected to decline by 11,000 jobs   
between the third quarter of calendar year 2007 and the third quarter of        
calendar year 2008. Employment in the construction and manufacturing sectors    
remains a concern. The housing slump seems to have had a more severe impact on  
Minnesota's economy than on the national economy. Personal income growth in     
Minnesota is forecast to be 3.9 percent. Nationally, a growth of 4.7 percent is 
projected. Personal income growth in Minnesota will again be boosted by strong  
farm sector earnings.                                                           

Major Initiatives. Revenues exceeded spending estimates by $1.0 billion in
the fiscal year 2007 budget forecasts. The State used some of these funds to    
restore the General Fund budgetary reserves as well as reverse the shifts in    
school aid payments and property tax recognition that had been utilized to      
balance 2004-05 biennial budget.                                                

   A significant portion of the 2007 tax and spending changes were the result of
initiatives enacted during the 2005 special session that initially adopted the  
biennial budget. Supplemental funding was added during the 2006 session for some
agencies for fiscal year 2007, including additional funding for the cost of     
employee contracts in a variety of state institutions that provide direct       
services to individuals.                                                        

   During the 2007 legislative session, no significant tax law changes occurred.
The budget adopted for the 2008/09 biennium included budgeted increases for a   
wide array of state agencies and programs, representing an easing of the fiscal 
constraints of the previous two biennia. The enacted budget authorized spending 
of $34.6 billion. The $1.0 billion one-time surplus of revenue resulting from   
fiscal year 2007 receipts was a major portion of the $3.0 billion increase in   
spending over the previous biennium (9.6 percent increase). Both K-12 education 
and health and human services have adopted budgets that exceed the previous     
biennium by more than $1.0 billion.                                             

Shortly after the enactment of the fiscal year 2008/09 budget, two major  
events occurred in Minnesota that changed the outlook from the time of the      
budget's original adoption. On August 1, 2007, the I-35W bridge over the        
Mississippi River collapsed in Minneapolis. Reconstruction of this span began   
quickly, and with federal assistance, the structure should be replaced by       
December 2008. Further, flooding in southeastern Minnesota in mid-August 2007   
resulted in a special session that increased spending and bonding authorizations
for recovery efforts.                                                           

   General Fund budgetary reserves are higher in fiscal year 2007 than projected
to be in the future. During the 2006/2007 biennium, there was a temporary $110  
million Tax Relief Account, which is treated like a reserve in the General Fund.
This account balance was released to the General Fund on July 1, 2007 as part of
legislation adopted in 2006.                                                    

  Debt Management. The State's debt management policies require that the ratio
of budgeted biennial debt service expenditures for general obligation bonded    
debt, paid by transfers from the General Fund, should not exceed 3.0 percent of 
total projected biennial General Fund non-dedicated revenues, net of refunds, on
a budgetary basis. The ratio of transfers to net non-dedicated revenues for the 
biennium ending June 30, 2007 is 2.4 percent.                                   

 The State's total long-term debt obligations increased by $536 million (9.7
percent) during for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2007. The increase is       
primarily due to the issuance of general obligation bonds for trunk highway     
projects and other various state purposes and revenue bonds for grants to school
districts in the taconite assistance area, a public safety radio communication  
system, and the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities.                      

Cash Management. The majority of cash is held in the State treasury and   
commingled in state bank accounts. The cash in individual funds may be invested 
separately where permitted by statute. However, cash in most funds is invested  
as a part of an investment pool. Investment earnings of the pools are allocated 
to the individual funds where provided by statute. Earnings for all other       
participants are credited to the General Fund.                                  

 Minnesota statutes require that deposits be secured by depository insurance
or a combination of depository insurance and collateral securities held in the  
State's name by an agent of the State. This statute further requires that such  
insurance and collateral shall be in amounts sufficient to ensure that the      
deposits do not exceed 90 percent of the sum of the insured amount and the fair 
value of the collateral.                                                        

  The State Board of Investment manages the majority of the State's investing.
Minnesota statutes broadly restrict investment to obligations and stocks of U.S.
and Canadian governments, their agencies and their registered corporations,     
short-term obligations of specified high quality, restricted participation as a 
limited partner in venture capital, real estate, or resource equity investments 
and restricted participation in registered mutual funds.                        

Legislation/Litigation. On May 8, 1998, Minnesota settled its lawsuit with
the tobacco industry, resulting in a new revenue stream for the State. A small  
portion of the settlement ($202 million) was dedicated by the courts for        
specific purposes and will not be a part of the State's general revenues. A     
larger portion of the settlement (the one-time payments) was dedicated by the   
Governor and the legislature to be placed into endowments for specific purposes.
The balance (the annual payments) will be deposited into the State's General    
Fund.                                                                           

 The 2002 legislature expanded the uses of one-time tobacco settlement funds
to allow for short-term borrowing by the State effective July 2003. The         
legislature created the endowments in response to the 1998 settlement and       
dedicated the proceeds to medical education and tobacco prevention. Up to five  
percent of the endowment's value is appropriated each year for health programs. 
After the recent law changes, appropriations may still be issued for medical    
education and tobacco prevention, but the State may use endowment balances if   
necessary to meet short-term cash flow needs.                                   

At any given time there may be numerous civil actions pending against the 
State of Minnesota which could, if determined adversely to the State, affect the
State's expenditures and, in some cases, its revenues.                          

Risk Management. Minnesota statutes permit the purchase of insurance on   
state-owned buildings and contents. The Commissioner of the Department of       
Administration may authorize the purchase of insurance on state properties      
should it be deemed necessary and appropriate to protect buildings and contents.
All losses of state property are self-insured, covered by programs of the Risk  
Management Fund (an internal service fund), or covered by insurance policies    
purchased by the Risk Management Fund on behalf of state agencies. Employees'   
health and a portion of dental insurance are self-insured. Employees' life and  
the remaining dental insurance are provided through contracts with outside      
organizations. Premiums collected for these benefits have been more than        
sufficient to cover claims submitted.                                           

Ratings. As of July 2008, all outstanding general obligation bonds of the 
State of Minnesota are rated AAA by S&P and Aa1 by Moody's. Any explanation     
concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating    
agencies. There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of
time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.                             

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Minnesota issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of   
obligations issued by the State of Minnesota, and there is no obligation on the 
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Minnesota IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description 
of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject. 
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Minnesota IM-IT,   
the market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective
issuers of such bonds acquired by the Minnesota IM-IT to pay interest on or     
principal of such bonds.                                                        

The Minnesota IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory   
factors affecting issuers of Minnesota municipal obligations (the "Minnesota    
Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain  
Minnesota constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and
other matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief
summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in Minnesota   
and is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and are   
believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the       
accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing information. It is based in    
part on information obtained from various state and local agencies in Minnesota 
or contained in Official Statements for various Minnesota Municipal Obligations.

 Missouri Risk Factors

Economic Outlook. The State provides a range of services in the areas of  
agriculture, education, health and social services, transportation systems,     
public safety, law enforcement, judicial systems, economic development,         
conservation and natural resources, labor relations, and general administration.

  The State operates on a legally adopted budget in order to ensure compliance
with legal provisions embodied in the annual appropriated budget passed by the  
General Assembly and approved by the Governor prior to the beginning of the     
fiscal year. If appropriations are not sufficient for a fiscal year,            
supplemental amounts are requested during the next legislative session by the   
same process that original appropriations are requested. Budgetary control is   
maintained at the departmental level. Expenditures cannot exceed the            
appropriation amounts at the individual appropriation level. Also, the Governor 
has the authority to reduce the allotments of appropriations in any fund if it  
appears that the revenue estimate will not be met. Unexpended appropriations    
lapse at the end of each appropriation year, unless reappropriated to the       
following appropriation year.                                                   

Missouri's economy is highly diversified. This is indicative of a robust  
economy capable of supporting a variety of industries. As a major manufacturing,
financial, and agricultural state, Missouri's economic health is tied closely to
that of the nation. While the national economy has slowed in fiscal year 2007,  
it is expected to return to growth in fiscal year 2008.                         

  Missouri's personal income, which directly impacts individual income tax and
sales tax, rose at a 5.3% rate during calendar year 2006. Personal income trends
indicate that Missouri can expect continued growth during fiscal year 2008.     
Along with higher personal income, Missourians also enjoy the seventh lowest    
cost of living in the United States.                                            

Through the end of June 2007, exports by Missouri companies totaled $6.9  
billion, compared to $6.0 billion after the second quarter of 2006. This is     
particularly good news for the State's businesses because Missouri set a record 
for exports in 2006 with $12.8 billion in total global sales. These second      
quarter 2007 figures put the State on track to top that mark this year.         

   Capital Assets. State's investment in capital assets for its governmental and
business-type activities as of June 30, 2007, was $28.5 billion (net of         
accumulated depreciation). This investment in capital assets includes           
construction in progress, infrastructure in progress, land, land improvements,  
buildings and improvements, equipment, and infrastructure.                      

 Long-Term Debt. At the end of fiscal year 2007, the State had total general
obligation and other bonded debt outstanding of $3.3 billion. Of this amount,   
$684.5 million comprises debt backed by the full faith and credit of the        
government. Principal amounts retired in fiscal year 2007 were $55,420,000 for  
general obligation bonds and $527,135,000 for other bonds.                      

Budget. The State of Missouri completed fiscal year 2007 with a balanced  
budget. Net general revenue collections increased 5.2% from fiscal year 2006    
ending with an amount of $7.7 billion. Also, consumer spending kept the economy 
growing at a steady pace. The approved budget for fiscal year 2008 anticipates  
an increase of 2.6% from fiscal year 2007.                                      

Missouri's economic future remains positive as evidenced by economic      
indicators and statistics. Despite averaging slightly slower than the U.S.,     
Missouri sustained a steady employment growth throughout 2005 and 2006. As of   
March 2007, Missouri employment growth over the year totaled 32,600 seasonally  
adjusted, an increase of 1.2% over the year.                                    

Over the last four years, the following industries have had above average 
employment growth: insurance carriers and related industries; computer systems  
design and most scientific and professional services; administrative and support
services; private educational services; most health care industries; and most   
leisure and hospitality industries. Educational and health services industry had
the largest increase in jobs mainly due to the increase in health care and      
social assistance. Growth within leisure and hospitality services was driven by 
a 7,500 increase in accommodations and food services. The strongest growth in   
professional and business services was in the administrative and support        
services sub sector, while growth in trade, transportation, and utilities was   
spread throughout the industry.                                                 

Despite a national decline in the housing market, Missouri experienced a  
growth in the construction industry. The State has not had the downturn in      
construction related to the housing bubble and meltdown of the sub-prime        
mortgage market. Missouri may not have speculatively overbuilt residential units
to the same extent as other parts of the country. Heavy construction has        
continued unabated. However, there is still a risk that the troubles in the     
housing market could spill over to other parts of the economy.                  

Missouri's unemployment rate increased 0.1% in fiscal year 2007. At July  
2007, the unemployment rate was 4.9% compared to the July 2006 unemployment rate
of 4.8%. The national unemployment rate was 4.6% in July 2007.                  

In spite of continued growth, Missouri faces several funding challenges in
areas such as education, health care, and transportation.                       

Funding remains a challenge for Missouri schools. A revision to the school
funding formula was made in 2005 in response to a lawsuit filed by 257 of the   
524 Missouri schools against the State in January of 2004 over both the equity  
in funding between schools and the overall adequacy of school funding. The      
revision in the school funding formula calls for $800 million to be phased in by
the 2012-2013 school year. However, an amended lawsuit was filed in November    
2005 and went to trial in 2007. The judge ruled in favor of the State but an    
appeal is expected to the State's Supreme Court. In fiscal year 2008, funding   
for Missouri Public schools will increase by $132.6 million due to a revision in
the school funding formula. The fiscal year 2008 budget also included an        
additional $1 million for after school programs.                                

More than five million Missourians have health insurance while 700,000 are
yet to be covered. House Bill 818 is working towards building a comprehensive   
program to expand access to quality health insurance and reduce the number of   
Missourians who lack coverage. This bill will also provide a tax relief measure 
to help lower the cost of health insurance for families by allowing them to     
deduct costs for health insurance premiums from their adjusted gross income.    

 Funding for Missouri's transportation is expected to be short of the amount
needed to improve and maintain Missouri's transportation system. The projected  
cost to maintain and improve the transportation system for the next 20 years is 
$37 billion, while the expected available funding for the same time period is   
$19 billion. Currently, the Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT)       
receives funding from state vehicle sales taxes, fuel taxes, and federal        
sources. However, the U.S. Department of Transportation has advised states that 
by October 2009 the National Highway Trust Fund will have a deficit balance.    
This could decrease the federal money received by the State by one-third. Higher
fuel prices are another likely cause in the decrease in available funds. A trend
has shown that motorists are driving less and purchasing more economical        
vehicles due to higher fuel prices, which means lower revenue from fuel and     
sales taxes for the State. MoDOT is continuing to work to control the cost of   
construction as well as to find alternative funding.                            

Despite funding challenges, the State is working to stimulate the economy,
increase efficiency, and decrease costs. In fiscal year 2007, Missouri passed   
Senate Bill 389 which establishes the need-based Access Missouri scholarship for
Missouri students. The bill also caps tuition increases and requires            
institutional performance measures. The Senior Tax Bill (House Bill 444)        
establishes a six-year phase out of taxes on Social Security or Public Pension  
benefits for those who are 62 years and older and whose total income is less    
than $85,000 for single; $100,000 for married couples. The Quality Jobs Act     
(House Bill 1 - Special Session) expands the Quality Jobs Program by raising the
cap on available tax credits from $12 million to $40 million annually. The      
program allows for state income tax and financial institutions tax credits for  
qualified businesses that create a minimum number of new jobs paying at or above
the county average in addition to offering health insurance and paying at least 
50% of the employees' premiums. The Health Insurance Portability and            
Accountability Act (House Bill 818) provides for various health insurance       
changes including establishing a health savings account; a tax deduction and a  
tax credit for costs associated with obtaining health insurance; and health     
screenings for pregnant women. The bill also establishes a process for hospitals
and other health care providers to intercept an individual's tax refund or      
lottery winnings to offset the individual's debt to the hospital or other health
care provider. Missouri Continuing Health Improvement Act (Senate Bill 577)     
modifies the laws to the State's medical assistance program, thereby            
transforming the State's Medicaid program into the new Missouri HealthNet       
Program. The bill extends health care coverage to the working disabled, to      
people who meet income limits, to foster children up to age 21, and to children 
participating in the State Children's Health Insurance Program.                 

  Governmental Funds. At the end of fiscal year 2007, the State's governmental
funds reported combined ending fund balances of $4.7 billion. Approximately     
65.0% is unreserved and available for spending at the government's discretion.  
The remainder of fund balance is reserved to indicate that it is not available  
for new spending because it has already been committed: 1) for budget reserve,  
2) to pay debt service, 3) for loans receivable, and 4) for a variety of other  
purposes.                                                                       

Proprietary Funds. The State has three major proprietary funds: State     
Lottery, Unemployment Compensation, and the Petroleum Storage Tank Insurance    
Fund. The State Lottery was established in 1986 to account for the sale of      
lottery tickets and lottery operations. Since 1992, public education has been   
the sole beneficiary of lottery proceeds. Unemployment Compensation accounts for
contributions and payments collected from Missouri employers under the provision
of the "Unemployment Compensation Law." This tax finances benefits for workers  
who become unemployed through no fault of their own. The Petroleum Storage Tank 
Insurance Fund accounts for moneys collected from transport load fees and       
participating owners of petroleum storage tanks. The fund pays cleanup expenses 
for petroleum leaks or spills from underground storage tanks and certain above  
ground storage tanks as well as third party property damage or bodily injury    
resulting from such discharges. This fund is one of the largest insurers of     
tanks in the country.                                                           

The State Lottery Fund's net assets increased by $0.4 million. Revenues   
increased by $22.0 million during the fiscal year which was partially offset by 
an increase in expenses for prizes paid. The increase in revenues was mainly due
to a $20.8 million increase in sales. The overall increase in sales was driven  
by a 7.1% increase in scratcher ticket sales due to an increase in prizes and   
the introduction of higher priced games.                                        

 The Unemployment Compensation Fund's net assets increased by $143.8 million
due primarily to an increase of $18.0 million in contributions and              
intergovernmental receipts and a decrease in accounts payable of $238.6 million 
due to the early repayment on a federal loan.                                   

The Petroleum Storage Tank Insurance Fund's net assets increased by $12.7 
million. Revenues increased by $2.0 million primarily due to an increase in     
investment earnings.                                                            

The general fund is the chief operating fund of the State. At the end of  
fiscal year 2007, the State's general fund reported a total fund balance of $1.9
billion. The net increase in fund balance during fiscal year 2007 was $365.8    
million. Expenditures of the general fund totaled $12.2 billion in fiscal year  
2007, a decrease of $601.2 million from fiscal year 2006. The major contributing
factor to this was a decrease in expenditures for human services of $667.0      
million from fiscal year 2006 to fiscal year 2007. The most significant decrease
was public assistance payments which decreased $328.8 million.                  

The public education fund category provides general and special education 
services to the children of the State and other related functions such as       
library services and student loans. Total fund balance increased by $37.0       
million. Revenues of the public education funds totaled $1.3 billion in fiscal  
year 2007, an increase of $8.4 million from fiscal year 2006. The major factor  
that contributed to this was an increase of $20.4 million in the miscellaneous  
revenues for an increase in loan repayments.                                    

  The conservation and environmental protection fund category provides for the
preservation of the State's wildlife and environment. The fund balance increased
by $58.5 million. The major contributing factor to this was an increase of $13.2
million in federal receipts from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.      

  The transportation and law enforcement fund category provides transportation
services, road construction and maintenance, and the enforcement of vehicle laws
and traffic safety. The fund balance decreased by $90.0 million. Revenues       
decreased $231.2 million during fiscal year 2007. The major factor contributing 
to this was a decrease of $104.4 million in motor vehicle fuel tax revenue      
relating to Amendment 3 of the State Constitution redirecting fees to the       
Missouri road fund.                                                             

The Missouri road fund accounts for revenues from highway users' fees,    
federal reimbursements for highway projects, and bond proceeds to be used for   
costs of constructing and maintaining an adequate state highway system. The fund
balance increased by $383.4 million in fiscal year 2007. Revenues of the        
Missouri road fund increased during fiscal year 2007 by $155.0 million primarily
due to an increase of $74.0 million in revenues from taxes. Out of this amount, 
$59.3 million of the increase is from motor vehicle sales tax.                  

Revenues and Expenditures. The slumping economy, federal tax cuts that sap
state revenue, and rapidly increasing health care costs have required decisive  
action each year to balance the budget. While the federal government is allowed 
to run a deficit, Missouri state government must balance its budget each year.  

  Missouri's constitutional revenue and spending limit ("Article X") imposes a
limit on the amount of taxes that may be imposed by the General Assembly in any 
fiscal year. This limit is tied to total State revenues for each fiscal year and
adjusted annually based on a formula which is tied to increases in the personal 
income of Missouri for certain designated periods. If the revenue limit is      
exceeded by 1% or more in any fiscal year, the excess revenue will be refunded  
based on the liability reported on state income tax returns. If the excess      
revenue collected is less than 1% of the revenue limit, the excess revenue shall
be transferred to the General Revenue Fund.                                     

The revenue limit can be exceeded by a constitutional amendment adopted by
the people or if the General Assembly approves by a two-thirds vote an emergency
declaration by the Governor. The State has refunded money to income taxpayers   
for fiscal years 1995 through 1999, but has not exceeded the revenue limit in   
fiscal years 2000 through 2007. The State does not expect the limit to be       
exceeded in fiscal year 2008.                                                   

 Total revenue collections decreased by $212.0 million or 1.0% during fiscal
year 2007, while total expenses only increased by $103.2 million. The decrease  
in revenue was due primarily to decreases in several types of taxes such as     
financial institution tax and managed care organization tax.                    

Debt Management. Missouri voters have approved constitutional amendments  
providing for the issuance of general obligation bonds used for a number of     
purposes. The amount of general obligation debt that can be issued by the State 
is limited to the amount approved by popular vote plus $1 million.              

Risk Management. The State is exposed to various risks of loss related to 
tort liability, general liability, motor vehicle liability, contractor          
liability, and injuries to employees. The State assumes its own liability for   
risks except for the purchase of surety bond, aircraft, and boiler coverage. The
State Office of Administration (OA), Risk Management Unit, self-insures its     
workers' compensation program for all state employees, with the exception of the
Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) and the State Highway Patrol.     
Liability insurance is also provided by OA-Risk Management, pursuant to State   
statute, through the State's legal expense fund, which is a component of the    
General Fund in this report. This insurance covers all State employees.         

Ratings. As of July 2008, all outstanding general obligation bonds of the 
State of Missouri are rated AAA by S&P and Aaa by Moody's. Any explanation      
concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating    
agencies. There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of
time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.                             

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Missouri issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of    
obligations issued by the State of Missouri, and there is no obligation on the  
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Missouri IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description  
of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject. 
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Missouri IM-IT, the
market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective    
issuers of such bonds acquired by the Missouri IM-IT to pay interest on or      
principal of such bonds.                                                        

The Missouri IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory    
factors affecting issuers of Missouri municipal obligations (the "Missouri      
Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain  
Missouri constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and 
other matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief
summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in Missouri and
is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and are       
believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the       
accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing information. It is based in    
part on information obtained from various State and local agencies in Missouri  
or contained in Official Statements for various Missouri Municipal Obligations. 

 Nebraska Risk Factors

General. Since Nebraska's Constitution generally allows no indebtedness,  
government expenses of such departments and agencies must be met on a           
pay-as-you-go basis. The State provides a full range of services including: the 
construction and maintenance of highways and infrastructure, education, social  
and health services, public safety, conservation of natural resources, economic 
development, and recreation facilities and development.                         

Budgetary control of state expenditures is maintained chiefly by three    
processes. First, a budget is required to be adopted through passage of         
appropriation bills by the Legislature. Second, the appropriated funds are      
allocated by program and fund type and are controlled by the executive branch   
through an allotment process. The Legislature may also enact a supplemental     
appropriation bill and other appropriation bills as it deems necessary. Finally,
the State's accounting system is designed to budget check each expenditure to   
ensure the appropriation is not exceeded.                                       

Economic Outlook. The General Fund operations of the State are almost     
entirely dependent upon the income and sales taxes the State receives each year.
Such taxes represent over 92 percent of all General Fund revenues. Net revenue  
from income taxes and sales taxes from all funds for the fiscal year ended June
30, 2007 increased $85 million over the prior year, due to the steady growth in 
Nebraska in all areas: jobs, income and revenue. In finalizing the biennium     
budget for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2009, the         
Legislature, as required by the State Constitution, balanced the budget.        

  For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2007, the State's General Fund ended the
fiscal year with a cash and investments balance that exceeded one billion       
dollars for the first time ever, at $1.114 billion.                             

The current forecast for fiscal year 2008 anticipates net receipts in the 
General Fund to increase about $50 million, or approximately a 1.5% increase    
over fiscal year 2007. No significant changes in revenue are anticipated in the 
other funds.                                                                    

State Economy. The Bureau of Business Research of the University of       
Nebraska-Lincoln and the Nebraska Business Forecast Council remain optimistic on
Nebraska's economic future and have published the following comments about its  
economy. Aggregate farm income is expected to grow rapidly in the next two      
years. Solid broad-based employment growth, rising proprietor incomes, and      
strong growth in dividend and interest incomes will lead to strong overall      
growth in non-farm personal income. While housing construction will not fully   
recover until 2008 or 2009, other components of the construction industry, such 
as hospital, health care, hotel and restaurant construction activity should grow
steadily. Nebraska should also continue to benefit from further decentralization
of manufacturing activity away from the industrial Midwest to areas in Nebraska.
Opportunities continue to improve in the food processing sector and the         
transportation and warehousing industries are expected to continue to expand    
rapidly. Finally, strong growth is expected in services employment, in areas    
such as health care and social assistance.                                      

  Cash Management. All cash is required to be deposited in the State Treasury.
At the direction of the State Treasurer, the State Investment Officer invests   
all cash in the Operating Investment Pool (OIP). This pool is comprised of some 
short-term investments and many medium-term investments. The OIP is reflected as
cash and investments on the State's financial statements. Interest earnings are 
credited on a monthly basis to each fund eligible to earn interest. All interest
earnings not credited to other funds are deposited in the General Fund.         

State law requires that all public funds deposited in banks be secured by 
having each such bank maintaining, at all times, an aggregate amount of         
securities of at least 102 percent of the amount on deposit, less the $100,000  
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). It is the State's  
policy to continually monitor the clearing and depository banks for compliance  
with this law.                                                                  

   Long-Term Financial Planning. The State always is looking at least four years
out in its analysis of the status of the financial condition of the State in    
preparing the its budgets, with a working model of the biennium budget for      
fiscal years 2010 and 2011. In its analysis, the State forecasting models to    
forecast revenue and then examine major expenditures, especially those that have
a trend of outpacing revenues. Future revenues are projected to increase between
4 and 6 percent annually. This increase is quickly tempered by the fact that    
during the last legislative session the Legislature passed the largest tax      
relief package in the history of the State. This moderate growth of income will 
not be enough to counter the future estimates of school aid increasing 6%,      
Medicaid increasing 7.5% and public assistance increasing 9%. Since these       
expenditures comprise about half of the General Fund expenditures, this puts    
significant pressure in keeping all other costs of running the State to a       
"minimum increase" mode in order to provide a mandated balanced budget. To      
ensure a balanced budget, the State exerts considerable time and effort in      
reviewing the trends of future revenues and expenditures.                       

Risk Management. Worker's compensation, employee health coverage, employee
liability and general liability are self-insured. Commercial insurance coverage 
has been purchased for automobile liability, real and personal property damage, 
employee life coverage, and employees' errors or omissions.                     

Retirement Systems. Total net assets of the State's pension trust funds   
reached $9.1 billion by June 30, 2007, compared to $7.8 billion on June 30,
2006. These are the assets of the three defined benefit plans (School, Judges   
and State Patrol plans), two defined contribution and cash balance plans (County
and State Employees plans) and the State Employees' Deferred Compensation Plan  
that are administered by the State.                                             

  Financial Highlights - Government-wide. The assets of the State exceeded its
liabilities at June 30, 2007 by $10.5 billion. The majority of the net assets   
are represented by the investment in the State's infrastructure and other       
capital assets, which cannot be used to fund ongoing activities of the State. Of
the net assets, unrestricted net assets were reported as $998 million, most of  
which is available to be used to fund future needs of the State. The primary    
government's net revenues exceeded net expenses for 2007 by $688 million        
resulting in the increase in net assets. The increase in net assets was         
primarily a result of a $165 million increase in investment earnings and a      
steady economy providing a moderate increase in taxes collected coupled with a  
less than budgeted increase of expenditures from 2006.                          

Fund Level. General Fund receipts for 2007 were $191 million above the    
original budgeted amount and above the final budget by $47 million. Expenditures
were $205 million less than the original budget. On a Generally Accepted        
Accounting Principles (GAAP) basis, the General Fund had $285 million in excess 
revenues prior to $6 million in other financing uses resulting in an ending fund
balance on June 30, 2007 of $972 million. Other governmental funds receipts     
exceeded expenditures by $169 million; in addition, such funds received $35     
million in other financing sources (namely net transfers in) increasing such    
fund balances at June 30, 2007 to $1,842 million.                               

  The $320 million of net assets of the Unemployment Insurance Fund represents
eighty-nine percent of the proprietary funds. Such fund had a $47 million       
increase in net assets for 2007 compared to a $62 million increase in 2006, a   
$15 million smaller increase. This was chiefly due to a $27 million decrease in 
business assessment fees collected from employers (due to a lower rate being    
charged), offset by an $8 million decrease in unemployment claims and a $5      
million increase in investment income.                                          

Long-term Liabilities. Long-term liabilities shown on the government-wide 
financial statements totaled $499 million at June 30, 2007, which is a slight   
decrease from the prior year. Most of these liabilities consist of claims       
payable for workers' compensation, medical excess liability, litigation,        
unemployment insurance, employee health insurance, and Medicaid, in addition to 
the calculated amount for accrued vacation and vested sick leave due employees  
when they retire. After a retired employee reaches the age of 65, the State has 
no further obligation for other post employment benefits.                       

Net Assets. The State's assets totaled $12,285 million at June 30, 2007 as
compared to $11,550 million at June 30, 2006. As total liabilities only totaled 
$1,769 million, net assets amounted to $10,516 million as of June 30, 2007. As  
of June 30, 2006, these amounts were $1,722 million and $9,828 million,         
respectively. By far the largest portion of the State of Nebraska's net assets  
(71 percent) reflects the State's investment in capital assets (e.g., land,     
buildings, equipment and infrastructure - highways, bridges, dams, etc.). The   
State uses these capital assets to provide services to citizens; thus, these    
assets are not available for future spending. Restricted net assets are subject 
to external restrictions, constitutional provisions, or enabling legislation on 
how they can be used. They also are not available for future spending. For      
Governmental Activities other than capital assets, the majority of the          
restricted net assets consist of the Permanent School Trust, the Tobacco        
Settlement Trust, the Intergovernmental Trust and the loans to political        
subdivisions for drinking water and clean water projects. The net assets for    
business-type activities represents chiefly cash set aside for future           
unemployment insurance benefits.                                                

 Over 79% of the State's non-capital assets consist of cash and investments.
It should be noted that $512 million in 2007 and $556 million in 2006 of such   
assets represent "Securities Lending Collateral," an amount created by a journal
entry required by GASB in order to record a lending transaction. Since the asset
is offset by a corresponding equal liability, the net asset is zero and thus the
asset cannot be spent. Receivables, chiefly from taxes and the federal          
government, represent 20% of the non-capital assets.                            

Liabilities largely reflect three groupings which represent 91% of total  
State liabilities, not including the obligations under securities lending       
explained in the above paragraph. These are operational payables, which consist 
of accounts payables and accrued liabilities of $344 million ($305 million in   
2006); tax refunds payable of $299 million ($281 million in 2006); and long-term
payables explained below.                                                       

 Since the State's Constitution generally prohibits the State from incurring
debt, the Statement of Net Assets presents few long-term liabilities (shown as  
noncurrent liabilities), which total only $499 million ($509 million in 2006).  
The majority of such liabilities are for claims payable for workers'            
compensation, medical excess liability, litigation, unemployment insurance, and 
employee health insurance totaling $138 million for 2007 ($140 million for      
2006), Medicaid claims for $192 million ($197 million in 2006) and the          
calculated amount for vested sick leave due employees when they retire and      
accrued vacation of $118 million in 2007 ($113 million for 2006). Other minor   
amounts of long-term liabilities consist chiefly of capital lease obligations,  
and bonds payable related to NETC Leasing Corporation and Nebraska State        
Building Corporation bonds. Both of these entities are legally separate from the
State, but are so intertwined with the State that they are, in substance, the   
same as the State. Such debt related to capital assets totaled $37 million at   
June 30, 2007. There was also $14 million of obligations under other financing  
arrangements.                                                                   

 The change in net assets of Governmental Activities, other than an increase
of $159 million in capital assets, was due to the $287 million increase in      
unrestricted net assets and the $196 million increase in restricted net assets. 
This was the result of increased taxes collected, a significant jump in         
investment income and lower spending than expected.                             

   At the end of June 30, 2007, the State is able to report positive balances in
all of the three categories of net assets.                                      

Governmental Activities. Governmental activities increased the State's net
assets by $641 million in 2007 ($503 million in 2006). Furthermore, governmental
activities represent 96% of all the primary government's revenues. Program      
revenues of governmental activities were $2,742 million and were used to        
partially offset program expenses of $6,271 million, leaving net expenses of    
$3,529 million. Only 6% of total expenses were spent on general government      
expenses. General taxes, investment earnings, contributions to the permanent    
fund principal and transfers all totaling $4,170 million were used to more than 
cover the remaining costs of the governmental activities' programs. Program     
revenues only increased 3% from 2006. Tax revenues were up $94 million, which   
was a little short of offsetting the increase in program expenditures, net of   
revenues. However, investment earnings increased $157 million, as opposed to a  
$25 million decrease in 2006. This increase in investment earnings was the      
result of more funds being invested at higher interest rates and large, positive
market value increases. These two revenue items were the chief reasons net      
assets increased $138 million more than in 2006. Program expenditures, net of   
revenue, increased by $119 million in 2007.                                     

  Business-type Activities. The business-type activities increased the State's
net assets by $47 million for 2007, which was net of a $29 million transfer to  
the governmental activities. Most of the $263 million of business-type          
activities' program revenues was related to the business assessment fees in the 
Unemployment Insurance Fund and Lottery Fund revenues. The Unemployment         
Insurance Fund had operating income of $33 million in 2007. This income, when   
combined with the $14 million in investment income, produced $47 million of net 
revenue. Lottery revenues of $114 million generated net revenue of $29 million, 
which was offset by the $29 million transfer to the Governmental Activities. The
lottery transfer was used primarily for education and environmental studies.    

   Governmental Funds. The focus of the State's Governmental Funds is to provide
information on near-term inflows and outflows and the availability of spendable 
resources. In particular, the unreserved balance may provide some indication of 
the State's net resources available for spending at the end of the fiscal year. 
(Unreserved balances may be designated or undesignated. If unreserved balances  
are designated, they are unreserved only within the confines of the purposes of 
the fund involved. In the Governmental Funds, most of the unreserved balances   
reside in designated funds.) At June 30, 2007, the State's Governmental Funds   
reported combined ending fund balances of $2,813 million. The total unreserved  
balances amounted to $2,153 million.                                            

General Fund. The General Fund is the chief operating fund of the State. The
major General Fund liability is the estimated tax refunds payable of $291       
million. Such refunds payable are $11 million less than the expected taxes owed 
the State. Other assets of the General Fund available to pay non tax-refund     
liabilities exceed such liabilities by $961 million. On June 30, 2006, the      
General Fund had a positive fund balance of $692 million. While both revenues   
and expenditures increased in 2007, revenues again exceeded expenditures which  
increased the fund balance $285 million in 2007, which was about equal to the   
$289 million increase that occurred in 2006. This operating increase in 2007,   
when coupled with the $6 million of net transfers out, caused the General Fund  
balance to increase by $279 million, ending with a fund balance of $972 million.
Revenues in 2007 were more than anticipated and were up $131 million over 2006  
chiefly due to (1) an increase in income tax revenue of $58 million (a 3%       
increase) over 2006 and (2) increased investment income of $57 million due to   
more funds being invested at higher interest rates. Sales taxes from increased  
retail sales were up 1.5% over last year. Expenditures were less than budgeted  
due to continued efforts by agency heads to be conservative in spending.        

To compensate for any downturns in revenues, the State has maintained a   
budgetary basis Cash Reserve Fund. While this Cash Reserve Fund is commingled   
with General fund cash in the General Fund financial statements, it is separate 
and distinct in that, by State Statute, it can only be used (1) when the cash   
balance of the General Fund is insufficient to meet General Fund current        
obligations and (2) for legislatively mandated transfers to other funds. Any    
money transferred in accordance with item one above must be repaid as soon as   
there is sufficient cash in the General Fund cash account to do so. No such need
existed in 2007. The Cash Reserve Fund was at $177 million at the beginning of  
2006. Due to the fact that 2005 revenues exceeded the forecast, a statutory     
requirement caused a $262 million transfer from the General Fund cash account to
the Cash Reserve Fund in fiscal year 2006 in July 2005. Offsetting this large   
transfer was a $146 million payment made on August 1, 2005 from the Cash Reserve
Fund to settle a lawsuit against the State related to a low-level radioactive   
waste site. There were also other transfers out of the Fund of $19 million,     
leaving a Cash Reserve Fund balance at June 30, 2006 of $274 million. The       
statutory transfer for excess receipts for FY 2006 of $260 million was made in  
July, 2006. There were transfers out of the reserve of $18 million, leaving a   
balance of $516 million at June 30, 2007.                                       

Other Governmental Funds. Other governmental fund balances totaled $1,842 
million at June 30, 2007; $660 million of such fund balances is reserved to     
indicate that such dollars are not available for new spending because such funds
(1) are represented by endowment principal ($406 million), (2) are represented  
by an asset that has not yet been received, e.g., loans receivable ($237        
million), (3) have been expended for other assets, chiefly inventories ($8      
million) and thus the funds are not available, or (4) have been committed for   
debt service ($9 million).                                                      

Of the non-General Fund unreserved fund balances of $1,182 million, $88   
million represents permanent school funds which can be used only for support of 
public schools. $1,014 million is represented by special revenue funds which    
while unreserved, normally must be spent within the confines of such special    
revenue funds (a majority of these same funds are considered "restricted" on the
government-wide financial statements). Twenty-eight million dollars is          
represented by other permanent funds, which again normally must be spent within 
the confines of the fund. Fifty-two million dollars is in the Capital Projects  
Fund, which, while unreserved, must be spent on a capital projects.             

The three major funds presented as special revenue funds are the Highway  
Fund, the Federal Fund and the Health and Social Services Fund, with total fund 
balances of $667 million. Of this balance, $656 million is classified as        
unreserved, but which are restricted in the government-wide statements,         
indicating that the funds are unreserved only within the confines of such funds.

Governmental funds other than the General Fund saw an increase in fund    
balances of $204 million. The fund balances of the following funds increased:   
the Highway Fund ($56 million), the Health and Social Service Fund ($72         
million), the Permanent School Fund ($53 million) and other Nonmajor Funds ($33 
million). The Federal Fund decreased by $10 million.                            

Fiduciary Funds. The Pension Trust Funds represent the majority of the    
fiduciary funds. Such Pension Trust Funds net assets increased $1,320 million to
$9,102 million in 2007 due primarily to a strong market in 2007, which provided 
$1,185 million in appreciation of investments. Investment income in 2007 was    
$147 million versus $141 million in 2006. Benefits, refunds and related         
administrative expenses exceeded the contributions to the plans by only $1      
million. In another trust fund, $435 million of participant contributions was   
received by the College Savings Plan and is recorded in the Private Purpose     
Trust Funds. Total net assets in the College Savings Plan now total $1,643      
million.                                                                        

Proprietary Funds. The State's proprietary funds provide the same type of 
information discussed earlier in the government-wide financial statements under 
Business-type Activities, but in more detail. The State's one major proprietary 
fund, the Unemployment Insurance Fund, had reported net assets of $320 million  
at the end of 2007. This fund's net assets increased $47 million in 2007, mainly
due to business assessment fees which exceeded the unemployment claims paid out 
by $33 million (which in effect helped rebuild the cash reserves of the fund)   
and investment earnings of $14 million. Other proprietary or enterprise funds,  
the Lottery Fund, the Excess Liability Fund (this fund was established to       
provide limited liability for physicians working in Nebraska) and Cornhusker    
State Industries (this operation utilizes incarcerated persons to manufacture   
and sell items) had combined income of $29 million prior to a $29 million       
transfer from the Lottery to governmental funds. Such transfer was used         
primarily for education and environmental studies.                              

  Analysis of General Fund. In 2007, the State continued to benefit from of an
improved economy in the Midwest. Forecasted revenues, upon which the State's    
budgeted General Fund expenses were based, were anticipated to be basically flat
in 2007 due to some changes in the sales tax base. Because the revenues         
continued to exceed expectations, the State's Forecasting Board made three new  
forecasts throughout the year, each time increasing the expected revenues. The  
total forecasted net revenues increased $144 million from the original revenue  
forecast of $3,106 million. However, the State even slightly exceeded the       
revised projected tax revenues of $3,250 million by $47 million, realizing      
actual tax revenues, net of refunds, of $3,297 million on a budgetary basis.    
Additionally, agencies continued to watch their General Fund expenditures and   
ended up spending $193 million less than the final appropriated amount. This    
reduction, when coupled with the increased tax revenues, allowed the State to   
finish 2007 with $274 million of General Fund revenues in excess of expenditures
on a budgetary basis, prior to net transfers out.                               

 Debt Management. Article XIII of the State Constitution prohibits the State
from incurring debt in excess of one hundred thousand dollars. However, there is
a provision in the constitution that permits the issuance of revenue bonds for: 
(1) construction of highways; and (2) construction of water conservation and    
management structures. The State can enter into capital lease and other         
financing contracts provided that the contracts include cancellation of clauses 
if the Legislature does not appropriate funds to continue the lease or financing
agreement.                                                                      

Ratings. As of July 2008, all outstanding general obligation bonds of the 
State of Nebraska are rated AA+ by S&P and unrated by Moody's. Any explanation  
concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating    
agencies. There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of
time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.                             

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Nebraska issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of    
obligations issued by the State of Nebraska, and there is no obligation on the  
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Nebraska IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description  
of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject. 
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Nebraska IM-IT, the
market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective    
issuers of such bonds acquired by the Nebraska IM-IT to pay interest on or      
principal of such bonds.                                                        

The Nebraska IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory    
factors affecting issuers of Nebraska municipal obligations (the "Nebraska      
Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain  
Nebraska constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and 
other matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief
summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in Nebraska and
is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and are       
believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the       
accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing information. It is based in

 New Jersey Risk Factors

 Economic Outlook. As of December 2007, New Jersey's unemployment rate stood
at 4.5 percent as compared to the nation's average of 5.0 percent. Generally    
improving labor market conditions have kept the State's monthly jobless rate    
below 5.0 percent for the forty-third time since June 2004. New Jersey's        
unemployment rate as of December 2006 was 4.2 percent.                          

  During calendar year 2007, the State's payroll employment grew at an average
annual rate of 0.6 percent after growing at rates of 0.9 percent in 2006, and   
1.0 percent in 2005. The State has added approximately 151,600 jobs between the 
bottom of the employment cycle in March 2003 and December 2007.                 

 The level of payroll employment in December 2007 was 4.1 million, remaining
above the 4.0 million mark for the forty-second consecutive month. The          
preliminary growth rate for New Jersey's personal income of 6.4 percent for the 
third quarter of 2007 came in above the revised growth rate of 5.1 percent for  
the second quarter of 2007. Personal income is expected to grow at a moderate   
pace below 5.0 percent in 2008 and 2009.                                        

The State and the nation may experience further near term deterioration in
growth and the expected pace of economic expansion may stall if consumers,      
investors, and businesses become more concerned about energy prices, sub-prime  
mortgage and other financial market turmoil, and geopolitical tensions. To a    
large extent, the future direction of the economy nationally and in New Jersey  
hinges on the assumptions regarding economic recession, energy prices, and      
stability in financial markets. With the passage of a federal economic stimulus 
package along with supportive monetary and fiscal policies, based on information
available as of the date of this report, the long term prospects for economic   
growth of the State are expected to remain stable in 2008 and beyond.           

  Revenues and Expenditures. The State's Fiscal Year 2007 net assets decreased
by $428.7 million. During Fiscal Year 2007, the State disbursed $600.0 million  
to the New Jersey Schools Construction Corporation to help finance school       
facilities construction throughout the State. Approximately 59.2 percent of the 
State's total revenue came from general taxes, while 20.6 percent was derived   
from operating grants. Charges for services amounted to 17.9 percent of total   
revenues, while other items such as capital grants, interest and investment     
earnings, and miscellaneous revenues accounted for the remainder. State         
expenditures cover a range of services. The largest expense, 30.3 percent was   
for educational, cultural, and intellectual development. Physical and mental    
health amounted to 19.6 percent of total expenditures, while government         
direction, management, and control amounted to 12.3 percent. Other major        
expenditures focused on economic planning, development, security, public safety 
and criminal justice, and community development and environmental management.   
During Fiscal Year 2007, governmental activity expense exceeded program         
revenues, resulting in the use of $31.3 billion of general revenues (mostly     
taxes and transfers). Revenues from business-type activities in Fiscal Year 2007
exceeded expenses by $899.1 million.                                            

 During Fiscal Year 2007, State revenues, including transfers, totaled $49.0
billion, a decrease of $1.0 billion from the prior fiscal year. This decrease   
was primarily due to the reclassification of funds resulting from the           
implementation of GASB Statement No. 43. General taxes totaled $29.0 billion and
accounted for 59.2 percent of total State revenues for Fiscal Year 2007. This   
amount reflects a $2.3 billion increase from the prior fiscal year and reflects 
a partial year effect of an increase in the Sales and Use Tax rate to 7.0       
percent from 6.0 percent and broadening of the Sales and Use Tax base to include
certain services. The State's Gross Income Tax totaled $11.7 billion, the Sales 
and Use Tax totaled $8.8 billion, and the Corporation Business Tax totaled $3.1 
billion. The State's three major taxes comprised 81.5 percent of the total      
general taxes that were collected during Fiscal Year 2007. Fiscal Year 2007     
expenditures totaled $49.4 billion, a decrease of $1.3 billion from the prior   
fiscal year. This decrease was primarily due to the reclassification of funds   
resulting from the implementation of GASB Statement No. 43. Offsets included    
increases of $767.9 million for educational, cultural and intellectual          
development, $477.9 million for transportation programs, $385.7 million for     
economic planning, development, and security, and $361.9 million for public     
safety and criminal justice. Overall, 49.9 percent of all State expenditures    
occurred in the areas of education, higher education, and physical and mental   
health.                                                                         

  Litigation. The State is a party in numerous legal proceedings pertaining to
matters incidental to the performance of routine governmental operations.       
Adverse judgments in these and other matters could have the potential for either
a significant loss of revenue or a significant unanticipated expenditure by the 
State. At any given time, there are various numbers of claims and cases pending 
against the State, state agencies and employees, seeking recovery of monetary   
damages that are primarily paid out of the fund created pursuant to the New     
Jersey Tort Claims Act. The claims filed can represent significant amounts and  
include, but are not limited to, issues regarding pensions and education        
funding. The majority of these claims have historically proven to be            
substantially less value than originally claimed. The State does not formally   
estimate its reserve representing potential exposure for these claims and cases.
As of June 30, 2007, the exact amount involved in these legal proceedings is not
fully determinable.                                                             

Debt Administration. The primary method for state financing of capital    
projects is through the sale of the general obligation bonds of the State. These
bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the State tax revenues and     
certain other fees are pledged to meet the principal and interest payments and  
if provided, redemption premium payments, if any, required to repay the bonds.  
General obligation debt must be approved by voter referendum and is used        
primarily to finance various environmental projects, transportation             
infrastructure, and correctional and institutional construction. As of June 30,
2007, New Jersey's outstanding long-term debt totaled $38.1 billion, a $0.7     
billion increase over the prior fiscal year. In addition, the State has $10.9   
billion of legislatively authorized bonding capacity that has not yet been      
issued. During Fiscal Year 2007, the legislatively authorized bonding capacity  
decreased by $313.2 million.                                                    

Ratings. As of July 2008, all outstanding general obligation bonds of the 
State of New Jersey are rated AA by S&P and Aa3 by Moody's. Any explanation     
concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating    
agencies. There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of
time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.                             

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local New Jersey issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of  
obligations issued by the State of New Jersey, and there is no obligation on the
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.

all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject.    
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such

 New Mexico Risk Factors

General. New Mexico is the nation's fifth-largest state in area (121,356  
square miles), with an estimated population in 2007 of 1,969,915. Albuquerque is
the State's largest city and economic center. Most of the State's leading       
employers are concentrated in Albuquerque, where 40% of the State's population  
resides. Albuquerque area employers include the University of New Mexico,       
Albuquerque Public Schools, Kirtland Air Force Base, and Sandia National        
Laboratories. Intel Corp. is the largest manufacturer and private employer in   
the State, with a semiconductor plant in Rio Rancho just outside Albuquerque.   

Major industries in the State are energy resources, semi-conductor        
manufacturing, tourism, services, arts and crafts, agriculture-agribusiness,    
government, and mining. Major federally funded scientific research facilities at
Los Alamos, Albuquerque and White Sands are also a notable part of the State's  
economy.                                                                        

General Fund. The State derives the majority of its recurring General Fund
revenues from four major sources: general and selective sales taxes, income     
taxes, taxes and royalties on natural resource production, and interest earnings
from its two permanent funds. Effective July 1, 1981, the Legislature repealed  
the property tax levy for general State operating purposes, and has not         
reinstated it since that time. However, the New Mexico Constitution authorizes a
levy of up to four mills for general State operating purposes and additional    
levies for the support of State educational, penal and other institutions.      

In the 2007 Fiscal Year, recurring General Fund revenues increased by 3.5 
percent to $5,774.5 million. Prices for oil moderated somewhat and natural gas  
prices declined to pre-Katrina levels, resulting in a decline in severance taxes
and rents and royalties of 10.2 percent and 9.5 percent, respectively. General  
and selective sales taxes grew by 7.8 percent, while income taxes grew by 9.0   
percent, with corporate income tax collections up by 21.9 percent. Investment   
income increased by 2 percent. Total recurring appropriations in the budget for 
the 2007 Fiscal Year total $5,113.1 million, representing 8.6 percent growth    
over the previous year. Non-recurring appropriations of $814.3 million were     
appropriated by the legislature, largely for capital investments. $152.9 million
was transferred from the General Fund Operating Reserve to the appropriation    
account. Year-end reserves in the General Fund decreased by $156.4 million to   
$641.8 million, or 12.6 percent of recurring appropriations.                    

Based upon the approved operating budget and estimate results for the 2008
Fiscal Year, recurring General Fund revenues are expected to increase by 2.2    
percent to $5,902.3 million. Prices for oil that had moderated somewhat early in
the fiscal year are expected to finish the fiscal year at prices over $100 a    
barrel. Natural gas prices were also moderate early in the year and finally     
began tracking crude oil increases late in the fiscal year. In the December 2007
budget forecast, growth in severance taxes and rents and royalties was estimated
at 2.0 percent and 9.0 percent, respectively. General and selective sales taxes 
are expected to grow by 2.9 percent, while income taxes are expected to decline 
by 3.2 percent. Investment income is expected to increase by 7.4 percent. Recent
flash updates indicate that total recurring revenues will be approximately as   
forecast, although oil and gas based taxes will grow strongly in excess of      
forecast, while gross receipts, income and motor vehicle excise taxes will grow 
more slowly than forecast. Total recurring appropriations in the budget for the 
2008 Fiscal Year total $5,675.1 billion, representing 11.0 percent growth over  
the previous year. Non-recurring appropriations of $313.0 million were          
appropriated by the legislature, largely for capital investments. Based on      
current estimates of revenues and appropriations, it is expected that there will
a $38.9 million transfer from the General Fund Operating Reserve to the         
appropriation account. Year-end reserves in the General Fund will decrease by   
$29.6 million to $612.2 million, or 10.8 percent of recurring appropriations.   

   Economic Factors and Next Year's Budgets and Rates. Additional resources were
added to improve the investment function in recent years. A portfolio manager   
was added to manage the new bond proceeds portfolio. Additionally, a new        
financial analyst will be added to provide analytical and accounting support. A 
new electronic trading platform (Trade Web) was initiated to allow transparent, 
competitive investment trades. The Local Government Investment Pool received its
maiden rating (AAAm) from S&P. These additional resources greatly benefited the 
investment function of the State Treasurer.                                     

   The State Treasurer contracted for a higher level of legal services to assist
with investment and other internal policy updates, provide legal counsel for    
various personnel lawsuits and grievance hearings, and draft proposed           
legislation and other miscellaneous legal advice. The State Treasurer also added
resources to implement numerous recommendations included in the forensic audit  
prepared by Deloitte; initiated personnel, system and facility, and security    
recommendations made by the Office of the Chief Information Officer; and reduced
IT budget based on decommissioning of TRACS and recognized staffing efficiencies
in banking operations due to SHARE implementation.                              

Revenues and Expenditures. The State derives the bulk of its recurring    
General Fund revenues from five major sources: general and selective sales      
taxes, income taxes, the emergency school tax on oil and gas production, rents  
and royalties from State and federal land, and interest earnings from its two   
Permanent Funds. Effective July 1, 1981, the Legislature abolished all property 
taxes for State operating purposes.                                             

Debt Management. Sections 7 and 8 of Article IX of the Constitution of the
New Mexico limits the power of State officials to incur general obligation      
indebtedness extending beyond the fiscal year in three ways. First, the State   
may borrow money not exceeding the sum of two hundred thousand dollars          
($200,000) in the aggregate to meet casual deficits or failure in revenue, or   
for necessary expenses. Second, other debt may be contracted by or on behalf of 
the State only when authorized by law for some specified work or object. Such a 
law takes effect only after being submitted to the qualified electors of the    
State and having received a majority of all votes cast thereon at a general     
election. No debt may be created if the total indebtedness of the State,        
exclusive of the debts of the territory and several counties thereof assumed by 
the State, would thereby be made to exceed 1% of the assessed valuation of all  
property subject to taxation in the State, as shown by the last preceding       
general assessment. Lastly, the State may also contract debts to suppress       
insurrection and to provide for the public defense.                             

General obligation bonds of the State are issued and the proceeds thereof 
appropriated to various purposes pursuant to an act of the Legislature of the   
State. The State Constitution requires that any law which authorizes general    
obligation debt of the State shall provide for an annual tax levy sufficient to 
pay the interest and to provide a sinking fund to pay the principal of the      
debts. General obligation bonds are general obligations of the State for the    
payment of which the full faith and credit of the State are pledged. The general
obligation bonds are payable from "ad valorem" taxes levied without limit as to 
rate or amount on all property in the State subject to taxation for State       
purposes. As of June 17, 2008 the total amount of general obligation bonds      
outstanding is approximately $238.6 million.                                    

Ratings. As of July 2008, all outstanding general obligation bonds of the 
State of New Mexico are rated AA+ by S&P and Aa1 by Moody's. Any explanation    
concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating    
agencies. There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of
time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.                             

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local New Mexico issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of  
obligations issued by the State of New Mexico, and there is no obligation on the
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the New  
Mexico IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of 
all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject.    
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the New Mexico IM-IT,  
the market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective
issuers of such bonds acquired by the New Mexico IM-IT to pay interest on or    
principal of such bonds.                                                        

The New Mexico IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory  
factors affecting issuers of New Mexico municipal obligations (the "New Mexico  
Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain  
New Mexico constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives   
and other matters that are described. The information provided above is only a  
brief summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in New   
Mexico and is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and
are believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the   
accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing information. It is based in    
part on information obtained from various State and local agencies in New Mexico
or contained in Official Statements for various New Mexico Municipal            
Obligations.                                                                    

 New York Risk Factors

General. Over the long term, the State of New York (the "State") and the City
of New York (the "City") face serious potential economic problems. The City     
accounts for approximately 41% of the State's population and personal income,   
and the City's financial health affects the State in numerous ways. Statewide,  
urban centers have experienced significant changes involving migration of the   
more affluent to the suburbs and an influx of generally less affluent residents.
Regionally, the older Northeast cities have suffered because of the relative    
success that the South and the West have had in attracting people and business. 
The City also has had to face greater competition as other major cities have    
developed financial and business capabilities which make them less dependent on 
the specialized services traditionally available almost exclusively in the City.

The financial condition of the State is affected by various national,     
economic, social and environmental policies and conditions. In particular,      
interest rate risk and equity market volatility pose a particularly large degree
of uncertainty for the State. Although the State's Division of the Budget       
("DOB") projects the current national recession to be mild, there are a number  
of factors that pose a particularly large degree of risk for New York due to the
uncertainty in the financial and capital markets. The State's tax revenues are  
more reliant on the financial sector of the economy than are other states and   
other regions of the nation. The full extent of the losses associated with      
subprime debt remains unclear, and escalating losses could result in a further  
delay in the recovery of Wall Street profits and bonuses. If inflation rates    
accelerate, the Federal Reserve may choose to reverse its current policy and    
increase rates, which traditionally has had adverse effects on the State        
economy. In addition, should the State's real estate market cool more rapidly   
than anticipated, household consumption and taxable capital gains realizations  
could be negatively affected. High energy prices also pose a particular risk to 
the State's tourism sector.                                                     

  Other significant risks to the current economic forecast include: (i) global
political instability, including the uncertain conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq,  
and the Middle East in general; (ii) high oil prices which could adversely      
affect many different sectors of the national and State economies; (iii)        
weakness of consumer spending or a failure of investment spending to commence   
growth during the year, which could worsen recessionary conditions; and (iv) the
potential for future terrorist attacks on U.S. soil.                            

Economic Condition and Outlook. Following the State's recovery from the   
recession of the early 2000s, it now appears that the State economy is entering 
a recession that is projected to be mild compared to the two past recessions.   
The financial markets showed strong performance in the first half of 2007. The  
subsequent national economic downturn has affected the State economy, although  
the State's downturn is likely to occur with a lag relative to the national     
economy. Tightening in the credit markets, along with the volume of writedowns  
of bad debt related to subprime mortgage-backed assets, are likely to continue  
to have a significant adverse affect on the State's economy. The State's economy
is heavily concentrated in the information, finance, and business service       
sectors-more than half of the State's economic output comes from these sectors. 
As a result, wage growth for the State is projected to increase at a lower rate 
than the projected national rate. Recent figures indicate that State            
unemployment rates are slightly better than national unemployment figures, but  
projections for wage growth are higher at the national level. In March 2008, the
unemployment rate in New York was 5.1 percent, compared with the national rate  
of 5.2 percent. The DOB projects State wage growth to be 2.7% for 2008, as      
compared to projections of wage growth of 3.1% for 2008 at the national level.  

   The City has a highly diversified economic base, with a substantial volume of
business activity in the service, wholesale and retail trade and manufacturing  
industries and is the location of many securities, banking, law, accounting, new
media and advertising firms. With a population of approximately 8,000,000, the  
City is an international center of business and culture, and a leading tourist  
destination. The City experienced an economic slowdown that began in 2001 as a  
result of the September 11 attack, a national economic recession and a downturn 
in the securities industry, and came to an end in 2003. Since then, Wall Street 
activity, tourism, and the real estate market have driven a broad based economic
recovery, up until the economic slowdown that began in the second half of       
calendar year 2007.                                                             

   Current and Outyear Fiscal Projections. The State Governor's Executive Budget
for the 2008-09 fiscal year projected ending the 2008-09 fiscal year in balance 
on a cash basis, with a closing balance in the General Fund of $2.2 billion, and
projected gaps of $3.3 billion in fiscal year 2009-10, $5.7 billion in fiscal   
year 2010-11, and $6.8 billion in fiscal year 2011-12. The DOB notes that the   
Enacted Budget (similar to the Governor's Executive Budget) also projects ending
the 2008-09 fiscal year in balance on a cash basis, projecting a closing fund   
balance in the General Fund of $2.0 billion and projected gaps of approximately 
$5.0 billion in fiscal year 2009-10, $7.7 billion in fiscal year 2010-11 and    
$8.8 billion in fiscal year 2011-12. Supplemental information released on May
28, 2008 indicates that tentative collective bargaining agreements with 11      
public employee unions will result in a General Fund closing balance of $1.89   
billion for fiscal year 2008-09, and increased outyear budget gaps in the range 
of $70 to $100 million per year.                                                

The City's current financial plan (the "Financial Plan") projects budget  
balance in the 2008 and 2009 fiscal years in accordance with GAAP as in effect  
through June 30, 2008. The City's Financial Plan projects gaps of $1.6 billion, 
$3.4 billion and $4.4 billion in fiscal years 2009 through 2011, respectively.  
Since the previous financial plan, the Financial Plan reflects an increase in   
projected net revenues of $2.3 billion in fiscal year 2008 and decreases in     
projected net revenues of $398 million, $2 billion and $1.6 billion in fiscal   
years 2009 through 2011, respectively.                                          

   General Government Results. An operating surplus of $202 million was reported
in the General Fund for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007. As a result the   
General Fund had an accumulated fund balance of $2.4 billion. The State         
completed its fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, with a combined Governmental    
Funds operating deficit of $45 million as compared to a combined Governmental   
Funds operating surplus in the preceding fiscal year of $3.8 billion. The       
combined 2006-07 operating deficit of $45 million is due in significant part to 
an $840 million deficit in the Special Revenue Fund.                            

As the State completed the 2006-07 fiscal year, its governmental funds    
reported a combined fund balance of $12.1 billion. Included in the 2006-07      
fiscal year's total change in fund balance is an operating surplus of $202      
million in the State's General Fund. The General Fund operating surplus is      
attributable to several factors including an increase of $1.4 billion in        
personal income tax revenue, a $1.4 billion increase in business taxes and a    
$746 million increase in miscellaneous revenues, offset by a $323 million       
decline in consumption and use tax revenue.                                     

   Much of the increase in tax revenues is related to improvement in the State's
economy and tax increases enacted for personal income. The increase in General  
Fund revenues was offset by a $3.6 billion increase in expenditures.            

  Local assistance expenditures increased by nearly $2.8 billion due primarily
to increased spending for medical assistance and income maintenance programs.   
State operations increased $798 million due primarily to negotiated salary      
increases, increased health insurance costs and employer pension costs. The     
State ended the 2006-07 fiscal year with a General Fund accumulated fund balance
of $2.4 billion. The increase of the fund balance is due primarily to an        
increase in tax revenues as a result of an increase in the personal income tax  
rate and an improving State economy.                                            

   Overall Financial Position. The State reported net assets of $48.9 billion as
of March 31, 2007, which was comprised of $62.7 billion in capital assets       
reported net of related debt, $7.3 billion in restricted net assets offset by an
unrestricted net assets deficit of $21.1 billion. Net assets reported for       
governmental activities decreased by $670 million from a year ago, decreasing   
from $46.0 billion to $45.3 billion. Unrestricted net assets-the part of net    
assets that can be used to finance day-to-day operations without constraints    
established by debt covenants, enabling legislation, or other legal             
requirements-had a deficit of $21.7 billion at March 31, 2007. The deficit in   
unrestricted governmental net assets, which declined by nearly $786 million in  
2007, exists primarily because the State has issued debt for purposes not       
resulting in a capital asset related to governmental activities. Such           
outstanding debt included securitizing the State's future tobacco settlement    
receipts ($4.1 billion), eliminated the need for seasonal borrowing by Local    
Government Assistance Corporation ($4.2 billion), local highway and bridge      
projects ($3.3 billion), local mass transit projects ($2.3 billion), and a wide 
variety of grants and other expenditures not resulting in governmental capital  
assets ($8.6 billion). This deficit in unrestricted net assets of governmental  
activities can be expected to continue for as long as the State continues to    
have obligations outstanding for purposes other than the acquisition of         
governmental capital assets.                                                    

Net assets for business-type activities increased by $463 million (14.8   
percent) to $3.6 billion in 2007 compared to $3.1 billion in 2006. The increase 
in net assets for business-type activities was caused primarily by employer     
contributions and other revenues exceeding unemployment benefit payments for the
Unemployment Insurance Fund ($178 million), SUNY and CUNY Senior College        
operating revenues and State support exceeding operating expenses ($255 and $56 
million, respectively), and offset by Lottery losses of $26 million. As of June
30, 2006, $8.4 billion in debt had been issued and was outstanding to finance   
capital assets of the State's colleges and universities.                        

General Fund Budgetary Highlights. General Fund expenditures exceeded     
receipts by $212 million in 2006- 07. The General Fund ended the fiscal year    
with a closing cash fund balance of $3.05 billion, which consisted of $1.03     
billion in the Tax Stabilization Reserve Account (the State's "rainy day"       
reserve), $278 million in the Community Projects Account, $21 million in the    
Contingency Reserve Account, and $1.71 billion in general reserves.             

The State's 2007-08 fiscal year capital budget calls for it to spend $7.7 
billion for capital projects, of which $3.8 billion is for transportation       
projects. To pay for these capital projects the State plans to use $220 million 
in general obligation bond proceeds, $4.1 billion in other financing            
arrangements with public authorities, $1.8 billion in Federal funds, and $1.6   
billion in funds on hand or received during the year.                           

Debt Administration. There are a number of methods by which the State may 
incur debt. The State has obtained long-term financing in the form of           
voter-approved General Obligation debt (voter approved debt), including         
lease-purchase and contractual obligations where the State's legal obligation to
make payments is subject to and paid from annual appropriations made by the     
Legislature or assignment of revenue in the case of Tobacco Settlement Revenue  
Bonds. One minor exception, Equipment Capital Leases and Building Capital Leases
which represent $244 million as of March 31, 2008, do not require Legislature or
voter approval. The State administers its long-term financing needs as a single 
portfolio of state-supported debt that includes general obligation bonds and    
other obligations of both its governmental activities and business-type         
activities. Most of the debt reported under business-type activities, all of    
which was issued for capital assets used in those activities, is supported by   
payments from resources generated by the State's Governmental Activities-thus it
is not expected to be repaid from resources generated by business-type          
activities.                                                                     

At March 31, 2008, the State had $1.8 billion in State-supported variable 
rate bonds outstanding and $5.9 billion in interest rate exchange agreements,   
where the State issues variable rate bonds and enters into a swap agreement that
converts the rate effectively to a fixed rate. In addition, the State had $2.4  
billion in convertible bonds, which bear a fixed rate until future mandatory    
tender dates, at which time they can convert to either a fixed or variable rate.

At March 31, 2008, variable rate bonds, net of those subject to the fixed 
rate swaps, were equal to 4.1% of the State-supported bonded debt portfolio. At 
March 31, 2007, the State had $48.8 billion in bonds, notes, and other financing
agreements outstanding compared with $47.1 billion the year before, an increase 
of $1.7 billion.                                                                

   The State Constitution, with exceptions for emergencies, limits the amount of
general obligation bonds that can be issued to that amount approved by the      
voters for a single work or purpose in a general election. The State Finance    
Law, through the Debt Reform Act of 2000 (the "Act"), also imposes phased-in    
caps on new State supported debt issued and related debt service costs. The Act 
also limits the use of debt to capital works and purposes, and establishes a    
maximum length of term for repayment of 30 years. The Act applies to all State  
supported debt. The Debt Reform Act does not apply to debt issued prior to April
1, 2000, or to other obligations issued by public authorities where the State is
not the direct obligor.                                                         

The construction of certain State office buildings, campus facilities, and
other public facilities has been financed through bonds and notes issued by     
public benefit corporations pursuant to lease/purchase agreements with the      
State. The State has also entered into financing arrangements with public       
benefit corporations that have issued bonds to finance past State budgetary     
deficits and grants to local governments for both capital and operating         
purposes. These lease/purchase and other financing arrangements which the State 
will repay over the duration of the agreements constitute long-term liabilities.
The amount included in obligations under lease/purchase and other financing     
arrangements consists of total future principal payments and equals the         
outstanding balance of the related bonds and notes. Reporting relative to       
capitalized interest is also not included for leased capital assets.            

Risk Management. The State does not insure its buildings or their contents
against theft, fire or other risks and does not insure its automobiles against  
the possibility of bodily injury and property damage. However, the State does   
have fidelity insurance on State employees. Workers' compensation coverage is   
provided on a self-insurance basis.                                             

   Litigation. The State is a defendant in numerous legal proceedings pertaining
to matters incidental to the performance of routine governmental operations.    
Such litigation includes, but is not limited to, claims asserted against the    
State arising from alleged torts, alleged breaches of contracts, condemnation   
proceedings, and other alleged violations of state and federal laws.            

Included in the State's outstanding litigation are a number of cases      
challenging the legality or the adequacy of a variety of significant social     
welfare programs primarily involving the State's Medicaid and mental health     
programs. Adverse judgments in these matters generally could result in          
injunctive relief coupled with prospective changes in patient care that could   
require substantial increased financing of the litigated programs in the future.

Actions commenced by several Indian nations which include the St. Regis   
Mohawk Indian Nation, the Oneida Indian Nation and the Cayuga Indian Nation     
claim that significant amounts of land were unconstitutionally taken from the   
Indians in violation of various treaties and agreements during the eighteenth   
and nineteenth centuries.                                                       

The claimants seek recovery of thousands of acres of land as well as      
compensatory and punitive damages. With respect to pending and threatened       
litigation, the State has reported, in the governmental activities, liabilities 
of $151 million for awarded and anticipated unfavorable judgments. In addition, 
the State is a party to other claims and litigation that its legal counsel has  
advised may result in possible adverse court decisions with estimated potential 
losses of nearly $262 million.                                                  

Ratings. As of July 2008, all outstanding general obligation bonds of the 
State of New York are rated AA by S&P and Aa3 by Moody's. As of July 2008, all  
outstanding general obligation bonds of the City of New York are rated AA by S&P
and Aa3 by Moody's. Any explanation concerning the significance of such ratings 
must be obtained from the rating agencies. There is no assurance that any       
ratings will continue for any period of time or that they will not be revised or
withdrawn.                                                                      

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local New York issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of    
obligations issued by the State of New York, and there is no obligation on the  
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the New  
York Trust and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of   
all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject.    
Additionally, many factors including national, economic, social and             
environmental policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the  
issuers of such bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the      
financial condition of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions
thereof. The Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors
or other factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the New York  
Trust, the market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the    
respective issuers of such bonds acquired by the New York Trust to pay interest 
on or principal of such bonds.                                                  

The New York Trust is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory    
factors affecting issuers of New York municipal obligations (the "New York      
Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain  
New York constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and 
other matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief
summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in New York and
is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and are       
believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the       
accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing information. It is based in    
part on information obtained from various State and local agencies in New York  
or contained in Official Statements for various New York Municipal Obligations. 

 North Carolina Risk Factors

Economic Condition and Outlook. The impact from the economic slowdown in  
North Carolina was still unrealized by the end of 2006. The State is typically  
more volatile with respect to economic cycles than the nation as a whole.       
However, by early 2007, it was evident the slowdown had begun nationally, yet   
the State's economy showed less of an effect than the national economy. The mild
slowdown experienced by the State in fiscal year 2006-07, may be due in part to 
North Carolina's relatively mild housing problems. For example, real estate     
conveyance tax receipts in North Carolina have been essentially flat compared to
double digit declines in a many other states. It is projected that the biggest  
impact to the State's economy from the mid-cycle slowdown, plus the housing and 
financial sector slump, will occur in 2008. By the end of 2009, the economic and
fiscal impacts are expected to dissipate with a return to near normal growth in 
the State.                                                                      

 North Carolina's impact from the housing slump has been different than many
other states. There was negative year-over-year sales growth statewide in       
existing, single-family homes for the fourth quarter of 2006 and the second     
quarter of 2007, and only 1.2 percent growth in the first quarter of 2007. The  
State's housing bubble was limited to a few resort areas, therefore, the        
Statewide impact from the housing slowdown has been far less severe than in many
states. In addition, the State continued to experience strong population growth 
as well as employment growth, which may have dampened the impact from the       
national housing slump.                                                         

The State's population is expected to continue growing at a rate above two
percent through 2009. Comparatively, the nation's population is only expected to
grow at slightly less than one percent. Likewise, non-farm employment grew in   
the State from August 2006 to August 2007, by 1.7 percent while national        
employment grew at only 1.2 percent. Another part of the employment story is the
State's continued strong growth in the service-providing sectors with annual    
growth above 2.2 percent. This has more than offset the loss in manufacturing   
jobs, which continued to decline at a rate of 1.7 percent (an estimated 9,300   
jobs) over this same period.                                                    

North Carolina's economy has held up well under the strain of the housing 
slump and the economic slowdown. Therefore, income growth is projected to       
continue at a moderate pace and grow only slightly below the long-term average  
of 5.8 percent. As with the nation, the majority of the housing slump's effects 
will have worked themselves out by 2009, but residual effects will continue to  
be a drain on the State's economy. These impacts show up in slower than normal  
growth in retail sales and employment.                                          

 The long-term negative growth trends in manufacturing continue as the State
transitions from a manufacturing and agricultural based economy to a service and
technological economy. The past year also saw a slowing of growth in the housing
related industries including financial services, residential construction, and  
transportation.                                                                 

 In general, North Carolina's economy is expected to expand at a faster pace
than the nation. This should bode well for overall employment and help bolster  
income growth. Employment losses in the manufacturing industries will continue, 
but growth in the service and tech industries should continue to be a major     
stimulus to economic growth. There is little doubt that the State will          
experience an economic slowdown in the next couple of years, but it is in a     
position to perform better than the nation as a whole.                          

Cash Management. It is the policy of the State that all agencies,         
institutions, departments, bureaus, boards, commissions and officers of the     
State shall devise techniques and procedures for the receipt, deposit and       
disbursement of monies coming into their control and custody which are designed 
to maximize interest-bearing investment of cash, and to minimize idle and       
nonproductive cash balances. The State Controller, with the advice and          
assistance of the State Treasurer, the State Budget Officer, and the State      
Auditor, develops, implements, and amends the Statewide Cash Management Policy. 
All cash deposited with the State Treasurer by state entities is managed in     
pooled investment accounts to maximize interest earnings.                       

Risk Management. The State maintains self-insurance programs for employee 
health; general liability; medical malpractice; workers' compensation; and      
automobile, fire and other property losses. The State limits its risk for       
general liability; medical malpractice; and automobile fire and other property  
losses by purchasing private insurance for losses in excess of deductibles.     

State Budget. On July 20, 2006, the General Assembly passed House Bill 914
State Budget Act to replace the Executive Budget Act. This new legislation was  
effective July 1, 2007 and affects budget merit and management by simplifying,  
reorganizing, updating the current budget statutes, and making changes to       
conform the statutes to the State constitutional provisions governing           
appropriations. The State Budget Act defines key budget aspects and increases   
the targeted balance of the General Fund savings reserve from 5 percent to 8    
percent of prior year operating appropriation expenditures. The new legislation 
provides that agency budgets be classified in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles as interpreted by the State Controller.                   

As part of the implementation of the State Budget Act, several budgetary  
processes and the State's budget code structure have been reviewed and revised  
as appropriate. Some revisions have required adjustment to the State's budgetary
and accounting systems. The State Budget Manual has been updated to reflect     
changes required by House Bill 914.                                             

   Financial Analysis of the State as a Whole. Over time, increases or decreases
in net assets serve as a useful indicator of whether a government's financial   
position is improving or deteriorating. The State's combined net assets         
increased $2.534 billion or 8.73% over the course of this fiscal year's         
operations. The net assets of the governmental activities increased $2.211      
billion or 8% and business-type activities increased $323.184 million or 23.3%. 

The largest component of the State's net assets ($29.716 billion) reflects
its investment in capital assets (land, buildings, machinery and equipment,     
state highway system, and other capital assets), less related debt still        
outstanding that was used to acquire or construct those assets. Restricted net  
assets are the next largest component ($2.689 billion). Net assets are          
restricted when constraints placed on their use are 1) externally imposed by    
creditors, grantors, contributors, or laws or regulations of other governments  
or 2) legally imposed through constitutional provisions. The remaining portion, 
unrestricted net assets, consists of net assets that do not meet the definition 
of "restricted" or "invested in capital assets, net of related debt."           

The government-wide statement of net assets for governmental activities   
reflects a negative $921.3 million unrestricted net asset balance. The State of 
North Carolina, like many other state and local governments, issues general     
obligation debt and distributes the proceeds to local governments and component 
units. The proceeds are used to construct new buildings and renovate and        
modernize existing buildings on the State's community college and university    
campuses, assist county governments in meeting their public school building     
capital needs, and to provide grants and loans to local governments for clean   
water and natural gas projects. Of the $6.875 billion of bonds and certificates 
of participation outstanding at June 30, 2007, $5.88 billion is attributable to 
debt issued as state aid to component units (universities and community         
colleges) and local governments. The balance sheets of component unit and local 
government recipients reflect ownership of the related constructed capital      
assets without the burden of recording the debt obligation. The policy of       
selling general obligation bonds and funneling the cash proceeds to non-primary 
government (non-State) entities has been in place for decades. However, by      
issuing such debt, the State is left to reflect significant liabilities on its  
statement of net assets (reflected in the unrestricted net asset component)     
without the benefit of recording the capital assets constructed or acquired with
the proceeds from the debt issuances. Additionally, as of June 30, 2007, the    
State's governmental activities have significant unfunded liabilities for       
compensated absences in the amount of $382.316 million. These unfunded          
liabilities also contribute to the negative unrestricted net asset balance for  
governmental activities.                                                        

 Litigation. The State is involved in numerous claims and legal proceedings,
many of which normally recur in governmental operations and may have a material 
adverse effect on the financial position of the State.                          

 Debt Administration. At year-end, the State had total long-term debt (bonds
and similar debt payable) outstanding of $6.912 billion, an increase of 6.03%   
from the previous fiscal year-end. During the 2006-07 fiscal year, the State    
issued $502.745 million in general obligation bonds (excluding refunding bonds) 
and $300 million in certificates of participation (COPs). The new general       
obligation debt represents a consolidation of clean water bonds and higher      
education bonds and constitutes the remaining authorized amounts of such bonds  
(see next page). The proceeds of the COPs will be used to finance the repair and
renovation of State facilities and related infrastructure ($100 million) and    
various State and university capital projects authorized for special            
indebtedness financing by previous sessions of the General Assembly ($200       
million). The repair and renovation projects were prioritized based on those    
projects related to life safety code requirements and water intrusion           
remediation.                                                                    

  The State refinanced $80 million of its existing debt in fiscal year 2007 to
improve cash flow and to take advantage of lower interest rates. By refinancing 
the debt, the State will reduce its future debt service payments by             
approximately $4.48 million over the next fifteen years.                        

The State issues two types of tax-supported debt: general obligation bonds
and various types of "special indebtedness", which are also known as            
appropriation-supported debt. General obligation bonds are secured by the full  
faith, credit, and taxing power of the State. The payments on all other types of
long-term debt, including COPs, lease purchase revenue bonds, and equipment     
installment purchase contracts are subject to appropriation by the General      
Assembly. Some appropriation supported debt is also secured by a lien on        
facilities or equipment. Article 9 of Chapter 142 of the General Statutes       
prohibits the issuance of special indebtedness except for projects specifically 
authorized by the General Assembly. The use of alternative financing methods    
provides financing flexibility to the State and permits the State to take       
advantage of changing financial and economic environments.                      

The State's long-term debt (bonds and similar debt payable) has increased 
significantly in recent years, rising from $1.521 billion in 1997 to $6.912     
billion in 2007, in part due to large issuances for higher education capital    
projects.                                                                       

The budget bill enacted by the 2007-2008 Session of the General Assembly  
authorized the issuance of up to $669.15 million of special indebtedness (e.g., 
COPs) as follows: $481.14 million for higher education projects. Significant    
projects include $119.61 million to for a genetics science building at the      
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, $53 million for a nanoscience      
building to be used jointly by the University of North Carolina at Greensboro   
and North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, $41.61 million  
for a health and gerontological building at Western Carolina University, and $38
million for an animal hospital at North Carolina State University; $120 million 
to acquire State park land, natural heritage land, and to acquire waterfront    
properties or develop facilities for the purposes of providing public and       
commercial waterfront access; $35 million for an education and visitors center  
at Tyron Palace; and $33.01 million for correctional facilities.                

Article 5, Section 3 of the Constitution of North Carolina imposes        
limitations upon the increase of certain State debt. It restricts the General   
Assembly from contracting debts secured by a pledge of the faith and credit of  
the State, unless approved by a majority of the qualified voters of the State,  
except for the following purposes:                                              

1.   To fund or refund a valid existing debt;                         

2.   To supply an unforeseen deficiency in the revenue;               

   3.   To borrow in anticipation of the collection of taxes due and payable
        within the current fiscal year to an amount not exceeding 50 percent
of such taxes;                                              

4.   To suppress riots or insurrections; or to repel invasions;       

5.   To meet emergencies immediately threatening the public health or 
      safety, as conclusively determined in writing by the Governor; and

6.   For any other lawful purpose, to the extent of two-thirds of the 
        amount by which the State's outstanding indebtedness shall have been
reduced during the next preceding biennium.                 

Ratings. As of July 2008, all outstanding general obligation bonds of the 
State of North Carolina are rated AAA by S&P and Aaa by Moody's. Any explanation
concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating    
agencies. There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of
time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.                             

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local North Carolina issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness 
of obligations issued by the State of North Carolina, and there is no obligation
on the part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event 
of default.                                                                     

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the North
Carolina IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description  
of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject. 
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the North Carolina     
IM-IT, the market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the    
respective issuers of such bonds acquired by the North Carolina IM-IT to pay    
interest on or principal of such bonds.                                         

  The North Carolina IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory
factors affecting issuers of North Carolina municipal obligations (the "North   
Carolina Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of 
certain North Carolina constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter   
initiatives and other matters that are described. The information provided above
is only a brief summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation
in North Carolina and is derived from sources that are generally available to   
investors and are believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been 
made of the accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing information. It is 
based in part on information obtained from various State and local agencies in  
North Carolina or contained in Official Statements for various North Carolina   
Municipal Obligations.                                                          

 Ohio Risk Factors

General. The State of Ohio's first constitution was adopted in 1802, and Ohio
entered the union in 1803. Ohio's present constitution was modified by a state  
constitutional convention in 1851 and has since been amended on numerous        
occasions. The Constitution establishes a state governmental structure similar  
to the federal model, with three separate branches of government - executive,   
legislative, and judicial. The executive branch consists of the Governor and    
Lieutenant Governor, who are jointly elected, and four additional statewide     
elected officials: the Attorney General, the Auditor of State, the Secretary of 
State, and the Treasurer of State. All of these officials are elected to        
four-year terms. More than 100 departments, agencies, boards, and commissions   
are part of the executive branch of government and receive appropriations from  
the legislature, along with the judicial branch and legislative agencies.       

The state legislature in Ohio is referred to as the General Assembly and  
consists of two separate chambers, the Senate, a 33-member body, and the House  
of Representatives, a 99-member body. Each member of the General Assembly is    
elected to represent the residents of a geographical district for a specified   
term. Members of Ohio's General Assembly are subject to term-limits; senators   
are restricted to serving two four-year terms, and representatives are          
restricted to serving four two-year terms. A new General Assembly is convened in
January of each odd-numbered year. Along with the establishment of the State    
governmental structure, the Constitution requires Ohio to have a balanced       
budget. Ohio's budget is prepared for a two year fiscal biennium which begins on
July 1 of odd-numbered years and ends 24 months later on June 30.               

   The State provides a wide range of services and support to its citizenry that
are accounted for in the following functions or programs: primary, secondary and
other education, higher education support, public assistance and Medicaid,      
health and human services, justice and public protection, environmental         
protection and natural resources, transportation, general government, community 
and economic development, workers' compensation, lottery, unemployment          
compensation, tuition credits, liquor control, and other business-type          
activities.                                                                     

Economic Overview. Although manufacturing (including auto-related         
manufacturing) in Ohio remains an integral part of the State's economy, the     
greatest growth in Ohio's economy in recent years has been in the               
non-manufacturing sectors. In 2005, Ohio's economic output as measured by gross 
state product (GSP) totaled $442 billion, 3.6% of the national GSP and seventh  
largest among the states. The State ranks third within the manufacturing sector 
as a whole ($85 billion) and third in durable goods ($57 billion). As a percent 
of Ohio's 2005 GSP, manufacturing was responsible for 19.3%, with 26.4%         
attributable to the goods-producing sectors and 32.5% to business services      
sectors, including finance, insurance and real estate. Ohio is the seventh      
largest exporting state with 2005 merchandise exports totaling $34.8 billion.   
The State's leading export products are machinery (including electrical         
machinery) and motor vehicles, which together accounted for nearly 57% of that  
total.                                                                          

 While diversifying more into the service and other non-manufacturing areas,
the Ohio economy continues to rely in part on durable goods manufacturing       
largely concentrated in motor vehicles and machinery, including electrical      
machinery. As a result, general economic activity, as in many other             
industrially-developed states, tends to be more cyclical than in some other     
states and in the nation as a whole. Agriculture is an important segment of the 
economy, with over half the State's area devoted to farming and a significant   
portion of total employment in agribusiness. Since 2000, payroll employment in  
Ohio's diversifying employment base increased in 2001, decreased in 2002 and    
2003, increased in 2004 through 2006, and decreased in 2007. Growth in recent   
years has been concentrated among non-manufacturing industries, with            
manufacturing employment tapering off since its 1969 peak. The                  
"non-manufacturing" sector employs approximately 86% of all non-farm payroll    
workers in Ohio.                                                                

   In earlier years, the State's overall unemployment rate was commonly somewhat
higher than the national figure. For example, the reported 1990 average monthly 
State rate was 5.7%, compared to the 5.5% national figure. However, in 1991     
through 1998 the annual State rates were below the national rates (4.3% vs. 4.5%
in 1998), were again slightly higher in 1999 (4.3% vs. 4.2%) and 2000 (4.0% vs. 
4.0%), lower in 2001 (4.4% vs. 4.7%) and in 2002 (5.7% vs. 5.8%) and higher in  
2003 (6.2% vs. 6.0%), in 2004 (6.1% vs. 5.5%), in 2005 (5.9% vs. 5.1%), in 2006 
(5.5% vs. 4.6%) and in 2007 (5.6% vs. 4.6%). In March 2008, the State           
unemployment rate was higher than the national rate (5.7% vs. 5.1%). The        
unemployment rate and its effects vary among geographic areas of the State.     

Major Initiatives - Tax Reform, Expenditure Limitations and Financial     
Systems. The State biennial budget enacted and signed into law in June 2005     
included a significant overhaul of Ohio's tax structure as described extensively
in prior financial reports. The entire tax reform package was designed to spur  
business development and new jobs through the following reforms:                

     1.   A 21 percent reduction in the personal income tax over five tax years;

    2.   Reduction of the State sales and use tax to 5.5% from 6% effective in
2005-06;                                                    

3.   Phased elimination over five years of the corporate franchise tax
(except for financial institutions and their affiliates);   

4.   Elimination of the tangible personal property tax for general    
        businesses and for telecommunications companies, phased in over four
and five year periods, respectively; and                    

5.   Implementation of a commercial activity tax (CAT).               

By fiscal year 2010, the reductions in State taxes are estimated to reach 
$2.4 billion, with the elimination of the local general business tangible       
personal property tax increasing estimated total tax reductions to $3.7 billion 
by fiscal year 2010 when the reform package is fully phased in.                 

   A year later in June 2006, there was also signed into law legislation enacted
by the General Assembly imposing a limitation on most General Revenue Fund (GRF)
appropriations commencing with the 2008-09 biennium. This statutory limitation  
initially uses fiscal year 2007 GRF appropriations as a baseline and then       
applies an annual growth factor of the greater of 3.5% or the sum of the        
inflation rates and rate of State population change. Every fourth fiscal year   
thereafter becomes a new base year.                                             

  Reflecting the tax restructuring described above, GRF appropriations for the
2006-07 and 2008-09 fiscal biennia are resulting in the four slowest growing    
fiscal years with respect to expenditures of the last 40 years. The biennial    
budgets for these years reduced or held flat many of the State's GRF-funded     
agencies and consolidated functions or activities of several state agencies. The
majority of GRF spending increases over this time period can be attributed to   
increased investment in primary and secondary education and Medicaid, and       
ongoing costs for debt service and property tax relief programs.                

In this period of expenditure constraint based on tax reform, the State is
has a renewed focus on improved State budgeting and expenditures with increased 
transparency, accountability and performance, improved financial systems and    
cash and debt management, and targeted investment of scarce resources.          

  With the revenue constraints of tax reform requiring a clear presentation of
Ohio's near term financial position, Ohio is enhancing the transparency of its  
financial position for its citizens and investors. For the first time, the      
2008-09 executive budget proposal presented revenue and spending projections for
four fiscal years (rather than two). Based on this new budgeting approach, the  
Office of Budget and Management (OBM) will pursue awards for excellence in      
budget reporting through the Government Financial Officers Association (GFOA)   
which Ohio has not received since its 2002-03 executive budget.                 

Ohio is also improving its financial management through the deployment    
throughout State government of a comprehensive enterprise information system    
know as the Ohio Administrative Knowledge System (OAKS). When installation is   
completed in June 2009, OAKS will be the most comprehensive enterprise IT system
operating at a state level in the nation. OBM is in the second of three stages  
in the deployment of OAKS. The initial stage went live in January 2007 and      
implemented a new human resource system for state agencies to manage payroll and
personnel. The second stage went live in July 2007 and provides OBM with new,   
enhanced financial management and reporting tools. The final stage went live in 
January 2008 and provided new and enhanced budget decision-making and management
tools. OAKS Implementation also involves upgrading workforce skills across      
agencies.                                                                       

To enhance collections and revenue management, the Department of Taxation 
commenced the deployment in 2008 of the State Taxation Revenue and Accounting   
System (STARS) by entering into a system integrator contract on June 2, 2008    
with Electronic Data Systems to provide hardware and software implementation,   
integrator services and post-implementation warranties and support. STARS       
includes a six phase implementation schedule with the last phase planned for    
completion in April 2011. STARS will provide an integrated tax collection and   
audit system and replace the State's existing separate tax software and         
administration systems for the twenty-four different taxes collected by the     
State. STARS will make it possible for the Department of Taxation to provide an 
improved quality of taxpayer services including self service opportunities, and 
enhance its compliance activities while providing cost savings through improved 
productivity and workflow management within the Department of Taxation.         

  Revenues and Expenditures in the 2006-07 and 2007-08 Fiscal Biennia. The GRF
appropriations Act for the 2006-07 biennium was passed by the General Assembly  
and signed (with selective vetoes) by the Governor on June 30, 2005. That Act   
provided for total GRF biennial revenue of approximately $51.5 billion (a 3.8%  
increase over the 2004-05 biennial revenue) and total GRF biennial              
appropriations of approximately $51.3 billion (a 5.0% increase over the 2004-05 
biennial expenditures). Spending increases for major program categories over the
2004-05 actual expenditures were: 5.8% for Medicaid (the Act also included a    
number of Medicaid reform and cost containment initiatives); 3.4% for higher    
education; 4.2% for elementary and secondary education; 5.5% for corrections and
youth services; and 4.8% for mental health and mental retardation.              

The State ended fiscal year 2006 with a GRF cash balance of $1,528,812,000
and a GRF fund balance of $1,025,967,000. Of that ending GRF fund balance, the  
State carried forward $631,933,000 to cover the expected and planned for        
variance of Fiscal Year 2007 GRF appropriations over estimated revenue, to      
offset the one-time cost of accelerating the phase-in of reductions in State    
personal income tax withholding rates, and to maintain 0.5% of fiscal year 2007 
GRF revenue as an ending fund balance. The remaining $394,034,000 was deposited 
into the BSF increasing its balance to $1,012,289,000 (which includes           
$40,045,000 in receipts collected from a broad tax amnesty initiative and       
deposited in June 2006). The State ended fiscal year 2007 with a GRF cash       
balance of $1,432,925,000 and a GRF fund balance of $215,534,000.               

   The GRF appropriations Act for the current 2008-09 fiscal biennium was passed
by the General Assembly and signed (with selective vetoes) by the Governor on   
June 30, 2007. Reflecting the continued implementation of the restructuring of  
State taxes commenced in 2006-07, that Act was based upon then estimated total  
GRF biennial revenues of approximately $53.5 billion (a 3.9% increase over the  
2006-07 biennial revenue) and total GRF biennial appropriations of approximately
$52.4 billion (a 2.1% increase over the 2006-07 biennial expenditures). Spending
increases for major program categories over the 2006-07 actual expenditures     
were: 2.2% for Medicaid (the Act also included a number of Medicaid reform and  
cost containment initiatives); 13.2% for higher education; 5.25% for elementary 
and secondary education; 4.92% for corrections and youth services; and 4.7% for 
mental health and mental retardation. The Executive Budget and the GRF          
appropriations Act complied with 2006 law limiting appropriation discussed above
under Major Initiatives.                                                        

The GRF appropriations Act for 2008-09 also created the Buckeye Tobacco   
Settlement Financing Authority to securitize tobacco settlement receipts payable
to the State under the November 1998 national tobacco settlement. On October 29,
2007, the Authority issued its $5.53 billion Tobacco Settlement Asset-Backed    
Bonds 2007 to fund capital expenditures for higher education ($938,000,000) and 
common school ($4,112,000,000) purposes over three years in lieu of the State   
issuing GRF-backed general obligation bonds to fund those capital expenditures. 
The resulting debt service savings to the GRF is funding the expansion of the   
homestead exemption property tax relief program contained in the Act. The Act   
reprograms all prior General Assembly allocations of anticipated tobacco        
settlement receipts to enable the pledge of 100% of those receipts to the       
payment of debt service on the Authority's obligations. Under those previously  
enacted allocations, the largest amount was to be applied to elementary and     
secondary school capital expenditures, with other amounts allocated for smoking 
cessation and other health-related purposes, biomedical research and technology 
transfer, and assistance to the tobacco growing areas in the State.             

With the Ohio economy expected to be negatively affected by the national  
economic downturn, OBM has been closely monitoring the State's major revenue    
sources (particularly the sales, personal and corporate income taxes) and in    
January 2008 reduced its original GRF revenue projections by $172,600,000 for   
Fiscal Year 2008 and $385,100,000 for Fiscal Year 2009. Based on those lower GRF
revenue estimates and increased costs associated with rising Medicaid caseloads,
OBM projected a budgetary shortfall for the current biennium of $733,000,000.   

  Executive and legislative actions were taken based on the new OBM estimates,
including:                                                                      

     o    The Governor, on January 31, 2008, issued an executive order directing
       expenditure reductions and spending controls totaling approximately
      $509,100,000 (since reduced to $402,000,000 based primarily on the
       transfers of unspent agency appropriations and the June 2008 action
described below).                                           

 o    Transfer of unspent agency appropriations totaling $120,200,000 in
Fiscal Year 2008 and $78,000,000 in Fiscal Year 2009.       

o    Authorizing expansion of the State-run lottery system to include 
      "keno" games currently projected to generate $65,000,000 in Fiscal
Year 2009.                                                  

   In June 2008, the General Assembly also passed legislation that provides for,
among other things, transfers to the GRF (after a selective line-item veto) of  
up to $63,333,000 from the BSF for State's share of increased Medicaid costs,   
$55,000,000 from rotary funds and $25,000,000 in uncommitted interest earnings  
from proceeds of the State's Tobacco Settlement Asset-Backed Bonds.             

Based on the expenditure reductions, spending controls and other measures 
identified above, OBM is currently projecting a positive GRF fund balance at    
June 30, 2008 and at the end of the current biennium. The Governor and OBM are  
continuing to closely monitor revenues and expenditures and work with the       
General Assembly to ensure these positive GRF ending fund balances.             

In March 2008, in response to the national economic downturn, the Governor
proposed a $1.7 billion economic stimulus plan for the Ohio economy through     
investments in logistics and distribution, bioproducts and bio-medical research,
advanced and renewable energy, local government infrastructure, conservation    
projects and brownfield revitalization projects. After extensive hearings and   
review, the General Assembly in June 2008, passed a $1.57 billion economic      
stimulus package that mirrored the purposes proposed by the Governor and added  
funding for higher education workforce programs and expanded the State's        
historic preservation tax credits. That legislation reconfigured the sources of 
funding for the stimulus plan to include, in addition to GRF-backed bonds,      
$230,000,000 of cash from the Ohio Tobacco Prevention Foundation, $370,000,000  
in GRF operating appropriations to be made over the next five fiscal years,     
$184,000,000 in bonds backed by net profits from the State's liquor enterprise, 
and $200,000,000 from the BSF for funding of certain local government           
infrastructure road and bridge projects. The Governor line item-vetoed the July
1, 2008 deadline by which the OBM Director must make that BSF transfer,         
emphasizing GRF budget stabilization as the proper first priority for           
utilization of BSF moneys and allowing time to explore other funding options for
this local government infrastructure portion of the economic stimulus plan.     
While it is not possible at this time to determine the extent to which this BSF 
transfer will be needed, the available balance in the BSF would be reduced to   
$748,956,000 should this transfer occur in addition to the above $63,333,000 BSF
transfer for increased Medicaid costs.                                          

 Budgetary Controls. With each office performing specific functions relating
to State expenditures, the OBM and the Treasurer of State account for and report
on the State's fiscal affairs.                                                  

   OBM maintains records of the appropriations made by the General Assembly, and
its Director certifies the availability of unencumbered appropriations as a     
condition of contract validity. OBM fiscal functions include the development and
oversight of operating and capital budgets as well as the review, processing,   
and reporting of financial transactions for most state departments and agencies 
(excluding, among others, higher education institutions' non-capital            
expenditures). The OBM Director's certification is required for all expenditure 
vouchers before the OBM may issue State warrants. Upon certification, OBM       
updates its accounting records to reflect the level of vouchered expenditures.  

 The Treasurer of State maintains the cash and investments that comprise the
State treasury, and redeems the warrants issued by the OBM when presented for   
payment by financial institutions and monitors the amounts and the timing of    
payments to determine the State's cash flow position for investment purposes.   

State financial reporting practices have been and are in accordance with  
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP basis). Each Comprehensive Annual
Financial Report (CAFR) includes the State's Basic Financial Statements (BFS)   
for that Fiscal Year as examined by the Auditor of State. The 1990 through 2004 
and 2006 CAFRs received the Government Finance Officers Association Certificate 
of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting. Ohio did not receive this 
award for its Fiscal Year 2006 CAFR due to challenges in concluding audits      
related to the Bureaus of Workers' compensation within reporting deadlines.     

The BFS are presented in accordance with a fund classification system     
prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. The GAAP basis       
financial statement presentation is comprehensive in scope and includes         
organizations and activities defined within Ohio's reporting entity that are not
subject to the State's appropriation process. The "General Fund" as reported in 
the BFS includes more than just the GRF; it also encompasses the Budget         
Stabilization Fund and those reimbursement-supported funds that account for     
activities administered by State agencies and departments and for which special 
revenue or proprietary fund classifications are considered inappropriate.       

  Cash Management. In Ohio, with the exception of certain organizations within
the State's reporting entity that have independent powers to manage and invest  
their funds, the Treasurer of State is responsible for investing the State's    
cash and investments pool.                                                      

  During fiscal year 2008, cash management and investment transactions made by
the Treasurer of State's Office, in accordance with the State's Uniform         
Depository Act, are limited to checking accounts and certificates of deposit    
with qualified public depositories, U.S. government and agency obligations,     
bonds and other direct obligations of the State of Ohio and obligations of      
boards of education and other local subdivisions, commercial paper, repurchase  
agreements, no-load money market mutual funds, bankers' acceptances, bonds of   
U.S. corporations or of foreign nations diplomatically recognized by the United 
States, security lending agreements, and the Treasurer's STAR Ohio investment   
pool.                                                                           

Quarterly, the OBM allocates the investment income earned on the cash and 
investments pool to the various funds designated by law to receive the earnings 
with those allocations made based on average daily cash balances invested over  
the quarter. The Ohio Lottery Commission's investment portfolio, which is       
dedicated to the payment of deferred lottery prizes and is accounted for as part
of the cash and investments pool, however, is not part of the investment        
earnings allocation just described. Instead, the Treasurer of State credits the 
investment earnings from the dedicated portfolio directly to the credit of the  
fund that accounts for this activity.                                           

Risk Management. The State's primary government is self-insured for claims
under the Ohio Med Health and United Healthcare plans and for vehicle liability 
while it has placed public official fidelity bonding with a private insurer. The
State self-funds tort liability and most property losses on a pay-as-you-go     
basis; however, selected state agencies have acquired private insurance for     
their property losses. Also, the State's primary government and its component   
units participate in a public entity risk pool, which is accounted for in the   
Bureau of Workers' Compensation Enterprise Fund, for the financing of their     
workers' compensation liability.                                                

Ratings. As of June 2008, all outstanding general obligation bonds of the 
State of Ohio are rated AA+ by S&P and Aa1 by Moody's. Any explanation          
concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating    
agencies. There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of
time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.                             

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Ohio issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of        
obligations issued by the State of Ohio, and there is no obligation on the part 
of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of default. 

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the Ohio 
IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of all    
adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject.        
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Ohio IM-IT, the    
market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective    
issuers of such bonds acquired by the Ohio IM-IT to pay interest on or principal
of such bonds.                                                                  

The Ohio IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory factors
affecting issuers of Ohio municipal obligations (the "Ohio Municipal            
Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain Ohio       
constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and other    
matters. The information provided above is only a brief summary of the complex  
factors affecting the financial situation in Ohio and is derived from sources   
that are generally available to investors and are believed to be accurate. No   
independent verification has been made of the accuracy or completeness of any of
the foregoing information. It is based in part on information obtained from     
various State and local agencies in Ohio or contained in Official Statements for
various Ohio Municipal Obligations.                                             

 Oklahoma Risk Factors

  Economic Outlook. Oklahoma's economy has made great gains since the economic
recession of 2001-2002. Oklahoma was ranked fourteenth, higher than surrounding 
states in the "Top 10 Pro-Business States for 2007" by Pollina Corporate Real   
Estate. The national study recognized Oklahoma for its business incentives and  
economic development efforts.                                                   

  Some highlights of Oklahoma's economy are: the State job growth for 2007 was
1.5 percent versus 1.3 percent at the national level; strong job gains relative 
to the U.S. have again pushed state population gains above the 1 percent mark in
2007; in 2007, over 5,000 jobs have been announced statewide by manufacturing   
and service companies; some of the most notable employment announcements taking 
place in Oklahoma include: 300 jobs being added in Tulsa by American Airlines;  
180 jobs in Broken Arrow by Hill Manufacturing; 100 jobs in McAlester by Choctaw
Manufacturing and Development and 450 jobs in Tulsa by DMI Industries; a        
manufacturer of steel products and wind towers.                                 

Oklahoma emerged from the revenue shortfall years of fiscal year 2002 and 
fiscal year 2003 with solid revenue growth in fiscal year 2004 through fiscal   
year 2007. Actual revenue collected again exceeded 100% of the estimate and a   
deposit of $75.9 million was made into the Rainy Day Fund. This is the third    
year in a row and only the third time since the creation of the Rainy Day Fund  
that the fund balance reached the maximum allowed by law. The legal maximum is  
equal to 10% of the prior fiscal year's general revenue fund appropriations, or 
$571.6 million for fiscal year 2007.                                            

Oklahoma is also experiencing record investment revenues as the State     
Treasurer's monthly average investable base has risen from $1.801 billion at the
end of fiscal year 2003 to $3.303 billion at the end of fiscal year 2007.       
Already for fiscal year 2008, this amount has increased another $295 million to 
an all time high of $3.598 billion.                                             

Major Initiatives.                                                        
 Revenue from the increased tobacco tax, gaming and the lottery will enhance
Oklahoma's diverse revenue base and provide additional funds to health care and 
education. The State Board of Equalization approved an increase in certification
of over $101.6 million from fiscal year 2007. Changes in law and transfers to   
the special cash fund made during the legislative session increased overall     
appropriations and expenditure authority to just over $7 billion for fiscal year
2008. Additional funds became available after the start of the fiscal year 2008.
An additional $155 million spilled over from the Rainy Day Fund when it reached 
a Constitutional cap of $571.6 million. A total of $139.8 million in "spillover"
funds were already allocated including $22 million for teacher salary increases,
$39 million for Higher Education and $90 million to the State Emergency Fund.   

   The Governor and Legislature focused on a number of significant issues during
the 2007 legislative session designed to encourage economic development, improve
education and increase access to quality health care services.                  

   Oklahoma's energy industry will likely give the State an edge in its economic
outlook for fiscal year 2008. The State will see overall tax revenues begin to  
moderate much like the United States as a whole. Tax reform was enacted lowering
the top marginal rate for income taxes for tax year 2008 to 5.5% with a further 
reduction to 5.25% in tax year 2009. The standard deduction will gradually      
increase to the federal level. Estate taxes will be phased out over a three-year
period by equaling the exemption and rates for lineal and collateral heirs in   
2007 and further increasing the exemptions in 2008 and 2009. The fiscal year    
2008 budget includes $32 million for a $600 salary increase for teachers and    
$19.95 million for a targeted pay increase for teachers with ten or more years  
of experience. While Oklahoma still lags the regional average for teacher's     
salaries, it has increased to 97% of the average from a low of 87% in fiscal    
year 2000. Recommendations of the Achieving Classroom Excellence (ACE) Task     
Force created in the 2006 Session are continuing to be implemented. Major       
provisions include advising the State Board of Education on curriculum          
alignment, assessment development, alternate tests, intervention, and           
remediation strategies.                                                         

 Revenues and Expenditures. Revenue collections continue to keep pace in the
current fiscal year. In the first six months, General Revenue Fund collections  
are $90.7 million (or 3.3%) above estimated collections and $7.9 million (or    
..3%) above prior year collections. December sales taxes are primarily          
responsible for the revenue increases. Income and sales tax collections are a   
good indicator that the underlying state economy continues to show strength. The
likelihood of budget cuts during the current fiscal year is remote unless the   
current trends reverse.                                                         

Receipts from all of the four major taxes (income tax, sales tax, gross   
production tax and motor vehicle tax) exceeded revenues of the prior year,      
producing a combined total of $5.9 billion, or 88% of total General Revenue Fund
receipts. The total of major taxes collected increased $140 million or 2.7% from
that of the prior year. As compared to fiscal year 2006, collections from income
taxes increased by $128 million, or 4.8%; sales taxes increased by $76 million, 
or 5.3%; motor vehicle taxes increased by $25.7 million, or 11.0% and gross     
production taxes on gas decreased by $103 million, or 16%.                      

Oklahoma has established an enviable record in recent years in its revenue
forecasting results. Since enactment of a constitutional amendment in 1985      
establishing new revenue estimating procedures, collections have exceeded the   
estimate in thirteen years and dipped below the estimate nine years.            

Assets and Funds. The State's combined net assets (government and         
business-type activities) totaled $13.4 billion at the end of 2007, compared to 
$12.4 billion at the end of the previous year. The largest portion of the       
State's net assets (50%) reflects its investment in capital assets such as land,
buildings, equipment, and infrastructure (road, bridges, and other immovable    
assets), less any related debt used to acquire those assets that is still       
outstanding. The State uses these capital assets to provide services to         
citizens; consequentially, these assets are not available for future spending.  
Although the State's investment in its capital assets is reported net of related
debt, it should be noted that the resources needed to repay this debt must be   
provided from other sources, since the capital assets themselves cannot be used 
to liquidate these liabilities.                                                 

A portion of the State's net assets (25%) represents resources that are   
subject to external restrictions on how they may be used. The remaining balance 
of unrestricted net assets may be used to meet the State's ongoing obligations  
to citizens and creditors. Internally imposed designations of resources are not 
presented as restricted net assets.                                             

 At the end of the current fiscal year, the State is able to report positive
balances in all three categories of net assets, both for the government as a    
whole, as well as for its separate governmental and business-type activities.   
The same situation held true for the prior fiscal year.                         

The State's net assets increased by $1.1 billion or 8.6%. Approximately 55
percent of the State's total revenue came from taxes, while 37 percent resulted 
from grants and contributions (including federal aid). Charges for various goods
and services provided 6.4 percent of the total revenues. The State's expenses   
cover a range of services. The largest expenses were for general education,     
social services, and health services. In 2007, governmental activity expenses   
exceeded program revenues, resulting in the use of $7.4 billion in general      
revenues (mostly taxes). The business-type activities' program revenues exceeded
their expenses for 2007 by $223 million.                                        

As of the end of the current fiscal year, the State's governmental funds  
reported combined ending fund balances of $6.2 billion, an increase of $520     
million from the prior year. More than one half ($3.4 billion or 56%) of this   
total amount constitutes unreserved fund balance, which is available for        
spending in the coming year. The remainder of fund balance is reserved to       
indicate that it is not available for new spending because it has already been  
committed 1) to liquidate contracts and purchase orders of the prior fiscal year
($439 million), 2) to pay debt service ($145 million), 3) to be held in         
permanent trust funds for education, wildlife and prevention of tobacco related 
health issues ($1.9 billion) or 4) for a variety of other restricted purposes   
($147 million). The general fund is the chief operating fund of the State. At   
the end of the current fiscal year, unreserved fund balance of the general fund 
was $3.4 billion, while the total fund balance increased $235 million to $4.2   
billion. As a measure of the general fund's liquidity, it may be useful to      
compare both unreserved fund balance and total fund balance to total fund       
expenditures. Unreserved fund balance represents 24.6% of total general fund    
expenditures (down from 26% a year ago), while total fund balance represents 30%
of that same amount (down from 31%). Overall the fund balance of the State's    
general fund increased by $235 million during the current fiscal year. This is a
5.9% increase from the prior year.                                              

   The State of Oklahoma's total debt decreased by $7 million, or 1%, during the
current fiscal year. The increase in long-term obligations of governmental      
activities was primarily due to a $96 million ODOT grant anticipation note      
payable, while business-type activities had a $74 million long-term obligations 
decrease primarily due to a reduction in the total outstanding bond indebtedness
of the Oklahoma Water Resources Board ($72 million decrease).                   

 Government Funds. The Commissioners of the Land Office manage land and cash
set aside by the Federal Government for the use and benefit of public education 
in Oklahoma to generate maximum earnings for Trust beneficiaries. The Trust     
beneficiaries are common education and thirteen Oklahoma colleges and           
universities. This year total program revenues were $272 million compared to    
$171 million of the prior year.                                                 

  Distributions to beneficiaries totaled $62 million for fiscal year 2007 with
$16 million disbursed to universities and colleges and $44 million disbursed to 
public schools. This was an increase of $7 million from the apportionments of   
fiscal year 2006.                                                               

The Department of Wildlife's Lifetime Licenses fund balance increased by  
13.7% to $80.1 million. This increase occurred due to increases in both license 
revenue and investment revenue over the previous year.                          

   The Tobacco Settlement Endowment Permanent Fund holds certain moneys that are
received in settlement of claims by the State against tobacco manufacturers.    
Earnings from these moneys are to be utilized for research, education,          
prevention and treatment of tobacco related diseases and certain other health   
programs. This fund reported a $78.8 million increase in fund balance with most 
of the increase, $47.6 million, coming from the settlement payment by tobacco   
manufacturers for 2007. The prior year's payment was about $42.4 million. The   
State now has $376.3 million in the permanent fund.                             

Debt Administration. General obligation bonds are backed by the full faith
and credit of the State, including the State's power to levy additional taxes to
ensure repayment of the debt. Accordingly, all general obligation debt currently
outstanding was approved by a vote of the citizens. Prior to a 1993 general     
obligation bond program, except for refunding bonds, the State last issued      
general obligation bonds in 1968. Certain maturities of those bonds were advance
refunded in 1977 and again in 2003. As of June 30, 2007, the outstanding general
obligation net debt of the State of Oklahoma was $233.5 million. This figure    
excludes the self-supporting taxable bonds of the Oklahoma Industrial Finance   
Authority, which are secured by the repayment of loans made to private          
businesses. State revenues have never been required to support debt service     
payments on these obligations.                                                  

Various agencies, trusts, and authorities issue revenue bonds on behalf of
the State of Oklahoma, and these obligations are supported solely by the        
revenues of the issuing entities. Those revenues may include appropriations to  
the respective entities.                                                        

Risk Management. In general the State is "self-insured" for health care   
claims, workers' compensation, tort liability, vehicle liability, and property  
losses, with some exceptions for participation in health maintenance            
organizations and for excess coverage items. The property loss excess coverage  
is limited to a maximum loss of $1 billion. The Oklahoma State and Education    
Employees' Group Insurance Board provides group health, life, dental and        
disability benefits to the State's employees and certain other eligible         
participants. The State Insurance Fund provides workers' compensation coverage  
for both public and private sector employees in Oklahoma.                       

Ratings. As of July 2008, all outstanding general obligation bonds of the 
State of Oklahoma are rated AA by S&P and Aa3 by Moody's. Any explanation       
concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating    
agencies. There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of
time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.                             

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Oklahoma issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of    
obligations issued by the State of Oklahoma, and there is no obligation on the  
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the

 Oregon Risk Factors

 General Economic Conditions. Oregon is the least populous of the three west
coast states that also include California and Washington. Oregon had slightly   
more than 1.9 million of the three states' 23.5 million workers in August 2007. 
Oregon's largest metro area is the Portland-Vancouver-Beaverton metropolitan    
statistical area. The Portland area has the sixth largest number of workers of  
the seven metro areas with one million or more workers in the three states. It  
includes about half of Oregon's jobs.                                           

   Employment grew more rapidly in Oregon than in most neighboring states in the
mid-1990s due largely to a combination of high net in-migration and a boom in   
high technology (primarily computer chips), transportation equipment (such as   
recreational vehicles and heavy trucks), and construction. The Asian financial  
crisis in 1997 led to weaker manufacturing employment and slower overall job    
growth in Oregon. Then the national recession hit the State. Between late 2000  
and the middle of 2003, employment fell by as much as 4 percent, much worse than
in neighboring states. From late 2003 to mid-2006, Oregon gained jobs at roughly
3 percent per year. Then growth slowed markedly. From September 2006 to         
September 2007, Oregon's employment grew by less than 1 percent.                

During the rapid job growth of the mid-1990s, Oregon's unemployment rate  
ranked in the middle of all states and lower than its neighboring states.       
However, the rate rose with the Asian financial crisis. During the economic boom
of the late 1990s and in 2000, Oregon's unemployment rate remained above the    
rates in neighboring states. The nation and Oregon went into a recession after  
the burst of the information technology bubble. With the onset of the recession,
Oregon's unemployment rate soared from just over 5.0 percent in late 2000 to a  
peak of 8.5 percent in the middle of 2003. The State's population continued to  
grow despite the high unemployment rate. Oregon had the nation's highest or     
second-highest state unemployment rate for 39 of the 40 months from May 2001 to 
August 2004. Rapid job growth from late 2003 to mid-2006 pulled the unemployment
rate down to under 5.5 percent by early 2006; it remained between 5.0 and 5.5   
percent through late 2007.                                                      

Oregon's major foreign export-related industries include computers and    
electronic products, transportation equipment, machinery, and agricultural      
crops. Oregon also ships large values of wood, food, nursery, machinery,        
plastic, and paper products to domestic markets and serves foreign and domestic 
tourists. Oregon's annual employment growth is expected to be 1.3 percent in    
2007 and 2008, 1.9 percent in 2009, 1.8 percent in 2010, and 1.4 percent in     
later years. The State is projected to outpace the nation's growth rate from    
2008 to 2013. Job growth is expected to be fastest in professional and business 
services, leisure and hospitality, and health care. Other nonmanufacturing      
sectors will post robust job gains as the State's population increases faster   
than the nation's. Manufacturing is projected to decline slightly. Overall,     
employment should grow slightly faster than population during the 2007 through  
2013 time period, so Oregon may continue to have a low unemployment rate.       

During the past ten years, the State's general governmental expenditures  
related to education have increased in amount, but have decreased as a          
percentage of total expenditures (a ten-year decrease of 4.2 percent). This     
relative decline results from a shift in allocation of total expenditures for   
other program areas such as human services, public safety, and debt service     
expenditures. The general governmental expenditures related to human services   
have increased as programs to serve needy Oregonians have expanded; the         
percentage of total expenditures is 2.6 percent higher than it was ten years    
ago.                                                                            

 During this same ten-year period, tax revenues, while increasing in amount,
have actually decreased as a percentage of total revenue (a ten-year decrease of
7.3 percent). The reason for this relative decline is the relative increase in  
general governmental expenditures related to services that are supported more by
federal revenues than by taxes (e.g., human services). As a percentage of total 
revenue, federal revenues are 3.8 percent higher than they were ten years ago,  
reflecting an increased participation in federal assistance programs which      
benefits Oregon's citizens.                                                     

The unemployment rate for Oregon as of October 2007 was 5.5 percent; the  
national rate as of October 2007 was 4.7 percent. Employment growth in the      
second quarter of 2007 was 1.4 percent. This marks the sixteenth consecutive    
quarter of job growth. However, job gains have been slowing since the first     
quarter of 2006, a slowdown that has been expected after three years of strong  
job growth in Oregon.                                                           

Budgetary Process. The Oregon budget is approved on a biennial basis by   
separate appropriation measures. A biennium begins July 1 and ends June 30 of   
odd-numbered years. Measures are passed for the approaching biennium during each
regular Legislative session, held beginning in January of odd-numbered years.   

Because the Oregon Legislative Assembly meets in regular session for      
approximately six months of each biennium, provision is made for interim funding
through the Legislative Emergency Board. The Emergency Board is authorized to   
make allocations of General Fund monies to State agencies from the State        
Emergency Fund. The Emergency Board may also authorize increases in expenditure 
limitations from Other or Federal Funds (dedicated or continuously appropriated 
funds), and may take other actions to meet emergency needs when the Legislative 
Assembly is not in session. The most significant feature of the budgeting       
process in Oregon is the constitutional requirement that the budget be in       
balance at the end of each biennium. Because of this provision, Oregon may not  
budget a deficit and is required to alleviate any revenue shortfalls within each
biennium.                                                                       

 Revenue and Expenditures. The State budgets on a biennial basis rather than
an annual basis. For the 2005-07 biennium, final budgeted expenditures for the  
General Fund increased by $152.5 million from original budgeted expenditures    
reflected in the Legislatively Adopted Budget. This increase was made to provide
funding for additional expenditures mainly in the program areas of education,   
human services, and public safety. Forecasted revenues increased by $1,062.7    
million from the original budgeted revenues. This increase was primarily due to 
higher than originally forecasted corporate and personal income tax revenue     
projections.                                                                    

 Actual revenue and other financing sources exceeded actual expenditures and
other financing uses by $708.6 million for the 2005-07 biennium, increasing the 
ending budgetary fund balance. For the biennium, actual revenues were greater   
than budgetary estimates mainly due to higher than expected corporate income tax
revenues. Through House Bill 2707, the Legislature directed that a significant  
portion of excess corporate income taxes be transferred from the General Fund   
into the Oregon Rainy Day Fund to begin setting aside resources that could be   
used to assist the State during difficult economic times. Actual expenditures   
for the biennium were less than budgeted expenditures, as presented in the (cash
basis) budgetary schedule for the General Fund; however, it is expected that the
majority of remaining budget will be expended as obligations are paid during the
six-month lapse period from July 1 to December 31, 2007.                        

 Debt Administration and Limitation. The State's constitution authorizes the
issuance of general obligation bonds for financing higher education building    
projects, facilities, institutions, and activities. As of June 30, 2007, the    
total balance of general obligation bonds was $4.40 billion.                    

Ratings. As of July 2008, all outstanding general obligation bonds of the 
State of Oregon are rated AA by S&P and Aa2 by Moody's. Any explanation         
concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating    
agencies. There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of
time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.                             

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Oregon issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of      
obligations issued by the State of Oregon, and there is no obligation on the    
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Oregon IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of 
all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject.    
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Oregon IM-IT, the  
market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective    
issuers of such bonds acquired by the Oregon IM-IT to pay interest on or        
principal of such bonds.                                                        

  The Oregon IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory factors
affecting issuers of Oregon municipal obligations (the "Oregon Municipal        
Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain Oregon     
constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and other    
matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief      
summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in Oregon and  
is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and are       
believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the       
accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing information. It is based in    
part on information obtained from various State and local agencies in Oregon or 
contained in Official Statements for various Oregon Municipal Obligations.      

 Pennsylvania Risk Factors

Economic Outlook. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ("Pennsylvania" or the 
"Commonwealth") historically has been identified as a heavy industry state,     
although that reputation has been changing as the industrial composition of     
Pennsylvania's economy continues to diversify into the service sector, including
trade, medical and health services, education and financial institutions.       
Pennsylvania's agricultural industries are also an important component of the   
Commonwealth's economic structure, particularly in crop and livestock products  
as well as agribusiness and food related industries.                            

The national economy slowed dramatically during the first quarter of 2007,
0.6 percent growth in gross domestic product (GDP), before rebounding during the
second quarter to 4.0 percent growth in GDP. This rapid turnaround supported    
continued gains in employment both nationally and within the Pennsylvania       
economy. Improvements in personal income, government finances, and jobs growth  
were recorded during the recently completed fiscal year. Overall, growth in the 
national economy averaged 2.5 percent during fiscal year 2006-07.               

From mid-2007 to mid-2008, growth in the national economy, as measured by 
GDP, is expected to average 2.4 percent, below recent performances. Continued   
weakness in the housing market will likely lead to slower growth in the economy.
Significant increases in oil prices will negatively impact the economy and      
likely reduce consumer expenditures. More cautious consumer spending and        
weakened foreign trade will adversely impact the national and Pennsylvania      
economies in fiscal year 2008.                                                  

Commonwealth Financial Structure. The Constitution and the laws of the    
Commonwealth require all payments from the State Treasury, with the exception of
refunds of taxes, licenses, fees and other charges, to be made only by duly     
enacted appropriations. Amounts appropriated from a fund may not exceed its     
actual and estimated revenues for the fiscal year plus any unappropriated       
surplus available. Appropriations from the principal operating funds of the     
Commonwealth (the General Fund, the Motor License Fund and the State Lottery    
Fund) are generally made for one fiscal year and are returned to the            
unappropriated surplus of the fund (a lapse) if not spent or encumbered by the  
end of the fiscal year. The Commonwealth's fiscal year begins July 1 and ends   
June 30.                                                                        

The General Fund. The General Fund, the Commonwealth's largest operating  
fund, may be used to assess Pennsylvania's financial position and activities for
the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. It accounts for all revenues and other     
receipts that are not required by law to be accounted for or deposited in other 
special funds, and reflects a significant portion of Commonwealth expenditures. 
Tax revenues, principally personal and corporate income, and sales and use      
taxes, constitute approximately 88.8 percent of the non-federal General Fund    
budgetary basis revenues. General Fund expenditures are reported in the         
following functional assignments, along with the related percentage of          
non-federal expenditures: direction and supportive services (3.52), protection  
of persons and property (11.89), health and human services (38.40), public      
education (37.66), recreation and cultural enrichment (1.14), economic          
development (3.02), transportation (1.42) and transfers to debt service funds   
(2.95) for all obligations except those incurred for highway or other special   
revenue fund purposes.                                                          

 Continued weakness in the housing sector and escalating oil prices were two
of the main factors that resulted in slower growth of the national economy      
during fiscal year 2006-07. Growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) finished
at 2.5 percent for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, down from 3.4 percent   
for the prior fiscal year. Corporate profits, growth in wages and salaries and  
consumer expenditures were all lower during fiscal year 2006-07 than in the     
prior fiscal year. Economic growth proved erratic as said growth was 0.4 percent
in the first quarter of 2007 but rebounded to reach 4.0 percent in the second   
quarter of 2007. Job growth continued during the fiscal year and the            
unemployment rate continued to drop throughout the fiscal year. Overall,        
economic conditions positively impacted state revenue growth, as revenues       
exceeded the budget estimate. These additional revenues were used in part to    
replenish portions of reserve funds and to support an increased demand for      
governmental goods and services, particularly in the area of health care costs. 

 During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, total General Fund revenues and
other sources exceeded expenditures and other uses by $8.7 million and, at June
30, 2007, the Commonwealth reported an unreserved/undesignated fund balance     
(budgetary basis) of $530.9 million in the General Fund. This compares to a     
budgetary basis fund balance of $522.2 million (restated) at June 30, 2006. The 
budgetary basis results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 include revenue 
collections totaling $44,797.5 million, less appropriation authorizations       
totaling $44,696.3 million, less other net financing uses totaling $92.5        
million. Included in the $44,696.3 million appropriation authorizations are     
$197.1 million of state supplemental appropriations and $94 million in Federal  
supplemental appropriations authorized during the fiscal year ended June 30,
2007.                                                                           

Debt Administration. The constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 
permits the incurrence of debt, without approval of the electorate, for capital 
projects specifically authorized in a capital budget. Capital project debt      
outstanding cannot exceed one and three quarters (1.75) times the average of the
annual tax revenues deposited in all funds during the previous five fiscal      
years. The certified constitutional debt limit at August 31, 2007 was $51.3     
billion. Outstanding capital project debt at August 31, 2007 amounted to $6.9   
billion, for a remaining legal debt margin of $44.4 billion. In addition to     
constitutionally authorized capital project debt, the Commonwealth may incur    
debt for electorate-approved programs, such as economic revitalization, land and
water development, water facilities restoration, and certain environmental      
initiatives; and for special purposes approved by the General Assembly, such as 
disaster relief. Total general obligation bond indebtedness outstanding at June
30, 2007 was $8.246 billion. Total debt service fund transfers paid from General
Fund and Motor License Fund appropriations to make principal and interest       
payments to bondholders during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 amounted to  
$849 million and $41 million, respectively. The table that follows shows total  
outstanding long-term indebtedness for general obligation bonds at the end of   
the eight most recent fiscal years.                                             

During the fiscal year ending June 30, 2008, the Office of the Budget     
currently plans general obligation bond issuances, excluding refundings,        
amounting to $981 million, a decrease of $92 million as compared to actual bond 
issuances of $1,073 million, excluding refundings, during the fiscal year ended 
June 30, 2007. This plan reflects the need to make continued investments in the 
Commonwealth's capital infrastructure, local capital projects and mass          
transportation. Additionally, a significant portion of the projected issuances  
for the 2008 fiscal year is attributable to two major environmental programs    
which would target capital improvements to water supply and sewage treatment    
facilities associated with economic development, as well as, general            
environmental capital improvement projects. Debt principal retirements of $555.3
million are currently planned for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2008.         

The Commonwealth continues to evaluate refunding opportunities for its    
outstanding bonds to reduce interest costs. During the fiscal year ended June
30, 2007, the Commonwealth closed a refunding issue that refunded $239 million  
of outstanding bonds and will produce $14 million of interest savings over the  
remaining life of those bonds. As market conditions provide additional          
opportunities, the Commonwealth may pursue additional refundings.               

In addition to general obligation bonds, the Commonwealth may issue tax   
anticipation notes to meet operating cash needs during certain months of the    
fiscal year. Tax anticipation notes may be issued only for the General Fund and 
the Motor License Fund. They may not exceed 20 percent of the funds' estimated  
revenues for the year and must mature during the fiscal year in which they were 
issued. Cash shortages may occur during the fiscal year because tax receipts,   
unlike cash disbursements, are concentrated in the last four months of the      
fiscal year. The Commonwealth has not issued tax anticipation notes during the  
past ten fiscal years and has no plans to issue any during the 2008 fiscal year.
There were no changes in credit ratings, and there were no debt limitations,    
restrictions or commitments during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 that may 
affect the Commonwealth's plans during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2008.    

 Capital Asset Activity. General capital assets as of June 30, 2006 amounted
to $22.8 billion at actual or estimated historical cost, net of accumulated     
depreciation of $11.7 billion.                                                  

Throughout the fiscal year, Commonwealth agencies acquire or construct    
capital assets. In governmental fund statements, expenditures for capital assets
are typically reported as capital outlay. Funding for a significant portion of  
capital asset acquisition is provided by proceeds of general obligation bonds   
issued; such proceeds are generally accounted for in the capital projects funds 
in the funds financial statements as another financing source. In the           
government-wide statements, bond proceeds are reported as additions to long-term
bond liabilities and completed project expenditures and construction in progress
at fiscal year end are reported as part of general capital assets. Construction 
in progress for Department of General Services (public works) and Department of 
Transportation (highway and bridge) projects at June 30, 2007 amounted to $0.4  
and $1.8 billion, respectively. Authorized but unissued general obligation bonds
at June 30, 2007 totaled $57.2 billion. General capital assets as of June 30,
2007 amounted to $23.8 billion at actual or estimated historical cost, net of   
accumulated depreciation of $12.6 billion.                                      

  Legislation. During the fiscal year that began July 1, 2007, the legislature
approved several new laws which are expected to change the Commonwealth's       
financial position in the future.                                               

Act 44, signed July 18, 2007 provides for a new system of funding public  
transportation and highway and bridge repair in Pennsylvania. On average, the   
new law will make $532 million available annually over the next 10 years to fund
state and local road and bridge repairs and $414 million available to support   
the 73 public transit systems that provide more than 400 million rides a year to
residents in all of Pennsylvania's 67 counties. The new transportation funding  
law replaces a patchwork transit funding system with the new Public             
Transportation Trust Fund, which will be funded by sales and other taxes,       
lottery proceeds and amounts from the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission.         

 Act 45, signed July 20, 2007 contains the enabling legislation for a number
of important education initiatives funded in Act 8A, the General Appropriations 
Act of 2007 including: $75 million for the Pre-Kindergarten Counts program, $6  
million for School Nutrition Incentives, $20 million additional Accountability  
Block Grant funds to promote Full-Day Kindergarten. The Act also includes the   
enabling legislation for the basic education subsidy which will provide $4.9    
billion to local school districts. There is also an increase in the Education   
Improvement Tax Credit which will reduce tax revenues by $16 million during the 
fiscal year ending June 30, 2008.                                               

 Act 55, signed July 25, 2007 amends the Tax Reform Code to make a number of
changes including 1) the creation of a Film Tax Credit and the Resource         
Enhancement and Protection Tax Credit, 2) the treatment of credit losses (bad   
debts) for the purposes of calculating certain taxes and 3) various other       
revisions to the Tax Reform Code. The estimated tax revenue decrease for all    
changes included in Act 55 is approximately $50 million for the fiscal year     
ending June 30, 2008.                                                           

Ratings. As of July 2008, all outstanding general obligation bonds of the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania are rated AA by S&P and Aa2 by Moody's. Any        
explanation concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from   
the rating agencies. There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for   
any period of time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.               

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Pennsylvania issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of
obligations issued by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and there is no         
obligation on the part of the Commonwealth to make payment on such local        
obligations in the event of default.                                            

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Pennsylvania IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive          
description of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations  
are subject. Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and 
environmental policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the  
issuers of such bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the      
financial condition of the Commonwealth and various agencies and political      
subdivisions thereof. The Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent
such factors or other factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in  
the Pennsylvania IM-IT, the market value or marketability of such bonds or the  
ability of the respective issuers of such bonds acquired by the Pennsylvania    
IM-IT to pay interest on or principal of such bonds.                            

The Pennsylvania IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory
factors affecting issuers of Pennsylvania municipal obligations (the            
"Pennsylvania Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse       
effects of certain Pennsylvania constitutional amendments, legislative measures,
voter initiatives and other matters that are described. The information provided

situation in Pennsylvania and is derived from sources that are generally        
available to investors and are believed to be accurate. No independent

Puerto Rico Risk Factors

  Geographic Location and Demography. The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico ("Puerto
Rico," or the "Commonwealth") is the fourth largest of the Caribbean islands and
is located approximately 1,600 miles Southeast of New York. It is approximately 
100 miles long and 35 miles wide. According to the United States Census Bureau, 
the population of Puerto Rico was approximately 3,808,610 in 2000 (3,927,776 as 
of July 1, 2006, according to a United States Census Bureau estimate), compared 
to 3,522,000 in 1990. However, the Puerto Rico Planning Board (the "Planning    
Board") estimates that as of July 2010, the population will be approximately    
4,022,446.                                                                      

 Relationship with the United States. Puerto Rico came under the sovereignty
of the United States with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on December 10,    
1898, at the conclusion of the Spanish-American War. Puerto Ricans became       
citizens of the United States in 1917, by virtue of the Jones Act, approved by  
the Congress of the United States. In 1950, the Congress of the United States   
enacted Public Law 600 in order to provide for an increased Puerto Rican        
self-government. This law set forth the political, economic and fiscal          
relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States. It also provided for the
drafting and adoption of a local constitution on July 25, 1952. The Constitution
of Puerto Rico was drafted by a Constituent Commission, approved in a special   
referendum by the people of Puerto Rico, amended and ratified by the United     
States Congress, and subsequently approved by the President of the United       
States. The official designation of the Government or body politic has          
henceforth been "Estado Libre Asociado," which literally translates to "Free    
Associated State," and has been called "Commonwealth" by the United States      
Government.                                                                     

The United States and the Commonwealth share a common defense, market and 
currency. Puerto Rico exercises virtually the same control over its internal    
affairs as any of the fifty states of the United States. However, it differs    
from the states in its relationship with the United States federal government.  
The people of Puerto Rico are citizens of the United States but do not vote in  
national elections (they can only vote in local (Puerto Rico) elections). The   
people of the Commonwealth are represented in Congress by a Resident            
Commissioner who has a voice in the House of Representatives and limited voting 
power. Puerto Rico is a self-governing commonwealth in association with the     
United States. The chief of state of the Commonwealth is the President of the   
United States. The head of government is an elected Governor. There are two     
legislative chambers: the House of Representatives, 51 seats, and the Senate, 27
seats.                                                                          

  While Puerto Rico has authority over its internal affairs, the United States
controls interstate trade, foreign relations and commerce, customs              
administration, control of air, land and sea, immigration and emigration,       
nationality and citizenship, currency, maritime laws, military service, military
bases, army, navy and air force, declaration of war, constitutionality of laws, 
jurisdictions and legal procedures, treaties, radio and television              
communications, agriculture, mining and minerals, highways, postal system;      
social security, and other areas generally controlled by the federal government 
in the United States. Puerto Rican institutions control internal affairs unless 
U.S. law is involved, as in matters of public health and pollution. The major   
differences between Puerto Rico and the 50 states are its local taxation system 
and exemption from Internal Revenue Code, its lack of voting representation in  
either house of the U.S. Congress, the ineligibility of Puerto Ricans to vote in
presidential elections, and its lack of assignation of some revenues reserved   
for the states.                                                                 

Economy. The Commonwealth has established policies and programs directed  
principally at developing the manufacturing and services sectors of the economy 
and expanding and modernizing the Commonwealth's infrastructure. Domestic and   
foreign investment have been stimulated by selective tax exemptions, development
loans, and other financial and tax incentives. Infrastructure expansion and     
modernization have been to a large extent financed by bonds and notes issued by 
the Commonwealth, its public corporations and municipalities.                   

Economic progress has been aided by significant increases in the levels of
education and occupational skills of the Commonwealth's population.             

The economy of Puerto Rico is closely linked to the United States economy.
The following exogenous variables are affected by the United States economy:    
exports, direct investment, transfer payments, interest rates, inflation and    
tourist expenditures. During fiscal year 2007 (July 2006 through June 2007),    
approximately 77% of Puerto Rico's exports went to the United States mainland,  
which was also the source of approximately 50% of Puerto Rico's imports.        

 Puerto Rico enjoyed almost two decades of economic expansion through fiscal
year 2001. Almost every sector of the economy participated, and record levels of
employment were achieved. Factors behind this expansion included                
government-sponsored economic development programs, periodic declines in the    
value of the United States dollar, increased in the level of federal transfers, 
a significant expansion in construction investment driven by infrastructure     
projects and private investment, primarily in housing, the relatively low cost  
of borrowing and low oil prices. In fiscal year 2007, however, Planning Board   
figures indicate that the economy of Puerto Rico registered a decline of 1.8% in
real gross product.                                                             

The dominant sectors of the Puerto Rico economy are manufacturing and     
services. The manufacturing sector has undergone fundamental changes over the   
years as a result of increased emphasis on higher wage, high technology         
industries, such as pharmaceuticals, electronics, computers, microprocessors,   
professional and scientific instruments and certain high technology machinery   
and equipment. The service sector, including finance, insurance, real estate,   
wholesale and retail trade and tourism, also plays a major role in the economy. 
It ranks second only to manufacturing in contribution to the gross domestic     
product and leads all sectors in providing employment.                          

Puerto Rico is heavily dependent on oil imports for the production of     
electricity. As a result of the construction of two cogeneration plants,        
however, one of which is fueled by liquefied natural gas and the other by coal, 
Puerto Rico's dependence on oil imports for the production of electricity has   
been reduced from 99% to 74%.                                                   

  The Commonwealth's gross product in fiscal year 2007 was approximately $58.7
billion. This represents an increase in gross product of 23.7% from fiscal year 
2003. Since fiscal year 1985, personal income, both aggregate and per capita,   
has increased consistently each fiscal year. In fiscal year 2007, aggregate     
personal income was $53.1 billion and personal income per capita was $13,491.   

   According to the Department of Labor and Human Resources Household Employment
Survey (the "Survey"), average employment increased from 1,188,000 in fiscal    
year 2003 to 1,263,000 in fiscal year 2007. The average unemployment rate       
decreased from 12.1% in fiscal year 2003 to 10.4% in fiscal year 2007.          

 According to the Survey, during the first eight months in fiscal year 2008,
total monthly seasonally adjusted employment averaged 1,214,800 compared to     
1,262,900 in the same period of fiscal year 2007, a decrease of 3.8%. The       
unemployment rate increased to 11.2% during the first eight months of fiscal    
year 2008 from 10.3% during the same period of fiscal year 2007. Total          
employment for January 2008 was 1,226,000, a decrease of 61,000 compared to the 
same month in 2007.                                                             

The Planning Board's real gross domestic product forecast for fiscal year 
2008, made in March 2008, projects a decrease of 2.1%.                          

 Debt, Revenues and Expenditures. The Constitution of Puerto Rico limits the
amount of general obligation (full faith and credit) debt that can be issued or 
guaranteed by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth's policy has been and continues
to be to maintain the amount of such debt prudently below the constitutional    
limitation.                                                                     

 Direct debt of the Commonwealth is supported by Commonwealth taxes. Debt of
municipalities of the Commonwealth, other than bond anticipation notes, is      
supported by real and personal property taxes and municipal license taxes. As of
December 31, 2007, total public sector debt of the Commonwealth (in thousands)  
was equal to $45,932,973.                                                       

General Fund total revenues for fiscal year 2007 were $8,890 million,     
representing an increase of $349 million, or 4.1%, from fiscal year 2006        
revenues. Expenditures for fiscal year 2007 are currently projected at $9.221   
billion, which is $267 million, or 2.9%, lower than the $9.488 billion initially
budgeted. These projections take into consideration $160 million in a portion of
savings from the 10% budget reserve and $107 million in health-related          
expenditure reductions.                                                         

 Ratings. As of July 2008, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has a BBB- credit
rating from S&P and a Baa3 from Moody's on general obligation bond issues. Any  
explanation concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from   
the rating agencies. There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for   
any period of time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.               

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Pennsylvania issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of
obligations issued by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and there is no          
obligation on the part of the Commonwealth to make payments on such local       
obligations in the event of default.                                            

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Puerto Rico IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive           
description of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations  
are subject. Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and 
environmental policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the  
issuers of such bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the      
financial condition of the Commonwealth and various agencies and political      
subdivisions thereof. The Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent
such factors or other factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in  
the Puerto Rico IM-IT, the market value or marketability of such bonds or the   
ability of the respective issuers of such bonds acquired by the Puerto Rico     
IM-IT to pay interest on or principal of such bonds.                            

The Puerto Rico IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory 
factors affecting issuers of Puerto Rico municipal obligations (the "Puerto Rico
Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain  
Puerto Rico constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives  
and other matters that are described. The information provided above is only a  
brief summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in Puerto
Rico and is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and  
are believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the   
accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing information. It is based in    
part on information obtained from various state and local agencies in Puerto    
Rico or contained in Official Statements for various Puerto Rico Municipal      
Obligations.                                                                    

 South Carolina Risk Factors

Governmental Overview. South Carolina stretches from the Atlantic Ocean to
the Blue Ridge Mountains, containing 30,111 square miles. Fortieth in geographic
area among the fifty states, South Carolina ranks twenty-fifth in population    
with approximately 4.3 million citizens. The coastal area, which is one of the  
leading recreation centers on the east coast, is the anchor of the State's      
thriving tourism industry.                                                      

South Carolina's government is divided into three separate branches:      
legislative, executive, and judicial. State government provides a full range of 
services to South Carolina's citizens including educational, health,            
social/human, transportation, public safety, regulatory, and                    
conservation/natural resources services. In addition, the State provides grants 
and loans to local governments, including school districts, within its borders. 

Economic Condition and Outlook. South Carolina historically has been a    
diverse manufacturing state; however, the State's economic base has undergone a 
gradual transition to other sectors such as trade, health care, services, and   
durable goods manufacturing. Businesses have migrated here from all over the    
world to take advantage of the State's skilled labor force, competitive wages,  
lower-priced land, excellent port facilities, accessibility to markets, and in  
recent years, substantial tax incentives.                                       

Overall, South Carolina's continues to post strong job growth with total  
employment up 33,100 jobs, a gain of 1.7% over the last twelve months. Although 
manufacturing still plays a big role in the State's economy, South Carolina's   
economic base has become more diversified including growth in leisure and       
hospitality, retail trade and service. Employment in the State's manufacturing  
sector has been declining and now represents only about 14%, a decrease from 16%
over the past five years. Non-durable goods manufacturing, primarily related to 
the textile and apparel industry, has seen the greatest decline over the past   
five years. Offsetting these declines was growth in the manufacturing of other  
goods, such as the production of transportation equipment, fabricated metals,   
and chemicals. The strongest employment gains have been in the State's service  
sector which has risen from 34% of total employment to 37% during the past five 
years. This sector, fueled by tourism, educational, and healthcare industries   
has contributed to a more diversified overall employment base and improved      
income levels.                                                                  

 Although the State's unemployment rate is higher than the national average,
South Carolina has experienced growth in its labor force. As the State's economy
has continued to generate jobs, the jobless rate has fallen from 6.8% for the   
calendar year 2005 to 6.5% for the calendar year 2006. However, because the size
of the labor force has been growing at approximately the same pace as total     
employment, the unemployment rate has not decreased substantially. Beginning in 
calendar year 2006 and continuing into 2007, the rapid influx of new job seekers
slowed, resulting in a decrease in the unemployment rate.                       

South Carolina's per capita income for 2006 increased to $29,688, or 5.2% 
over 2005. Although the 2006 increase was below the national (6.2%) and         
southeastern states (6.6%) growth rates, it ranked as the highest per capita    
personal income growth rate for the State in the last five years.               

South Carolina's population at July 1, 2006, was 4.3 million. The State's 
rate of population growth is presently the fourteenth fastest in the nation.    

For the calendar year 2006, the South Carolina Department of Commerce     
reported $2.99 billion in new capital investment that is expected to create     
about 14,000 new jobs. The State's rural communities will benefit from this     
growth with nearly 30% of the newly created jobs being located in rural         
communities.                                                                    

 Budgetary General Fund revenues for the first three months of the 2007-2008
fiscal year were $26.011 million, 1.7% higher than during the same period for   
fiscal year 2006-2007. South Carolina's three major revenue sources continue to 
experience modest gains, indicating that the State economy, while not showing   
the same vibrant growth as seen in the past three fiscal years, has not slipped 
into recession. Individual income taxes are up 3.7%, as withholdings increased  
3.1% and estimated tax payments increased 11.1%. Corporate income taxes have    
decreased by 23.5%. Sales taxes have increased 2.8% despite higher gasoline     
prices experienced during this period.                                          

Budgetary General Fund Highlights. The State's Board of Economic Advisors 
(BEA) is responsible for forecasting revenues for the budget. State law requires
that the BEA meet at least quarterly to review revenue collections and to adjust
its forecasts if necessary. If the BEA reduces revenue projections significantly
once the budget year begins, the State's Budget and Control Board is responsible
for mandating spending cuts to keep the budget in balance.                      

Original estimated revenues for the 2006-2007 accounting year were $6.089 
billion. The BEA revised its original revenue estimate three separate times     
during the course of the year by a total of $586.285 million. The upward        
revisions resulted from their review of tax revenue collections and economic    
conditions as the year progressed. Actual revenues at June 30, 2007, were       
$16.654 million less than the BEA's final revised estimate, and $569.631 million
(9.4%) over the original revenue estimate. Actual revenues exceeded prior year  
revenue collections by $432.476 million (6.9%). Individual income and sales     
taxes, the fund's primary revenue sources, were greater than expected because of
favorable economic conditions that lead to increased job growth and consumer    
spending.                                                                       

   For Fiscal Year 2007-2008, estimated revenues in the 2007-2008 Appropriations
Act were $6.622 billion, or $36 million less than 2006-2007 revenue collections.
This estimate may be subsequently revised.                                      

At June 30, 2007, the General Reserve Fund, sometimes called the rainy day
account, was fully funded at $167.732 million. The State's Constitution requires
restoration of the reserve to full funding within three years after a           
withdrawal. State law defines full funding for the reserve as 3% of the         
Budgetary General Fund's revenues for the latest completed accounting year. The 
2006-2007 Appropriation Act passed by the General Assembly appropriated $14.244 
million to fully restore the rainy day account.                                 

Assets. At the end of the 2006-2007 accounting year, the State had $16.932
billion invested in capital assets. This represented a net increase (including  
additions and deductions) of $709.97 million, or 4.4%, over the previous        
accounting year.                                                                

The State's investment in land and improvements increased significantly,  
primarily because of the public colleges and universities expanding their campus
facilities. The University of South Carolina improved land sites for several    
major building projects in progress that are expected to be completed in 2008   
and Tri-County Technical College established a new campus requiring site,       
parking lot and infrastructure development.                                     

  As in previous years, machinery and equipment assets increased significantly
due, in large part, to acquisitions by public universities. Clemson University, 
The Medical University of South Carolina and the University of South Carolina   
all made significant investments in computing, testing, medical, scientific, and
laboratory equipment and equipping newly-established facilities.                

Intangible assets decreased from last fiscal year primarily because of    
state-wide depreciation expense exceeded investment in additional intangible    
assets.                                                                         

  Cash Management. The State Treasurer is responsible for managing the State's
cash and investments, except for certain component units included within the    
reporting entity that manage and invest their own funds. State law requires full
collateralization of all State Treasurer bank balances. Some component units may
have collateralization policies that differ from those of the State Treasurer.  
Investment income includes appreciation and depreciation in the fair value of   
investments. Increases in fair value during the current year, however, do not   
necessarily represent trends that will continue; nor is it always possible to   
realize such amounts, particularly in the case of temporary changes in the fair 
value of investments that the State plans to hold to maturity.                  

  Debt Administration. At the end of the accounting year, the State had $8.539
billion in bonds and notes outstanding--an increase of $312.44 million, or 3.9%,
over last year.                                                                 

New debt from governmental activities resulted mainly from the issuance of
revenue bonds by the South Carolina Transportation Infrastructure Bank. The Bank
issued $388.37 million in revenue bonds, including refunding bonds to advance   
fund $98.855 million in bonds. Also, the Department of Natural Resources issued 
$20.295 million in Heritage Trust Revenue Bonds. New debt from business-type    
activities resulted mainly from the issuance of revenue bond enterprise funds.  
The Housing Authority issued $83.54 million in bonds for housing programs, the  
Education Assistance Authority issued $172.700 million in bonds to provide      
financing for student loans, and the Medical University of South Carolina issued
$38.0 million in facilities revenue bonds.                                      

  The State limits the amount of annual payments for principal and interest on
general obligation bonds and notes rather than directly limiting the amount of  
those bonds and notes that the State may have outstanding. At June 30, 2007, the
State legally could issue additional bonds as long as the new debt would not    
increase the State's annual principal and interest payments by more than the    
following amounts: $50.249 million for institution bonds, $24.362 million for   
highway bonds, $145.086 million for general obligation bonds, excluding         
institution and highway bonds, $9.591 million for economic development bonds,   
and $16.993 million for research university infrastructure bonds.               

Ratings. As of July 2008, all outstanding general obligation bonds of the 
State of South Carolina are rated AA+ by S&P and Aaa by Moody's. Any explanation
concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating    
agencies. There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of
time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.                             

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local South Carolina issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness 
of obligations issued by the State of South Carolina, and there is no obligation
on the part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event 
of default.                                                                     

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the South
Carolina IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description  
of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject. 
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the South Carolina     
IM-IT, the market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the    
respective issuers of such bonds acquired by the South Carolina IM-IT to pay    
interest on or principal of such bonds.                                         

  The South Carolina IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory
factors affecting issuers of South Carolina municipal obligations (the "South   
Carolina Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of 
certain South Carolina constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter   
initiatives and other matters that are described. The information provided above
is only a brief summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation
in South Carolina and is derived from sources that are generally available to   
investors and are believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been 
made of the accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing information. It is 
based in part on information obtained from various State and local agencies in  
South Carolina or contained in Official Statements for various South Carolina   
Municipal Obligations.                                                          

Tennessee Risk Factors

General. Tennessee's state legislation requires the Governor to present his
proposed budget to the General Assembly at the beginning of each annual session.
Annual budgets are adopted for the general fund, special revenue funds (except  
Fraud and Economic Crime, Community Development and the Dairy Promotion Board), 
and debt service fund. The General Assembly enacts the budget through passage of
specific departmental appropriations, the sum of which may not exceed estimated 
revenues. Before signing the Appropriations Act, the Governor may veto or reduce
any specific appropriation, subject to legislative override. Once passed and    
signed, the budget becomes the State's financial plan for the coming year.      

Budgetary control is maintained at the department level. Budget revisions 
during the year, reflecting program changes or interdepartmental transfers of an
administrative nature, may be affected with certain executive and legislative   
branch approval. Only the legislature, however, may transfer appropriations     
between departments.                                                            

 Local Economy. By most broad measures of economic activity, 2006 was a good
year for Tennessee. Nonfarm job growth should total nearly 1.3 percent for the  
year, personal income should be up 6 percent and the unemployment rate should   
average 5.2 percent. The weakness in manufacturing was sustained, however, with 
a setback of 1.2 percent projected for 2006. The uneven pattern of growth across
metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas of the State also continued; rural      
Tennessee in particular has been hit hard by the loss of manufacturing jobs     
while metropolitan communities have benefited from strong growth in the service 
sector.                                                                         

   The short-term outlook for the State calls for slightly slower growth in 2007
than in 2006 with growth then showing some acceleration in 2008. The primary    
factor weighing down on the economy in the near term include higher interest    
rates, a slowdown in residential construction, high energy prices and further   
setbacks in manufacturing. Strong job growth in services should continue to     
provide an important foundation for economic expansion in metropolitan          
Tennessee.                                                                      

  The Southeastern states have been known historically for their concentration
in manufacturing, though there has always been considerable variation in the    
dominance of industry across states within the region. On average, manufacturing
jobs accounted for 11.9 percent of nonfarm jobs in the Southeast in the third   
quarter of 2006, ahead of the 10.5 percent average for the nation. Tennessee's  
manufacturing share of 14.5 percent places it fourth in the region in terms of  
industrial importance.                                                          

  While Tennessee has enjoyed healthy job growth in the last year, the pace of
employment expansion has fallen below that of many other states in the region.  
On a year-over-year basis, the Tennessee state economy saw jobs expand at a 1.2 
percent pace in the third quarter of 2006, as did Arkansas and Mississippi.     
Eight states in the region performed better than Tennessee's 1.2 percent        
posting, Florida's 3.1 percent job growth bring especially impressive.          

 Tennessee's 4.5 percent unemployment rate matched the rate for the national
economy in October 2006 and placed it fifth-lowest in the region. Virginia      
enjoyed the lowest rate of unemployment, while South Carolina was the highest   
among the Southeastern states. Tennessee is enjoying the lowest unemployment    
rate experienced in a number of years since rates in the past three years have  
averaged 5.5 percent.                                                           

   Among the twelve southeastern states in individual well being, as measured by
per capita personal income, Tennessee ranks fourth at per capita income of      
$32,446. The highest levels of per capita income are found in Virginia and      
Florida with Mississippi ranking at the bottom in the region. Per capita        
personal income has increased each of the past three years on average - $28,416 
in 2003, $29,566 in 2004, and $30,908 in 2005. The national figure sets at      
$36,105.                                                                        

In 2005, the number of farms in Tennessee continued a decades-long decline
from 274,000 in 1935, to 92,000 in 1995, to 84,000 in 2005. Despite this decline
in numbers, Tennessee ranks fourth among all states in the number of farms.     
Tennessee is twenty-fifth in total lands in farms (11.6 million acres) and      
forty-fourth in average size of farms (138 acres). Agriculture in Tennessee is  
very diverse. The State's top agricultural commodities include farm animals     
(including cattle, hogs, and poultry) greenhouse/nursery, and various kinds of  
crops (including soybeans, cotton, corn, tobacco).                              

Long-term Financial Planning. In 1996, legislation was enacted that       
determined the allocation goal for a reserve for revenue fluctuations to be five
percent of the estimated State tax revenues to be allocated to the general fund 
and education trust fund. The revenue fluctuation reserve allows services to be 
maintained when revenue growth is slower than estimated in the budget. Amounts  
in the revenue fluctuation reserve may be utilized to meet State tax revenue    
shortfalls. Subject to specific provisions of the general appropriations bill,  
an amount not to exceed the greater of $100 million or one-half (1/2) of the    
amount available in the reserve may be used to meet expenditure requirements in 
excess of budgeted appropriation levels.                                        

   The expansion of this fund is a priority. The reserve increased $49.3 million
in 2005-2006 and $218.2 million in 2006-2007 budget years. The increase in this 
reserve in 2006-2007 not only met expectations but exceeded the minimum legal   
requirement.                                                                    

   In 2002, Tennessee initiated an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) automation
assessment study to research the feasibility of implementing an ERP system to   
meet the State's financial management, procurement, human resources, payroll    
administration and other administrative business needs. In 2005, the software   
and a prime contractor were procured. The system, Edison, is expected to        
significantly improve the State's business processes, and thereby its           
effectiveness and efficiency. The system will enable the use of best management 
practices for financial, human resource, purchasing and other administrative    
operations. During this fiscal year, the project moved closer to implementation 
of the various modules. The human resources and payroll modules are scheduled to
begin implementation on July 1, 2008 with the financial and procurement modules 
following on October 1, December 1, 2008 and March 2009.                        

 Tennessee pursues an aggressive cash management and investment program. One
aspect of this program that is believed unique to Tennessee is the State's      
direct access into the Federal Reserve wire system. Through the State Trust of  
Tennessee, wire services in the federal system are accessed by the State's      
investment office. This provides the State flexibility in investing and         
concentrating cash balances, pension fund assets, and in redeeming warrants and 
checks issued against the Treasury. During fiscal year 2007, uncommitted State  
funds were invested in short-term collateralized deposits as follows (averaged):
certificates of deposit (31%), commercial paper (30%), U.S. Treasuries (33%),   
and money market accounts (6%). The composite weighted average yield on these   
investments was 5.3%, up from 4.11% last year.                                  

Relevant Financial Policies. The budget projects moderate growth in state 
revenues next year. This, along with surplus funds carried forward from last    
year, is adequate to fund a balanced plan for next year, in which recurring     
program requirements are funded by recurring revenue growth and one-time needs  
are addressed by the surplus and nonrecurring funds.                            

  As required by budget law and careful budget management practices, the State
will maintain the revenue fluctuation reserve at five percent of the general and
education fund reserves.                                                        

  Also, based on an established budget principle of maintaining education as a
number one priority, approximately 90 percent of a new multi-million dollar     
revenue stream generated from an increase in the State's cigarette tax will go  
to education.                                                                   

Major Initiatives. Tennessee continues to focus on making education the   
State's fundamental priority, and on continuing to improve job creation and     
economic development, public safety, and making State government focused and    
more responsive to its citizens.                                                

 The voluntary pre-kindergarten program continued to expand during 2006-2007
with funding from the General Fund. The pre-kindergarten program is designed to 
give preference to children who qualify as at-risk, however, the goal is to     
extend the program beyond at-risk and make it available to every four year-old  
child in the State.                                                             

 The Basic Education Program (BEP) which provides funding to local education
agencies includes full funding for significant improvements this year. The BEP  
funding increased by $290.1 million over last year to provide for the           
instructional component of the BEP, to improve the teacher's base salary        
average, and to provide for at-risk students.                                   

  Funding for higher education includes increases to operating improvements to
limit tuition increases to the range of 5 to 6 percent in 2007-2008. Increases  
were also included for agricultural research and extension and public service   
programs.                                                                       

The capital outlay budget totals $505 million including $109 million for  
higher education, $100 million to establish a K-12 school construction bond     
pool, and $89 million for land conservation, state parks and historic sites.    
Also, capital outlay includes additional funding for the prison expansion in    
Bledsoe County and grants to local governments in the State.                    

 Additional funding is proposed for the Cover Tennessee healthcare programs.
This is the second-year adjustment for this new program, which is available to  
uninsured children through age 18, with a household income below 250 percent of 
the poverty level. Maternity coverage also is available for pregnant women.     

 Financial Information. Net assets may serve over time as a useful indicator
of a government's financial position. In the case of the State of Tennessee,    
combined assets exceeded liabilities by $26.47 billion as of June 30, 2007. By  
far the largest portion of the State's net assets (79%) reflects its investment 
in capital assets (e.g., land, infrastructure, structures and improvements,     
machinery and equipment), less any related debt used to acquire those assets    
that is still outstanding. The State uses these capital assets to provide       
services to its citizens; consequently, these assets are not available for      
future spending. Although the State's investment in its capital assets is       
reported net of related debt, it should be noted that the resources needed to   
repay this debt must be provided from other sources, since the capital assets   
themselves cannot be used to liquidate these liabilities.                       

  An additional portion of the State's net assets (8.56 percent) is restricted
and represents resources that are subject to either external restrictions or    
legislative restrictions on how they may be used. The remaining balance is      
unrestricted net assets ($3.18 billion) and may be used to meet the State's     
ongoing obligations to citizens and creditors not funded by resources that are  
restricted.                                                                     

   At June 30, 2007, the State was able to report positive balances in all three
categories of net assets, for the government as a whole, and for its separate   
governmental and business-type activities. The State's net assets increased by  
$1.7 billion during the year ended June 30, 2007. Most of this increase was     
attributable to the State's decision to adopt the modified approach to          
infrastructure. Because of this decision, the State capitalized $736.7 million  
in infrastructure expenditures and did not record depreciation expense. Also,   
Tennessee does not fund highway construction by issuing debt, but it is funded  
primarily with fuel taxes and federal grants in the Highway Fund. Most of the   
remaining increase of $963.3 million resulted from operations in the General    
Fund, Education Trust, Sewer Treatment Loan, and other non-major enterprise     
funds. Tax collections increased for the year and expenditures also increased.  
The Revenue Fluctuation Reserve has been increased to $542.9 million or 3.77% of
General Fund expenditures.                                                      

General fund revenue collections decreased for the year by $651.2 million.
Sales tax collections increased by $126 million. In addition, excise tax        
collections were up $246 million due to continued economic improvements. Federal
revenue collections increased by $123 million primarily due to increased        
expenditures in the TennCare program.                                           

General fund expenditures increased approximately $547.2 million. TennCare
expenditures increased by $97 million and the State implemented a new healthcare
program, Cover Tennessee, which accounts for $78.8 million of additional        
expenditures not included in the prior year. Mental Retardation expenditures    
increased by $63.8 million. Costs incurred for the care of children in State    
custody increased an additional $60.3 million. These increases reflect the      
rising cost of community residential placements and associated medical costs as 
well as increased demand for services in the health and social services         
function.                                                                       

Assets in the General fund increased by approximately 21.27%. The fund    
balance of the General fund increased significantly with an increase of 32.62%. 

 The Education Trust Fund revenue increased $231.6 million for the year. The
sales tax appropriated to the fund increased by $169.0 million. In addition, the
net lottery proceeds and unclaimed prize money transferred from the Tennessee   
Education Lottery Corporation (TELC) increased by $5.1 million and the interest 
earned on these funds increased by $8.1 million. These proceeds fund            
scholarships for eligible Tennessee citizens to attend post-secondary           
educational institutions located in Tennessee and other educational programs. Of
the $488.5 million Educational Trust Fund balance, $453.3 million is restricted 
for the distribution of scholarships.                                           

 Education Trust Fund expenditures increased approximately $422.3 million or
8.0%. Most of the increase was to maintain full funding of the Basic Education  
Program (BEP) formula, fully fund the BEP growth factor, provide for teacher    
salary increases and group health insurance increases for local education       
agencies, and provide additional funding for at-risk student programs and       
English Language Learner students ($200.3 million). Expenditures also increased 
in the school nutrition and special education programs (23.9 million). This     
increase was mostly due to additional children being served by the school       
nutrition programs, an increase in the federal reimbursement rate for the meals 
served and, an expansion of the special education programs at the local level.  
Also, expenditures increased for the lottery-funded programs by $53.8 million.  
This occurred mostly because of the increase in eligible students receiving     
scholarships. In addition, appropriations to the college and university systems 
increased approximately $91.2 million to provide additional funding for         
operational support, to restore prior year budgetary cuts, to provide for       
employee salary increases and to provide for group health insurance, 401(k)     
match, and retirement system rate increases.                                    

 The total plan net assets of the pension trust funds were $32.3 billion, up
over $3.5 billion from the prior year. As a result of the improved performance  
of the financial markets, the pension trust funds incurred a net investment gain
of $3.8 billion.                                                                

 Debt Administration. In accordance with the Constitution, the State has the
authority to issue general obligation debt that is backed by the full faith and 
credit of the State. The Legislature authorizes a certain amount of debt each   
year and the State Funding Board has oversight responsibility to issue the debt 
for capital projects. Capital spending is also authorized by the Legislature and
the State Building Commission has oversight responsibility for all capital      
projects exceeding $100 thousand (for new construction) and maintenance to      
existing facilities. The State issues Commercial Paper as a short-term financing
mechanism for capital purposes and the Commercial Paper is typically redeemed   
with long-term bonds. The State issued $110 million in tax-exempt general       
obligation bonds during the fiscal year to redeem commercial paper, which is    
used to finance capital projects on a short-term basis. Nearly two-thirds of the
outstanding debt has been issued either for capital projects of two of the      
State's major Component Units - University of Tennessee and Tennessee Board of  
Regents - or provided to local governments as capital grants; assets acquired   
with this debt belong to those entities.                                        

Ratings. As of July 2008, all outstanding general obligation bonds of the 
State of Tennessee are rated AA+ by S&P and Aa1 by Moody's. Any explanation     
concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating    
agencies. There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of
time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.                             

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Tennessee issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of   
obligations issued by the State of Tennessee, and there is no obligation on the 
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Tennessee IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description 
of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject. 
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Tennessee IM-IT,   
the market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective
issuers of such bonds acquired by the Tennessee IM-IT to pay interest on or     
principal of such bonds.                                                        

The Tennessee IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory   
factors affecting issuers of Tennessee municipal obligations (the "Tennessee    
Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain  
Tennessee constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and
other matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief
summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in Tennessee   
and is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and are   
believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the       
accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing information. It is based in    
part on information obtained from various State and local agencies in Tennessee 
or contained in Official Statements for various Tennessee Municipal Obligations.

Texas Risk Factors

General Economic Information. In calendar 2007, the Texas economy created 
jobs at nearly twice the national rate. Nonfarm employment in the State advanced
by 2 percent or 204,400 jobs, reaching a total of 10.3 million Texas jobs in    
November 2007. The national rate of job growth was 1.3 percent for the year. As 
the number of workers increased for the fourth consecutive year, joblessness    
dropped to its lowest rates since 2000, with a Texas unemployment rate of 4.3   
percent in November. Early in 2007, Texas' jobless rate edged below the nation's
for the first time in several years. By November, with the nation's unemployment
rate at 4.6 percent, Texas' compara-tive advantage had widened to 0.3 percent.  

As evidence of the State's relative economic health, Texas not only added 
more jobs than any other state in 2007, but added more jobs than second-place   
Florida and third-place California combined. In terms of percent change, Texas  
ranked fifth for its rate of job growth from November 2006 to November 2007 and 
was exceeded only by Utah, Wyoming, Montana and Louisiana.                      

 There were more migrants to Texas in 2006 than to any other state, with the
Census Bureau estimating that 218,745 more people moved to Texas during the year
than moved away. A relatively healthy state economy was one reason, but the     
impact of Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana was another factor contributing to the 
flow of migrants. According to Census Bureau estimates, Texas accounted for more
than 15 percent of the nation's total population growth between 2000-07, again  
more than doubling the increase of California and Florida combined.             

Despite the positive nature of these statistics, overall state economic   
growth registered no more than average in 2007. The underlying story is that the
national economy slowed significantly in 2007 while the Texas economy slowed    
much less. The State's gross domestic product rose 6.4 percent in 2007, for an  
inflation-adjusted increase of 3.3 percent. This matched the average annual     
growth rate over the past decade in Texas. Among industries, the fastest growth 
was in the oil and gas industry and the smallest increase was in government and 
"other services." Unlike in much of the nation, construction and real estate    
activity still contributed to Texas' growth in 2007, although at a slower pace. 
Gross state product in Texas reached $1.1 trillion dollars in 2007.             

What really changed in 2007 was the nature of the State's economic growth.
While much of the job growth in 2006 had been spurred by the healthy            
construction and energy sectors, mortgage lending and single-family housing     
starts followed national trends and withered considerably in 2007, causing a    
shift in construction toward multi-family projects and roads. Oil prices in 2007
stabilized somewhat after a three-year run-up but still fueled job opportunities
in the State's energy-driven businesses. Although higher fuel prices have       
negative effects on consumers, they still have a modestly positive effect on the
State's overall economy, because the oil and natural gas industry provides Texas
with a large number of relatively high paying jobs from drilling and marketing  
operations around the world.                                                    

 In 2006, goods-producing industries in Texas grew at a faster rate than the
service-providing industries, but in 2007, the more typical pattern returned and
service-providing industries grew at a faster pace. Natural resources and       
mining, which was up 8 percent, was still the State's fastest growing industry  
during the year, while construction, up 2.4 percent, slowed down compared to    
last year. Manufacturing, down 1.2 percent, lost jobs after three years of job  
increases. With increased oil and gas rig production, the State's manufacturing 
industry was spurred in 2007 by hiring in machinery and fabricated metal        
manufacturing, but losses in computers and electronics fabrication overshadowed 
these gains.                                                                    

 With outsourcing and productivity gains, losses in manufacturing employment
would have been even greater had it not been for another year of strong export  
growth. The U.S. dollar continued to weaken during the year, making exports a   
bargain overseas. Texas has been the nation's largest exporting state since 2002
and during the first 10 months of 2007, the State's exports to other countries  
totaled $138.9 billion, up 11.6 percent from the first 10 months of 2006. Texas 
exports have increased 77 percent over the last five years and now account for  
15 percent of the State's gross product. Texas currently accounts for more than 
one-seventh of total U.S. exports, based on export data from the World Institute
of Social and Economic Research (WISER).                                        

 Current Economic Information. After posting extraordinary gains in 2005-06,
consumer confidence in the West South Central States began edging back in the   
latter half of 2007, but it remained at a healthy level, 22 points above its    
1985 baseline in December 2007. Since it is a major factor driving housing and  
other major purchases, consumer confidence is a key indicator to economic       
health.                                                                         

High energy prices, although a draw on much of the economy, still have a  
small positive effect on the State's total gross state product as long as they  
remain sufficiently high to stimulate domestic and international drilling. The  
number of operating oil and gas rigs has increased 189 percent since dropping to
306 rigs in 2002, including a 13 percent gain over the past year. With an       
average of 884 drilling rigs in operation at the end of the year, 2007 was the  
State's most active year for oil and gas exploration since 1984.                

   The single-family housing market, following national trends, is the weak link
in the economy today. Although the problem is far less pronounced in Texas,     
single-family housing permits fell by 27.9 percent in Texas during the first 11 
months of 2007, compared to the same period of 2006. Steep declines in the      
housing arena have the potential to upset the national economy, which would     
certainly be felt in Texas. With several years of consumer spending fueled by   
mortgage equity withdrawals and home equity loans, consumer spending has        
outstripped income growth. There will be a substantial pull on wholesale and    
retail sales activity when this pattern stops.                                  

  On the bright side of the Texas housing market, multi-family housing permits
for projects with five or more units increased 14.4 percent during the first 11 
months of 2007. Texas home prices rose 5.2 percent over the past year, keeping  
up a trend of increases since 2001. Even with steep declines in prices in much  
of the nation, Texas continues to have some of the most undervalued residential 
real estate in the country, relative to household income, as calculated by      
Global Insight, Inc. The average price of a Texas house stood at $189,800 in the
fall of 2007, according to a moving average of monthly data from the Texas A&M  
Real Estate Center. Although prices have remained firm, sales of existing homes 
in Texas during the first 11 months of 2007 fell by 5.3 percent.                

Sales tax collections in Texas, an indicator of taxable retail sales      
activity, grew by a robust 9.4 percent in calendar 2007, following a            
particularly strong 12.1 percent increase in 2006 and growth every year since   
2002. Vehicle sales tax receipts rose by 6.7 percent in 2007.                   

Texas is set to reach its sixteenth year of increases in new business     
incorporations, based on data for the first 10 months of 2007. In 2007, the     
State had a monthly average of 9,468 new incorporations, compared to the        
previous year's average of 9,227. Newly incorporated businesses are not always  
economically viable, but the growing number reflects an entrepreneurial         
willingness to invest in new ventures.                                          

At the close of calendar 2007, four of the State's 10 leading economic    
indicators pointed toward an improved state economy in the upcoming months.     
Positive signs include an increase in new business incorporations, continued    
brisk growth in retail sales, increasing stock values in Texas corporations and 
higher oil prices. In contrast, consumer confidence has begun to falter, albeit 
from a high level, housing permits are off substantially and the average        
manufacturing workweek is getting shorter. Also, the U.S. leading economic index
is tending downward. The Texas leading index reflects various possible outcomes 
for 2008, but somewhat subdued economic growth is expected to continue.         

  Texas' gross domestic product growth has outperformed U.S. growth in all but
one year since 1991. The Comptroller's econometric forecast model predicts that 
the Texas increase will again exceed forecasted U.S. growth in both 2008-09,    
advancing by 3 percent in 2008 and another 3 percent in 2009. This will exceed  
the nation's growth rate by about one percentage point in 2008 and an estimated 
tenth of a percentage point in 2009. Employment growth in Texas will be 2       
percent in 2008 and 1.9 percent in 2009, compared to a national annual average  
of 0.9 percent. The State's population growth in 2008 will stay near 1.5        
percent, with net migration contributing an estimated 38 percent of total       
growth. For 2008, the State's population will average 24.3 million.             

The price of oil remains unpredictable. Texas benefited from the impact of
high energy prices on the State's oil and gas production, manufacturing and     
services sectors over the past three years. However, if oil and natural gas     
prices continue to climb, the national economy could easily slide into          
recession. Although Texas would be somewhat insulated from a recession's        
negative effects because of its relatively heavy concentration in the oil and   
gas industry, a national recession would nonetheless be felt in Texas. The State
and national unemployment rates are likely to trend upward, with Texas averaging
about 4.8 percent unemployment for 2008-09.                                     

 While growth in the global economy and a declining dollar have boosted U.S.
export growth, there are signs the European economy is losing momentum. Although
economic growth in Asia looks solid, any slowdown in U.S. exports will be felt  
in Texas, largely because Texas is the nation's largest exporting state. The    
continued low value of the U.S. dollar will price Texas-made products and       
service more competitively overseas, allowing exports to add fuel to economic   
growth.                                                                         

Personal income growth in Texas is expected to remain healthy, although it
will slow somewhat. Job growth helped personal income, expressed in nominal     
terms, to increase by 8.2 percent annually over the past two years, but slower  
job growth and reduced corporate profits should temper this to a 5.7 percent    
annual rate for 2008-09.                                                        

 The Texas economy should outpace the U.S. economy for the same reasons that
it is outperforming the national economy today. These include continued net     
migration into the State, a Sunbelt location at the middle of the nation's most 
vibrant economic regions - the South and the West, an experienced workforce, a  
comparatively healthy housing market, a strategic geographic position for Latin 
American trade, an oil and gas industry serving as a buffer for high fuel prices
and a relatively low cost of doing business.                                    

Fiscal Matters. The State operates on a fiscal year basis, which begins on
September 1 and ends on August 31. The State's appropriation period is a        
biennium covering two fiscal years. During the 1987 session, the Legislature    
imposed uniform accounting and financial reporting procedures on all State      
agencies and provided that accounting for State agencies be in accordance with  
generally accepted accounting principles.                                       

Total assets of the State on August 31, 2007, were $197.2 billion, an     
increase of $15.6 billion. Total liabilities as of August 31, 2007, were $55.9  
billion, an increase of $2.3 billion or 4.2 percent. Net assets were affected by
a number of factors. Cash and cash equivalents grew $1.2 billion from fiscal    
year 2006, and investments increased $6.9 billion. Net capital assets increased 
$4.9 billion, from additions to the State's highway system and college and      
university construction projects. The change in total liabilities is primarily  
in non-current liabilities with a net change in note and bond debt of $2.4      
billion. The Net Asset balance was $141.2 billion in fiscal year 2007, an       
increase of $13.3 billion, or 10.4 percent. Of the State's net assets, $63.8    
billion were invested in capital assets, net of related debt, while $55.2       
billion were restricted by statute or other legal requirements, and were not    
available to finance day-to-day operations of the State. Unrestricted net assets
were $22.3 billion. The State's bonded indebtedness was $24.2 billion, which    
included new issuances of $6.4 billion in state bonds to finance new            
construction, housing, water conservation, and other projects. Approximately    
$3.2 billion in bonded debt was retired or refunded.                            

The State earned program revenues of $63.3 billion and general revenues of
$40.7 billion, for total revenues of $104 billion, an increase of $8.3 billion, 
or 8.7 percent. The major components of this increase are taxes, which were up  
by $3.1 billion, operating grants and contributions, up by $2.8 billion and     
charges for services, which increased $2.3 billion. Sales and use tax increased 
almost $1.8 billion and cigarette and tobacco taxes increased $778.7 million    
over the prior year.                                                            

   The expenses of the State were $90.5 billion, an increase of $6.9 billion, or
8.3 percent. The expense fluctuations in governmental activities are largely    
attributable to the health and human service function and education function,   
due to increased spending for urban and rural hospitals, teacher pay raises and 
high schools. In the business-type activities, college and universities expenses
were the largest increase. Other proprietary entities showed relatively stable  
activities between the prior and current years.                                 

Debt. The State of Texas issues both General Obligation Bonds and Revenue 
Bonds. Each series of revenue bonds is backed by the pledged revenue source and 
restricted funds specified in the bond resolution. Most revenue bonds are       
designed to be self-supporting from a primary revenue source related to the     
program financed.                                                               

   During fiscal 2007, Texas state agencies and universities issued $6.2 billion
in state bonds to finance new construction, housing, water conservation and     
treatment and other projects. General obligation debt accounted for $2.8 billion
of state bonds issued in fiscal 2007. This debt, which can only be authorized by
a constitutional amendment, carries the full faith and credit of the State. The 
remaining $3.6 billion is due to new issuances of revenue bonds, which are      
serviced by the revenue flows of individual entity projects. Bonds retired      
during the year were composed of $362.7 million in general obligation bonds and 
$838.6 million in revenue bonds. Also, $158.1 million in general obligation     
bonds and $1.8 billion in revenue bonds were refunded. The total outstanding    
general obligation debt of the State after new issuances, retirements and       
refundings as of Aug. 31, 2007, was $9.5 billion. This represents an increase of
$2.3 billion or 32.1 percent from fiscal 2006. An additional $3.8 billion of    
general obligation bonds have been authorized but have not been issued. Total   
revenue bonds outstanding were $14.7 billion, which is an increase of $918.4    
million or 6.7 percent from fiscal 2006. $2.2 billion of the net increase for   
general obligation bonds and $931.7 of the net increase for revenue bonds are to
finance highway projects in the State                                           

Cash Management. Funds deposited in the State Treasury are pooled for     
investment purposes. The Treasury is authorized to invest in fully              
collateralized time deposits, obligations of the United States, obligations of  
various federal credit organizations, direct security repurchase agreements,    
reverse repurchase agreements, bankers' acceptances, commercial paper, and      
contracts written by the Comptroller which are commonly known as covered call   
options.                                                                        

Texas' real gross state product growth slowed in 2007, advancing by an    
estimated 3.3 percent when adjusted for inflation. Nominal personal income      
increased by an estimated 7.9 percent. The State's total personal income still  
exceeded the growth in population and inflation, resulting in a real per capita 
personal income increase of 3.6 percent during the year.                        

Ratings. As of July 2008, all outstanding general obligation bonds of the 
State of Texas are rated AA by S&P and Aa1 by Moody's. Any explanation          
concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating    
agencies. There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of
time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.                             

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Texas issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of       
obligations issued by the State of Texas, and there is no obligation on the part
of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of default. 

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the Texas
IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of all    
adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject.        
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Texas IM-IT, the   
market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective    
issuers of such bonds acquired by the Texas IM-IT to pay interest on or         
principal of such bonds.                                                        

 The Texas IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory factors
affecting issuers of Texas municipal obligations (the "Texas Municipal          
Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain Texas      
constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and other    
matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief      
summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in Texas and is
derived from sources that are generally available to investors and are believed 
to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the accuracy or    
completeness of any of the foregoing information. It is based in part on        
information obtained from various State and local agencies in Texas or contained
in Official Statements for various Texas Municipal Obligations.                 

 Virginia Risk Factors

Economic Outlook. In fiscal year 2007, the Commonwealth of Virginia's (the
"Commonwealth") economy continued to expand, but at a slower pace than in recent
years.                                                                          

Employment. In fiscal year 2007, Virginia's nonfarm payroll increased by  
48,000 or 1.3 percent. The increase was far below the preceding two years, but  
matched the gain in 2004. The Commonwealth's growth rate in 2007 was below the  
national growth rate of 1.6 percent. In earlier years, Virginia consistently    
outperformed the nation. One must go back to fiscal year 1996 to find a pervious
case when the national growth rate was higher.                                  

Personal Income. Developments in personal income have a strong bearing on 
Common wealth government revenues since collections from the individual income  
tax and the retail sales tax are closely tied to income. In fiscal year 2007,   
Virginia personal income in current dollars grew 5.2 percent. This was below the
national rate of 6.4 percent and below the Commonwealth's rate in the three     
preceding years.                                                                

Government-wide Highlights. The Primary Government's assets exceeded its  
liabilities at June 30, 2007 by $17.8 billion. Net assets of governmental       
activities increased by $380.7 million and net assets of business-type          
activities increased by $274.6 million. Component units reported an increase in 
net assets of $3.3 billion from June 30, 2006.                                  

Fund Highlights. At the end of the fiscal year, the Commonwealth's        
governmental funds reported a combined ending fund balance of $5.56 billion, an 
increase of $209.0 million in comparison with the prior year. Of this total fund
balance, $3.76 billion represents unreserved fund balance and the remaining $1.8
billion represents amounts reserved for specific purposes, such as the Revenue  
Stabilization Fund and education. The enterprise funds reported net assets at   
June 30, 2007, of $1.1 billion, an increase of $273.2 million during the year.  

   Debt. The Commonwealth is one of only seven states in the nation with "triple
A" bond rating for general obligation debt from the three rating agencies:      
Moody's, S&P, and Fitch. These ratings reflect the Commonwealth's long-standing 
record of sound fiscal management, its diversified economic base, and low debt  
ratios.                                                                         

 The total debt of the Commonwealth, as of June 30, 2007, was $24.3 billion,
with primary government being $7.8 billion and component units being $16.5      
billion. Of the total, $7.3 billion (29.9 percent) was tax-supported debt. Debt 
is considered tax supported if Commonwealth tax revenues are used or pledged for
debt service payments. This includes all debt issued pursuant to Article X,     
Sections 9(a), 9(b) and 9(c) of the Constitution of Virginia, as well as        
selected Section 9(d) debt issues and other long-term obligations.              

Outstanding general obligation debt backed by the full faith and credit of
the Commonwealth totaled $1.3 billion as of June 30, 2007. Included is Section  
9(b) debt totaling $797.3 million for Public Facilities and $24.3 million for   
Transportation Facilities. In 2002, voters in the Commonwealth approved two     
general obligation bond referenda authorizing $1.0 billion in new capital       
projects for educational and park and recreational facilities of the            
Commonwealth. Of the amount authorized, $573.9 million has been issued as of    
June 30, 2007. Principal and interest payments on Public Facilities Section 9(b)
debt were less than one percent of total General Fund expenditures in fiscal    
year 2007.                                                                      

   The balance of general obligation debt of $490.6 million consisted of Section
9(c) bonds. Revenue-producing capital projects, primarily auxiliary enterprises 
of colleges and universities and transportation toll facilities, service these  
bond payments. Holders of Section 9(c) bonds have a legal claim to general tax  
revenues of the Commonwealth should revenues prove to be insufficient to meet   
principal and interest payments. Such claims on general tax revenue have not    
been made.                                                                      

The remaining $6.0 billion in tax-supported debt is made up of selected   
Section 9(d) bonded debt and other long-terms obligations. Included in this     
amount is $3.9 billion in transportation, Virginia Public Building Authority,   
Innovative Technology Authority, Virginia Biotechnology Research Park Authority,
and certain Virginia College Building Authority and Virginia Port Authority     
bonds. Other tax-supported long-term obligations include capital leases, certain
appropriation supported bonds, installment purchases, notes payable, pension    
liability, Virginia Public Broadcasting Board Notes, and compensated absences.  

The remaining debt of the Commonwealth, which totals $17.0 billion, is not
supported by tax revenues. The Commonwealth has no direct or indirect pledge of 
tax revenues to fund reserve deficiencies. However, in some cases, the          
Commonwealth has made a moral obligation pledge to consider funding deficiencies
in debt service reserves that may occur. At June 30, 2007, $1.1 billion, or 6.6 
percent, of debt not supported by taxes was considered moral obligation debt.   

Litigation. The Commonwealth, its officials and employees are named as    
defendants in legal proceedings which occur in the normal course of governmental
operations, some involving claims for substantial amounts. It is not possible at
the present time to estimate the ultimate outcome or liability, if any, of the  
Commonwealth with respect to these lawsuits. However, any ultimate liability    
resulting from these suits is not expected to have a material adverse effect on 
the financial condition of the Commonwealth.                                    

Risk Management. The Commonwealth maintains self-insurance programs for   
employee health, general (tort) liability, medical malpractice, workers'        
compensation, property, and automobile liability insurance. These are reported  
in the Internal Service Funds. The Commonwealth assumes the full risk for claims
filed under the employee health insurance program and the workers' compensation 
program. For the other programs, the risk assumed is limited to certain amounts 
per occurrence.                                                                 

The Commonwealth also provides employee health, errors and omissions      
liability and law enforcement professional liability insurance for local        
governmental units throughout the Commonwealth. These programs are reported in  
the Enterprise Funds.                                                           

Ratings. All outstanding general obligation bonds of the Commonwealth of  
Virginia are rated as of July 2008 AAA by S&P and Aaa by Moody's. Any           
explanation concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from   
the rating agencies. There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for   
any period of time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.               

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Virginia issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of    
obligations issued by the Commonwealth of Virginia, and there is no obligation  
on the part of the Commonwealth to make payment on such local obligations in the
event of default.                                                               

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the      
Virginia IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description  
of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject. 
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the Commonwealth and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in the Virginia IM-IT, the
market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective    
issuers of such bonds acquired by the Virginia IM-IT to pay interest on or      
principal of such bonds.                                                        

The Virginia IM-IT is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory    
factors affecting issuers of Virginia municipal obligations (the "Virginia      
Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain  
Virginia constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and 
other matters that are described. The information provided above is only a brief
summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in Virginia and
is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and are       
believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been made of the       
accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing information. It is based in    
part on information obtained from various Commonwealth and local agencies in    
Virginia or contained in Official Statements for various Virginia Municipal     
Obligations.                                                                    

West Virginia Risk Factors

 Economic Conditions and Outlook. In 2007, Expansion Management magazine and
the National Policy Research Council conducted a study which reviewed 19 million
businesses across the country. West Virginia was ranked 8th in the nation for   
business recruitment and attraction.                                            

 The State's average unemployment rate last year was 4.6 percent, the lowest
unemployment average in the State's history. The number of West Virginians      
working last year averaged 778,269, the highest number during a year ever       
recorded. Meanwhile, the size of State government has decreased for the second  
consecutive year for the first time in more than 15 years.                      

Long-term Financial Planning and Relevant Financial Policies. The State's 
employees have worked tirelessly for West Virginia. In addition, during the last
three years, the State's leaders have addressed the State's debts directly by   
putting an additional $1.7 billion toward the State's retirement systems. With  
this contribution, the State's employees and its teachers can be confident that 
the money they have earned will be there when they need it.                     

   State leadership is investing in its citizens as well by committing more than
$300 million since 2004 to install and upgrade water and sewage systems         
throughout West Virginia, with at least $77 million worth of additional projects
set to begin in 2008. This is bringing clean drinking water and safe sewage     
systems to many West Virginia communities. These proactive initiatives are being
done while continuing to reduce costs to citizens and businesses alike. West    
Virginia consumers have benefited from more than $80 million worth of reductions
in their insurance costs, with many more insurance companies doing business in  
West Virginia today than in recent years.                                       

Major Initiatives. It is estimated that 80 percent of West Virginia       
households now have access to broadband internet, up from 58 percent in 2004.   
Working closely with the private sector, the State's goal is to reach 100       
percent by 2010 which will allow its citizens and businesses to better compete  
in today's global economy.                                                      

  West Virginia continues to lead the way in underground coal mine safety. The
State has instituted a "rapid response" accident reporting system, hired        
additional mine inspectors, and better equipped and trained mine rescue teams.  
It is now easier for regulators to close an entire mine if a pattern of serious 
violations exist. In addition, all underground coal operations in West Virginia 
are in full compliance with the State's new emergency air pack requirements a   
full six months earlier than originally scheduled. This amounts to more than    
40,000 new self-contained, self-rescuers deployed in West Virginia mines during 
the past year.                                                                  

 West Virginia also received its first underground emergency shelter in 2007
with a total of 308 shelters scheduled to be delivered over the next several    
months to mining companies throughout the State. The deployment of wireless     
communication and tracking devices in West Virginia's mines, which has been a   
major undertaking, is now well under way. Coal company plans for these devices  
have been received and approved and the deployment of these systems into State  
mines has begun and will continue throughout 2008, meaning that all of West     
Virginia's underground coal mines should have these systems in place at least   
one year earlier than required by the federal government.                       

State leadership is taking bold steps to ensure a quality of life for its 
citizens, both present and future, that leads to retaining good jobs and        
attracting new business opportunities.                                          

Government-wide Financial Highlights. The assets of the primary government
exceeded its liabilities at the close of the fiscal year by $7.97 billion.      
Governmental activities reported 48.6 billion in net assets (a $1 billion       
increase, up 14.1% from last year), while the business-type activities reported 
a deficit of $674 million, a $397 million decrease in the deficit.              

   Fund Level Financial Highlights. At year-end, the governmental funds reported
a combined ending fund balance of $3.48 billion, an increase of $730 million, or
26.5%, in comparison with the prior year. The unreserved fund balance for the   
general fund was $698 million, or 9%, of total general fund expenditures.       
General Revenue surpluses allowed $53 million to be transferred to the Revenue  
Shortfall Reserve Fund (Rainy Day Fund).                                        

Long-Term Debt. At year-end, the State had $7.6 billion in bonds, capital 
leases, notes payable, claims and judgments, compensated absences, pension      
obligations, and other long-term obligations outstanding.                       

The State's general obligation debt must be authorized by constitutional  
amendment. A proposed amendment must be approved by two-thirds of both the      
Senate and House of Delegates before it can be ratified or rejected by the      
voters. Once the amendment has voter approval, the Legislature must pass        
specific legislation authorizing the issuance of the general obligation debt.   
Revenue bonds are issued pursuant to specific statutory provisions enacted by   
the Legislature primarily for the purpose of financing capital construction.    
Neither the West Virginia Constitution nor its statutes establish a general     
limit on any type of debt, although certain agencies have debt limits in their  
specific Code sections.                                                         

Ratings. As of July 2008, all outstanding general obligation bonds of the 
State of West Virginia are rated AA- by S&P and Aa3 by Moody's. Any explanation 
concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating    
agencies. There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period of
time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.                             

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local West Virginia issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness  
of obligations issued by the State of West Virginia, and there is no obligation 
on the part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event 
of default.                                                                     

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in the West 
Virginia IM-IT and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description  
of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject. 
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental

interest on or principal of such bonds.

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

Build America Bonds Income Trust (BABS0037)
	
		





Objective
		  	
		
		Build America Bonds are new taxable municipal bonds created from the $787 billion stimulus package passed in 2009 by Congress. The purpose of the bonds is to build and repair America's roads, bridges, transit and rail systems, schools, ports and inland waterways, and other infrastructure, while stimulating the U.S. economy and job growth. Van Kampen Unit Trusts provide investors with convenient access to a diversified portfolio of taxable municipal bonds with a low minimum investment, consistent monthly income, daily liquidity and transparency.




Investment objective The trust seeks to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital. The trust invests in a portfolio of long-term taxable municipal bonds, primarily consisting of "Build America Bonds". As of the date of deposit, the trust will invest at least 80% of its assets in Build America Bonds, and may include other taxable municipal bonds for purposes of diversification.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.

1The S&P and Moody's ratings apply to the bonds held by the trust, and not the trust itself.   A Standard & Poor's credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.  Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of the issues and issues in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues.

Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit.
