2. On February 25, 2015, each of the Ray Dolby 2011 Trust A and the Ray Dolby 2011 Trust B transferred shares of Class B Common Stock to the Marital Trust (each such trust as defined below).

Dolby, son of Dagmar Dolby, as Special Trustee of the Marital Trust. Such shares were transferred to the Marital Trust by another trust of which Dagmar Dolby and David E. Dolby serve as the Trustee and Special Trustee, respectively, and such transfer was made for tax and estate planning purposes and no reporting person received any funds or other consideration in exchange for such transfer.

Alex and Daves wedding was supposed to be the happiest day of their lives, for them and their long-time friends… until Alex left groom-to-be Dave at the altar. The breakup, in the words of one pal, was a huge game changer that complicated everyones lives and made everyone question their own choices. Alex and Dave were the glue that kept their urban family together: Alexs sister, Jane, a suburban housewife, and her buttoned-up husband, Brad; Max, their perpetually underemployed gay friend; and Penny, who worries about never finding the right guy. A year later, this gang is still friends, although Alex and Dave are trying to figure out just where their relationship stands. Penny is convinced that 2011 will be The Year of Penny, and she starts things off by buying her dream condo. Shell also be getting a new roommate when Alex moves in.

You cant get manlier than Mike Baxter. Of course, he drives a pick-up truck and before being grounded from his companys international photo shoots, Mike remembers the exciting adventures he had while traveling for work. He is the marketing director for The Outdoor Man, an iconic outdoor sporting goods store. He works there with his long-time boss and friend, Ed, and the somewhat sensitive Kyle, who considers Mike his mentor. When Ed put Mike in charge of the companys webpage, Mike discovered that the Internet provides him with just the outlet he needs. He looks at it as a platform that gives him a voice to appeal to those who agree that manliness is under assault, and a pulpit for his opinions about feeling like the last real man in a womans world. While Mike is king of the hill at work, hes the odd man out in a home that is dominated by women — his wife, Vanessa, a geologist, and their three daughters: 14-year-old tomboy Eve, the outspoken Mandy, 18, and Kristin, a 21-year-old single mom living at home with her toddler son, Boyd, possibly Mikes only ally. Last Man Standing stars Tim Allen as Mike, Nancy Travis, as Vanessa, Kaitlyn Dever as Eve, Molly Ephraim as Mandy, Alexandra Krosney as Kristin, Christoph Sanders as Kyle and Hector Elizondo as Ed.

Her work lifes no easier as she struggles day to day as the least successful sales woman at the towns only surviving car dealer. Frankies unflappable husband, Mike, is manager at the local quarry and her sardonic partner in the daily grind that is raising their average  yes, most definitely average  family.Between juggling shifts and picking up fast food dinners eaten in front of the TV, Frankie and Mike raise their kids with love, humor and solid Midwestern practicality. Axl, the oldest, is a jock slacker who eats them out of house and home and walks around the house in his underwear. Then theres Sue, their extraordinarily ordinary teen daughter, who fails at just about everything she tries with great gusto. This year she entered high school and continues to not only navigate the raging waters of school life but co-exist with Axl, who is not too thrilled with his little sister being at the same school. And last is Brick, their quirky fourth-grader, who reads constantly, whispers to himself and unapologetically marches to the beat of his own drummer. But through all the madness shines a loving family, and together, the Hecks are putting THE MIDDLE on the map.The Middle stars Patricia Heaton as Frankie, Neil Flynn as Mike, Charlie McDermott as Axl, Eden Sher as Sue and Atticus Shaffer as Brick.The Middle was created and is executive produced by Eileen Heisler and DeAnn Heline.
