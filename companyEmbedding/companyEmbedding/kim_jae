작사: 김재중 / 작곡: 김재중 / 편곡: 권빈기 
05. All Alone 
작사: 김재중 / 작곡: 김재중, 김세진 / 편곡: 김세진


JYJ에서 감성적인 섬세한
보컬리스트로 사랑 받는 김재중의
첫 솔로 미니 앨범 “I”

이미 JYJ의 정규 앨범과 자신이 출연한 드라마와 영화의 곡 작업등으로 싱어송 라이터로서 실력을 인정받은 김재중의 공동 프로듀싱 !!

김재중이 생각한 락 장르를 앨범에 담기 위해 그룹 시나위 출신의 보컬 김바다와 콜라보레이션 작업을 통해 락의 
정통성을 이어나가면서 글램하면서도 폭발적인 가창력을 지닌 김재중만이 할 수 있는 곡들을 탄생 시켰다. 
데뷔 10년을 맞아 자신이 가수로, 배우로 활동하면서 느낀 모든 감정과 하고 싶었던 이야기들을 김재중이 직접 모든 곡의 가사에 담았다. 또한 자신의 삶과 음악에 대해 진솔한 고백을 이야기 했다. 한마디로 이 앨범은 음반을 넘어선 ‘작품’이라 할 수 있겠다.


01. One Kiss (작사-김재중/작곡-김바다/편곡-숀)  
“One Kiss”는 하늘을 나르는 듯한 신디사이저에 과감하지만 섬세한 드럼의 연주, 크런치한 기타, 퍼지한 베이스의 록 적인 요소와 김재중만의 허스키한 고음 보이스가 어우러진 곡이다. 강렬한 사운드와 상반되는 가사에서는 슬프지만 누구나 간직하고 있는 아련한 기억을 자극하며 오래도록 여운을 남긴다.

02. Mine (작사-김재중/작곡-김바다,숀/편곡-김바다,숀)
미니앨범의 타이틀곡인 "Mine"은 김재중의 폭발적인 가창력과 탁월한 감성 표현이 녹아 든 곡으로 김바다의 편곡 어프로치가 빛나는 곡이다. 웅장하지만 크리스탈한 기타 사운드가 곡의 중심을 잡고 있고 터널을 질주하는 듯한 신디사이저의 질감이 리스너들로 하여금 어디론가 달려가고 싶게 만든다. 중간 부분에서 들리는 퍼지한 베이스는 락의 중요한 요소인 패션어블함을 더하고 있다. 

03. 내안 가득히 (작사-전해성/작곡-전해성/편곡-PJ,김진훈)
모던 락 발라드로 김재중의 감미로운 목소리로 시작되는 “내안 가득히”는 그의 감춰져 있던 섬세한 감성이 돋보이는 곡이다. 잔잔한 선율에 맞춰 사랑을 고백하는 가사에서는 소중한 것은 가까이에 있다는 메시지를 전달하며 그가 말하는 사랑, 우정, 관계에 대해 이야기 한다.

04. 나만의 위로 (작사-김재중/작곡-김재중/편곡-권빈기)
짝을 잃은 반지를 홀로 바라보며 떠나간 연인을 그리워하는 내용을 담은 김재중의 자작곡으로 감미로운 멜로디에 슬픈 가사가 감성을 더욱 자극한다. 그리움에 대한 가사 내용의 감정변화가  잔잔한 선율에서 점점 더 강렬해지는 사운드로 대비되어 진동의 폭을 넓힌다. 후반부에서는 김재중의 락보컬 매력이 발산 되어 인상적이다. 

05. All Alone (작사-김재중/작곡-김재중,김세진/편곡-김세진)
피아노 선율로 시작되는 “All Alone”은 곡 전체에 감도는 서정적인 분위기와 김재중의 애절하게 부르는 섬세한 가창력이 돋보이는 곡이다. 포근하면서도 따뜻한 멜로디에 마음 한 구석에 자리잡고 있는 여린 기억을 끄집어 내는 가사는 아름다우면서도 슬픈 감성을 자극한다. 눈을 감고 들으면 누구나 가장 슬프고도 아름다운 추억의 한 장면이 떠오를 것이다.

Customer Review Rated Bad 10 -  10 out of 10


  				

  
  I bought this as soon as it came out, but thought of reviewing only now...

  

  A great album, one of my favourites.

  
  Even though it's a mini album, and has less tracks then a full album, I don't feel it's short or lacks anything, since all the tracks are great.

  
  The photobook is beautiful too, and that's surely an added value.

  
  Jaejoong never disappoints me. Great music, amazing photo, perfect album!!

Customer Review Rated Bad 10 -  10 out of 10


  				

  
  I preordered this album once I saw his music video "Mine". Trust me, this album is truly great. All the songs feel personal-as all but 1 have been written by Jaejoong himself. This is one of the few albums where I am not skipping some songs because all the songs are beautiful.

			Published:

June 15th, 2017




Produce 101’s Kim Jae Hwan has come under fire in a series of online posts claiming he was a bully.






The post accused Kim Jae Hwan of bullying the anonymous author back in middle school.







A message between the alleged victim and a teacher was uploaded as evidence.
“Do you remember a student named Kim Jae Hwan? And did you hear that he’s appearing on the debut survival show called Produce 101? It’s a story related to him. As you well know, I was harassed by couple of students back in middle school ㅠㅠ Kim Jae Hwan was one of the kids who bullied me. He used to curse at me and say hurtful things… I think not many students knew about it… There were also other students who were victims like me. When I meet up with my childhood friends, we always wonder how he got to have such image. I don’t understand how he got to have such a great image, and why someone with such a great image now would have bullied me back then. I’m so angry…”
— Alleged Victim







A photo of the alleged victim’s phone log was uploaded as further evidence.
“I even cried while calling a hot line a few days ago ㅠㅠ I don’t know how I’ll be able to find stability through this.”
— Alleged Victim







When the images became a hot topic online, many of Jae Hwan’s friends stood up to defend his honor.
“That’s all a lie. He was kind. He was never the one to stick out. The only time he would was when the school festival MC would ask him to dance. He didn’t even come to school often, because of his training.”
“Middle school students often curse casually, but I’ve never seen Jae Hwan curse. He was always respectful, fun, and treated his fellow classmates well.”
— Anonymous Friends






These friends uploaded photos of their yearbook to verify that they were indeed his classmates.

Shin Dong Hyuk, a fellow contestant and friend from Voice War: God’s Voice, even announced that he will be suing the attacker.
“When I asked him if he ever bullied anyone or went to bars with friends, he assured me that I had nothing to worry about…. I will be collecting evidences to sue the accuser after talking with legal representatives.”
— Shin Dong Hyuk







Whether true or false, it seems the alleged rumors will be resolved quickly.

YesAsia Editorial Description


		Following his rocking solo debut in the beginning of the year, Kim Jae Joong is now releasing his first full-length solo album WWW, short for Who, When, Why. Taking on post grunge, Brit-pop, neo-punk, new metal, free fork, emo and more, Jae Joong penned most of the album's lyrics and composed several of the songs including "So It Was" and 9+1#. The advance track "Sunny Day," a beautiful ballad featuring Noel's Lee Sang Gon, is only the beginning of the album's great collaborations. BEAST's Jun Hyung features on Don't Walk Away while Ha Dong Kyun features on Luvholic. Jae Joong worked with legendary J-rock band Glay's Takuro for the song Modern Beat, and Korea's own rock legend Yoon Do Hyun wrote and composed Now Is Good.

김재중 그가 돌아온다. 
10월 29일 솔로 첫 정규 앨범 [ WWW :: Who, When, Why ] 으로 컴백.
지난 1월 솔로 미니 앨범 [ I ] 를 통해 처음 Rock 이라는 장르에 도전한 김재중.
솔로 미니 앨범 [ I ] 의 선공개곡 '원키스(One Kiss)' 9개국 아이튠즈 Rock차트 1위 석권.!!
김재중은 솔로 미니앨범 [ I ] 와 리패키지 앨범 [ Y ] 으로 총 20 여 만장의 판매고를 기록하며  뜨거운 반응과 평단의 호평을 받으며 이미지 변신에 대성공을 이룬다.  그리고  NOW !! 김재중은 변하지 않았다.  김재중은 진화했다.

이번 첫 정규 솔로 앨범 [ WWW :: Who, When, Why ] 에서 다양한 Rock을 기반으로 김재중은 자신의 음악적 재능의 화염을 마음껏 뿜어내었다.
깔끔한 멜로디 라인의 팝적인 사운드를 기반으로  Post Grunge,  Brit Pop, 
Neo Punk,  J-Rock,  New Metal,  Free Fork,  Emocore ,  Ballad등 다양한 
스타일로  자신의 위엄을 마음껏 휘발한 김재중의 이번 앨범은 국내외 유명
아티스트들의 참여 또한 매우 인상적이다.
일본의 전설적인 밴드 GLAY의 타쿠로 와 한국 Rock의 자존심 윤도현.
블랙스트릿 앨범 참여 경력의 작곡가 D . Brown. 강력한 코어밴드 피아의 드럼, 베이스 맴버 혜승,기범 그리고 하동균, 노을 이상곤, 비스트 용준형의  보이스도 더해저  한층 기대감을 더한다. 또한 김재중은 13곡의 수록곡 중 10곡의 작사에 참여하며 사랑이라는 공통된 주제 아래 자신이 가진 생각을 고스란히 전하며 그만의 섬세함과 깊은 감정과 감성으로 한편의 영화 같은 앨범을 완성 시켰다.

한편 이번 앨범 수록곡중 15일 선공개한 발라드 은 국내 음원 
차트는 물론 일본, 대만, 태국, 홍콩 4개국 아이튠즈 차트 1위를 차지하며 공개 
직후 뜨거운 사랑을 받고 있으며 다음주23일 공개 예정인 수록곡 버터플라이(Butterfly)' 추가 선공개에 벌써부터 많은 관심이 집중되고 있다.  

김재중의 다양한 보이스로 전하는 사랑 이야기.

Awesome



Customer Review Rated Bad 10 -  10 out of 10


  				

  
  I just got it few months ago and decided to share my view here. If you've been a fan of Jaejoong for years, this is a must-have album. He has grown so much. Most of the songs are written by him and i can proudly say that every song is worth listening to. His singing just gets more matured and his rock style is simply state of an art. Buying this album is definitely worthwhile ;)

love this!



Customer Review Rated Bad 10 -  10 out of 10


  				

  
  ok when i first got this my sister was like oh my god it's a coffin, which I laughed at lol.

  
  I did notice the packaging is quite big and oncedI'd forced the paper off neatly without ripping it, I opened the case to see the two disc and a booklet. The booklet has lyrics and awesome pics of jaejoong and the discs are obviously the album and the mv and making for another girl.

  
  talking about the casing it was very masculine which I liked about it, and the coffin shape gived it a slight rock feel. The case however didnt have a little hinge unfortunately so that loses a few brownie points.

  

  the songs on the cd I really love, and im not just saying that because its jaejoong.  I liked tracks 3, 5, 6, 8 and 12 are the best, especially 3 cause it sounds like an anime opening, and number 12 cause its in my opinion the most rock like, and I love that there are a decent amount of tracks on this album. I feel it  was worth the money.

  

  pros: album contains  jaejoong lol

  
  Track number 3 5 and 12 ^_^

  
  the case is interesting

  
  there are 15 tracks (just like old school albums ^_^)

  
  the songs are really nice, and there are differing moods

  
  Jaejoong's rock feel rocks my socks~~~

  

  cons: in my opinion the case needs a hinge of some sort, and is slightly too big, I mean its the same size as an a4 piece of paper.

  

  (^_^)v

  I just got both CD and Poster and I'm wordless. The golden case is beautiful and JaeJoong in this photobook is really awesome. The poster is not so big but not so small, anyway, if you'll buy it you won't regret it ;)
