Why Repair?
By repairing your own household appliances and electronics, you are giving them a second chance and saving them from the landfill. You'll also reduce the amount of waste, power and gas it requires to manufacture and deliver new products.


 



							Identify Your Presto Model						



							So you're trying to navigate our website to find some replacement parts for your Presto, but don’t know where to find your model number? Good thing we’re here, eh? Finding the model number on your Presto shouldn’t be hard. They usually write it on an identification sticker on the back, rear, or bottom of your appliance. If your model is older, it may be pressed or molded directly into the unit. 

Found the sticker? Now scan it for the model number. It will be a 4-7 digit number listed on this tag, likely next to the Presto logo. Examples: 0704707, 07211, 01/C13 13. 

Still not finding anything? Give us a call and one of our techs will happily help you find it. 						
 





							Presto Repairs from A to Z						

							We stock hundreds of Presto spare parts in our warehouse. So if you need an air vent for your pressure canner or a master heat control for your electric skillet, we’ve got them here. To find the parts for your specific model, find your model number on the right then use our parts breakdown to navigate your model. 

Once you’ve ordered your parts, you can use our awesome repair resources to get your questions answered, or get step-by-step instructions on even the most difficult repairs. Leave the guessing behind and use eReplacementParts.com!

						Rave Reviews					

						Hi, I just found your website and am happy to see a Utah based company in the replacement parts business. Especially for so many brands of tool parts and home appliance parts as well.					

						John K.					

						Utah, USA					


					Ain’t Nothin’ Like a FryDaddy				

					If you’ve never used a FryDaddy, let me tell you: you’re missing out. The iconic Presto deep fryer has been the gold standard since it was released in 1978. Other famous Presto products include the GranPappy, Pizzazz, PowerPop, SaladShooter, and PowerPop. Put those models to the test and we’re convinced you’ll think of them as much more than a fancy name.

NATIONAL PRESTO INDUSTRIES, INC. DIVESTS ABSORBENT PRODUCT
  BUSINESS TO DRYLOCK TECHNOLOGIES
Eau Claire, Wisconsin (January 3, 2017) -- National Presto Industries, Inc. (NYSE: NPK) announced today the sale of the assets of its absorbent product segment, Presto Absorbent Products, Inc. (“PAPI”), to Drylock Technologies, LTD. Originally formed to acquire the assets of a struggling baby diaper company in 2001, PAPI is currently a well-respected innovator and manufacturer of adult incontinent wear serving preeminent institutional and retail distributors. Drylock is a private Belgian company that manufactures and sells innovative private label diapers, feminine hygiene, and adult incontinence products in Europe. The business is family-owned by the Van Malderens, who re-entered the absorbent product business in 2011, after selling what was then the premier European absorbent product business, Ontex Group NV, a company the family had founded.
The entire transaction is valued at $71 million and includes substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of PAPI. Drylock will operate the business in Eau Claire out of the current PAPI facility and plans to make that facility its U.S. headquarters. It has entered a multi-year lease for the plant with National Presto Industries, Inc. and will offer employment to all current PAPI employees. 
    
  In describing the transaction, Maryjo Cohen, President of National Presto, stated, “We are very proud of the strides our absorbent product business has made in the last several years, but recognized that to move to the next level for full success, we needed to combine the operation with that of a major player in the industry. This sale is a win-win for all parties involved. Those parties include not only the shareholders of Presto and the owners of Drylock, but also the four other groups that are affected by this kind of transaction: our employees, our community, our customers and our suppliers. The acquisition affords Drylock an instant presence in the U.S. market with a strong customer and manufacturing base. In turn, it assures our employees of ongoing employment. The transaction provides Presto with a major tenant for its facility and secures for the Chippewa Valley an international player in the industry. In contrast to most acquisitions that typically reduce the number of competitors, the transaction actually broadens our customers’ choices by adding a significant and long-term contender to the field. Our suppliers will enjoy the opportunity to increase their customer base through the addition of a new customer complete with the best introduction possible – their proven track records as PAPI suppliers.”
Houlihan Lokey served as the exclusive financial advisor to Presto. It also assisted in structuring and negotiating the transaction on Presto’s behalf. 
Following the transaction, National Presto Industries, Inc. operates in two business segments. The Housewares/Small Appliance segment designs and sells small household appliances and pressure cookers under the PRESTO® brand name and is recognized as an innovator of new products. The Defense segment manufactures a variety of products, including medium caliber training and tactical ammunition, energetic ordnance items, fuzes, cartridge cases, less-lethal munitions, and less-lethal accessory equipment.
This release contains “forward looking statements” made pursuant to the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions, that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results and those presently anticipated or projected. In addition to the factors discussed above, other important risk factors are delineated in the Company’s various SEC filings.

        Houlihan Lokey served as the exclusive financial advisor to Presto. It also assisted in structuring and negotiating the transaction on Presto's behalf.
      

        Following the transaction, National Presto Industries, Inc. operates in two business segments. The Housewares/Small Appliance segment designs and sells small household appliances and pressure cookers under the PRESTO® brand name and is recognized as an innovator of new products. The Defense segment manufactures a variety of products, including medium caliber training and tactical ammunition, energetic ordnance items, fuzes, cartridge cases, less-lethal munitions, and less-lethal accessory equipment.

National Presto Industries is a company founded in 1905 in Eau Claire, Wisconsin[2] in the small kitchen appliances industry. Originally called the "Northwestern Steel and Iron Works" and then becoming the "National Pressure Cooker Company" in 1917, the company produced pressure canners. Beginning in 1939, National Presto Industries introduced small home-use cooking appliances. The company was admitted to the New York Stock Exchange on March 3, 1969.
The company is divided into three business segments (divisions), Housewares/Small Appliance; Defense; and Absorbent Products.[3] The Housewares/Small Appliance segment "designs and sells small household appliances", including pressure cookers, under the Presto brand.[3] The Defense segment produces ordnance and ammunition products.[3] The Absorbent Products segment "is primarily engaged in the manufacture of private label adult incontinence products."[3]
Having previously divested itself of almost all operations and having closed its defense operations in 1992, the company was a small household appliance seller.[4] In 2001, with the purchase of AMTEC, the company returned to the defense business.[4] In Nov 2005, Presto lost fight with SEC over investment status. A Federal Court judge ruled that Presto was an "inadvertent" investment company because of its huge cash holdings.[5] During the first three quarters of 2009, National Presto obtained more than $650,000,000 in contracts with the U.S. government for ammunition. Also in 2001, the company acquired RMED International and created its Absorbent Products division.[4]

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death associated with the use of
          thousands of types of consumer products under the agency’s jurisdiction. Deaths, injuries, and property damage from consumer product incidents cost the
          nation more than $1 trillion annually. CPSC is committed to protecting consumers and families from products that pose a fire, electrical, chemical or
          mechanical hazard. CPSC's work to help ensure the safety of consumer products - such as toys, cribs, power tools, cigarette lighters and household
          chemicals -– contributed to a decline in the rate of deaths and injuries associated with consumer products over the past 40 years.
Federal law bars any person from selling products subject to a publicly-announced voluntary recall by a manufacturer or a mandatory recall ordered by the
          Commission.
To report a dangerous product or a product-related injury go online to www.SaferProducts.gov or call CPSC's Hotline at 800-638-2772 or teletypewriter at
          301-595-7054 for the hearing impaired. Consumers can obtain news release and recall information at www.cpsc.gov, on Twitter @USCPSC or by subscribing

Why Repair?
By repairing your own household appliances and electronics, you are giving them a second chance and saving them from the landfill. You'll also reduce the amount of waste, power and gas it requires to manufacture and deliver new products.


 



							Identify Your Presto Model						



							So you're trying to navigate our website to find some replacement parts for your Presto, but don’t know where to find your model number? Good thing we’re here, eh? Finding the model number on your Presto shouldn’t be hard. They usually write it on an identification sticker on the back, rear, or bottom of your appliance. If your model is older, it may be pressed or molded directly into the unit. 

Found the sticker? Now scan it for the model number. It will be a 4-7 digit number listed on this tag, likely next to the Presto logo. Examples: 0704707, 07211, 01/C13 13. 

Still not finding anything? Give us a call and one of our techs will happily help you find it. 						
 





							Presto Repairs from A to Z						

							We stock hundreds of Presto spare parts in our warehouse. So if you need an air vent for your pressure canner or a master heat control for your electric skillet, we’ve got them here. To find the parts for your specific model, find your model number on the right then use our parts breakdown to navigate your model. 

Once you’ve ordered your parts, you can use our awesome repair resources to get your questions answered, or get step-by-step instructions on even the most difficult repairs. Leave the guessing behind and use eReplacementParts.com!

						Rave Reviews					

						Hi, I just found your website and am happy to see a Utah based company in the replacement parts business. Especially for so many brands of tool parts and home appliance parts as well.					

						John K.					

						Utah, USA					


					Ain’t Nothin’ Like a FryDaddy				

					If you’ve never used a FryDaddy, let me tell you: you’re missing out. The iconic Presto deep fryer has been the gold standard since it was released in 1978. Other famous Presto products include the GranPappy, Pizzazz, PowerPop, SaladShooter, and PowerPop. Put those models to the test and we’re convinced you’ll think of them as much more than a fancy name.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
