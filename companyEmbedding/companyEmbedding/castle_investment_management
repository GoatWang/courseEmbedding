Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics

Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank.

We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.

Our goal is to compound shareholder capital over a full market cycle by participating sensibly when markets move up and losing less when markets pull back.

OUR INVESTMENT PRINCIPLES

Buy at a Discount Our proprietary investment research seeks to determine the appraised value of a company. Investments are then ideally made at a significant discount to our conservative estimate of the company’s current intrinsic value.

Emphasis on Risk Defining risk as the permanent loss of capital, we believe that the quality of investment decisions is far more important than the quantity of investment decisions.

Willingness to Hold Cash Patience is necessary in the absence of obvious bargains, as entry price is a significant determinant of return.


WE ARE VALUE INVESTORS

Castle Investment Management is a SEC Registered Investment Adviser based in Alexandria, Virginia. Castle manages one investment strategy — the Castle Focus Fund (MOATX).
We believe that an experienced value manager who adheres to a disciplined and conservative approach to investing gives clients the best chance to compound capital over a full market cycle.
We are an independent firm that is managed by its owners.

About the Advisor

Castle Investment Management is a SEC registered investment adviser based in Alexandria, Virginia. We are the Advisor to the Castle Focus Fund (MOATX).
We identify institutional managers with an absolute return mindset and deliver their investment strategies to mutual fund investors. Our manager search process resulted in the selection of St. James Investment Company as sub-advisor to the Castle Focus Fund.
We seek managers with the following attributes
Independent Thinkers
We prefer patient managers who do their own fundamental research and ignore the noise generated by Wall Street, market pundits, and CNBC.  We seek managers who are willing to diverge from the crowd and run portfolios that may be substantially different than their assigned benchmark or index.  As we believe in active over passive investment management, we seek out experienced portfolio managers whom we believe can outperform the S&P 500 over a full market cycle.
Highly Experienced
We partner with experienced managers who have successfully navigated a variety of markets. An important consideration in our process is an assessment of the manager’s track record during periods of extreme market volatility.
Long-Term Approach
We seek managers who have quietly built a strong institutional track record.

Management
Caeli Andrews and Andrew Welle founded Castle Investment Management and handle the day-to-day management of the firm and its mutual fund, the Castle Focus Fund.
Caeli Andrews

Caeli earned a BS in Management from Keene State College.

Investment Process

We look for good businesses, good people, and an attractive entry price. We seek to achieve superior long-term performance. As we are value investors, we attempt to acquire equity securities of financially strong, well-managed companies at market prices significantly below our assessment of their business value. We sell stocks when they approach our appraisal value.

 
Equities purchased at prices substantially less than their intrinsic worth may protect capital from significant permanent loss and may also appreciate substantially once the market recognizes the company’s economic value.
A company’s market price must trade at a discount to intrinsic value to be considered for inclusion in the Fund.  We determine intrinsic value by studying financial statements, speaking with corporate management, analyzing regulatory information, reading trade publications, as well as other industry and corporate journals.
We may assess the company’s liquidation value based on the current economic worth of assets and liabilities or we may determine the company’s ongoing value based on its ability to generate free cash flow after required capital expenditures and working capital needs. We calculate the present value of the projected free cash flows plus a terminal value, using a conservative discount rate. Our analysis should represent the price that rational, independent buyers and sellers would negotiate in a private transaction.

Castle Asset Management believes that the best investment is in oneself. 



























BARRY JAMES DYKE, President & Founder of Castle Asset Management, LLC entered the financial services business in 1982 with Prudential after working with RCA Global Communications and high tech industries. At Prudential, he was one of the rookies of the year.  Soon after he then became an independent agent with New England Life, founded a pension consulting business in 1986 called Chestnut Green Benefit that excelled in the design, installation and funding of both qualified and non-qualified retirement plans. He has also designed, communicated and administered numerous health and welfare plans, and in 1990 set up the first self funded PPO plan for a Fortune 100 company for a major Boston HMO.  Dyke also founded an administration firm in 1991, The Merrimac Benefit Group, Inc.  Which specialized in flexible benefit and defined contribution health and welfare plans under Sections 125 and 105 of the Internal Revenue Code. 

He has also written about financial planning and retirement plan issues in national publications such as Pensions & Investment Age and Broker World, and in self-published newsletters. Dyke is currently working on a book that addresses the inherent problems of investing in the stock market, how deregulation and the central banking system have created the �Casino Age� which shifts additional risk onto consumers.
As one of the leading agents in his field, he has worked with numerous closely held businesses, high net worth individuals and major public corporations. In 2000, Dyke founded another corporation, Castle Asset Management, LLC that is a Registered Investment Advisor. Today, he spends the majority of his time in macroeconomic financial planning for his clients to help them maximize their opportunities, expose them to the severely damaging pitfalls of traditional �accumulation theory financial planning� most often promoted by major financial institutions, their agents and the media.  He also assists clients in setting up their own finance companies. An ardent student in Austrian economics, Dyke defends the market economy, private property and sound money. He celebrates the freedom and productive power of capitalism, and views government intervention as socially and economically destructive.

Your Family Business, Your Family Net Worth

You have spent a lifetime building and safeguarding your business. Now it's
time to retire. If you are like most business owners, you have more
questions than answers. "What is my business really worth?" "Can I afford to
retire?" "How can I safeguard my net worth and protect my family?" "How can
I reduce taxes on the sale?" "Should I keep the business in the family, or
sell it to someone else?" And the biggest question of all: "How do I get
started?" Gary Pittsford, owner of Castle3, has answered these tough questions for business
owners time and time again...

A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.

Checklist: 9 Questions Every Advisor Should Be Able to Answer 




Whatever your priorities, this can help you find someone who understands you and has the resources to help you manage your financial life 











AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER, WE ALL face major turning points in our lives—getting married, becoming a parent, receiving a life-changing promotion, getting ready to retire. At times like these, many people feel a need for financial help, and start to wonder whether working with a financial advisor might make sense. That's when the search begins.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future. Someone who'll be there for you for years to come, and who can provide more than just stock recommendations.
To find an advisor who can help you with those decisions, don't be afraid to ask the following tough questions—they'll help you get a clear idea of what you can expect from the relationship and whether it makes sense for you.
1. What types of clients do you work with?
Some advisors have special experience working with business owners or members of a specific profession. Others might have particular knowledge in a specialty, such as sustainable investing or retirement planning. Ask what team members or resources from around their company they can call upon to help you meet your specific needs.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future.
2. What is your track record?
No advisor can or should promise financial results based on past performance. And beware those who do. But an advisor with a record of long relationships with clients likely provides the kind of service that earns their loyalty.
3. How often will we talk?
An advisor should be committed to conversations in person, by phone, or online—whatever your preference is—as often as you require. Every client has different needs and expectations. Be upfront with the advisor about how frequently and by what means you would like to get together to discuss your finances.
4. How realistic are my goals?
Even if you have a strong idea of what you want to accomplish with your money, the right advisor can help you better understand and prioritize your goals, including making any necessary tradeoffs based on your finances, timelines and investing preferences.

Watch the webcast



5. How will we keep my strategy on course?
Even the best strategy will need adjusting as financial markets and your goals change. An advisor should have a plan for regular reviews and the ability to correct as market conditions and your priorities shift.
6. What happens if the markets are volatile? Will you call me?
When markets get scary, there's nothing worse than feeling isolated and alone. One of an advisor's most vital functions is to reach out at such times, hear your concerns, offer perspective, and talk about any needed adjustments to your strategy.
7. What if I'm upset about a service issue or an investment?
As life becomes increasingly automated, there's nothing like a human voice and quick response when you're concerned about a financial matter. Advisors who define their success by your success will be eager to quickly resolve any such issues.
8. Who will I actually be working with?
Many advisors have teams of professionals to enhance the services they provide. Ask who you'd be working with on a regular basis and their level of experience. Beyond the immediate team, does the company supporting them have access to a broad array of financial insights and resources?
9. How do I pay you for your work?
It's never easy to ask, but the right advisors will welcome this question. Clarity about fees is vital to a successful relationship. Payment—whether a percentage of assets or per transaction—should be structured around your needs and preferences.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
