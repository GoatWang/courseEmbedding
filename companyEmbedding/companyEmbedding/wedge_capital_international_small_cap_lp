Quantitative Equity - Our Strategies - WEDGE Capital Management

Our Firm
Our People
Our Strategies
Our Clients



Our Strategies Our Quantitative Equity strategies are based on our long history of value investing, our foundation of fundamental research, and our belief in the effectiveness of quantitative tools. 






Quantitative Equity
Utilizing fundamental characteristics, our Quantitative Equity platform employs robust models that systematically combine value, contrarian and momentum factors to identify undervalued stocks. Our research has proven that the factor categories that determine stock price performance often vary across economic sectors and capitalization ranges. By using unique combinations of numerous factors, our sector-specific models allow us to efficiently and unemotionally analyze the designated universe of stocks. This process generates objectively determined buy and sell decisions.
QVM® Process




QVM® Large Cap
Launched in 1994, this strategy focuses on the 1000 largest companies that are available for purchase on U.S. stock exchanges. Utilizing 8 separate WEDGE-defined sectors, this portfolio applies a model-driven systematic approach to large cap value investing.

                            WEDGE QVM Large Cap 2Q17 Fact Sheet                        


QVM® Small Mid Cap
This strategy is based on our long history of quantitative equity investing in QVM - Large Cap and focuses on the 501st to 2500th largest companies traded on U.S. stock exchanges.  Utilizing 10 separate WEDGE-defined sectors, this portfolio applies a model-driven systematic approach to small-mid cap value investing.

Micro Cap Value
Combining elements of our traditional equity strategies with our quantitative tools, this portfolio concentrates on companies with market capitalizations between $50 million and $500 million. Once a stock reaches twice the upper market cap limit, or $1 billion, it will be sold from the portfolio.

                            WEDGE Micro Cap 2Q17 Fact Sheet                        


Enhanced Core Russell 1000
This index-driven strategy focuses on the securities within a desired benchmark (i.e. the Russell 1000 or S&P 500).  Beginning with all benchmark securities, a model-driven systematic approach is utilized to deselect those securities expected to underperform. The remaining securities are held with a sector-neutral weighting relative to the benchmark.

Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney & Strauss, LLC ("Barrow") Details

Location: Dallas, Texas

Barrow Hanley's approach to the equity markets  is based on their underlying philosophy that the inefficiencies in the market  can be exploited through adherence to a value-oriented process dedicated to the  selection of securities on a bottom-up basis. 
In fixed  income, Barrow Hanley defines value as temporarily mispriced securities with  yield-to-maturity advantages over Treasury bonds of comparable maturity. They  identify each opportunity from the bottom up, building a duration-neutral  portfolio designed to “out-yield” the market. In this way, Barrow Hanley seeks  to achieve higher total returns for their fixed-income clients with  below-benchmark volatility.

Zebra Capital Management, LLC ("Zebra") Details

Location: Milford, Connecticut
Zebra  Capital Management, LLC is an SEC registered, global, independent investment  management firm managing equity-focused investment strategies. Founded in 2001  by Roger Ibbotson, Professor Emeritus of Finance at Yale University, Zebra has  successfully combined Professor Ibbotson’s leading-edge research and scientific  methods with decades of direct trading, risk management, and operational  experience. Zebra's strategies seek to generate superior performance without  incurring additional volatility and have demonstrated attractive risk/return  characteristics. 
The  Zebra investment and research teams focus on harnessing the popularity premium  in global equity markets, using Professor Ibbotson’s original research as the  springboard. Using liquidity, valuation and growth to identify manifestations  of “popularity,” Zebra’s strategies seek to systematically invest in stocks  that are less popular but nonetheless have strong fundamental characteristics.  Zebra’s investment strategies seek to methodically capture these rewards in the  public equity markets. Zebra believes positive, long-term excess returns are  driven by systematically exploiting market characteristics supported by basic  economic principles. By seeking out fundamentally strong, but overlooked, less  demanded securities, Zebra believes it can generate consistent attractive  returns without taking on significant levels of risk. Zebra manages these  strategies in both long and long-short products. 
Zebra serves as a sub-advisor to the following funds:

Our Strategies A disciplined approach to value investing using bottom-up fundamental research. 






Traditional Equity
Our research-driven approach to value investing and portfolio construction defines our Traditional Equity platform. We first apply systematic quantitative analysis to evaluate companies and industries with favorable value and return characteristics. Approximately 35% of the stocks in each product universe make it through our two proprietary screening models and qualify for further research. Our experienced equity research teams then perform comprehensive company and industry analysis. Our multi-step recommendation process encourages constructive debate among members of the investment team. We rely on strong buy/sell disciplines to ensure adherence to our value and quality philosophy. 




Small Cap Value
Our small cap value portfolio focuses on companies with market capitalizations between $250 million and $3.5 billion. Once a stock reaches twice the upper market cap limit, or $7 billion, it will be sold from the portfolio.

International Small Cap Fund












Fund Profile


The Fund invests primarily in common stocks of companies with smaller market capitalizations located in developed and emerging markets outside the U.S. The Fund normally invests at least 80% of its total assets in equity securities of companies with smaller market capitalizations. Smaller market capitalization companies are companies with market capitalizations that do not exceed the highest market capitalization of a company within the Fund’s benchmark, the MSCI ACWI ex USA Small Cap Index (Gross), at the time of purchase. Some of these companies, although small by U.S. standards, might be large companies in their local markets. The Fund may continue to hold securities of a portfolio company that appreciate above the smaller market capitalization threshold and thus may from time to time hold less than 80% of its total assets in equity securities of companies with smaller market capitalizations. The Fund may invest in a wide range of industries.

The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth less than their original cost and current performance may be lower than the performance quoted. Returns greater than one year are average annual total returns. Total returns assume reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions at net asset value when paid. All information is as of the date shown. Investment performance reflects fee waivers in effect. In the absence of such fee waivers, total return would be reduced. Contractual fee waivers are in effect until 1/31/18. The expense ratios for Institutional Class shares are 3.45% and 1.33% after adviser fee waiver. The expense ratios for Investor Class shares are 3.71% and 1.58% after adviser fee waiver. There is a 2% redemption fee on shares held less than 60 days to protect shareholders from short-term investors. If your account incurred a redemption fee, your performance will be lower than the performance quoted. If you invest through a financial intermediary, it may apply the Fund’s redemption fee or other frequent trading restrictions.

Approach


For Causeway International Small Cap Fund, our quantitative process examines a multitude of factors within four main categories to gauge the return potential of a stock. First, we seek relatively inexpensive valuations. Second, we want to see accelerating earnings growth prospects and upward earnings estimate revisions from the sell-side analysts who cover the stock. Third, we look for positive recent momentum, since recent trends tend to persist. And fourth, we want to find quality by seeking stocks with a focus on strong free cash flow generation rather than simply sales growth. We then rank the stocks on these factors to identify candidates that we believe should produce the most attractive risk-adjusted returns. Before we establish new positions, our fundamental portfolio managers and analysts have the opportunity to review stocks in their sector of coverage and report any “red flags” that may be outside the scope of quantitative analysis. 
We take many steps to monitor and manage risk within the portfolio. We start by including in our tradable universe only the roughly 2,800 stocks that trade at least $1 million per day on average, to seek sufficient liquidity and to minimize market impact when we enter and exit positions. We intend for the portfolio to also typically contain between 120 and 200 stocks at any one time, and this breadth is intended to limit idiosyncratic risk.

Commentary



PERFORMANCE REVIEW for the month ended 30 Jun 2017
International smaller capitalization equities appreciated modestly during the month, as strong year-to-date momentum was tempered by hawkish signals from global central banks. The strongest returns within the MSCI ACWI ex USA Small Cap Index (“Index”) came from financials, materials, and industrials. Energy, utilities, and consumer staples delivered the weakest sector returns. Smaller capitalization equities performed broadly in-line with larger capitalization equities in June, with stronger performance in developed markets offsetting weaker performance in emerging markets.

Causeway International Small Cap Fund (“Fund”) outperformed the Index during the month. To evaluate stocks in our investable universe, our multi-factor quantitative model employs four broad bottom-up factor categories: valuation, earnings growth, technical indicators, and quality. Value posted the strongest returns for the month of June among our factor groups, and value remains the best-performing factor group over the calendar year-to-date period and over the past 12 months. Earnings growth factors posted slightly negative returns for June and earnings growth is the worst performing factor group over the 2017 year-to-date period (though its returns are nevertheless positive). Technical factors were positive for June, but they are the worst performing group over the past twelve months. The financial strength factor group posted positive returns in June, and financial strength remains the most consistent factor group in the last twelve months with only one month of negative returns. All factor group returns are positive over the 2017 year-to-date period, and all remain positive on an inception-to-date basis.

Fund holdings across all eleven sectors contributed to relative performance. The top contributing sectors included materials, real estate, and industrials. Holdings in the telecommunication services, utilities, and health care sectors contributed least to relative performance. June’s strong performance was primarily driven by stock selection. The largest contributor to relative performance was passenger & cargo airline company, Air France-KLM SA (France). Additional top contributors included residential property developer, Yuzhou Properties Co., Ltd. (Hong Kong), chemical & specialty materials manufacturer, Tosoh Corporation (Japan), real estate company, Macquarie Mexico Real Esatate management SA de CV (Mexico), and insurer, UNIQA Insurance Group AG (Austria). The largest detractor to relative performance was energy services company, Cape plc (United Kingdom). Additional detractors included plastics & polymers manufacturer, Korea Petro Chemical Ind. Co., Ltd. (South Korea), real estate property developer, Yanlord Land Group Limited (Singapore), real estate company, Immobiliare Grande Distribuzione SIIQ S.p.A. (Italy), and financial services provider, Societa Cattolica di Assicurazioni - Societa Cooperativa (Italy).

Investing involves risk including loss of principal. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from economic or political instability in other nations. Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and lower trading volume. Investments in smaller companies involve additional risks and typically exhibit higher volatility. Diversification does not prevent all investment losses.
To determine if a Fund is an appropriate investment for you, carefully consider the Fund's investment objectives, risk factors, charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus, which may be viewed and downloaded by clicking here or by calling 1-866-947-7000. Read it carefully before investing.
There is no guarantee that the Causeway Funds will meet their stated objectives. The Funds are available to U.S. investors only. There is a 2% redemption fee on shares held less than 60 days to protect shareholders from short-term investors. If your account incurred a redemption fee, your performance will be lower than the performance quoted. If you invest through a financial intermediary, it may apply the Fund’s redemption fee or other frequent trading restrictions.

Our Strategies A conservative approach in which market outperformance and preservation of principal build long-term investment success. 






Fixed Income
Our fixed income strategy is designed to consistently maintain an effective yield advantage versus each client’s benchmark while cautiously managing the assumption of risk. We achieve this by investing in undervalued fixed income securities and sectors, managing portfolio duration relative to a client’s benchmark, and strategically investing in different maturities given the shape of the yield curve. We are balanced in our approach, using both qualitative judgment and quantitative tools. In every case, we strive to achieve the optimum balance of risk and reward.




Core
Our Core strategies include Aggregate and Government Credit portfolios. Each of these broadly diversified portfolios focuses on dollar-denominated, high quality, investment grade fixed income securities.  Our approach emphasizes non-Treasury sectors that meet our stringent risk/reward parameters.  Maturity focus is across the yield curve.

Short Duration
Broadly diversified portfolio of dollar-denominated, high quality, investment grade bonds focusing on shorter maturities (1-5 years). Emphasis is on capital preservation in rising interest rate environments.

Intermediate
Our Intermediate strategies include Intermediate Aggregate and Intermediate Government Credit portfolios.  Each of these broadly diversified portfolios focuses on dollar-denominated, high quality, investment grade fixed income securities in intermediate maturities (1-10 years).  Our approach emphasizes non-Treasury sectors that meet our stringent risk/reward parameters
