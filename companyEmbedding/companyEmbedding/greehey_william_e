William E. (Bill) Greehey
Bill Greehey is Chairman of the Board of NuStar  Energy L.P., and NuStar GP Holdings, LLC, both of which are based in San Antonio, Texas.  NuStar Energy is a publicly traded master  limited partnership that is one of the largest independent liquids terminal and pipeline operators in the nation.   Valero GP Holdings, LLC  was formed as the general partner for Valero L.P. in 2006, and both companies  assumed the NuStar name in April 2007 as part of their separation from Valero  Energy. 

Mr. Greehey became  Chairman of NuStar Energy in 2001, when the  company was known as Valero L.P., and the  company has achieved significant growth and success since that time.  It has grown from 160 employees in 2001 to 1,600  today; from less than $400 million in assets to $5 billion; and from $100 million in revenues to $3.1 billion in 2014. 
Mr. Greehey is responsible for implementing the same culture  that made Valero such a success at NuStar.   For its commitment to its employees, NuStar most recently earned a rank of No. 18 on Fortune magazine's list of the 100 Best  Companies to Work For.  What’s more, the  company was named the No. 1 best large company to work for in Texas, and was  recognized as a top employer through local media competitions in San Antonio,  as well as in Wichita, Kansas and the Coastal Bend region of Texas. Employees showed  their commitment to their communities by completing a record United Way  campaign in 2014 with a per capita gift that was one of the best in the nation,  and volunteering a record 93,000 hours in the communities where NuStar has  operations. 
Mr.  Greehey previously served as Chairman and CEO of Valero Energy Corporation from the company’s inception in 1980 until  he retired as CEO in January 2006, and then retired as Chairman in January 2007.  Under his  leadership, Valero grew from a small, regional natural gas pipeline  company to become the largest refining company in North   America with approximately 22,000 employees, assets of $33 billion,  and revenue of more than $80 billion, which ranked the company among the top 15  on the Fortune 500 listing when he retired as Chairman. 
Bill Greehey and local government officials celebrated the groundbreaking for Haven for Hope in May 2007.
Under Mr. Greehey’s direction, Valero was consistently  ranked one of the “100 Best Companies to Work For” by Fortune magazine, rising to No. 3 in 2006, the year he  retired.  Forbes magazine ranked Valero on its listing of the  “Platinum 400-Best Big Companies” for its superior financial performance and  shareholder return in 2005 and 2004; and for two consecutive years (2005 and  2004) Platts ranked Valero No. 1 among the world's refining companies on its  Top 250 Global Energy Companies listing.  Investor’s Business Daily ranked Valero No. 3 on its “Big  Cap 20” list for being one of the top performers on the S&P 500 Index, and BusinessWeek placed it at No. 4  among the “BusinessWeek 50.”  Forbes also recognized Valero on its 2005 listings of “Best-Managed Companies in America” and “Fastest-Growing Big Companies,”  while Fortune named  Valero one of America’s  “Most Admired Companies” and the No. 1 oil and gas company among its “100  Fastest-Growing Companies.” 
For its commitment to community service, Valero received the  “Spirit of America” Award, United Way’s highest corporate honor, in 1992 and  2003, making it one of only two companies to have received the honor  twice.  It was also one of nine U.S. companies to receive the 1999 “Award  for Excellence in Corporate Community Service” from the Points of Light  Foundation; and it was ranked No. 15 out of the Fortune 500 in terms of  corporate philanthropy by the Council on Economic Priorities and Worth magazine (at the time the company  was ranked No. 259 in terms of revenue).  Also in response to the  company’s significant contributions to its communities, Mr. Greehey and Valero  were featured on the cover of Philanthropy magazine in September 2003.
Mr. Greehey established The Greehey Family Foundation in  2004, and it has already given tens-of-millions of dollars in grants to worthy  charities.  This includes a $25 million  grant to the University of Texas Health Science Center to fund research and  treatment for children’s cancer. Mr. Greehey serves as Chairman of the Board  for Haven for Hope, an innovative facility  that will provide a wide range of social services to meet the needs of San Antonio’s homeless  community in a “one-stop” setting.  
He also serves on the Board of Trustees of the United Way of San Antonio and Bexar   County and on the Board  of the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research.  In addition, he has  served on the Board of Trustees of St. Mary’s University in San Antonio, which named him a Distinguished  Alumnus in 1986, granted him an honorary doctorate of philosophy in 1998, and  named its business school in his honor in 2005.   He also gave a $25 million gift to the business school to expand the university’s recruitment of top  business students and attract internationally known business professors, and to  promote business ethics and community service among future business leaders.  It is the largest single gift in the  university’s 155-year history.  He  acted as campaign chairman of the St. Mary’s $22 million Alumni Athletics &    Convocation Center,  and subsequently, the university named its arena in his honor.  Mr. Greehey joined the National Executive  Board of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) in 1992, and has served as a member of  the BSA National Advisory Council and is past president of the Alamo Area  Council BSA.  In 1987, the Alamo Area Council presented him with the  Silver Beaver Award for his support of Scouting and his distinguished service  to youth.  And in 2001, he received the Good Scout Award, the Council’s  highest honor, which is presented to individuals whose leadership in business,  education and community service has made a difference in the community.   In addition, Mr. Greehey is past chairman of the board and past campaign  chairman of the United Way  of San Antonio and Bexar County  and past chairman of the San Antonio Economic Development Foundation. 

  In 2009, Mr. Greehey was presented with  the Outstanding Volunteer  Fundraiser Award by the Association of Fundraising Professionals.  This international award honors an individual who  demonstrates outstanding skills in coordinating and motivating groups of  volunteers for fundraising projects for the benefit of charitable  institutions.  In 2002, Mr. Greehey was inducted into the  Texas Business Hall of Fame, which honors members of the state’s business community  whose visions and careers have helped to place Texas at the forefront of the 21st century  economy.  In 2000, he was selected as one of 10 American leaders to  receive the prestigious Horatio Alger Award, which recognizes individuals who  have climbed from humble beginnings to personal and professional success, and  have achieved the “American Dream.”  Also in 2000, the American Academy  of Achievement presented Mr. Greehey with its “Golden Plate Award” and inducted  him into the Academy’s Museum of the American Dream.  Previously, he  received the 1999 International Citizen of the Year Award from San Antonio’s World Affairs Council.  In  1998, Mr. Greehey was presented with the Outstanding Philanthropist Award from  the San Antonio Chapter of the National Society of Fund Raising Executives; and  he was inducted into the San Antonio Business Hall of Fame by Junior  Achievement.  Based on his community service record, he received the 1993  Entrepreneur of the Year Award in the Socially Responsible Category.

      ■ William E. Greehey rose from humble origins to become the
      chairman and CEO of Valero Energy Corporation, one of the largest
      independent oil-refining companies in the United States. Greehey saw
      Valero through a price plunge in unleaded gas in the 1980s that threatened
      its existence; he eventually turned the debt-ridden corporation into a
      flourishing Fortune 500 company with approximately 20,000 employees and
      revenues of $38 billion. Industry analysts and colleagues described
      Greehey as a tenacious man whose ambitious vision ultimately made Valero
      into one of the most successful oil refiners in the nation.
    

      FROM SMALL TOWN TO BIG TIME
    

      Greehey grew up in the small town of Fort Dodge, Iowa, in a loving but
      relatively poor family. By the time he was 12 years old, Greehey had found
      employment in order to help support his family. Equipped with a strong
      work ethic and a dream of attaining more in life, he joined the air force
      in order to benefit from the GI bill and become the first person from his
      family—as well as his neighborhood—to go to college.
    

      After completing his tour of service, Greehey attended St. Mary's
      University in San Antonio, Texas. At the Catholic college Marianist
      brothers helped arrange for further financial aid, and Greehey also worked
      nights and weekends parking cars at a hospital. He went on to complete his
      four-year course of studies in business administration in two and a half
      years, earning numerous academic honors in the process. After graduating
      in 1960, Greehey first became a certified public accountant and worked for
      Price Waterhouse. He then joined Exxon as an auditor. In 1963 he was hired
      by Coastal State Gas Corporation, where he rose quickly through the ranks
      to become senior vice president in 1968 at the age of 32.
    

      In the early 1970s Greehey's career reached a turning point. A
      subsidiary of Coastal, LoVaca Gathering Company, found itself being sued
      by natural-gas utilities throughout Texas when it could not fulfill its
      contracts due to a short supply of natural gas. In 1973 the courts
      appointed Greehey as LoVaca's CEO and president and charged him
      with negotiating a settlement, which many industry analysts believed would
      be an impossible task. But Greehey proved them wrong and turned the
      company around by striking a $1.6 billion deal. In an article in 
      
        Philanthropy World Magazine
      
      , the former Texas governor Dolph Briscoe noted that taking over LoVaca
      would have been "too daunting a task for some people, but it never
      occurred to Greehey that he would not succeed in turning the company
      around and reaching a successful settlement" (August/September
      2003).
    

      FACES NEW CHALLENGE
    

      Greehey's turnaround of LoVaca reached a conclusion in 1980, but
      his relations with the company had not yet ended. The agreement to meet
      LoVaca's debts had necessitated the creation of a new company
      called Valero Energy Corporation. When the spin-off occurred in 1980, it
      was the largest in U.S. history. Greehey was appointed as the head of
      Valero and soon found a whole new set of challenges awaiting him.
    

      One of Greehey's early decisions was to diversify the natural-gas
      supplier into the refinement of unleaded gasoline; he
       had a hunch that the company could prosper from increasing fuel shortages
      and the industry's general lack of specialized refining capacity.
      Greehey focused on the use of residual fuel oil, a byproduct of the
      process of crude-oil refinement, to produce the desired unleaded gas. He
      made arrangements to obtain supplies from Saudi Arabian refiners, bought
      an old refinery in Corpus Christi, and spent $600 million to build a new
      refinery on the old site. In an interview with Claire Poole of 
      
        Forbes
      
      , Greehey recalled, "The headlines in San Antonio said buying the
      refinery was the biggest mistake we'd ever make" (April 13,
      1992).
    

      For a while it looked as though the analysts would be right. A yearlong
      strike by Great Britain Coal miners beginning in 1984 caused much of
      Greehey's Saudi supply of residual fuel oil to skyrocket in price
      because of the greater demand for fuel with which to fire British boilers.
      Greehey and Valero were hit again when European refiners decided to boost
      production of unleaded gasoline from residual oil and then dump stores on
      the U.S. market. As 1984 came to a close, Greehey's refinery in
      Corpus Christi was losing $250,000 a day, according to some industry
      analysts. The company's stock dropped from around $20 per share in
      1983 to just $5.88 per share in 1984.
    

      Greehey avoided panicking and was determined to see Valero through the
      tough times. He sold off the company's west Texas pipeline and some
      of its preferred stock to raise around $80.5 million. Still, by 1986
      Valero had lost approximately $50 million and incurred around $900 million
      in debt. The following year Greehey decided to spin off a substantial
      portion of Valero's gas-pipeline operation into Valero Natural Gas
      Partners, a move that reduced Valero's debt load by $700 million
      and saved the company $45 million a year in interest expenses.
    

      In 1988 the bailout started to pay off as refining margins began to
      improve. Valero earned $30.6 million on sales of $770 million that year.
      Greehey's decision to build the new refinery in Corpus Christi also
      paid dividends in other ways. Because they had constructed one of the most
      modern and efficient refineries in the country, Greehey and Valero did not
      need to spend any money to comply with the refinery standards of the 1990
      Clean Air Act; partly as a result of the act several of Valero's
      competitors were ultimately forced to close down.
    

      FORGES AHEAD
    

      Valero's earnings reached $98.7 million on revenues of more than $1
      billion in 1991. Greehey retired as the company's CEO in 1996, but
      his retirement lasted only four months, as his replacement, who had become
      CEO on June 30, 1996, resigned following a board meeting. Greehey came
      back on board just as the company was making numerous transactions that
      focused on the selling off of natural-gas assets in order to reduce the
      company's operations to oil refining and marketing exclusively.
    

      By the time Valero Energy Corporation completed its divestitures of the
      natural-gas divisions, Greehey had already set in place the foundation for
      the company's future success. According to many industry analysts,
      one of his most significant moves was the acquisition of Basis
      Petroleum's three refineries the previous April, when refining
      margins between costs and prices had been narrow and owners had been
      willing to sell. Analysts pointed out that Greehey had been right in
      predicting that refining margins would widen and that purchasing the
      refineries to add to Valero's only existing refinery in Corpus
      Christi would be a boon to the company. Greehey told David Hendricks of
      the 
      
        Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News
      
       that the second and third quarters were good and "the fourth
      quarter will be very good. We're going to have a record
      year" (August 24, 1997).
    

      Greehey continued to successfully guide Valero; in 2001 he was the
      highest-paid executive of a publicly traded U.S. upstream or downstream
      oil company. Although already the largest U.S. independent oil refiner by
      2002, Valero continued to expand through the purchase of other refineries
      such as Ultramar Diamond Shamrock. In January 2004 Valero posted record
      profits and reduced its debt by $725 million. The company reported net
      incomes of $131.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2003 and $621.5
      million for the year, which were record highs. Bolstered by the
      company's success, Greehey once more looked for acquisitions. He
      told Paul Merolli of the 
      
        Oil Daily
      
      , "We feel there is room to grow in the East Coast, Gulf Coast,
      Mid-Continent and—excluding California—the West
      Coast" (January 28, 2004).
    

      MANAGEMENT STYLE: EMPLOYEES FIRST
    

      Industry analysts noted that Greehey had grown up in the face of adversity
      and that his experience certainly played a role in his never-say-die
      management attitude. They credited his shrewd business deals with bringing
      Valero back from the brink of collapse in the mid-1980s. Colleagues and
      industry watchers said that his dedication and determination were the
      primary reasons for Valero's overwhelming success over the years.
    

      Both analysts and colleagues noted that in spite of his business wheelings
      and dealings Greehey always considered Valero's most important
      asset to be its employees. Fiercely loyal to the company's
      management and workers, he referred to them as the "Valero
      family." This loyalty was best demonstrated by the facts that the
      company never laid anyone off and that employees received the best pay and
      benefits in the industry. Because of Greehey's leadership 
      
        Fortune
      
       magazine recognized Valero in 2003 as one of the "100 Best
      Companies to Work For in America."
    

      Greehey's personal philosophy was to share Valero's success
      with the community through various initiatives. The company received
      numerous honors, including the Points of Light Foundation's
      national award for Excellence in Corporate Community Service and the
      United Way's Spirit of America Award, its highest corporate honor.
      Greehey also donated his personal time and money to worthy causes; he
      raised funds to build an athletic arena for his alma mater, St.
      Mary's, which named the complex Bill Greehey Arena.
    

      LOOKING GOOD
    

      Although Greehey had initially planned on retiring in 1999, he continued
      to lead Valero into the 21st century. In 2004 Valero had an extensive
      refining system with a throughput capacity of over 2.4 million barrels per
      day; its refining network stretched from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast and
      from the West Coast to the Caribbean. Greehey remained optimistic about
      the future, telling Merolli of the 
      
        Oil Daily
      
      , "As far as the fundamentals are concerned, they've never
      looked better to us" (January 28, 2004).
    

      In addition to his duties at Valero, Greehey served in numerous capacities
      for other organizations, serving on the board of trustees of St.
      Mary's University and on the Boy Scouts of America's
      National Advisory Council. He also served on the board of trustees of the
      United Way of San Antonio and Bexar County and on the boards of the
      Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research, the Cancer Therapy &
      Research Center, and the Alamo Board.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.
