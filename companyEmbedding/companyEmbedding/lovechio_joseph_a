                                NPI
                            

                                1023269693
                            

                                10-position all-numeric identification number assigned by the NPS to uniquely identify a health care provider.
                            



                                Entity Type
                            

                                Individual
                            

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Sole Proprietor
                            

                                N
                            

                                Indicate whether provider is a sole proprietor.

A sole proprietor is the sole (the only) owner of a business that is not incorporated; that unincorporated business is a sole proprietorship.
In a sole proprietorship, the sole proprietor owns all of the assets of the business and is solely liable for all of the debts of the business.
There is no difference between a sole proprietorship and a sole proprietor; they are legally a single entity: an individual.
In terms of NPI assignment, a sole proprietor is an Entity type 1 (Individual) and is eligible for only one NPI (the sole proprietorship business is not eligible for its own NPI).
As an individual, a sole proprietorship cannot be a subpart and cannot have subparts. (See NPI Final Rule for information about subparts.)
A sole proprietorship may or may not have employees.
Often, the IRS assigns an EIN to a sole proprietorship in order to protect the sole proprietor's SSN from disclosure in claims or on W-2s. NPPES does not capture a sole proprietorship's EIN.
Many types of health care providers could be sole proprietorships (for example, group practices, pharmacies, home health agencies).

                                The last name of the provider (if an individual). If the provider is an individual, this is the legal name. This name must match the name on file with the Social Security Administration (SSA). In addition, the date of birth must match that on file with SSA. (First and last names are required for initial applications.) The First, Middle, Last and Credential(s) fields allow the following special characters: ampersand, apostrophe, colon, comma, forward slash, hyphen, left and right parentheses, period, pound sign, quotation mark, and semi-colon.

            My  focus is in assisting individuals to incorporate mindfulness in daily life and to improve overall quality of live in addition to assisting individuals in developing coping skills to improve interpersonal conflicts. I engage clients in a person-centered approach and explore with clients early developmental conflicts that impact daily life and assist clients in developing adaptive approaches to resolving conflicts in daily life. I also provide somatic processing to assist individuals who have suffered trauma.  I have years of experience providing supervision to students and limited licensed professionals who are in pursuit of becoming fully licensed mental health counselors.
        

            My approach to treatment incorporates a combination of psychodynamic psychotherapy of which I have received training from The New York Psychoanalytic Institute,cognitive behavioral therapy, and mindfulness skills, distress tolerance training and somatic processing. I also have extensive experience in safety planning and working with women who have been the victims of domestic violence.

Any attempt by any participant to obtain more than the stated number of entries by using multiple or different identities, forms, or email addresses or any other methods will void all of that participant’s entries, and that participant may be disqualified at Sponsor’s discretion.  In the event of a dispute as to any entry, the authorized account holder of the email address used to enter will be deemed to be the registered player.  The “authorized account holder” is the natural person assigned an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider, or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted email address.  Potential winners may be required to show proof of being the authorized account holder or forfeit the prize.  Entries specifying an invalid, non-working, or inactive email address will be disqualified and ineligible to win.  Sponsor and Sponsor’s agents, affiliates, subsidiaries, representatives, or service providers may use entrants’ email address submitted with entry for purposes of prize notification, prize fulfillment, and/or future marketing by Sponsor.  You may remove your email address from future email marketing promotions by following the instructions on any email marketing promotion.  Information collected from entrants is subject to the Sponsor’s Privacy Policy, which may be found at http://www.josbank.com/privacy-policy. 

4.  PRIZE DRAWINGS:  A random drawing will be held on or about the first day of each month from among all eligible entries received in the previous month.  Sponsor’s decisions are final and legally binding on all matters relating to the Sweepstakes.

Upon verification of winner’s eligibility by Sponsor, Prize will be sent to winner’s home address.  Noncompliance with the foregoing, failure to abide by these Official Rules, failure to respond within seven (7) days after the first attempt to contact the potential winner or return of the prize notification or prize as undeliverable may result in disqualification and the naming of an alternate potential winner. Up to 3 alternate drawings will be held, after which any remaining prizes will remain un-awarded. No compensation will be given upon prize forfeiture for any reason.  Unaccepted prizes may not be awarded within sole discretion of Sponsor.  Sponsor is not responsible for any change of mailing address, email address, and/or telephone number of entrants.

Nice comfy T shirt



July 23, 2017 by


FirstReviewer




I love how this T shirt fit to my body. I want to have a one which nicely hug my body. However, the material contains 7% spandex which makes the t shirt feel weird. Anyhow, I will still keep this one.
