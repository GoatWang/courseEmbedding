Customer lifetime value is affected by revenue and by the costs of customer acquisition, retention, and cross-selling.TRUE118) Both brand equity and customer equity emphasize the importance of customer loyalty and the notion that we create value by having as many customers as possible pay as high a price as possible.Answer: Brands perform a number of valuable functions for firms. First, they simplify product handling ortracing. Brands help to organize inventory and accounting records. A brand also offers the firm legal protection for unique features or aspects of the product. The brand name can be protected through registered trademarks; manufacturing processes can be protected through patents; and packaging can be protected through copyrights and proprietary designs. These intellectual property rights ensure that the firm can safely invest in the brand and reap the benefits of a valuable asset.A credible brand signals a certain level of quality so that satisfied buyers can easily choose the product again. Brand loyalty provides predictability and security of demand for the firm, and it creates barriers to entry that make it difficult for other firms to enter the market. Loyalty also can translate into customer willingness to pay a higher price.119) What valuable functions can brands perform for a firm?Answer: The three key ingredients of customer-based brand equity are as follows:1) Brand equity arises from differences in consumer response. If no differences occur, the brand-name product is essentially a commodity, and competition will probably be based on price.2) Differences in response are a result of consumers' brand knowledge, all the thoughts, feelings, images, experiences, and beliefs associated with the brand. Brands must create strong, favorable, and unique brand associations with customers, as have Toyota (reliability), Hallmark (caring), and Amazon.com (convenience).3) Brand equity is reflected in perceptions, preferences, and behavior related to all aspects of themarketing of a brand. Stronger brands lead to greater revenue.120) Describe the three ingredients of customer-based brand equity.Answer: The BAV model is based on research of almost 800,000 consumers in 51 countries. BAV provides comparative measures of the brand equity of thousands of brands across hundreds of different categories. There are four key components—or pillars—of brand equity. These pillars are: (1) energized differentiation—measures the degree to which a brand is seen as different from others, and its perceived momentum and leadership; (2) relevance—measures the appropriateness and breadth of a brand's appeal; (3) esteem—measures perceptions of quality and loyalty, or how well the brand is regarded and respected; and (4) knowledge—measures how aware and familiar consumers are with the brand.121) Advertising agency Young and Rubicam (Y&R) developed a model of brand equity called Brand Asset Valuator (BAV). What is the intent of the BAV model? List and briefly characterize the four key components (pillars) of brand equity.Answer: The six components of the brand resonance pyramid include: (1) brand salience—relates to how often and easily the brand is evoked under various purchase or consumption situations; (2) brand performance—relates to how the product or service meets customers' functional needs; (3) brand imagery—deals with the extrinsic properties of the product or service, including the ways in which the brand attempts to meet the customers' psychological or social needs; (4) brand judgments—focus on consumers' own personal opinions and evaluations; (5) brand feelings—customers' emotional responses and reactions with respect to the brand; and (6) brand resonance—refers to the nature of the relationship that customers have with the brand and the extent to which customers feel that they are "in sync" with the brand.122) The creation of significant brand equity involves reaching the top or pinnacle of the brand pyramid. What are the six components of the brand resonance pyramid?Answer: The brand value creation process begins when the firm invests in a marketing program targeting actual or potential customers. Next, customers' mindsets are assumed to change as a result of the marketing program. This change affects the way the brand performs in the marketplace through the collective impact of individual customers deciding how much to purchase and when, how much they'll pay, and so on. Finally, the investment community considers market performance and other factors such as replacement cost and purchase price in acquisitions to arrive at an assessment of shareholder value in general and the value of a brand in particular.123) Identify and describe the four value stages of the brand value chain.Answer: To understand how the sources and outcomes of brand equity change, if at all, over time, marketers conduct brand tracking studies. These studies collect quantitative data from consumers over time to provide consistent, baseline information about how brands and marketing programs are performing. Tracking studies help us understand where, how much, and in what ways brand value is being created, to facilitate day-to-day decision making.124) Describe the function of brand tracking studies.Answer: To better understand the sources of brand equity and how they affect outcomes of interest, marketers often need to conduct brand audits. A brand audit is a consumer-focused exercise that involves a series of procedures to assess the health of the brand, uncover its sources of brand equity, and suggest ways to improve and leverage its equity. The brand audit can be used to set strategic direction for the brand. As the result of this strategic analysis, the marketer can develop a marketing program to maximize long-term brand equity. Marketers should conduct a brand audit whenever they consider important shifts in strategic direction.125) Describe the meaning and function of a brand audit.Answer: Many firms, such as Heinz and GE, use their corporate brand as an umbrella brand across their entire range of products. A corporate umbrella brand name has a number of advantages. Development cost is less because there is no need for "name" research or heavy advertising expenditures to create brand-name recognition. Furthermore, sales of the new product are likely to be strong if the manufacturer's name is good. Corporate-image associations of innovativeness, expertise, and trustworthiness have been shown to directly influence consumer evaluations. Finally, a corporate branding strategy can lead to greater intangible value for the firm.126) As a branding manager, you have recommended to your board of directors a corporate policy of umbrella branding. What are the advantages that your company might gain from this?Answer: The four roles are: (1) flankers—or fighting brands. These are positioned with respect to competitors' brands so that more important (and more profitable) flagship brands can retain their desired positioning; (2) cash cows—some brands may be kept around despite dwindling sales because they still manage to hold on to a sufficient number of customers and maintain their profitability with virtually no marketing support. These "cash cow" brands can be effectively "milked" by capitalizing on their reservoir of existing brand equity; (3) low-end entry-level—the role of the relatively low-priced brand in the portfolio often may be to attract customers to the brand franchise. Retailers like to feature these "traffic builders" because they are able to "trade up" customers to a higher-priced brand; and (4) high-end prestige—the role of a high-priced brand in the brand family often is to add prestige and credibility to the entire portfolio.127) There are a number of specific roles brands can play as part of a brand portfolio. List and briefly describe the four roles.Answer: Consumers make inferences and form expectations about the composition and performance of a new product based on what they already know about the parent brand and the extent to which they feel this information is relevant to the new product. By setting up positive expectations, extensions reduce risk and may make it easier to convince retailers to stock and promote a brand extension because of increased customer demand. From a marketing communications perspective, an introductory campaign for an extension doesn't need to create awareness of both the brand and the new product, but instead can concentrate on the new product itself.128) In what ways can brand extensions improve the odds of new-product success?Answer: The steps would be: (1) identifying and establishing brand positioning; (2) planning and implementing brand marketing; (3) measuring and interpreting brand performance; and (4) growing and sustaining brand value.129) Assume you are a marketing manager and want to adopt strategic brand management. List the four main steps that you would most likely go through to accomplish this task.Answer: A brand, according to the AMA, is "a name, term, sign, symbol, or design, or a combination of them, intended to identify the goods or services of one seller or group of sellers and to differentiate them from those of competitors."130) How does the American Marketing Association (AMA) define the term brand?Answer: Brand equity is the added value endowed to products and services. This value may be reflected in how consumers think, feel, and act with respect to the brand, as well as the prices, market share, and profitability that the brand commands for the firm.131) Define brand equity.Answer: A brand is said to have positive customer-based brand equity when consumers react more favorably to a product and the way it is marketed when the brand is identified, than when it is not identified.132) What is positive customer-based brand equity?Answer: Brand knowledge consists of all the thoughts, feelings, images, experiences, beliefs, and so on that become associated with the brand. In particular, brands must create strong, favorable, unique brand associations with customers.133) Explain the concept of brand knowledge.Answer: Brand knowledge created by marketing investments dictates appropriate future directions for the brand. Consumers will decide, based on what they think and feel about the brand, where they believe the brand should go and grant permission to any marketing action or program. Many new products can fail because consumers find them inappropriate extensions for the brand.34) How does consumer knowledge play a role in the success of new products associated with existing brands?Answer: Energized differentiation and relevance combine to produce brand strength. Esteem and knowledge together create brand stature.135) Brand equity has four components—energized differentiation, relevance, esteem, and knowledge. How are these components combined to produce brand strength and brand stature?Answer: The steps are in ascending order: (1) presence, (2) relevance, (3) performance, (4) advantage, and (5) bonding.136) According to the BRANDZ model of brand strength, brand building involves a series of five sequential steps. What are those five sequential steps?Answer: The six criteria are: (1) memorable, (2) meaningful, (3) likable, (4) transferable, (5) adaptable, and (6) protectable.137) List the six criteria used in creating brand elements.Answer: As a brand manager you would need to consider the questions like, "How legally protectable is the brand element?" "How competitively protectable is the brand element?" and "Can it be easily copied?" It is important that names that become synonymous with product categories—such as Kleenex, Kitty Litter, Jell-O, Scotch Tape, Xerox, and Fiberglass—retain their trademark rights and not become generic.138) As a brand manager you would like to have your brand (brand name) be protectable. Explain what you mean by "protectable" and give an illustration.Answer: Three important principles for internal branding are: (1) choosing the right moment; (2) linking internal and external marketing; and (3) bringing the brand alive for employees.139) Identify the three important principles for internal branding.Answer: The two approaches are: (1) an indirect approach that assesses potential sources of brand equity by identifying and tracking consumer brand knowledge structures; and (2) a direct approach that assesses the actual impact of brand knowledge on consumer response to different aspects of the marketing.140) Given that the power of a brand resides in the minds of consumers and how it changes their response to marketing, there are two basic approaches to measuring brand equity. Briefly, describe each of these approaches.Answer: Brand equity is the added value endowed to products and services. Brand valuation is the job of estimating the total financial value of the brand.141) Distinguish between brand equity and brand valuation.Answer: Marketers can reinforce brand equity by consistently conveying the brand's meaning in terms of1) what products it represents, what core benefits it supplies, and what needs it satisfies; and2) how the brand makes products superior, and which strong, favorable, and unique brand associations should exist in consumers' minds.142) How can marketers reinforce brand equity?Answer: The firm can: (1) develop new brand elements for the new product, (2) apply some of its existing brand elements, or (3) use a combination of new and existing brand elements.143) The decision as to how to brand new products is especially critical. When a firm introduces a new product, it has three main choices. What are those choices?Answer: Nichepro Technologies are advocating brand extension strategy. Brand extensions fall into two categories: 1) line extension and 2) category extension. Marketers use the parent brand to enter a different product category, in category extension. Nichepro is adopting the same strategy by using their parent brand to enter the healthcare products category.144) Nichepro Technologies, who were mainly into producing personal computers and laptops, have now decided to produce Nichepro health care products. Explain the branding strategy advocated by the company.Answer: Brand variants are specific brand lines supplied to specific retailers or distribution channels. They result from the pressure retailers put on manufacturers to provide distinctive offerings.145) Define brand variants.Answer: Kellogg's employs a sub-brand or hybrid branding strategy by combining the corporate brand with individual product brands as with Kellogg's rice krispies, Kellogg's raisin bran, and Kellogg's corn flakes.146) Kellogg's uses its corporate brand name with its individual product brands as with Kellogg's rice krispies, Kellogg's raisin bran, and Kellogg's corn flakes. Which branding strategy is being used by the company?Answer: A licensed product is one whose brand name has been licensed to other manufacturers that actually make the product. Corporations have seized on licensing to push their company names and images across a wide range of products-from bedding to shoes-making licensing a multibillion dollar business.147) What is a licensed product? Why have corporations seized on licensing?Answer: When there is a threat of losing consumers to a competing brand, companies sometimes opt for preemptive cannibalization. This causes consumers to switch between the same brand's products, preventing loss of customers. Even though Tide's various line extensions may cannibalize sales of its other products, if the extensions had not been introduced, then customers would have defected to another brand offering the same type of extension. In this way, Tide has maintained its market share through preemptive cannibalization.148) Tide laundry detergent maintains the same market share it had 50 years ago because of the sales contributions from its various line extensions. It can be said that Tide employs a preemptive cannibalization strategy in generating line extensions. What does this mean?AdvertisementUpgrade to remove ads

2.6 What is the value to the
corporation of ethical guidelines?
To reduce inconsistent behaviors among marketing reduce
risk/damaging ongoing-term relationships with suppliers, channel partners and
customers.  To reduce damaging the trust
between a firm and its suppliers or customers, thereby not disrupting the
development of long term exchange relationships and resulting in the likely
loss of sales and profits over time.

2.10 What is a portfolio model?
Enable managers
to classify and review their current and prospective SBUs by viewing them as
portfolios of investment opportunities and then evaluating each business's
competitive strength and the attractiveness of the markets it serves.

Relative market share
Two Dimensions
Market
Growth rate  maturity and attractiveness of an industry
Relative
Market share  a proxy for its competitiveness strength within its industry
 
Business
Types
Question
Marks -  Business in high-growth
industries with low relative market shares also known as problem children
increase shares of a question mark business it becomes a star, If they fail it
will turn into a dog.
Stars -  market leader in a high-growth industry,
critical to the continued future success of the firm .  as industries mature they move into cash
cows.
Cash Cows
-  high relative hare of low-growth
markets because they are the primary generators of profits and cash in a
corporation.  Do not require additional
capital markets are stable share leadership usually mean they enjoy economies
of scale and relatively high profit margins.
Dogs
 low share businesses in low-growth markets throw off some cash, typically
generate low profits, or losses. 
 
2.12 What are the major limitations of
the BCG model?
ˇ       
Market growth rate is an inadequate descriptor of
overall industry attractiveness
ˇ       
Relative market share is inadequate as a description of
overall competitive strength
ˇ       
The outcomes of a growth share analysis are highly
sensitive to variations in how growth and share are measured
ˇ       
While the matrix specifies appropriate investment
strategies for each business, it provides little guidance on how best to
implement those strategies
ˇ       
The model implicitly assumes that all business units
are independent of one another except for the flow of cash.
2.13 What is value-based planning?
Is a resource allocation tool that attempts to assess the
shareholder value a given strategy is likely to crease, it is a basis for
comparing the economic returns to be gained from investing in different
businesses pursuing different strategies from alternative strategies that might
be adopted by a given business unit.
1)     
Assess the economic value a strategy is lively to produce by
examining the cash flows it will generate rather than relying on distorted
accounting measures such as return on investment
2)     
2) Estimate the shareholder value that strategy will p[reduce
by discounting its forecasted cash flows by the businesss risk-adjustment cost
of capital
3)     
3) Evaluate strategies based on the likelihood that the
investments required by a strategy will deliver returns greater tan the cost of
capital .  The amount of return a
strategy or operating program generates in excess of the cost of capital is
commonly referred to as its economic value added or EVS.
2.14 What are its limitations?
Value based planning is not a substitute for strategic
planning; it is a tool for evaluating strategy alternative identified and
developed through mangers judgments. 
It relies on forecast of many kinds to put a financial value on the
hopes, fears, and expectations managers associate with each alterative.  I.e. forecasts of sales volumes, product
mix, unit price and competitive action
2.15 Ideally, what characteristics
should strategic business units have?
ˇ       
A homogenous set of markets to serve with a limited
number of related technologies.
ˇ       
A unique set of products markets
ˇ       
Control over those factors necessary for successful
performance
ˇ       
Responsibility for their own profitability
2.16 What are the objectives of a
business unit?
Sub objectives vary across Strategic Business Units SBUs
according to their industry attractiveness, strength of their competitive
positions with those industries, and resource allocation decisions by corporate
management. 
2.17 What is the role of marketing in
formulating and implementing strategies?
Marketing mangers bear the primary responsibility for
formulating and implementing strategic marketing plans for individual
product0market entries.  However freedom
of action is designing such plans is often constrained by the firms corporate
and business0level strategies. 
2.18 What are the more important
characteristics of a market-oriented company?
The marketing concept holds that the planning and
co-ordination of all company activities around the primary goal of satisfying
customer needs in the most effective means to attain and sustain a competitive
advantage and achieve company objectives over time.  
They adopt a variety of organizational procedures and
structures to improve the responsiveness of their decision making, including
more detailed environmental scanning, continuous, real-time information
systems; seeking frequent feedback form and coordinating plans with key
customers and major suppliers; decentralization of strategic decisions,
encouragement of entrepreneurial thinking among lower-level mangers an the use
of inter functional management teams to analyze issues and initiate strategic
actions outside the formal planning process.
Part 2 Market Opportunity Analysis
Module 3 Environmental Analysis - Content
Questions:
3.1 What are the major problems in
terms of the planets physical environment?
Depletion of many of the earths valuable resources, decline
in the earths overall health  deserts are growing while forests are
shrinking, lakes are dying, quality and quantity of groundwater are declining
and rising temperatures.  Pollution
problems, inadequate supply of municipal water.
3.2 What are green products?
Green products are those that are environmentally friendly
ie phosphate-free detergents, recycled motor oil, tuna caught without netting
dolphins, organic fertilizer, high-efficiency light bulbs, recycled paper.
3.3 What kinds of risk derive from a
change in a countrys regulatory environment?
ˇ       
Confiscation (seizure without compensations) 
ˇ       
Exportation (seizure with some compensations)
ˇ       
Domestication (transfer of ownership to the host
country and local management and sourcing)
ˇ       
Change in exchange control, 
ˇ       
local content laws,
ˇ       
import restriction
ˇ       
taxes and price controls 
Designed to provide advantage to local industry.
3.4 What are some of the more
important opportunities resulting from research in biology? Electronics?
Trends in biology especially in gene therapy.  I.e. research to discover faulty geneses is
an example of what is hoped to be gained.
Trends in Electronics / Telecommunication relating to how
goods and services as well as ideas are exchanged and how individuals learn and
earn as well as interact with one another.
3.5 What are the major trends in the
worlds population?
Ageing of the worlds population, caused primarily by
declining mortality rates.  
Rapid shift in the populations of less-developed countries
from rural to urban.
 
3.6 Describe the four major shifts
taking place in the US population.



Family Structure


Closely structured family is less and less typical,
  households because of divorce, remarriage two wage earners etc




Ageing


Baby boomers 1949  1064 continue to dominate growth in
  the age groups they pass through en route to old age.  




Geographic Distribution


Immigrants account for nearly 1/3 of US annual growth and
  end up residing mostly in the large metropolitan areas of the South and
  West.  
Migration of jobs and people to suburban cities  further
  and further form central cities.




Ethnic Composition


Diverse ethnically 25% of population is composed of racial
  minorities.  



 
3.7 Define purchasing power parity.
Further, explain why an unadjusted per capital GNP substantially understates
the spending power of urban households in the underdeveloped countries.
Gross domestic product (GNP) measure economic
performance of a country on a per capita basis after accounting for inflation,
in order realistically to compare incomes across countries it is necessary to
use a purchasing power parity (PPP) approach that takes into account the
cost of a standard basket of products expressed in US dollars for each country.
Thus, using a PPP analysis helps to compare the relative purchasing power of a
given country for goods with what theses same goods would cost in the United
States.   PPP typically lower GDP per
capita income for wealthier countries and higher ones for the poorer nations.   Despite leveling from PPP the GDP gap is
less inflation increased between rich and poor countries  mainly because of
higher population growth.  PPP does not
take into account the subsidies provided by many countries for such essentials
as food, utilities, shelter, transportation, education and medical care, which
account for about half of the average household expenditures in developed
countries.
3.8 What are the major forces driving
the competitive environment?
Known as the macro environments 



Globalization of business


Takes more resources to be a major global player, the
  number of players become more and more limited.  Almost always results in a change in an industrys structure,
  which makes it more difficult for entry as well as for competitors to survive
  




Technology


Rate and complexity has a strong impact on innovations in
  the production process and development of new and improved products. Vertical
  integration and mergers. 




Changing channels of distribution


In retailing they have been numerous and far reaching
  include:
ˇ       
  Fast growth of general merchandise discount stores
  operating cost lower than traditional retailers 
ˇ       
  Direct marketing via telemarketing, direct mail and
  Internet
ˇ       
  Growth in vertical marketing systems that integrate
  producers, wholesaler and retailer into a unified system designed to achieve
  lower costs while increasing market power. 
  I.e. franchising examples of fast foods (McDonalds)




Regulation / Deregulation


In US Deregulation has had an impact on airlines, trucking
  banking bringing more competition.
And Regulation to Telephone markets, which had controlled
  of the seven Baby Bells the new legislation, will open theses markets to
  competition and in exchange will permit the Baby Bells to compete in the
  long-distance market.   




Changing values, Attitudes and lifestyles


These are powerful engines of change as companies compete
  to take advantage of new trends.  I.e.
  increase concern about physical fitness has been responsible for athletics
  clubs exercise equipment ect..



 
3.9 Describe what an
opportunity/threat matrix is and how it can be used to help management
identify, evaluate and respond to environmental events.
An opportunity/threat matrix enables the examination of a
large number of events in such a way that management can focus on the most
important ones.  In any given period,
many environmental events that could have an impact on the firm  either
positively or negatively  may be detected. 

Example:

3.10 What are the ethical issues
arising from the interaction of business and the environment?
ˇ       
Environmental Impact
ˇ       
Third world countries concerns for unhealthy working
environments, 
ˇ       
Third world countries use of child labour 
ˇ       
High prices of third world countries for goods purchase
pharmaceutical drugs.  
Module 4 Industry Dynamics and Strategic
Change - Content Questions:
4.1 What are the various levels at
which products can be defined?



Industry


Includes an array of non-competing products i.e. car
  industry




Product class


May serve diverse markets.  The more generic the definition the higher the aggregation
  level of products i.e. desserts versus pastries




Product type


Subsets of product class contain items that are
  technically the same




Brand level


Bottom of the aggregation hierarchy, inappropriate units
  of analysis.  Sales largely function
  of managements strategic decisions, 



 
4.2 Describe market hierarchies.
Market Hierarchy is a complex one to define since there are
numerous ways markets can be arrayed. 
Levels targeted, the trend is towards greater specificity  that is
towards targeting more precisely defined segments at the lower level in the
hierarch e.g. Johnson & Johnson targeted children aged 2  6years with a
special line of bath products featuring Winnie the Pooh.
4.3 Describe what is meant by the
product life-cycle concept.
Sales history of a product and the sales change over time in
a predictable way the product go through a series of five distinct stages: Each
opportunities brings threats, thereby affecting the strategy as well as
marketing programmes. 
 
4.4 What are the characteristics and
their implications of each of the product life-cycle stages?
4.5 What are the strategic
implications of the product life cycle?



4.3 Stages


4.4
  Characteristics and Implications


4.5 Strategic
  Implications




Introduction


Purchase of new product limited because members of the
  target market are insufficiently aware of its existence. And product
  availability.  
Communications task at the outset to build awareness of
  the new products uniqueness, expensive undertaking promotional expenditures
  product availability for trial


Both innovators and followers, accelerate overall market
  growth and product acceptance through awareness, trial and product
  availability.




Growth


As people learn about product and it becomes readily
  available, sales increase at a progressively faster rate. 
Marketing mix changes, prices tend to decline ,
  price differences between brands decrease, 
  Sellers build channel or a direct sales system provide maximum product
  availability and service at lowest cost. 
  This accomplished rivals at disadvantaged,  
Promotion costs concerned with building demand for a
  companys brand  (selective demand)
  than demand for product class or type (primary demand) Firms strive to build
  favorable attitudes toward their brand on unique features,  promotion costs remain high, typically
  decline as a percentage of sales.


Increase competitive position




Shake-out / Competitive turbulence stage


Growth slows as the number of buyers nears maximum and
  repeat sales become increasingly more important than trial sales as number of
  buyers and purchases stabiles 
Price cuts, weaker competitors leave the market, stronger
  firms gain shares.  Major changes in
  industrys competitive structure occur. 
  Firms rationalize product line by eliminating weaker items, emphasis
  creative promotional pricing and strengthen its channel relationships. 
Marketing mix changes
More direct price competition, firms make every effort to
  maintain and enhance their distribution system.  Reduce number of products carried weaker competitors  need to offer buying incentives to
  continue in the market.
 


Improve/solidify competitive position




Maturity


Sales plateau, typically lasts some time, Net adoption
  rate holds steady, adopters drop out and exceed new first time users, 
Longer stage lasts the more likely changes occur.  If firm does not respond successfully to
  change its competitors do, then a change in industry structure of significant
  may occur
Marketing mix changes
Various brands mare similar, breakthroughs by R&D or
  engineering help to differentiate product. 
  Options is to add value to product that benefits customer., increase
  service distribution and in-store displays become increasingly important as
  does effective cost management.


Maintain position




Decline


sales rate declines and product is said to have reached
  its final stage this may be gradual or extremely fast.  
Sales decline, costs increase and radical efforts are
  needed to reduce costs and the asset base. 
  Exit barriers are low , many firms vacate the market so increasing the
  sales of remaining firms, there by delaying their exit.  Stronger firms may even prosper for a
  time.  
 


 



 
4.6 What are the major limitations of
the product life-cycle concept?
Major limitations lies in its normative approach to
prescribing strategies based on assumptions about the features or
characteristics of each stage.  It fails
to take into account that the product life cycle is in reality driven by market
forces expressing the evolution of consumer preferences (the market),
technology (the product) and competition (the supply side)
4.7 Describe the adoption process.
The adoption process involves the attitudinal changes
experienced by individuals from time they first hear about a new product, serve
or idea until they adopt it.  The five
stages in the adoption process are:



Awareness


Person only aware of the existence of the new product
  insufficiently motivated to seek information about it




Interest


Individual becomes sufficiently interested in the new
  product, but is not yet involved.




Evaluation


Mental rehearsal stage, Individual is mentally applying
  the new product to his or her own use requirements and anticipating the
  results.




Trial


Individual actually uses the product, but, if possible, on
  a limited basis to minimize risk. 
  Only is the use experience is satisfactory with the product stand a
  chance of being adopted.




Adoption


Individual not only continues to use the new product but
  adopts it in lieu of substitutes.



 
4.8 What is the adoption rate a
function of?
The time dimension is a function of the rate at which people
in the target group move through the five stages in adoption process.  Depends on the following factors
1)     
Risk (cost of product failure or dissatisfaction)
2)     
Relative advantage over other products
3)     
Relative simplicity of the new product
4)     
Compatibility with previously adopted ideas
5)     
Extent to which its trial can be accomplished on a small-scale
basis
6)     
Ease with which the central idea of the product can be
communicated. 
4.9 What are the various adopter
categories?



Innovators


First 2.5% of all individuals who ultimately adopt a new
  product,  more venturesome more likely
  to be receptive to new ideas and tend to have high incomes which reduces the
  risk of a loss arising from an early adoption.




Early adopters


Next 13% 14 % who adopt. 
  Part of local scenes, often opinion leaders, serve as vital links to
  members of the early majority group, participate more in community
  organizations than do later adopters.




Early Majority


34% of those who adopt. 
  Display less leadership than early adopters, tend to be active in
  community display less leadership than early adopters, active in community
  affairs * thereby gain respect form their peers0.  do not like to take unnecessary risks and want to be sure new
  product will prove successful before they adopt it.




Late Majority


Another 34% Frequently those individuals adopt a new
  product because they are forced to do so for either economic or social
  reasons.  They participate in
  community activities less than the previous groups and only rarely assume a
  leadership role.




Laggards


Last 16% they are the most local; .  participate less in community matters than
  any other groups and stubbornly resist change.  Adopt a product so late sometimes that it has already been
  replac3ed by another new product. 



 
4.10 Describe the ways in which a
product markets characteristics change as the market evolves.
Product innovation diminishes over time.  Thus the sales of a new products those
entering the market for the first time decline as percentage of total market
volume form 10.2% during the growth stage of evolution to 5.4% during growth
maturity, to 3.5% and 3.7% during stable maturity and declining maturity and to
2.8% in the decline stage.  This is know
as PIM (profit impact of market strategy) 
4.11 What questions need to be
answered in making an industry analysis?
1)     
How profitable is the industry likely to be in the short
term?  Or in the longer term?  
2)     
What are the more import industry characteristics?
3)     
What are the industry driving forces?
a.      
Changes in the markets long-term growth rate which directly
affect investment decisions and intensity of competition
b.     
Changes in buyer segments, which affect demand and strategic
marketing programmes
c.      
Diffusion of proprietary knowledge, which controls both the
rate at which products become ore alike and the entry of new firms
d.     
Changes in cost and efficiency, derived from scale and
learning effects which have the potential of making entry more difficulty
e.      
Changes in government regulations, which can affect entry
costs, bases on competition and profitability.
4)     
What the essential determinants of success?
 
4.12 What are the major forces, which
determine industry competition?
This is a part of industry analysis, five interactive
competitive forces that collectively determine an industrys long-term
attractiveness present competitors, potential competitors, the bargaining power
of suppliers and buyers and substitute products
. 

 
Module 5 Consumer Marketing and Buying
Behaviour- Content Questions:
5.1 Describe each of the four types of
purchasing decision.



 


Extent of involvement




Extent of decision making


High


Low




Extended
  (information search; consideration of brand alternatives


Complex decision making
(cars, homes, vacations)


Limited decision making, including variety seeking and
  impulse purchasing (adult cereals and snack foods)




Habit /routine (little or no information search; focus on
  one brand)


Brand loyalty (athletic shoes, adult cereals, cologne,
  deodorant)


Inertia (frozen vegetables, paper towels)



 
5.2 Describe briefly the five steps
consumers go through when purchasing high involvement products or services.



Problem identification


Triggered by unsatisfied needs or wants Perceive
  differences between in deal and actual states on some physical or
  sociopsychological dimension.  Seek
  products or services to help bring their current state more into balance with
  the idea




Information search


How much information will a consumer seek?
Source of Information - personal  commercial - public




Evaluation of alternatives


Product attributes and their relative importance i.e. Cost
  , Performance, Social attributes, Availability




Purchase


Choosing a source from which to buy the product involves
  essential the same mental process i.e. mail order, teleshopping, catalogue,
  retail store.




Post Purchase Evaluation


Aspiration or expectation level how well the product was
  expected to perform. 
Post purchase dissonance consumer may doubt whether they
  made the best possible choices. Such doubts are called cognitive dissonance.



 
5.3 How do low-involvement purchase
decisions differ from high-involvement ones?
They are not import to consumers, the search for information
to evaluate alternative brands is minimal. 
As a result, decisions to buy products such as cookies or cereal often
are made within the store either impulsively on the basis of brand familiarity
or as a result of comparisons of the brands on the shelf.
5.4 What are the marketing
implications of low-involvement purchasing?



Implications


High Involvement


Low Involvement




Product design and positioning


Consumers
  evaluate alternative brands according to choice criteria that reflect the
  benefits they seek


Brand evaluation occurs after the product is purchased,
  consumers seek brands that are least likely to give them problems, 
Focus on product features that minimize any problems in
  using the product.




Advertising and Promotion


Printed media are better for highly involved with
  the product and actively seeking information.  


Passive information gatherer, advertising should focus on
  a few main points to make it as easy as possible for them to gain
  familiarity and positive association with a brand.  Television is primary medium for advertising.  allows
  passive learning. Distinctive package design helps consumers recognize
  brands they have seen advertised.




Pricing


 


Bought often on price alone, special sales or
  coupon offers can be effective.  If no
  problems experienced in use of trial consumers may continue to repurchase the
  brand out of inertia until a competitor offers an attractive price
  promotion




Distribution


 


Extensive retail distribution important because consumers
  are unwilling to search for a particular brand.




Strategies to increase consumer involvement


 


Link product to some involving issue, i.e. bran cereals
  associated their product with a high fibre diet that may reduce the incidence
  of colon cancer.



 
5.5 Describe the Fishbein model by
using an example.

Attitude A = Consumers overall attitude towards
Brand A
Bi = Consumers
belief concerning the extent to which attribute i is associated with
Brand A
Ii = The importance of
attribute i to the consumer when choosing a brand to buy. 
k =  The total attributes considered by the
consumer when evaluating alternative brands in the product category.
i = Any specific product
attribute.

5.6 What is the difference between a
compensatory and a non-compensatory model?
In a compensatory model a poor evaluation of one attribute
can be offset by a strong evaluation on another.  
In a non compensatory model brands are evaluated one
attribute at a time. Until one is superior
 
5.7 How do demographics and lifestyle
have an impact on buying behaviour?
Demographics influence:
1)     
The nature of consumers needs and wants
2)     
Their ability to buy products or services to satisfy those
needs
3)     
The perceived importance of various attributes or choice criteria
used to evaluate alterative brands
4)     
Consumers attitudes toward and preferences for different
products and brands.
 
Lifestyles
            People live
their lives in different ways i.e. different opinions, interests and
activities, i.e. buying and using brands in different ways for different
purposed.
5.8 Identify the major social
influences on consumers decision-making processes.
Social
Culture  set of beliefs, attitudes and
behaviour patterns relatively stable over time. 
            Sub
Culture  share common geographic, ethnic, racial or religious
backgrounds,  They continue to hold some
values, attitudes and behaviour pattern that are uniquely their own.
Social Class - status groups largely based on
similarities in income, education and occupation.
            Reference
Groups groups that affect consumer behaviour through normative
compliance, value-expressed influence and informational influence.

Module 6 Organisational Markets and Buying
Behaviour - Content Questions:
6.1 What are the major differences
between organisational and consumer markets?
Organisational markets are about twice as large as consumer
markets.
Organisational buyers purchase goods and services for
further production, for use in operations or for resale to other consumers, In
contrast to individual and households who buy for their own use and
consumption.
 
Differences between
organisational and consumer markets
Demand characteristics
The demand for industrial goods and services
is:
1 Derived from the demand for consumer goods
and services.
2 Relatively inelastic  price changes in the
short run are not likely to affect
demand drastically.
3 More erratic because small increases in
consumer demand can, over time,
strongly affect the demand for manufacturing
plants and equipment.
4 More cyclical.
Market demographics
Organisational buyers, when compared with
buyers of consumer goods, are:
1 Fewer in number.
2 Larger.
3 Geographically concentrated.
4 More apt to buy on specifications.
Buyerseller relationships
Organisational markets are characterised by
the following when compared with
the markets for consumer goods:
1 The use of professional buying specialists
following prescribed procedures.
2 Closer buyerseller relationships.
3 The presence of multiple buying influences.
  
6.2 Who are the major types of
organisational customers?



Resellers


All retailers, wholesalers  buy large quantities of goods
  for resale to other organisation or household consumers




Goods Producers


Producers of raw materials (such as farm and forest
  products firms and mines), building contractors and manufacturers.  




Service Producers


Banks, Hotels (lodgings), Financial, Insurance,
  entertainment, Education




Government


Large buyers of goods and services



 
6.3 What groups of people are the
participants in the buying process?
It involves people from various departments, and can be:



Users


People who
  must use or work with the product or service




Influencers


Provide information for evaluating alternative products
  and services, usually technical experts from various departments.  Help determine specifications and criteria
  to use in making the purchase decision.




Gatekeepers


Control the flow of information to other people in the
  purchasing process, primarily purchasing agents and suppliers salespeople
  control information that reaches other decision makers.   




Buyers


Purchasing agent or purchasing manager buyers have
  authority to contact suppliers and negotiate the purchase transaction.  




Deciders


Person who has the authority to make a final purchase
  decision.



 
6.4 What factors determine the buying
task faced by an organisation?
1)     
The newness of the problem and the relevant buying experience
of decision makers in the buying center.
2)     
The information needs of the people in the buying center.
3)     
The number of new alternative products and/or suppliers to
consider in making the purchase decision. 
 
Three kinds of buying task or situations;
1)     
Straight rebuy purchasing common product or service
the organisation has bought many times before. 
Routine 
2)     
Modified rebuy  organizations needs remain
unchanged, but buying center members are not satisfied with the product or the
supplier they have been using.
3)     
New-task buying 
organisation faces a new and unique need or problem 0 one in which
buying center members have little or no experience in buying and thus must
expend a great deal of effort to define purchasing specifications.
6.5 Describe briefly the
organisational purchase decision-making process.

6.6 What are the marketing
implications of the following categories of industrial goods and services?



Category


Description


Characteristics


Marketing Implication




Raw materials.


Relatively
  unprocessed goods that become apportion of a final product


Limited supply, few producers; distribution is a key
  function; price is a critical competitive variable.  


Little promotional activity except for co-operative
  advertising campaigns funded by trade groups to stimulate primary demand for
  a product.  




Component materials and parts.


Processed goods that become a portion of a final product.


High volume purchases, long-term contracts; fierce
  competition among suppliers, requires good service and nurturing of
  relationships with buyers.
 


Manufacturers buy most components materials and parts in
  large quantities, usually sold direct, without use of middlemen.  Wholesale distributors sell to smaller
  manufactures in some lines of trade. 
  To avoid disrupting production runs, sellers must ensure a steady
  reliable supply of materials and parts, JIT 




Accessory equipment.


Finished goods that facilitate production of a final
  product


Enduring but less os than installations, more
  standardized, more frequently purchased and less costly than capital equipment;
  less complex buying intermediaries may be involved.


Wide range of specific items, it is hard to genralise
  about the most common or appropriate marketing strategies for accessory
  equipment. , producers sell accessory equipment directly.  Presale and post sale service requirements
  are substantial, but the monetary value of the average sale is high enough to
  justify direct distribution.  Personal
  selling either by the producers or a distributor sales force is the most
  important promotional method used in selling accessory equipment.  Products standarsied and not technically
  complex and thus advertising and brand name promotion are also important.
 




Installations.


Major capital goods used to produce a final product, but
  not part of the final product.


Long-lasting; involved in production of many units of the
  final product over several years; involve large monetary outlays; capital
  budgeting committee involved in purchase decision; sold directly from
  manufacturer.


Presents real chanllege because there are few potential
  coustomers at any one time, average sale is very large.  Many installations are custom0made to fit
  a partcular customers needs, therefore sellers must provide enginerring and
  design services before making a sale. 
  Often long perod of negotiation prior to fina transaction.  Firms sell installatin must usually provid
  emany post sale services, ie installation, training, maintenance repair and
  sometimes financing.  Small number of
  buyers large monetary volue of each sale and custom engineering involved,
  distriution usually dirct from producer to customer.  Some wholesale distributors provide
  replacement parts and repair services for equipment already in
  operation.  For similar reasons
  promotional emphasis is usually on personal selling rather than advertising,
  High-caliber, well-trained salespeople are critically important in the
  marking of installations.




Operating supplies.


Finished goods that facilitate repair, maintenance and
  ongoing operations.


Analogous to consumer convenience goods, frequently
  purchased and consumed in a short time; standardized; broad market; heavy
  used of channel intermediaries.


Purchased in small quantities by a great many different
  organizations, wholesale middlemen typically used to distribute.  Price is usually critical variable in
  marketing operating supplies. 
  Competing products are quite standardized and there is little brand
  loyalty.  Personal selling by agents
  and distributors is also important.




Business services.


Provide special expertise to facilitate ongoing operations


Long-term relationships with customers; suppliers
  qualifications, experience and reputation critical to success; purchase
  decision often made by top executives.


Services are intangible purchased prior to evaluation by
  buyer, Suppliers qualifications, past performance and reputation become
  critical determinants of the success of the marketing effort.  Price is less important in selling
  business services because a lawyer or consultant with an outstanding
  reputation can often charge much more for a given service than one who is
  less well know,  Even so, rice often
  serves as an indicator of quality, especially when there are no other quality
  cues. 



Module 7 Marketing Information and Marketing
Research - Content Questions
7.1 Describe market database systems
and how they can be used.
Point of Sale (POS) database are used for direct marketing
and prospecting programmes for companies that sell directly to end users.  Collecting demographic data and tracking
purchases.
Geodemographic database provide 4 types of data
demographics, geographics, psychographics and consumer behaviour.  
 
7.2 Define what is meant by the term
marketing research.
The function which links the consumer, customer and public
to the marketer through information  information  used to identify and define marketing opportunities and problems;
generate, refine and evaluate marketing actions; monitor marketing performance;
and improve understanding of marketing as a process.
 
7.3 What are the six steps in the
marketing research process?



Steps



Potential
  error





1. Problem formulation



Management
  identifies the wrong problem or defines it poorly





2. Determining information
  needs and data source



Management fails
  to identify the specific information needed for decision-making or the
  researcher uses the wrong source.





3. Research
  design, including questionnaire



Ambiguous
  questions or poor experimental designs result in invalid responses. 





4. Sample design
  and size



Sample procedures
  result in the selection of a biased sample.





5.  Data collection



Errors are caused
  by non-response, by poor selection of respondents, by the interviewer, or by 





6. Tabulation and
  analysis



Errors occur
  while transforming raw data from questionnaires into research findings.




7.4 What
is the difference between primary and secondary data sources?



Primary


Are collected specifically for the problem at hand and
  require the firm to undertake the steps in the research process or hire an
  outside agency to do so




Secondary


Data collected by other organizations and are not usually
  tied directly to the firms problems. 
  They have the advantage of saving time and money, but the data must be
  compatible with the needs of the specific study.



 
7.5 How can secondary source data be
evaluated?
Researchers must answer the question How good are the
data? if the source specifies the data-collection method used, it can serve as
the basis for the evaluation.  If not
the researchers are forced to judge the quality on the basis of other factors.  I.e. research sponsors may be federal
government or a trade association.  And
how data was collected i.e. by mail or personal interview.
7.6 What is the difference between
exploratory and conclusive research?



Exploratory


ˇ       
  Uses secondary data (case studies and interview with
  knowledgeable people)
ˇ       
  Used to learn more about the nature and scope of the
  problem 
ˇ       
  Preliminary step to be followed by conclusive
  research that tests the relevant findings
ˇ       
  Flexibility is key to the investigation




Conclusive


Comprises
  descriptive and experimental studies
Conclusive research to test alternative solutions to a
  problem
studies  .



 
7.7 What is the difference between
descriptive and experimental research?



Descriptive


often referred to as survey research more commonly used
  design




Experimental


advantage of permitting the researcher to show cause-and 
  effect relationships between the variables 0 something that can only be
  inferred from descriptive studies.  
Some serious disadvantages that limit its usefulness in
  marketing
1)     
  most experiments can measure only immediate results
2)     
  Expensive
3)     
  Use small samples that may not be representative of the
  national market
4)     
  Difficulty holding all variables constant
5)     
  Pose severe administrative problems can be audited by
  competitors



 
7.8 What are the major differences
between probability and non-probability sampling?



Probability


Ensures that every unit in the universe has a known
  probability of being selected.  This is
  the only method that enables the researcher to measure the reliability of the
  sample data
 Possible problems
  0 minorities  or poor are
  under-represented in phone or mail survey




Non Probability


Does not provide every unit in the universe with a known
  probability of being included in the sample. 
  Thus, the results cannot be generalize with any degree of certainty to
  a larger population 
Is not objective unit included because the researcher
  thinks it should be
 



 
7.9 Why is interviewing one of the
major sources of error in a typical research project?
Telephone and personal interviews, an interviewer often
selects the person to interview, asks questions and records the answer and
errors can occur at each step.  
Respondents refuse to cooperate
Unable to remember information wanted 
Biased by the interviewing process 
Not want to report things that reflect poorly on their
intelligence or social position. 
Does question mean the same to everyone
Interviewing respondents it the one major source of error in
the typical research project, 
7.10 Under what conditions would you
use each of the various data collection methods?



Questioning


Most common way - 
  almost any problem can be attacked using it, problems involving attitudes,
  knowledge and buying intentions can be approached only by using this
  method.  




Observation


Recognizes and notes people, objects and actions, rather
  than asking for information.  Less
  popular than interviewing respondents 



 
7.11 What are the major kinds of data
you would want to collect about a competitor?
Examining data on their characteristics, objectives,
strategies, performance to date and their strengths and weaknesses in order to
gain insights into their future behaviour. 

7.12 What two kinds of measures need
to be merged to develop a meaningful measure of customer satisfaction?
The first has to do with understanding of the
criteria used by customers to evaluate the quality of the firms relationship
with them.  Knowing the product/service
attributes that constitute the customers choice.  Criteria as well as the relative importance of each should
facilitate this task.  Once these
attributes are identified they serve as the basis for developing expectation
measures
The second type of measurement is concerned with how
well the firm is meeting the customers expectations on an individual
attribute as well as an overall basis, Thus, if the choice criteria of a cruise
lines target market included such attributes as food, exercise facilities and
entertainment, then a performance measure would be developed for each . 
7.13 Define the term marketing
potential.
Market measurements are critical in determining, which
markets to target, what resources to allocate to each and whether the firms
sales performance is each is satisfactory.
7.14 How can one measure market
potential?
Via Single factor index  researchers use it most
successfully when the two items have a derived or complementary demand.
Multiple-factor indexes  - use a combination of two or more factors to estimate relative
market potentials,  multifactor index 
7.15 What is a marketing-decision
support system?
Marketing-Decision support systems (MDSS) deals with the use
of computer technology to enhance a marketers ability to identify and solve
problem on a continuous day-in day-out basis using a marketing-decision support
system.  -  It co-ordinates collection of data, systems, tools, and
techniques with supporting software and hardware by which organisation gathers
and interprets relevant information from business and its environment and turns
into a basis for marketing action.  
Highly flexible and action oriented
7.16 What is the future of MDSS?
Many have not progressed further in developing more
sophisticated system.  Major reason risk
involve din making large investments, given the difficulty of estimating the
return.  Al closely related problem is
that the success of such system depends heavily on the decision making
capabilities of the user.  
Companies will adopt during the next decade.  Increasingly empowering mangers throughout
the organisation to make bigger, more complex decisions more quickly because of
increased environmental dynamics. 
Becoming a critically needed resource 
7.17 What are the major ethical issues
in marketing research?
Potential to harm individuals when such information is used
worth their knowledge or/or consent, leading them to be excluded from or
included in activities in such a way that they are harmed economically,
psychologically or physically
Stem in large part from the interaction between the
researcher and respondents, clients and the general public.  Fir instance, respondent should not be
pressured to participate, should have the right to remain anonymous and should
not be deceived by fake sponsorship.  .
Module 8 Market Segmentation and Market
Targeting- Content Questions
8.1 Define market segmentation.
Involves subdividing the market place into distinct subsets
of customers having similar needs and wants, each of which can be reached with
a different marketing mix. lead them to respond in similar ways to a particular
product offering and strategic marketing Programme.  
 
 4 Classifications
Characteristics of the person
Nature of the situation in which the product or Service any
be purchased 
Geography
Culture and Subculture adopted by the consumer
8.2 Why is there a strong
interdependency between market segmentation, market targeting and positioning?
Determination of which segment target.  To do so would require evaluating the
relative attractiveness of each segment (size, revenue potential and growth
rate), the benefits sought and the firms relative business strengths.  This is called target marketing,
Finally product positioning  that is, designing product offerings and
developing strategic marketing programmes that collectively create an enduring
competitive advantage in the target market  would need to be undertaken.  
All must be well considered and implemented if the firm is
to be successful in managing a well considered and implemented if the firm is
to successful .
8.3 What is the rationale for market
segmentation?
Find an appropriate segmentation scheme that will facilitate
market targeting, product positioning and the formulation of successful
marketing strategies and programmes.  
8.4 What are the benefits of market
segmentation?
1)     
Identifies opportunities for new-product development
2)     
Segmentation helps in the design of marketing programmes that
are most effective for reaching homogenous groups of customers
3)     
It improves the strategic allocation of marketing
resources.  
8.5 Why is market segmentation of
growing importance?
1)     
Population growth has slowed
2)     
More product markets are maturing in turn sparks more intense competition
as firms seek growth via gains in market share.
3)     
Social and economic forces as expanding disposable incomes,
higher education level and more awareness of the world 
4)     
Important rend toward micro segmentation.  Accelerated by new technology 
5)     
Implementation of specialized marketing programmes by
broadening and segmenting their own services. 

8.6 What is the objective of the
market segmentation process?
Divide the market
into groups of prospective buyers of a product or service who are relatively
homogenous with regard to their demands.  
Ideally the variances within individual groups would be relatively
small.  
8.7 What
are the different types of descriptors used to segment consumer goods?
Industrial goods?
Consumer and Industrial Macro & Micro
ˇ       
Physical
ˇ       
General behavioral
ˇ       
Product- relatedness Behaviour
ˇ       
Customer Needs
8.8 Describe the two-step process used
to segment industrial markets.



Macro segmentation


Divides the market according to the characteristics of the
  buying organisation using such descriptors a geography, location, company
  size and industry affiliation. (SIC) International counterpart of SIC is the
  trade-category code




Micro segmentation


Groups customers by the characteristics of the individuals
  who influent the purchasing decision for instance, age, sex and position
  within the organisation 



 
8.9 What is geodemographic
segmentation? Why is it becoming increasingly important?
It attempts to predict consumer behaviour by making
demographic, psychographics and consumer information available at the bloc and
zip code levels.  
8.10 What are the requirements for
effective segmentation?
1)     
Adequate size
2)     
Measurability
3)     
Accessibility
4)     
Different response.
8.11 What are the two emerging
inter-country global segments?
Identify consumers with similar needs and wants reflected in
their behaviour in the marketplace across a range of countries.   Identifies consumer homogenous groups of
consumers across country segments.
8.12 Why, for many products, are
international markets becoming more homogeneous?
Similar segments have emerged in different countries at the
same time because of technological developments affecting communications,
transportation and travel,  developing
Global segments.  
8.13 What are the steps in
constructing a market-attractiveness/business-position matrix for evaluating
potential target markets?
1)                 
Choose criteria to measure attractiveness and competitive
position
2)                 
Weight attractiveness and competitive position factors to
reflect their relative importance
3)                 
Assess the current position of each potential target market on
each factor
4)                 
Project the future position of each market based on expected
environmental, customer and competitive trends
5)                 
Evaluate implications of possible future changes for business
strategies and resources requirements
8.14 What are the three most common
types of targeting strategy? Discuss each.



Mass Market


1)     
  Ignore any segment differences and design a single product
  and marketing program that will appeal to the larges number of
  consumers.  Capture sufficient volume
  to gain economies of scale and a cost advantage.  
2)     
  Design separate products and marketing programmes for the
  differing segments.  Differentiated
  marketing.  




Niche Market


Involves serving one or more segments that, while not the
  largest consist of substantial numbers of customer seeking somewhat
  specialized benefits from a product or service.   Designed to avoid direct competition with larger firms pursing
  bigger segments.




Growth Market


Target one or more fast-growth segments even though they
  may not currently be very large. 
  Favored by smaller competitors to avoid direct confrontation with
  larger firms while building volume and share for the future



 
8.15 Discuss the major inclusion and
exclusion ethical issues involved in market targeting.



Inclusion


Undesirable stereotypes. Include sex role, race or age
  stereotypes ie women a sex objects. 




Exclusion


Certain groups are deprived of the products or services
  but also that they may pay more for those they do receive. 



 
Module 9 Positioning Decisions - Content
Questions
9.1 What is meant by positioning?
Differentiation  the perceived fit between a particular
product and the needs of the target market. 
Defined relative to competitive offerings and consumer needs.  
9.2 What are the differences between
physical and perceptual positioning?
A business position its offering so that customers in the
target market perceive it as providing the desired benefits, thereby giving it
an advantage over current and potential customers. 
Physical position offerings are based on comparison on some
set of objective physical characteristics
9.3 What are the limitations of
physical positioning?
A simple comparison of only the physical dimensions of
alterative offerings usually does not provide a complete picture of relative
positions because positioning ultimately takes place in customers minds.  
9.4 What are the steps in the
positioning process?
1)                 
Identify relevant set of competitive products
2)                 
Identify the set of determinant attributes that define the
product space in which the positions of current offerings are located.
3)                 
Collect information from a sample of customers and potential
customers about perceptions of each product on the determinant attributes
4)                 
Analyze intensity of a products current position in
customers minds.
5)                 
Determine products current location in the product space
(product positioning)
6)                 
Determine customers most preferred combination of determinant
attributes
7)                 
Examination the fit between preferences of market segments and
the current positions of product (market positioning).
8)                 
Select positioning or repositioning strategy. 
9.5 What are some of the more common
types of bases used to distinguish one product or service from another?
1)     
Features  physical product position and industrial
products
2)     
Benefits  directly related to a product
3)     
Usage including end use , demographic,
psychographics or behavioral and popularity.
4)     
Parentage  who makes it, 
5)     
Manufacturing process  the subject of a firms
positioning efforts.
6)     
Ingredients - positioning concept illustrated by ie
pure cotton
7)     
Endorsements two types those by experts ie medical
professionals and those via emulation Michael Jordan using Nike shoes.
8)     
Comparison with a competitors product is commonplace
9)     
Pro-environment  positioning seeks to portray a
company as a good citizen 
10) 
Product Class  new different product type
11) 
Price/quality  
12) 
Country or geographic area
9.6 What constraints are imposed on a
brand with an intense position?
Developing a strong relationship between a brand and a
limited number of attributes.
9.7 What are the limitations of a
product positioning analysis?
It indicates how alterative products or brands are
positioned relative to one another in costumers; minds.  Does not tell the marketer which positions
are most appealing to customers.  
9.8 In choosing a given position for a
given brand, what factors should one consider?
Market targeting analysis and the results of a market
positioning analysis.  
Position should match the preferences of a particular market
segment and should take into account the current positions of competing
brands.  Also reflect the current and
future attractiveness of the target market and the relative strengths and
weaknesses of the competitors.  
9.9 What is a product intent share?
Product intent share represents the percentage of consumers
who intend to buy a specific brand before actually searching for it.  Integrates all factors that influence the
perceived qualities of a product.
9.10 How can the purchase intent share
that a brand might acquire in a given segment be estimated?
Based on the positions of existing brands and the
preferences of consumers in the segments. 
In a perceptual map obtained via multidimensional scaling,   based on the distance between a brands
position and the ideal points.  
9.11 What market dynamics should be
considered in evaluating the sales potential of alternative positions?
1)     
Growth of market segments
2)     
Evolution of segments ideal pints
3)     
Changes in position intensity
4)     
Evolution of existing brands positions
5)     
Emerging attributes
6)     
Development of new segments
7)     
Introduction of new brands.
9.12 Describe each of the various
market positioning strategies.



Monosegment
  positioning


Developing a product and marketing Programme tailored to
  the preferences of a single market segment. 
  




Multisegment positioning


Position a product so as to attract consumers from different
  segments. Provides higher economies of scale, requires smaller investments
  and avoids dispersion of managerial attention




 Standby
  positioning


Not in best economic interest of a firm to switch from
  multisegmeent position to monosegment (assumes use several brands, each
  positioned to serve the needs of only one segment) only implement monosegment
  when forced to do so. 




Imitative positioning


Head-on strategy where a new brand targets a position similar
  to that of an existing successful brand.




Anticipatory positioning


Position anew brand in anticipation of the evolution of a
  segments needs. This is particularly appropriate when the new brand is not
  expected to have a fast acceptance and market share will build as the needs
  of consumers become more and more aligned with the benefits being
  offered.  




Adaptive Positioning


Periodically repositioning a brand to follow the evolution
  of the segments needs.




Defensive positioning. 


When a firm occupies a strong position in a market segment
  with a single brand, it is vulnerable to imitative positioning
  strategies.  Pre-empt competitive
  strategies by introducing similar poison for the same segment.  



 
Part 3 Developing Strategic Marketing
Programmes
Module 10 Business Strategies and Marketing
Programme Decisions - Content Questions
10.1 What are the basic/generic
competitive strategies? Describe each briefly.
1)     
Overall cost leadership
2)     
Differentiation  building customer perceptions of
superior product quality, design or service
3)     
Focus in which the business avoids direct confrontation
with its major competitors by concentration on narrowly defied market niches. 
10.2 What are the characteristics of
Miles and Snows four business strategies?



Prospector


ˇ       
  Operates within a broad product-market domain that
  undergoes periodic redefinition
ˇ       
  Values being a first mover in new product and
  market areas, even if not all of these efforts prove to be highly profitable.
ˇ       
  Responds rapidly to early signals concerning areas of
  opportunity, and these responses often lead to new rounds of competitive
  actions.
ˇ       
  Competes primarily by stimulating and meeting new
  market opportunities but may not maintain strength over time in all markets
  it enters. 




Defender


ˇ       
  Attempts to locate and maintain a secure position in
  relatively stable product or service areas.
ˇ       
  Offers relatively limited rage of products or
  services compared to competitors
ˇ       
  Tries to protect its domain by offering lower price,
  higher quality or better service than competitors.
ˇ       
  Usually not at the fore front technological / new
  product development in its industry; tends to ignore industry changes not
  directly related to its area of operation.




Analyser


ˇ       
  An intermediate type; makes fewer and slower
  product-market changes than prospectors, but is less committed to stability
  and efficency than defenders
ˇ       
  Attempts to maintain a stable, limited line of
  products or services, but carefully follows a selected set of promising new
  developments in its industry.
ˇ       
  Seldom a first mover, but often a second or third
  entrant in product markets related to its existing market base  often with a
  lower-cost or higher-quality product or service offering.




Reactor


ˇ       
  Lacks any well-defined competitive strategy
ˇ       
  Does not have as consistent a product market
  orientation as its competitors
ˇ       
  Not as will to assume the risks of new-product or
  market development as its competitors
ˇ       
  Not as aggressive in marketing established products
  as some competitors 
ˇ       
  Responds primarily when it is forced to by
  environmental pressures..



10.3 How do low-cost defender,
differentiated defender, prospector and analyzer differ with respect to their
scope, cash needs and synergy?



Dimensions


Low Cost Defender


Differentiated Defender


Prospector 


Analyzer




Scope


Mature/stable/well defined domain; mature technology and
  customer segments


Mature / stable 0 well defined domain; mature technology
  and customer segment


Broad/ dynamic domains; technology and customer segments
  not well established.


Mixture of defender and prospect strategies.  




Resources


Generate excess cash (cash cow)


Generate excess cash (cash cow)


Need cash for product development (question marks or
  stars)


Need cash for product development but less so tan do
  prospectors




Synergy


Need to seek operating synergies to achieve efficiencies


Need to seek operating synergies to achieve efficiencies


Danger is sharing operating facilities and programmes 
  better to share technology/ marketing skills.

Market
  characteristics


Industry in
  introductory or early growth stage of life cycle, many potential customer

10.6 Do service businesses require
different strategies? Why? Why not?
Services can be thought of as intangibles and goods as
tangibles.  Service can rarely be
experienced in advance of the sale while goods can be experienced even tested
before purchase. 
Many organizations are concerned with producing and
marketing a service as their primary offering rather than as an adjunct to a
physical product.  
Have the same implications as those for goods
producers.  
Module 11 
Product and Services Decisions - Content Questions
11.1 What is a product? Describe its
various components.
A product can be defined as anything that satisfies a want
or need through use, consumption or acquisition.  It included subjects, services, places, people activities, and
ideas. 
11.2 Describe the four subgroups of
consumer goods.
11.3 What are the marketing strategy
implications of this classification?



 


Examples


Strategy
  elements stressed




Convenience goods


  toothpaste, soap
  


 Maximum distribution, consumer advertising 




Shopping goods 


 Colour TV, cars 


 Available in limited number of stores, personal selling
  important, limited to extensive advertising, seller often offer financing,
  warranties and post purchase service




Specialty goods


  Musical instruments, stereo equipment 


 Limited distribution high price strong advertising to
  promote brand uniqueness and where available locally




Unsought Goods 


 Certain medical services, insurance, 


 - Strong
  promotion, including personal selling.



 
11.4 How do the earlier decisions
concerning targeting and positioning affect the composition of the product line
as well as the attributes of individual products?
Earlier steps in the marketing management process constrain
a business units product strategy  especially market targeting and market
positioning which have an impact on the composition of the product line and the
attributes of individual products.  
11.5 How do the various stages in the
product life cycle constrain product strategy?
As times change the environment in
which the business unit competes, the result is likely to be a change in its
product strategy, constrained by the products life cycle. 
11.6 What
are the characteristics of a high-share global strategy?
1)     
A drive for a strong international market-share position
2)     
Products with a high degree of international standardization
3)     
A marketing Programme  especially price, product line and
advertising  geared to the mass market.
4)     
Large expenditures on design and R&D relative to the
industrys norm.  Because of the large
volume of sales, these costs on a unit basis are low.
5)     
The use of regional production facilities or a rationalized
global network designed to reduce logistics costs.
11.7 Under what conditions should a firm
adopt a localization strategy?
The premise that products and programmes must be adapted to
the needs and wants of individual countries because of environmental
differences especially cultural ones,.  
Often occurs because of mandatory adaptation * that is, the foreign
market requires it).  
11.8 Discuss briefly the effect of
each positioning strategy on product decisions.
Single (mono) product line is typically shorten than
if it undertakes a multisegment positioning strategy, In a defensive
positioning strategy a firm with a successful brand introduces a second
similar brand to pre-empt a competitors initiative strategy,  similar to a flanker or fighting
brand, which counters the moves made by competitors by offering retailers
certain price and advertising concessions. 

11.9 How does each of the three major
types of business strategy constrain a firms product strategy?



Prospector Strategies


Center on new-product development, which encourages broad
  and technically advanced lines




Analyzers


Concerned with defending their established business,
  either by using a low cost approach or by differentiating their product
  offering on the basis of quality and service.  Some attention to new-product development.




Defender


Similar to Analyzers except the defenders devote fewer
  resources to the development of new products, have smaller product lines (on
  average) and wherever possible differentiate themselves from competitors via
  service.  



Three major types of business strategies constrain a firms product
strategy with respect to its breadth, technical sophistication, quality and
service. 
11.10 What are the eight dimensions of
quality? How do these affect a firms quality strategies?



Performance


Has to do with a products basic operating characteristics,




Features


Secondary product characteristics that are designed to
  enhance the products basic functions.




Reliability


Is the probability that a product will perform
  satisfactorily over a given period.  




Conformance


The extent to which a products operating characteristics
  meet certain specifications.




Durability


Measure of the life of a product, technical (replacement)
  and economic (repair cost)




Serviceability


Concerned with the speed and ease of obtaining competent
  repair.




Aesthetics


How product looks, feels, sounds, tastes, and smells




Perceived quality


Results from the use of indirect measures since the
  consumer may lack or not understand information about a products attributes.
  



 
11.11 How does branding benefit
consumers? Sellers?



Consumers


Simplifies shopping, facilitates the processing of
  information concerned with purchase options, provides confidence that the consumer
  made the right decision.




Seller


Enhances effectiveness of their marketing Programme
  promotion
Brand loyalty which in turn leads to greater profitability
Opportunities for successfully launching brand extensions
Prices and margins resulting from a competitive advantage
Channel relationships.



11.12 Under what conditions is
branding particularly effective?
When it is difficult for the consumer to measure the
products quality objectively.  Status, large
enough market to warrant the cost of branding, differentiate product.
11.13 Why in America have high quality
store brands gained considerable share as against national brands?
In the 80s the national brands regularly increased their
prices along with making massive distributions of coupons, thereby training
consumers to shop on price.  Large
number of line extensions and in general, focused less on brand equity.  Taking advantage of the price vulnerability
of many national brands.  Strong in the
soft goods trade.  
11.14 Discuss briefly the various
branding strategy options.



Individual Branding


Each product has a distinctive name.  I.e. Proctor and Gamble (Tide, Luvs,
  Crest, Pringles)




Family Branding


Same brand name to cover a group of products i.e.
  Campbells soups Sears Kenmore appliances




No brand brand Name


Examples include generic, no-frills, unbranded,  




Multipe Brands strategy


Company deliberately competes against itself i.e. General Motors
  (Buick versus Oldsmobile versus Pontiac)



 
11.15 Define each of the following:



Line filling.


Lengthens the product line by adding items within the
  present range , objective to satisfy more customers, increase sales and
  profits




Line stretching.


 Involves
  lengthening the product line beyond its current range of variables, such as
  size and price.  




Line extensions.


Introduction of new products that differ significantly
  form those in the existing line certainly by more than just size and
  price.  - Greater costs 
and financial risks than product line filling or
  stretching strategies



.  
11.16 How does the fact that services
are intangible affect marketing management?
Differentiates service from a good.  The degree to which a service is intangible
affects the getting and keeping of customers. 
Consumers are forced to buy the promise of a service.  They are intangible; hence marketers need to
make them tangible to prospective buyers.  

11.17 Discuss briefly the five
criteria consumers use to evaluate service quality.



Tangibles


Appearance of physical characteristics




Reliability


Dependable performance




Responsiveness


Promptness and helpfulness




Assurance


Competence, courtesy and credibility




Empathy


Good communication and customer understanding



Module 12 
Developing and Testing New Products and Services- Content Questions
12.1 How can the variation in
new-product failure-rate estimates be explained?
Some studies examine the proportion of new-product concepts
or ideas that fail to achieve commercial success, while others focus only on
products that fail after being introduced into the market.  
12.2 Why is it becoming increasingly
difficult to introduce new products successfully?
Maturity of many basic technologies, shorter product life
cycles, increasing competition, government regulations and the increased costs
of new-product development process.  
12.3 Why are more and more firms using
teams to introduce new products?
One of the advantages of using teams is their ability to
reduce the time of the new product development process by fostering closer
relations between various functional areas.  
Reduces time to gain approval from one area.
12.4 What are the major steps of the
new-product development process?
1)     
New product objective and strategy
2)     
Opportunity identification, idea generation and screening

12.5 What are the more important
reactive strategies for new-product development?
Defensive strategy adjusts a firms existing
products so they can better compete against a recently introduced competitive
product
Imitative strategy quickly copies a new
product
Second-but-better strategy improves on a
competitors new product
Responsive strategy reacts to consumer request
for a new or improved product. 
12.6 How can proactive strategies be
implemented?
R&D strategy strives to develop superior
technical products
Marketing Strategy based on finding a consumer
need and then developing a product to fill it.
Entrepreneurial foster development of new
improved products.
Acquisition strategy whereby a firm buys new
products to bring to market. 
12.7 What are the more important
sources of new product ideas?
ˇ       
Customers
ˇ       
Company personnel
ˇ       
Channels of distribution
ˇ       
Competitors
ˇ       
Government Agencies
ˇ       
Old products (brands)
ˇ       
Miscellaneous sources
12.8 What are the various ways new
product ideas can be tested?
Screening process 
depends on constraints set forth in the firms new product strategy.
 
Scoring models early stages of new product
development process  use limited number
of review criteria to more sophisticated ones. Easy to use and low in
cost.  When only rough distinctions are
required among projects.  
 
12.9 Describe a core benefit
proposition.
CBP  states what is
being offered to consumers, what they will derive from it and why this is
important all in terms of consumer benefits. 

12.10 How can new products be tested?
Laboratory Tests  can often accurately measure the
performance of certain types of products and a variety of conditions
Consumer tests informal in-house use test a
sample of consumers as asked to use the product and then fill out a
questionnaire. Highly structured blind-paired comparison tests.  Consumer does not know the brands
involved.  Ie taste test panels. To
elaborate computer analyses.
12.11 Describe a laboratory test
market and how it operates.
Mostly applicable to packaged consumer products, mainly
food, household and some personal care items. 
The procedure measures the process by which a consumer adopts a new
product.  The process consists of three
major steps:  awareness, trial and
repeat buying. 
12.12 Describe electronic mini-test
markets.
A.C. Nielsen and Information Resources Behaviour Scan. . The
latter pioneered the technology that monitors the purchasing and viewing
behaviour of a sample of household in eight or so small cities across the
United States.  Panel member show their
id card at the supermarket checkout, a scanner records their purchases and the
data are sent directly to a central computer. 

12.13 Under what conditions would a
firm be well advised to forgo a full-scale test market?
If The companys market share total sales and repeat buying
measurements clearly exceed expectations there is no reason not to proceed with
national distribution.
12.14 Describe briefly the various
commercialization strategies.
Forego market testing and move directly to a roll-out region
by region or nationally from the outset. 

Extension of the full-scale test market, which was designed
to test a national introductory plan.
Roll-out test rather than an elaborate market test
Test area where the company has strong resources in order to
lead from strength to get things moving.
Multiple channels roll out 

Based on the trade-offs between risk and the need to plan
the cash flow for the introduction and the speed with which competitors are
likely to react.  
12.15 What problems are involved in
applying the new-product development process to services?
Testing a new service can pose problems since the presence
of the consumer in the service system makes it difficult to develop a service
that is uniform or consistent.  Service
companies try to get around this problem in a variety of ways they use machines
(automatic bank tellers) .  
12.16 What are the major ethical
issues involved in the development of new products?
 
Business is critics for excessive production of me-too
products, leads to waste in the economic system.  
Reverse that business fails to produce products that are
needed such as products for people with unusual physical attributes. 
Safety into products
Impact of Product and Packaging on the environment.
Module 13 
Pricing  Decisions - Content
Questions
13.1 Why has price become a more
important part of a firms marketing strategy in recent years?
Slower growth, the maturing of many basic industries,
improved productivity, the growing power of retailers and their private labels
and the increased aggressiveness of low-cost global competitors have made domestic
markets more price competitive. Resulting in pricing and price competition
becoming number one priority in the 1990s.
13.2 Why is price an area in which
managers feel the most pressure to perform yet the least certain they are doing
a good job?
For the most part, managers believe that they dont have
control over price.  The market dictates
it yet anything closer to the right price can have a tremendous impact.  
13.3 What are the steps in the
price-setting decision process?
Influences and Constraints
ˇ       
SBU and marketing strategies
ˇ       
Target market characteristics
ˇ       
Product characteristics
ˇ       
Competitor characteristics
ˇ       
Company strengths and weaknesses
ˇ       
Environmental influences
o      
Economic trends
o      
Legal restrictions
o      
 
The price-setting decision process
1)     
Set strategic pricing objective
2)     
Estimate demand and price elasticity of demand
3)     
Determine cost and their relationship to volume
4)     
Examine competitors prices and costs
5)     
Select a method for calculating prince
6)     
Set a price level
7)     
Adapt price structure to meet variations in demand and cost
across geographic territories, market segments, etc.
8)     
 
13.4 Under what conditions is
penetration pricing appropriate?
When in addition to a large market:
1)                 
Target customers are relatively sensitive to price
2)                 
The firms costs are low compared to those of competitors and
the SBU is pursing a low-cost strategy
3)                 
Production and distribution costs per unit are likely to fall
substantially with increasing volume.
4)                 
Low prices may discourage potential competitors from entering
the market.  
13.5 Describe a skimming price policy.
Setting the price very high and appealing to only the least
price-sensitive segment of potential customers.  This can also be accomplished over time, as in periodic
discounting, when the seller prices high at the beginning of each period and
low at the end.    Used normally in
pioneer development of a new product market. 
Maximize short-run profits.
13.6 Describe a harvesting price
strategy.
Maximize short-term profits before demand for the product
disappears.  Typically involves cutting
marketing, production and operating costs of the product while setting a
relatively high price to maintain margins and maximize profits.  
13.7 What are the major factors
affecting a customers sensitivity to price?
1)     
Buyers willingness to pay a given price for a product is
influenced by their perception and preferences: their needs, desires, awareness
of and attitude towards the item in question
2)     
The price, availability and attractiveness of alternative
brands and substitutes products affect buyers willingness to buy the product. 
3)     
Size of their incomes relative to the price influences
customers ability to pay for a product or service.
Taken together, these factors
determine the perceived value a potential customer will associate with a given
product-market entry and price he or she will pay.
13.8 Define the term elasticity of
demand.
The larger the proportion of price-sensitive customers in a
products market the more sensitive overall demand is to a change in the
products price.  The degree of
responsiveness of demand to a price change is referred to as the price
elasticity of demand.
 
13.9 What is the formula for
calculating the price elasticity of demand for a product or service?
 
Price elasticity of demand (E) = %change in quantity
demanded / %
change in price
13.10 What are the major problems in
using this formula?
ˇ       
Failure to consider the response of competitors to the
companys change in price
ˇ       
The demand may be inelastic for a given price change,
but elastic for a larger amount
ˇ       
That elasticity is measure din terms of sales revenues
not profit margins (one reason being that it does not take into account scale
effects)
ˇ       
A lowering of price may affect the sales of others in
the companys product line 
ˇ       
It ignores any societal benefits that may be accorded
to the company for benefiting low-income segments via a price reduction
13.11 What are the more common ways of
estimating a products demand curve?
1)     
approach is to survey a sample of consumers, or bring them
into a laboratory setting, and ask them how much of the product they would buy
at different possible prices. -Validity is questionable,
2)     
estimating the price-quantity relationship via the regression
analysis of historical sales using consumer panel data, 
3)     
in-store experiments where a products price is systematically
varied, or 
4)     
multiple test markets.  
This is expensive.
13.12 How can competitors costs and
prices be estimated?
Track the price, cost and relative quality of each
competitors offer.
Competitors costs are harder to measure than their
price.  Reverse engineering can be used
to take apart competing products and examinee the cost of their components,
packing and production process.  
13.13 Describe (using an example)
cost-plus or mark-up pricing, rate-of-return or target return pricing and
break-even pricing.
Cost plus or mark up pricing is simply to add
a standard mark-up to the cost of the product.
rate-of-return
or target return this uses the same method as markup price but adds the
cost of capital tied up in producing and distributing the product.
break-even
pricing   This is the variable cost
per unit and fixed costs the volume necessary to just cover total costs.  
13.14 Describe the various
competition-oriented pricing methods.
Going  rate or competitive parity  - where all try to maintain prices equal to
those of one or more major competitors. 
Used when little product differentiation and a few large
competitors.  
Discount or premium price policies  base its pricing
on what its competitors are charging, but try to hold its price either below or
above the competition.
Sealed bidding buyers request a formal bid with no
later opportunity for change.
13.15 Describe the various
customer-oriented pricing methods.



Perceived Value 


 potential customers usually have some idea of what
  constitutes a good or bad price.  




Customary Prices 


-  consumers expect
  a single customary price for products i.e. Candy bars at a customary price of
  10 cents when cost put pressure on manufactures margins, they reduced size of
  bar rather than upset customers expectation by raising the price.




Price Lining


Selling all products in a category at one of several
  predetermined price points or levels. 
  Each price line represent a different level of quality.  




Psychological pricing


users use price as an indication of quality.




Promotional pricing


most common type is sale: the offer of a reduced price on
  a product for a limited time.



 
13.16 Define the following terms:



FOB origin pricing.


The
  manufacturer places the goods free on board a transportation carrier.  At this point the title and responsibility
  pass to the customer, who pays the freight form the factory to the
  destination.




freight absorption pricing.


The
  seller picks up all or part of the freight charges.  New competitors trying to penetrate new markets and smaller
  competitors in maturing industries trying to increase their share 




zone pricing.


Is
  another compromise approach that falls between FOB and uniform delivered
  pricing.  Here the company divides the
  country into two or more pricing zones. 
  IT charges all customers within the same zone the same delivered
  price, but a higher price is set for distant zones than for those closer to
  the plant. 



13.17 Describe the various forms
counter trade can take.



Barter


Direct  exchange of
  goods with no money and no third party involved.




Compensation deals


Seller agrees to take some % of the payment in cash and the
  rest in goods.




Buyback arrangements


Seller offers a plant, equipment, or technical exercise to
  a customer and agrees to accept a partial payment products manufactured with
  the equipment or training supplied.




Offsets


Seller compensated in cash but agrees to spend a
  substantial amount of that cash with e customer or its government over a
  stated time period.



 
13.18 Define trade or functional
discounts, quantity discounts, co-operative advertising allowances and rebates.



Trade or functional discounts


A discount from the suggested retail list price.  This discount is given to the wholesaler
  and / or retailer.




Quantity discounts


Discount increases as order size increases.




Cooperative advertising


A temporary reduction in the products price.  I.e. Pepsis offer of 15 cans of soda for
  the price of a 12-pack.




 Allowance


Similar to discounts In they inducements to encourage
  channel members or final customers to engage in specific behaviors in support
  of the product.  I.e. car is a
  trade-in allowance.   




Rebates


Rebates reduce the price of the product through a
  money-refund offer.  Example mail in
  rebate.



13.19 What conditions allow for price
discrimination?
Not always possible or wise to set different prices for
essential the same product.  
1)     
Must be obviously be identifiable customer segments with
different price sensitivities
2)     
Either the customer segments must be physically separated from
one another or
 the firm must institute control procedures to ensure that the
segment paying the lower price cannot resell the product o customers paying the
higher price. 
3)     
The cost to the manufacturer of segmenting and monitoring the
market should not exceed the extra revenue generated by the discriminatory
pricing. 
4)     
The firm should be confident that resentment among customer
asked to pay the higher price, or competitive conditions in the market, will
not leave it vulnerable to competitive attacks in the high price segments.
5)     
The firm should pay careful attention to the legal
restrictions involved in price discrimination.

Distribution Decisions - Content Questions
14.1 Define a marketing channel.
The set of interdependent organizations involved in the
process of making a product or service available for consumption or use by
consumers or industrial users.

found in marketing channels.



Merchant wholesalers


Take title to the goods they handle; sell primarily to
  other resellers industrial and commercial customers rather than to individual
  customers.




Agent middlemen


Includes manufacturers representatives and brokers.  Also sell to other resellers and
  industrial or commercial customers, but do not take title to the goods.  Usually specialize in the selling function
  and represent client manufacturers on a commission basis.




Retailers


Sell goods and services directly to ultimately consumer s

  marketing functions, work on a fee-f0r-service basis to help clients perform
  those functions more effectively and efficiently. 



 
14.3 Define the following:



Rack jobber

  wholesaler.  In recent years
  supermarkets and drugstores have added non-traditional product lines such a
  magazines, housewares, and health and beauty aids about which they have
  little knowledge.  Rack jobbers have
  prospered by not only performing a full range of wholesaling activities by
  also taking over some retain functions such as providing display racks,
  promotional materials, stocking and selling on consignment. 




Manufacturers agent.

  to consumers




Channel C


Wholesalers and retailers and is most common for low-cost
  frequently purchased items




Channel D


Agent sells to wholesalers who in turn sell to retailers,
  is used when the manufacture is too small or its product line too narrow to
  justify a company sales force.

15.4 Consumers
engage in practices designed to protect themselves from receiving unwanted
messages. Describe these practices.



Selective exposure


Expose themselves to messages and media that are
  compatible with their existing attitudes, 
  Avoid messages not compatible with their attitudes or that they find
  irritating or boring.




Selective perception


People distort or misinterpret the intended meaning of a
  message when it differs from their attitudes.  The greater the attitude change required to make respondents
  accept the position advocated in the message, the more likely the message is
  to be distorted or rejected.




Selective retention


People the to forget more quickly communications that are
  substantially at variance with their attitudes.  People remember for a longer time messages that reinforce their
  attitudes.

ˇ       
Advertising objective
ˇ       
Target audience
ˇ       
Major selling idea  or key benefits
ˇ       
Creative strategy statement (campaign theme, appeal and
execution technique)
ˇ       
Support information 
15.11 What have researchers concluded
regarding what message structures are most effective?
Success of any message depends not only on its content, but
also on its structure.  
Two-sided presentations           generally
more effective with those members of the audience who are well educated or
opposed to the communicators position. 
Prepare people for counterarguments. 

Drawing conclusions     the
best thing to do, although advertisability of doing so depends on the
intelligence of the audient, the complexity of the subject matter presented and
the extend to which the audience is involved.
Optimum size    of a
message is difficult to ascertain because of the interactions of message size,
the power of the message itself and effect of repletion on consumer
learning.  Strongly liked to the degree
of consumer interest in the product. 
Low interest require high or large unit message i.e. full page
advertisement 30 second television spot.
Message is of great interest to the target audience a
smaller unit may suffice.
15.12 What problems arise from using
reach and frequency measures?

Defining
     the target audience and correlating ti with audiences reached by the
     various media vehicles.
Defining
     exposure  is it an opportunity to be exposed to a given message or is it
     an actual reading of a print advertisement, the actual watching of a
     television commercial or the actual listening to an advertisement on
     radio?  Difficult task to measure
     exposure, no matter how it is defined.
Not
     all who are exposed are of equal value to the advertiser 0 some may not
     even be prospects
How
     should successive exposures be weighted? 
     Is a second exposure worth more than third? How much? And how much
     time should else between exposures.

15.13 What are the advantages and
limitations of each of the four types of mass media?



Television


best at communicating images and symbols because it can
  demonstrate product usage and consumer reactions.  Enormous reach almost all US households have a TV set.  




Radio


less involving than television, but offers economy and the
  opportunity to target specific audiences- Hispanics, blacks, teenagers,
  senior citizens.  
Inexpensive compared with TV
reaches people mostly when they are doing something
  else-working, driving or walking.  
  Often used to reinforce TV advertising




Printed media


more involving than broadcast media, Readers select what
  advertising they want to read and take as much time as they wish to read
  it.  Effective in communicating
  specific information about a product. 
  Particular important for most industrial products and high-involvement
  consumer goods. (three major types of magazines, consumer, farm and
  business), Newspapers advertise consists mainly of retail and classified. 




Out of home, exhibition and supplementary media


cover wide variety of media typed Out-of home  Billboards
  are most prominent  Exhibition 
  in-store display materials




Supplementary Directories and yellow pages


 




Event sponsorship 


become increasingly popular high visibility in terms of
  media coverage, 



15.14 Why have retailers had
difficulty in using the Web?
It requires subscribing to an Internet access service as
well as the hardware and software to facilitate accessing the site and
exploring the company information fields, 
Technical support needed to maintain the system, including its update
and security.  Advertising costs
associated with maximizing site traffic and guiding visitors through the files.
15.15 How are print medium audiences
typically measured?
Researches conduct interviews however when to conduct the
interview is also a problem
15.16 What are the major problems in
measuring television audiences?
Researchers can measure the number of sets tuned to a given
programme, how long they are tuned to a given programme but do not know the demographics
of the individual viewing , the number of actual views, does not record who is
looking at the television especially during commercials.
15.17 Describe the various ways to
pre-test message effectiveness.



Recall test


Print advertisement are inserted into a simulated magazine
  and respondents are told to read whatever interest them  After doing so, they are asked to ply
  back advertisements they remember.




Television Commercials 


Tested by exposing them in one or more cities and
  following up with several hundred phone interview to find out how many
  remember the message




Project tests


Give respondents an advertisement and using a variety of
  projective techniques to elicit responses. 
  




Physiological test


Use special machines to measure physiological responses to
  advertising.




Pupil Dilation


When person is viewing or listening to interesting
  pleasant message the pupil dilates.




Sales test


Administered by commercial research firms measure the
  effects of television commercials through the use of consumer panels located
  in a number of small cities.




Theatre tests 


Similar to the above except the audiences reaction to
  commercials is measured electronically during the showing via buttons the audience
  pushes to indicate liking / disliking.




On Air testing 


Using VHF
  or cable television channel to air a given program in which the advertisement
  will appear.



15.18 Describe the various ways to
measure the effects of an advertising message after it has run.



Recognition test


Most popular post-exposure testing.  Field workers interview people who say
  they have read a given issue of a magazine. 
  Respondent goes through the issue pointing out what was seen and
  read.  Interviewer asks which parts
  were read. Interviewer starts each interview at a random point within the
  issue, so that ratings are not affected by respondent fatigue.




Recall tests


Measure the effectiveness of an advertising message
  especially a television commercial after it has been run.  Respondents are typically aided In their
  recall.  Interviews show them a list
  of the advertisers and brands presented and ask which ones they have seen
  recently.  Interviewers proceed to
  obtain play backs of these advertisement from the respondents.



15.19 Discuss the use of a globalised
advertising strategy as compared with a localized one.
The benefit of globalize is in the form of economies of scale,
which relate primarily to production costs and to a lesser extent to the use
international media.
Okay for product component of the marketing mix especially
for industrial goods and consumer durables. 

Difficulties encountered by differences in local cultures,
translation, how consumer respond to humorous appeals, sexual appeals
reactions,  Start with standard /
globalize and expand to local as required.
15.20 Define the term sales
promotion.
Those marketing activities, other than personal selling,
advertising and publicity, that stimulate consumer purchasing and dealer
effectiveness
15.21 What are the most commonly used
sales promotion techniques?
ˇ       
Price off promotions, 
ˇ       
premiums, 
ˇ       
sampling, 
ˇ       
rebates, 
ˇ       
contests 
ˇ       
sweepstakes 
ˇ       
trade promotions. 

15.22 Define the term public
relations.
A promotional function that uses two-way communication to
mesh the needs and interest of an institution or persons with the needs and
interests of the various publics with which that intuition or person must
communicate.
15.23 Define the term integrated
communications plan.
The process of building and reinforcing mutually profitable
relationships with employees, customers, other stakeholders and the general
public by developing and coordinating a strategic communications programme that
enables them to make constructive contact with the company brand through a
variety of media.
15.24 Discuss the problems in
regulating and controlling deception in advertising.
It is difficult to detect in many cases because of the subtle
ways in which it can work.   Enforcement
is hindered by the fact that advertisers can legally employ puffery which
uses subjective claims the best or greatest to promote a product.

Part 5 Implementing & Controlling
Strategic Marketing Programmes
Module 19 
Implementing Business and Marketing Strategies - Content Questions
19.1 What are the three aspects of the
relationship between corporate headquarters and the business unit that determine the
SBUs success in implementing a particular competitive strategy?
 
1 The degree of
autonomy provided to each business unit manager.
2 The degree to
which the business unit shares functional programmes and facilities with other
units.
3 The manner in
which the corporation evaluates and rewards the performance of its SBU
managers.
19.2 Successful implementation of a
given strategy is more likely under what conditions?
When the business has the functional competencies demanded
by its strategy and supports them with substantial resources relative to those
of competitors, is organized suitably for its technical, market and competitive
environment and has developed appropriate mechanisms for co-ordinating efforts
and resolving conflicts across functional departments.
19.3 What additional functional-area
competencies are needed for success for service organisations  especially
those involving high customer contact?
service organisations  and manufacturers that provide high
levels of customer service as part of their product offering  often need some
additional functional competencies because of the unique problems involved in
delivering quality service.
close co-ordination between operations, sales and marketing
is crucial. Also, because many different employees may be involved in producing
and delivering the service  production planning and standardisation are needed
to reduce variations in quality from one transaction to the next. Similarly,
detailed policies and procedures for dealing with customers are necessary to
reduce variability in customer treatment across employees. All of this suggests
that personnel management  particularly the activities of employee selection,
training, motivation and evaluation  is an important adjunct to the production
and marketing efforts of high-contact service organisations.
19.4 Organisational adaptiveness and
innovativeness are enhanced under what conditions?
1)     
decision-making authority is decentralised; 
2)     
managerial discretion and informal co-ordination mechanisms
replace rigid rules and policies; and 
3)     
more specialists are present. Thus, prospector business units
and their marketing departments are likely to perform better when they are
decentralised, have little formalisation and are highly specialised 
19.5 Under what conditions is a
functional type of organisation best to use? And a product-management type?



Functional type 


companies operating in stable and slow-growth industries
  where the environments are predictable. Thus, the form is appropriate for
  low-cost defender SBUs attempting to maximise their efficiency and
  profitability in mature or declining industries.




Product management type


When an SBU has many product-market entries, this form
  adds an additional layer of managers to the marketing department, usually
  called product managers, brand managers or marketing managers, each of whom
  has the responsibility to plan and manage the marketing programmes and to
  co-ordinate the activities of other functional departments for a specific
  product or product line.



19.6 Discuss briefly the recent
organisational design developments.
Managing of business processes in contrast to functional
areas.  Every business has about six
basic or core processes, such as, for example, new-product development and
materials flow. The former would be staffed by individuals from marketing,
R&D, manufacturing and finance. The latter would contain people with
expertise in purchasing, manufacturing, order delivery and billing.
 
Managing processes will make the organisation
essentially horizontal  flat (few layers) and lean  in contrast to a vertical
or hierarchical model. Thus, executive positions will no longer be defined in
terms of managing a group of functionally oriented people; instead, executives
will be concerned with a process that strongly emphasises the importance of
customer satisfaction.  Process
management is quite different from the management of a function because, 
1)     
It uses external objectives  for example, customer
satisfaction rather than simple revenues. 
2)     
People with different skills are grouped to undertake a
complete piece of work; their work is done simultaneously, not in sequence. 
3)     
Information flows directly to where it is used. Thus, if you
have an upstream problem, you deal with the people involved directly rather
than via your boss.
19.7 What are the more common
international organisational structures?



Functional type


 Would have
  vice presidents (worldwide) for such areas as manufacturing, marketing and
  finance  all reporting to the president.




Products based


giving SBUs worldwide control over their product lines. The
  main advantages of this type of structure are the economies derived from
  centralising manufacturing activities and the ability to respond quickly to
  product-related problems originating in overseas markets. Marketing is
  localised at the country or regional level.




Area structure


when there is considerable variance across markets
  regarding product acceptance and marketing activities. Firms typically
  organise on a regional basis (North America, Latin America, Far East, Middle
  East and Africa) using a central staff that co-ordinates worldwide planning
  and control activities.




Hybrid organisation 


combination of the functional, product or area types of
  structure. The global matrix is one such attempt. It has individual business managers
  reporting to both area and functional groups, or area managers reporting to
  business and functional groups, thereby enabling the company to balance the
  need for centralised efficiency and its responsiveness to local needs. But
  the dual reporting sets up conflicts and slows the management process to such
  an extent that many companies, have returned to more traditional
  organisational designs



19.8 What are the major components of
an annual marketing plan for a given product?
 



I


Executive summary


  Presents a short
  overview of the issues, objectives, strategy and actions incorporated in the
  plan and their expected outcomes for quick management review.

  contingency plans to be used if performance falls below expectations or the
  situation changes.



 
19.9 What subject areas should be
discussed under the analysis of the current situation section of the annual
marketing plan?



Market Situation

  size growth trends, variations across geographic regions or other market
  segments.  Market research information
  re customer perceptions and buying behaviour trends




Competitive Situation


Identifies and describes the products major competitors
  in terms of their size, market share, product quality, marketing strategies

  bearing on the products future. 
  Relevant economic, technological, political/ legal or social/cultural
  changes.

in the discussion of a companys action plan for a given product.
Specific actions necessary to implement the strategy for the
product are listed, together with a clear statement of who is responsible for
each action, when it will be done and how much is to spent o each activity.

control process?
 










 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

20.2 Why are more and more firms using
non-financial control measures in addition to the traditional financial-based measures?
What are some of the more commonly used non-financial measures?
 
Companies are turning to measure they feel better reflect
how their mangers think about what decision areas drive the firms success 
such as
            Customer
satisfaction
            Product
quality
            Market
share
            New-product
development
20.3 How have some of the new types of
organisational structure posed difficult control problems?
ˇ       
Many objectives can best be measured in no-financial
terms
ˇ       
Profits is a short- term ensure and can be manipulated
by taking actions that may prove dysfunction in the longer term
ˇ       
Profits can be affected factors over which management
has no control 
ˇ       
Setting milestones that are achievable.  Such systems can cause actions to be taken
that in the short term may help attain the desired goals, but in the longer
term may be detrimental to the firm.
20.4 Describe the use of benchmarking
as a performance type of measure.
The firms performance in a given area is compared against
the performance other companies.  The
comparison does not however have to be with companies in the same
industry.  
20.5 What are the advantages of using
the marginal contribution method to determine a products profitability?
A product or market may make a contribution to profits even
though it shows a loss, because is absorbing overhead costs, indicates what is
gained by adding or propping a product or a customer.  
20.6 What does strategic control hope
to accomplish?
Monitoring and evaluating a firms SBU level strategies.
Strategic control must provide some way of changing the firms thrust if new
information about the environment and/ or the firms performance so dictate. 
20.7 What is the major benefit of a
variance decomposition analysis?
Variance decomposition attempts to isolate the causes for
deviation from a plan.  It analysis the
areas where problems may exist.  However
determining the factors that caused the favorable or unfavorable variances
requires additional information coupled with the skills of an experienced
manager.
20.8 What are the major determinants
of a consumer products sales and market share?
Effective distribution
Relative price
Attitude maintenance 
Change towards one or more salient product characteristic
relative to competition and shelf facings.
20.9 What are the factors that
determine the extent of control exercised over an overseas subsidiary?
Largely a function of its size
Differences in the environment
Extent to which the company employs a standardized rather
than localized strategy
Larger companys international operation greater the
likelihood that staff personnel specializing in control activities will be on
site
Small overseas operations tend to involve fewer specialist
and less intensive control system
20.10 What are the various types of marketing
audit?



Marketing Environment audit
