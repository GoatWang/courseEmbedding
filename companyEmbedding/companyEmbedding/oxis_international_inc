	Product Pipeline
 


OXS-1550
OXS-1550 is a bispecific scFv recombinant fusion protein-drug conjugate composed of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 antibodies and a modified form of diphtheria toxin as its cytotoxic drug payload.  CD19 is a membrane glycoprotein present on the surface of all stages of B lymphocyte development, and is also expressed on most B-cell mature lymphoma cells and leukemia cells.1  CD22 is a glycoprotein expressed on B-lineage lymphoid precursors, including precursor B acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and often is co-expressed with CD19 on mature B-cell malignancies such as lymphoma.2
OXS-1550 targets cancer cells expressing the CD19 receptor or CD22 receptor or both receptors.  When OXS-1550 binds to cancer cells, the cancer cells internalize OXS-1550 and are killed due to the action of drug's cytotoxic payload.  OXS-1550 has demonstrated success in early human clinical trials in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma or leukemia.
Twenty-five patients with advanced B-cell lymphoid malignancies expressing CD19 and/or CD22 were enrolled in a clinical study to evaluate OXS-1550 in a phase 1 FDA study. Patients were enrolled that had previous failed chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and/or hematopoietic (bone marrow or stem cell) transplantation. Patients received a single course of OXS-1550 according to study rules. Adverse events were successfully managed and included weight gain, low albumin, transaminitis, and fever were transient grade 1–2 and occurred in patients at the higher doses tested (>/=40µg/kg/day). Durable objective responses occurred in 2 patients at these higher doses. A complete response occurred in the only patient given a second cycle of therapy that had a 70% cancer reduction after the first cycle of therapy... The patient has been in remission for a year now. Correlative studies showed a surprisingly low incidence of neutralizing antibody (30%) production that could be related to the drug's ability to suppress antibody responses.  For further information about the clinical trial, see Bachanova, V., et. al., Clin Cancer Res; 21(6) March 15, 2015.

OXS-4235
Overview
Dr. Xian-Qun Xie and his colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh have demonstrated that the ZZ domain of the p62/SQSTM1 protein is responsible for increased multiple myeloma cell growth and associated osteoclast mediated bone disease. Dr. Xie and colleagues have developed novel chemical compounds, such as OXS-4235, to inhibit osteoclastic bone destruction in multiple myeloma.
Market Need — Multiple Myeloma
Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer that forms in white blood cells, and affects about 26,850 people annually in the U.S. causing about 11,240 deaths per year.
Multiple myeloma causes cancer cells to accumulate in the bone marrow, where they crowd out healthy blood cells. Multiple myeloma is also characterized by destructive lytic bone lesions (rounded, punched-out areas of bone), diffuse osteoporosis, bone pain and the production of abnormal proteins, which accumulate in the urine.

OXS-2175
Overview
OXS-2175 is a small molecule therapeutic candidate that has shown promise in early-stage preclinical in vitro and in vivo models of triple-negative breast cancer. We are investigating OXS-2175 formulated as an infusible therapy and as part of an ADC infusible therapy for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer.
Market Need — Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
According to the American Cancer Society there were approximately 231,840 new cases of invasive breast cancer last year in the USA and 40,290 deaths from breast cancer during the same period. Women represent 99% of all breast cancer patients. Breast cancer is treated by various combinations of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy. TNBC is a type of breast cancer characterized by breast cancer cells that do not express estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, or large amounts of HER2/neu protein. Approximately 10% - 20% percent of invasive breast cancers are diagnosed as triple-negative breast cancers. TNBC is more likely to affect younger people, African Americans or Hispanics, and those with a BRCA1 gene mutation. TNBC is insensitive to many of the most effective therapies available for the treatment of breast cancer including the HER2-directed therapy Herceptin® (trastuzumab), and endocrine therapies such as tamoxifen or the aromatase inhibitors. The relapse and survival rates of TNBC patients are shorter than for patients with other types of breast cancer. There is no current or pending drug therapy available for the treatment of TNBC.

To our knowledge, OXIS remains the only significant commercial source of pure l-ergothioneine worldwide using our patented synthetic manufacturing process. L-ergothioneine is a natural antioxidant amino acid normally found in high concentrations in tissues of the body exposed to high levels of oxidative stress (free-radical damage). Humans and other animals cannot synthesize l-ergothioneine (as is also true for the so-called essential amino acids) therefore we have to obtain it from our diet.

At the heart of the OxisResearch® product line are the Bioxytech® assay kits. These products simplify the testing of Oxidative, Antioxidant, Nitrosative and Inflammatory Biomarkers thought to play a central role in many human diseases including Cancer, Diabetes, Atherosclerosis, Stroke, Alzheimer’s, MS and ALS to name a few.

Additionally, OXIS’ line of Oxidative biomarker test kits is the finest collection available with many assays for lipid, protein and DNA determinants of oxidative mediated damage. Researchers in nearly every major university throughout the world regularly use OXIS products for their oxidative stress related testing needs.

Oxis International Inc. Announces Treatment of First Patient in FDA Phase 2 Trial of Cancer Drug OXS-1550


 Download as PDF

April 18, 2017

LOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / April 18, 2017 / Oxis International Inc. (OTCQB: OXIS and Euronext Paris OXI.PA) announced today that the first patient has begun treatment in a Food and Drug Administration-approved Phase 2 clinical trial of its promising cancer therapy, OXS-1550.
Oxis Biotech, a wholly owned subsidiary of Oxis International, owns the worldwide rights to commercialize OXS-1550. The targeted immuno-oncology company is focused on novel antibody constructs that provide alternative treatments to cancer patients for whom existing therapies have failed.
The Phase 2 clinical trial is being conducted with Oxis' partner, the University of Minnesota's Masonic Cancer Center. Researchers at the University of Minnesota recently completed a Phase 1 trial of OXS-1550. The Phase 1 portion of the trial involved a safety review to determine the safe and effective dose of the drug.
Anthony Cataldo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Oxis, said the initiation of Phase 2 patient treatment is a key step for the company and a milestone for the promising technology.
"The initiation of Phase 2 patient treatment of OXS-1550 brings us one step closer in our company's effort to provide a promising alternative to existing technology," Mr. Cataldo said. "The product performed well in Phase 1 studies of blood cancers and we look forward to providing a targeted immunotherapy product that has the capability of treating a number of different liquid tumors." OXS-1550 is an ADC (Antibody Drug Conjugate) drug. ADCs, such as ADCETRIS® (brentuximab vedotin) from Seattle Genetics (SGEN), a first-in-class FDA approved antibody-drug conjugate, have paved the way for this type of next generation platform drug.
OXS-1550 uses a proprietary immunoconjugate platform technology as a treatment for leukemia and other blood-born cancers. What sets OXS-1550 (DT2219ARL) apart from other treatments, such as chemotherapy, is that it is designed to specifically target and kill cancer cells while minimizing damage to normal tissues.
Dr. Daniel Vallera, director of the section on Molecular Cancer Therapeutics at the University of Minnesota Cancer Center, helped develop OXS-1550. He said, "The initiation of Phase 2 patient treatment is a key opportunity to demonstrate the effectiveness of this promising cancer therapy. This brings us one step closer to an important alternative to invasive chemotherapies and costly cell therapies, Kite Pharma, Inc. (KITE), Juno Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), for cancer patients."
The news about OXS-1550 follows other good news about cancer treatments in the Oxis pipeline.
Additionally, on March 23, Oxis announced that it entered into a sponsored research agreement with the University of Minnesota to conduct a toxicity study of its TriKE cancer treatment (OXS-3550), a required step before researchers can apply for a Phase 1 clinical trial with the FDA.
Under the TriKe agreement, Oxis will pay for the university to conduct a study that will determine the optimal dose for OXS-3550.
About Oxis Biotech, Inc.:
Oxis Biotech is an immuno-oncology focused company developing innovative drugs focused on the treatment of cancer and other unmet medical needs. OXIS' lead drug candidate, OXS-1550 (DT2219ARL) is a novel bispecific scFv recombinant fusion protein-drug conjugate composed of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 antibodies and a modified form of diphtheria toxin as its cytotoxic drug payload. OXS-1550 targets cancer cells expressing the CD19 receptor or CD22 receptor or both receptors. OXS-2175 is a small molecule therapeutic candidate targeting the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In in vitro and in vivo models of TNBC, OXS-2175 demonstrated the ability to inhibit metastasis.

Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

About Environmental, Social & Governance Summary (ESG)



GMI ESG Ratings


GMI AGR® Score & Rating






GMI ESG Ratings
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Flags:  GMI Ratings publishes Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) ratings on over 6,000 companies worldwide. These ratings provide an independent assessment of the sustainable investment value of public companies.  The ESG Ratings model is based on a carefully crafted and applied list of KeyMetrics® that result in an overall ESG concern level as expressed by Red (High Concern), Yellow (Average Concern), and Green (Low Concern) flags.  Unlike traditional ESG risk models, GMI's rating methodology is designed to identify risks most likely to affect equity valuations. Specifically, these ratings reflect actual corporate behaviors rather than policies or affirmations of intent to adhere to best ESG practices. Further, unlike other models with evenly weighted metrics, we assign context-sensitive relative weightings to our key metrics, based on market, regional, ownership or sector differences.  Individual company scores are then assigned as a percentile rank, ranging from 1 (worst ranked) to 100 (best) on the basis of these KeyMetrics® and then converted to the Red, Yellow or Green flag designation.
Company Reports:  In addition to a company's overall risk rating, ESG reports also include an industry rating based on a comparison between the company's risk levels in each ESG component area relative to its industry peers.  Further, the ESG analysis serves as a summary of behavioral events that contributed to the company's overall risk level.

 More About GMI



GMI Accounting and Governance Risk (AGR) Score & Rating
The GMI Accounting and Governance Risk (AGR) Score & Rating is widely recognized as an indicator of the confidence level surrounding a company's management and reported financials.
Scores range from 0 to 100, and correspond to a risk classification for each company ranging from "Very Aggressive" to "Conservative." The AGR Score is a percentile ranking among the approximately 8,000 companies rated by GMI. Through continued back-testing, GMI has demonstrated a strong correlation between its quarterly AGR Score and the likelihood of adverse events, including securities class action litigation, financial restatements, regulatory enforcement actions, and stock price declines.
				Thus, a company's AGR Score can help investors looking to manage risk or enhance investment performance. GMI forensically analyzes the financial reporting and governance practices of over 8,000 North American-based publicly traded companies.
About GMI
GMI is an independent risk research firm which provides a statistically modeled assessment of corporate integrity. Founded in 2002 in direct response to the growing number of scandals, lawsuits and investor losses resulting from fraudulent corporate behavior, the firm identifies potential high-risk company accounting and governance activity, which in turn has been historically correlated to stock price declines, securities class-action litigation, and material financial restatements. The product of GMI's analysis is a unique risk measure - the AGR Score which can be used by investors as a way to more effectively manage corporate risk.

† The Equity Summary Score provided by Thomson Reuters StarMine is current as of the date specified.  There may be differences between the Equity Summary Score analyst count and the number of underlying analysts listed.  Due to the timing in receiving ratings changes into the Equity Summary Score model, the Equity Summary Score analyst count may lag the ratings count displayed by one or more days.  There may also be analyst count variations for symbols with multiple share classes and ADRs.  More details on Equity Summary Score calculation are included in the Understanding and Using the Equity Summary Score Methodology (PDF).As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to money market funds and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.
Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
 
 Life insurance and variable annuities 

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC, Member NYSE, SIPC and/or Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc., distribute fixed and variable insurance products issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company, Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company, New York, NY, and certain third party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with Fidelity Investments.
 
 Workplace savings plans 
Some of the funds and services described on the Fidelity Sites may not be available or appropriate in a workplace savings plan. Check with your employer for information on any investment restrictions associated with your 401(k), 401(a), 403(b), or 457 savings plan, or nonqualified deferred compensation plan at work. Or, if your workplace savings plan is already with Fidelity, call your toll-free retirement benefits line or log on to Fidelity NetBenefits® to find out more about the investment options available to you in your workplace savings plan.
If you hold Fidelity Advisor Fund assets outside of your employer-sponsored retirement plan, accounts with such assets are not included in the list of Fidelity accounts.
Company Stock Funds are not mutual funds and are unmanaged, non-diversified investment options. The value of your investment in the Company Stock Fund is affected by the performance of the company and the overall stock market, as well as the amount and performance of any short term investments held by the fund.
Managed Income Funds, Commingled Pools and individually managed options, such as Strategies, are not mutual funds. Although individual investment contracts purchased for a managed income fund are backed by the issuer of the debt, units of the fund are not guaranteed by the manager, Plan sponsor or insured by the FDIC.
A summary of the benefits provided under a workplace savings plan is contained in the Summary Plan Description for the plan. Full details are provided in the official plan document, which governs the operation of the plan. In the event that the content of a Fidelity Site or any oral representations made by any person regarding the plan conflict with or are inconsistent with the provisions of the governing plan document, the provisions of the governing plan documents are controlling. The information presented on a Fidelity Site is not intended to create, nor is it to be construed to create, a contract between (1) an employer or a Fidelity Entity and (2) any one of the employer’s employees or other plan participants. Each employer reserves the right to amend, modify, suspend, replace or terminate any of its plans, policies or programs, in whole or in part, including any level or form of coverage, by appropriate company action, without the consent or concurrence of persons affected.
 
 529 College Savings Plans 
The UNIQUE College Investing Plan, U.Fund College Investing Plan®, Delaware College Investment Plan, and the Fidelity Arizona resident College Savings Plan are offered by the State of New Hampshire, MEFA, the State of Delaware, and the Arizona Commission for Postsecondary Education, respectively, and managed by Fidelity. If you or the designated beneficiary are not a New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Delaware, or Arizona resident, you may want to consider, before investing, whether your state or the designated beneficiarys home state offers its residents a plan with alternate state tax advantages or other benefits.
Units of the College Savings Plan Portfolios are municipal securities and may be subject to market volatility and fluctuation.
Please carefully consider the Plan's investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses before investing. For this and other information on any 529 College Savings Plan managed by Fidelity, contact Fidelity for a free Fact Kit, or view online. Read it carefully before you invest or send money.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/21/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
