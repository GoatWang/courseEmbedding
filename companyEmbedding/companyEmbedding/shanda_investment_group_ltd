             (1) Calculated based on 95,871,683 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of May 25, 2017.       This Amendment No. 4 to Schedule 13D (this “Amendment No. 4”) relates to the Common Stock, par value $0.10 per share (the “Common Stock”), of Legg Mason, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the “Issuer”) and amends the Schedule 13D filed on April 21, 2016 (the “Original Schedule 13D”), as amended by Amendment No. 1 to the Original Schedule 13D filed on July 7, 2016 (“Amendment No.1”), Amendment No. 2 to the Original Schedule 13D filed on December 20, 2016 (“Amendment No. 2”) and Amendment No.

This Amendment No. 4 is being filed to amend Item 3, Item 4 and Item 5 of the Schedule 13D as follows:  Item 3. Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration  Item 3 of the Schedule 13D is amended and restated to read as follows:                 The aggregate purchase price for 5,567,653 shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons was $151,319,692, inclusive of commissions paid and other transaction costs and less the premium received for certain put options sold by the Investor relating to the Common Stock. Such purchase price was funded through internally generated funds of the affiliates of Shanda Group.
                       The 3,383 shares of Common Stock directly beneficially owned Mr. Chen were granted to him in his capacity as a director of the Issuer pursuant to and under the conditions of the Issuer’s Non-Employee Director Equity Plan, as amended.  Item 4. Purpose of Transaction.  The following paragraph shall be added to the end of Item 4 of the Schedule 13D:                                 The Reporting Persons continue to be very supportive of the Issuer’s strategy of expanding client choice across investment strategies, product vehicles and client access, as well as its investment managers and the leadership of its management team and Board of Directors.                       In the meantime, the Reporting Persons intend to review their holdings in the Issuer on a continuing basis and, depending upon the price and availability of the Issuer securities, subsequent developments affecting the Issuer, the business prospects of the Issuer, general stock market, industry and economic conditions, tax considerations and other factors deemed relevant, may consider increasing or decreasing their investment in the Issuer or entering into hedging, derivative or other transactions with respect to the Common Stock or other securities of the Issuer.  As part of this ongoing review, the Reporting Persons may seek to engage in discussions with the Board of Directors of the Issuer, the management and/or other stockholders of the Issuer concerning the business, operations, corporate governance or future plans of the Issuer, may engage legal and financial advisors to assist them in such review, and may evaluate strategic alternatives that may become available in the future.  Item 5. Interest in Securities of the Issuer.  Item 5 of the Schedule 13D is amended and restated to read as follows:      The information set forth in Items 2, 3 and 4 herein is incorporated herein by reference.

Mr. Chen may be deemed to directly beneficially own an additional 3,383 shares of Common Stock, representing less than 1% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Issuer. The foregoing percentage is calculated based on 95,871,683 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of May 25, 2017.  Mr. Chen, through his ownership of Shanda Media Limited, may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power over the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Shanda Media Limited.

Shanda Technology Overseas Capital Company Limited, through its ownership of the Investor, may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power over the shares of Common Stock directly held by the Investor.  Mr. Chen has the sole power to vote and dispose of the shares of Common Stock directly beneficially owned by him.  Except as set forth in Item 5(a), none of the Reporting Persons, and, to the best of their knowledge, any persons named in Schedule A hereto owns beneficially any Common Stock of the Issuer.  (c)  On June 28, 2017, Shanda Asset Management Investment Limited sold 4,232,500 shares of Common Stock at a price of $38.43 per share in a private sale.

This Amendment No. 4 to Schedule 13D (this “Amendment No. 4”) relates to the Common Stock, par value $0.10 per share (the “Common Stock”), of Legg Mason, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the “Issuer”) and amends the Schedule 13D filed on April 21, 2016 (the “Original Schedule 13D”), as amended by Amendment No. 1 to the Original Schedule 13D filed on July 7, 2016 (“Amendment No.1”), Amendment No. 2 to the Original Schedule 13D filed on December 20, 2016 (“Amendment No. 2”) and Amendment No. 3 to the Original Schedule 13D filed on February 1, 2017 (“Amendment No. 3”, and, collectively with the Original Schedule 13D, Amendment No. 1, Amendment No.2 and this Amendment No. 4, the “Schedule 13D”).


This Amendment No. 4 is being filed to amend Item 3, Item 4 and Item 5 of the Schedule 13D as follows:


Item 3. Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration


Item 3 of the Schedule 13D is amended and restated to read as follows:
               
The aggregate purchase price for 5,567,653 shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons was $151,319,692, inclusive of commissions paid and other transaction costs and less the premium received for certain put options sold by the Investor relating to the Common Stock. Such purchase price was funded through internally generated funds of the affiliates of Shanda Group.
                      
The 3,383 shares of Common Stock directly beneficially owned Mr. Chen were granted to him in his capacity as a director of the Issuer pursuant to and under the conditions of the Issuer’s Non-Employee Director Equity Plan, as amended.


Item 4. Purpose of Transaction.


The following paragraph shall be added to the end of Item 4 of the Schedule 13D:
                              

The Reporting Persons continue to be very supportive of the Issuer’s strategy of expanding client choice across investment strategies, product vehicles and client access, as well as its investment managers and the leadership of its management team and Board of Directors.

                    

In the meantime, the Reporting Persons intend to review their holdings in the Issuer on a continuing basis and, depending upon the price and availability of the Issuer securities, subsequent developments affecting the Issuer, the business prospects of the Issuer, general stock market, industry and economic conditions, tax considerations and other factors deemed relevant, may consider increasing or decreasing their investment in the Issuer or entering into hedging, derivative or other transactions with respect to the Common Stock or other securities of the Issuer.  As part of this ongoing review, the Reporting Persons may seek to engage in discussions with the Board of Directors of the Issuer, the management and/or other stockholders of the Issuer concerning the business, operations, corporate governance or future plans of the Issuer, may engage legal and financial advisors to assist them in such review, and may evaluate strategic alternatives that may become available in the future.


Item 5. Interest in Securities of the Issuer.


Item 5 of the Schedule 13D is amended and restated to read as follows:

The information set forth in Items 2, 3 and 4 herein is incorporated herein by reference.


(a) – (b)


The Investor holds 5,567,653 shares of Common Stock, representing approximately 5.8% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Issuer. Mr. Chen may be deemed to directly beneficially own an additional 3,383 shares of Common Stock, representing less than 1% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Issuer. The foregoing percentage is calculated based on 95,871,683 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of May 25, 2017.


Mr. Chen, through his ownership of Shanda Media Limited, may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power over the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Shanda Media Limited.

Shanda Investment Group Limited, through its ownership of Shanda Technology Overseas Capital Company Limited, may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power over the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Shanda Technology Overseas Capital Company Limited. Shanda Technology Overseas Capital Company Limited, through its ownership of the Investor, may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power over the shares of Common Stock directly held by the Investor.


Mr. Chen has the sole power to vote and dispose of the shares of Common Stock directly beneficially owned by him.


Except as set forth in Item 5(a), none of the Reporting Persons, and, to the best of their knowledge, any persons named in Schedule A hereto owns beneficially any Common Stock of the Issuer.


(c)  On June 28, 2017, Shanda Asset Management Investment Limited sold 4,232,500 shares of Common Stock at a price of $38.43 per share in a private sale. No commissions were charged in connection with this sale of Common Stock.  There were no other transactions by the Reporting Persons during the past 60 days.

HONG KONG, November 26, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Shanda Games Limited (NASDAQ:   GAME, "Shanda Games" or the "Company"), a leading online game developer, operator and publisher in China, has been informed by Shanda Interactive Entertainment Limited ("Shanda Interactive"), the former controlling shareholder of Shanda Games, of the completion of the sale by Shanda SDG Investment Limited ("Shanda SDG"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Shanda Interactive, of (i) 48,759,187 class B ordinary shares of the Company ("Class B Shares") to Zhongrong Shengda Investment Holdings (Hong Kong) Company Limited ("Zhongrong"), a company formed under the laws of Hong Kong and an affiliate of Ningxia Zhongyincashmere International Group Co., Ltd. ("Ningxia"), and (ii) 48,759,187 Class B Shares to Yili Shengda Investment Holdings (Hong Kong) Company Limited ("Yili"), a company formed under the laws of Hong Kong and an affiliate of the Company's acting CEO, Mr. Yingfeng Zhang ((i) and (ii) together, the "Sale").  As previously announced, Ningxia also entered into a share purchase agreement with Shanda SDG to purchase 80,577,828 class A ordinary shares of the Company ("Class A Shares"), and the Company has been informed by Ningxia that, pursuant to the share purchase agreement, an affiliate of Ningxia completed such purchase on September 23, 2014.  Upon the completion of the Sale, (i) Shanda Interactive no longer beneficially owns any ordinary shares of the Company; (ii) Ningxia and its affiliates collectively own Class A Shares and Class B Shares representing approximately 24.1% of the Company's issued and outstanding ordinary shares as of October 20, 2014 and approximately 40.1% of the total number of votes represented by the Company's issued and outstanding ordinary shares as of October 20, 2014; and (iii) Yili owns Class B Shares representing approximately 9.1% of the Company's issued and outstanding ordinary shares as of October 20, 2014 and approximately 34.5% of the total number of votes represented by the Company's issued and outstanding ordinary shares as of October 20, 2014.
As previously announced, the board of directors (the "Board") of the Company has received a preliminary non-binding proposal letter dated January 27, 2014 (the "Proposal") from a consortium (the "Consortium") formed pursuant to the consortium agreement dated as of January 27, 2014 (the "Consortium Agreement") among Shanda Interactive and certain other parties, and, among other subsequent changes to the composition of the Consortium, Ningxia joined the Consortium by entering into an adherence agreement on September 1, 2014.  According to the Proposal, the Consortium proposes to acquire Shanda Games in a "going private" transaction for US$3.45 per Class A Share or Class B Share, or US$6.90 per American depositary share (each representing two Class A Shares).  The Company has been informed by Shanda Interactive that it does not intend to remain a member of the Consortium following the completion of the Sale.  In addition, the Company has been informed by each of Mr. Yingfeng Zhang and Ningxia, on his/its own behalf, that he/it intends to continue pursuing the proposed "going private" transaction.  The Proposal states that it constitutes only a preliminary indication of interest and is subject to negotiation and execution of definitive agreements relating to the proposed transaction. The Company cautions its shareholders and others considering trading its securities that there can be no assurance that any definitive agreement will be executed relating to the proposed transaction, or that the proposed transaction or any other transaction will be approved or consummated.
In addition, Shanda Games today announced the following changes to the Board and the Compensation Committee and the Corporate Development and Finance Committee of the Board:

Mr. Tianqiao Chen resigned as a director of the Company and stepped down as the chairman of the Board and the chairman of the Compensation Committee and the Corporate Development and Finance Committee of the Board. 
Mr. Yingfeng Zhang, the acting CEO of the Company, is appointed as the chairman of the Board and the chairman of the Compensation Committee and the Corporate Development and Finance Committee of the Board. 
Mr. Shengming Ma, the chairman of the board of directors of Ningxia, is appointed as a director of the Company. 
Mr. Li Yao, a director of the Company, is appointed as a member of the Compensation Committee and the Corporate Development and Finance Committee of the Board.

Finally, as previously announced, Mr. Andy Lin has resigned from the special committee of independent directors (the "Special Committee") formed by the Board to evaluate the Proposal due to his affiliation with Orient Finance Holdings (Hong Kong) Limited, another party to the Consortium Agreement.  In connection with his resignation from the Special Committee, Mr. Lin also resigned as a member of the Audit Committee of the Board.  Prior to his resignation, Mr. Lin was the chairman of the Audit Committee and qualified as an audit committee financial expert under the applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules and as a financially sophisticated audit committee member under Rule 5605(c)(2)(A) of the NASDAQ Listing Rules (a "Financial Expert").  In connection with Mr. Lin's resignation, Mr. Heng Wing Chan was appointed as the chairman of the Audit Committee, and the Audit Committee currently consists of two members, Mr. Heng Wing Chan and Mr. Yong Gui.  The Board has also authorized the Company to initiate a search for a potential director candidate who will (i) qualify as an "independent director" within the meaning of Rule 5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ Listing Rules and (ii) qualify as a Financial Expert.
