ICC15 CWS-L-2
  



1Pacific Life Insurance Company’s Pacific PremierCare Advantage (Policy Form #P12PPC or ICC12 P12PPC—policy form # based on state in which policy is issued) is a flexible premium adjustable life insurance policy with long-term care insurance payable through reimbursements.

 Only one premium is necessary to fund Pacific PremierCare Advantage. While this product allows additional premiums, they are not required and do not provide additional Long-Term Care Benefits, a greater Return of Premium Benefit, or increased Death Proceeds (unless a subsequent increase in the policy’s cash value requires a death benefit increase to satisfy IRC Section 7702 requirements). A premium load will apply to each premium payment. Once a sufficient premium has been paid, the long-term care coverage will continue as long as the insured lives; or until the policy is surrendered at the owner’s request; or until the maximum long-term care benefits have been paid; or until policy lapse. Policy charges (cost of insurance and coverage charges) are deducted from the policy’s accumulated value on a monthly basis. Policy lapse will only occur where the policy’s cash value less policy debt is not sufficient to cover monthly policy charges. Prior to lapse, the policy provides 61 days to pay premium sufficient to keep the policy in force.

2Pacific Life Insurance Company’s Pacific PremierCare Advantage Multi‐Pay (Policy Form #P14PCF or ICC14 P14PCF—policy form # based on state in which policy is issued) is a fixed premium universal life insurance policy with long-term care insurance payable through reimbursements.

 A premium load will apply to each premium payment.  As long as each premium is paid when due, the long-term care coverage as issued will continue as long as the insured lives; or until the policy is surrendered at the owner’s request; or until the maximum long-term care benefits have been paid; or until policy lapse. Policy charges (cost of insurance and coverage charges) are deducted from the policy’s accumulated value on a monthly basis. Policy lapse will occur where the policy debt exceeds the Cash Surrender Value; and/or the required premium was not paid within the Grace Period. Prior to lapse, the policy provides a Grace Period of 61 days to pay an amount sufficient to keep the policy in force as issued.

3Pacific PremierCare Advantage and Pacific PremierCare Advantage Multi-Pay are subject to underwriting and approval of the application and may include obtaining medical records from your physician. No medical exam is required, but a Medical Information Bureau (MIB) and prescription report will be ordered and a Personal History Interview and Cognitive Assessment will be performed via telephone as part of the underwriting process.

These products are not Partnership Qualified products. For more information on Partnership Qualified products, please contact your state department of insurance. These policies have certain exclusions and limitations. For costs and complete details of the coverage, contact your life insurance producer.

 These products are intended to provide federally tax-qualified long-term care insurance as defined in IRC Section 7702B(b). When benefits are received from multiple policies providing long-term care or chronic illness benefits for a given insured, including policies with different owners, all of those benefits must be aggregated to determine their taxability. Pacific Life cannot determine whether the benefits are taxable. If you have any questions concerning the tax implications of these products, qualified and independent legal and tax advisors should be consulted.

Reimbursements for covered long-term care expenses are subject to an elimination period and are provided by the Accelerated Benefit Rider (ABR) for Long Term Care (Form #R12ABR or ICC12 R12ABR) and the Extended Benefit Rider (EBR) for Long Term Care (Form #R12EBR or ICC12 R12EBR). (Rider form numbers vary based on state in which policy is issued.) The amount and duration of the maximum long-term care benefits will be based on the benefit options elected at time of application. Coverage elected for longer than two years is only provided through a combination of ABR and EBR. Actual amount and duration of long-term care benefits will vary based on the use of policy benefits and features. Covered long-term care expenses will be reimbursed until the total long-term care benefits are exhausted, which may vary from the elected duration. Premiums for long-term care benefits will vary depending upon the benefit options elected. Charges for ABR, EBR, and any Inflation Benefit Option are included in the initial premium payment.

Exclusions, Exceptions, and Limitations: We will not pay benefits for any room and board, care, treatment, services, equipment, or other items for care or services: 1) provided by the Insured’s Immediate Family unless he or she is a regular employee of an organization which is providing the treatment, service or care; and the organization receives the payment for the treatment, service or care; 2) for which no charge is normally made in the absence of insurance; 3) provided outside the United States of America, except as described in the International Benefit; 4) that result from an attempt at suicide (while sane or insane) or an intentionally self-inflicted injury; 5) provided in a government facility (unless otherwise required by law); 6) for which benefits are available under Medicare (including amounts that would be reimbursable but for the application of a deductible or coinsurance amount) or other governmental program (except Medicaid), any state or federal workers’ compensation, employer’s liability or occupational disease law, or any motor vehicle no-fault law. No benefits will be paid for services received while the Accelerated Benefit Rider (ABR) for Long Term Care and the Extended Benefit Rider (EBR) for Long Term Care are not in force.

You should carefully consider a variable life insurance product’s risks, charges, limitations, and expenses, as well as the risks, charges, expenses and investment goals/objectives of the underlying investment options. This and other information about Pacific Life insurance products are provided in the applicable product and underlying fund prospectuses which are available from your life insurance producer or by clicking here. Read them carefully before investing or sending money.

This material is not intended to be used, nor can it be used by any taxpayer, for the purpose of avoiding U.S. federal, state or local tax penalties. This material is written to support the promotion or marketing of the transaction(s) or matter(s) addressed by this material. Pacific Life, its distributors and their respective representatives do not provide tax, accounting or legal advice. Any taxpayer should seek advice based on the taxpayer’s particular circumstances from an independent tax advisor.

Pacific Life refers to Pacific Life Insurance Company and its affiliates, including Pacific Life & Annuity Company. Insurance products are issued by Pacific Life Insurance Company in all states except New York and in New York by Pacific Life & Annuity Company. Product availability and features may vary by state. Each insurance company is solely responsible for the financial obligations accruing under the products it issues. Insurance products and their guarantees, including optional benefits and any crediting rates, are backed by the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company, but they do not protect the value of the variable investment options. Look to the strength of the life insurance company with regard to such guarantees as these guarantees are not backed by the broker-dealer, insurance agency or their affiliates from which products are purchased. Neither these entities nor their representatives make any representation or assurance regarding the claims-paying ability of the life insurance company. Variable insurance products are distributed by Pacific Select Distributors, LLC (member FINRA & SIPC), a subsidiary of Pacific Life Insurance Company, and an affiliate of Pacific Life & Annuity Company, and are available through licensed third-party broker-dealers.

Pacific Life is located in Newport Beach, CA.

It's full of products that even some of the experts don't understand and, much like the recent events that took place at JP Morgan, sometimes complicated investments produce unexpected results. Many of the more complicated investment products are likely inappropriate for retail or part-time investors, but that doesn't mean that stocks and mutual funds are all that are available to you. Have you considered closed-end funds?
SEE: Open Your Eyes To Closed-End Funds
Open-End FundsMany investment products are not one single product, but are instead a collection of individual products. Just as you wear a collection of clothing products to make up your whole wardrobe, products like mutual funds and ETFs do the same thing by investing in a collection of stocks and bonds to comprise the entire look.
There are two types of these products on the market. Open-end funds are what you know as a mutual fund. They don't have a limit as to how many shares they can issue. When an investor purchases shares in a mutual fund, more shares are created, and when somebody sells his or her shares the shares are taken out of circulation. If a large amount of shares are sold (called a redemption), the fund may have to sell some of its investments in order to pay the investor.
You can't watch an open-end fund like you watch your stocks, because they don't trade on the open market. At the end of each trading day, the funds reprice based on the amount of shares bought and sold. Their price is based on the total value of the fund or the net asset value (NAV)
SEE: When To Sell A Mutual Fund
Closed-End FundsClosed-end funds look similar but they're very different. A closed-end fund functions much more like an exchange traded fund than a mutual fund. They are launched through an IPO in order to raise money and then trade in the open market just like a stock or an ETF. They only issue a set amount of shares and, although their value is also based on the NAV, the actual price of the fund is affected by supply and demand, allowing it to trade at prices above or below its real value.
There are currently about 650 closed-end funds trading on the market, yet they are not well known by retail investors. Some funds, like BlackRock Corporate High Yield Fund VI (HYT), pay a dividend of more than 8%, making these funds an attractive choice for income investors. 
But investors have to know one key fact about closed-end funds. Nearly 70% of all of these products use leverage as a way to produce more gains. Using borrowed money to invest may produce big returns, but it could also put the fund under intense pressure. Recently, Moody's downgraded the rating of many of the largest banks that included debt securities issued by 38 closed-end funds.
These downgrades will likely make it more expensive for these and other closed-end funds to borrow money in order to invest. Higher borrowing costs impact the return investors receive from these funds, making them potentially less attractive in the future.
SEE: Leveraged ETFs: Are They Right For You?
The Bottom LineOpen-end products may represent a safer choice than closed-end funds, but the closed-end products might produce a better return, combining both dividend payments and capital appreciation. Of course, investors should always compare individual products within an asset class; some open-end funds may be more risky than some closed-end funds.

Turning ideas into reality
We’re about more than products and apps. We create successful start-ups.



We Listen You know best when it comes to your product, your market and potential customers. That’s why we listen to you, without imposing our own ideas first. We take your knowledge and add our expertise, enhancing both through client development and customer interviews.  


We Advise By combining our experience with yours, we not only keep costs down but create superior customer experiences. From here, we are able to craft a plan or fully-fledged product.


We Create At the heart of everything, we’re creators. We’re passionate about building tools and products which can improve people’s lives. Whatever the challenge, we mix the perfect cocktail of people and skills to make it a reality. 


We Deliver You customers want – and deserve – the best. So we work with you to help you give them just that. We work on an evidence-based process, learning from what works and what doesn’t. The result? World class solutions of consistent quality across processes and outputs.



Bespoke design and custom innovation
Making it happen, every single time.









Why Codeventures? 
We’re unique here at Codeventures, as our services aren’t limited to technology and product development. There is so much more than that to building a successful business – so our passionate team are here to help you with every aspect. Take a look at just a few of our key services below.



Web Application Development
Need a web app or ecommerce platform? No problem. We can create a beautiful-looking web platform to your specific functionality and aesthetic requirements. Completely bespoke and customised, whatever we build for you can be scaled as your business grows and grows.



Social App Development
We take traditionally complex features like text mining, sentiment analysis and automatic categorisation and make them simple, effective and easy. To help you learn and grow from your social strategy, we always provide daily, weekly and monthly metrics and KPIs.



Mobile Development
IOS, Android or Windows, we’ve got you covered. We can create native apps for each operating system to maximise the potential of each one, including parallel processing on GPGPUs, offering better performance than their web counterparts.




User Acquisition & Marketing
Our social media strategies are so much more than one-dimensional. We incorporate tools to centralise multiple communication platforms, and can also help you to run user acquisition campaigns across all social network platforms. If something doesn’t work, we don’t stop until it does.



Venture Funding Assistance
Life can be tough for a start-up – especially when it comes to raising capital. We know all about these challenges, so can help you to find creative solutions to both fundraising and networking. How? Using our knowledge of the venture capital market and understanding of your vision.



Operations
When it comes to operations, our priority is efficiency and effectiveness to help you get things done. Complex operational issues become a piece of cake thanks to our industry knowledge and process, organization and technology know-how.







Our Process 

No matter the maturity of your start-up, we have got a dedicated solution to help you.


How does it work?
We get started by sitting down with you to chat about the incredible potential of your business during a Discovery Workshop. This takes the form of an in-depth and intensive 2-3 day workshop.While this is a paid consultation, the incurred cost goes towards your completed product. What’s more, your consultation is led by the founder and CEO of Codeventures, Aji Abraham, along with key members of our product team. Aji Abraham will act as your part-time CTO/Tech co-founder if you do not have one.
We don’t believe in all talk and no action. So, by the end of your initial consultation, we will have determined the user flow, MVP definition, high level architecture, development time frame, business model and go to market plan for your start-up business.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
