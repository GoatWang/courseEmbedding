      Trust Overview          

Pacific Coast Oil Trust is a Delaware statutory perpetual trust formed by Pacific Coast Energy Company LP (“PCEC”) through a conveyance of interests in California onshore oil properties located in the Santa Maria and Los Angeles Basins. PCEC owns the underlying properties from which these net profits interests were conveyed. The underlying properties consist of (i) proved developed reserves, referred to as the “Developed Properties,” and (ii) all other development potential on the underlying properties, referred to as the “Remaining Properties”.Production from the Developed Properties that will be attributable to the trust is produced from wells that, because they have already been drilled, require limited additional capital expenditures. As a result, the Developed Properties are projected to have positive net profits immediately upon conveyance to the trust. Production from the Remaining Properties that will be attributable to the trust will require capital expenditures for the drilling of wells and installation of infrastructure. PCEC will supply required capital on behalf of the trust during this period; however, because the costs initially incurred will exceed gross proceeds, the Remaining Properties will have negative net profits during the drilling and development period. During this period of negative net profits, instead of being paid net profits, the trust will be paid a 7.5% overriding royalty on the portion of the Remaining Properties located on PCEC’s Orcutt properties. Once revenues from the Remaining Properties have paid back PCEC for the cumulative costs it has advanced on behalf of the trust, then the net profits interests on the Remaining Properties will be paid out in place of the royalty interests, as described below. We refer to the net profits interests and royalty interest conveyed to the trust as the “Net Profits Interests” and “Royalty Interest,” respectively. These interests, which we refer to collectively as the “Conveyed Interests,” entitle the trust to receive the following:Developed Properties-       80% of the net profits from the sale of oil and natural gas production from the Developed Properties.Remaining Properties-     7.5% of the proceeds (free of any production or development costs but bearing the proportionate share of production and property taxes and post-production costs) attributable to the sale of all oil and natural gas production from the Remaining Properties located on PCEC’s Orcutt properties, including but not limited to PCEC’s interest in such production, which we refer to as the “Royalty Interest Proceeds,” or-       25% of the net profits from the sale of oil and natural gas production from all of the Remaining Properties.Net profits are calculated separately for the Developed Properties and the Remaining Properties. The trust will make cash distributions of all its monthly cash receipts, after deduction of fees and expenses for the administration of the trust, at month-end to unitholders of record within ten business days.Pacific Coast Oil Trust is a New York Stock Exchange-listed entity, with Units trading under the symbol "ROYT”. The current trustee of the trust is The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A.Properties OverviewOrcutt Hill WebsiteROYT - Final Prospectus

      Trust Overview          

Pacific Coast Oil Trust is a Delaware statutory perpetual trust formed by Pacific Coast Energy Company LP (“PCEC”) through a conveyance of interests in California onshore oil properties located in the Santa Maria and Los Angeles Basins. PCEC owns the underlying properties from which these net profits interests were conveyed. The underlying properties consist of (i) proved developed reserves, referred to as the “Developed Properties,” and (ii) all other development potential on the underlying properties, referred to as the “Remaining Properties”.Production from the Developed Properties that will be attributable to the trust is produced from wells that, because they have already been drilled, require limited additional capital expenditures. As a result, the Developed Properties are projected to have positive net profits immediately upon conveyance to the trust. Production from the Remaining Properties that will be attributable to the trust will require capital expenditures for the drilling of wells and installation of infrastructure. PCEC will supply required capital on behalf of the trust during this period; however, because the costs initially incurred will exceed gross proceeds, the Remaining Properties will have negative net profits during the drilling and development period. During this period of negative net profits, instead of being paid net profits, the trust will be paid a 7.5% overriding royalty on the portion of the Remaining Properties located on PCEC’s Orcutt properties. Once revenues from the Remaining Properties have paid back PCEC for the cumulative costs it has advanced on behalf of the trust, then the net profits interests on the Remaining Properties will be paid out in place of the royalty interests, as described below. We refer to the net profits interests and royalty interest conveyed to the trust as the “Net Profits Interests” and “Royalty Interest,” respectively. These interests, which we refer to collectively as the “Conveyed Interests,” entitle the trust to receive the following:Developed Properties-       80% of the net profits from the sale of oil and natural gas production from the Developed Properties.Remaining Properties-     7.5% of the proceeds (free of any production or development costs but bearing the proportionate share of production and property taxes and post-production costs) attributable to the sale of all oil and natural gas production from the Remaining Properties located on PCEC’s Orcutt properties, including but not limited to PCEC’s interest in such production, which we refer to as the “Royalty Interest Proceeds,” or-       25% of the net profits from the sale of oil and natural gas production from all of the Remaining Properties.Net profits are calculated separately for the Developed Properties and the Remaining Properties. The trust will make cash distributions of all its monthly cash receipts, after deduction of fees and expenses for the administration of the trust, at month-end to unitholders of record within ten business days.Pacific Coast Oil Trust is a New York Stock Exchange-listed entity, with Units trading under the symbol "ROYT”. The current trustee of the trust is The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A.Properties OverviewOrcutt Hill WebsiteROYT - Final Prospectus

The Trust’s distribution calculation relates to net profits and overriding royalties generated during May 2017 as provided in the conveyance of net profits and overriding royalty interest.The current month’s calculation for the Developed Properties resulted in $1.5 million of revenues less direct operating expenses and development costs. The current month’s revenues were $3.4 million, lease operating expenses including property taxes were $2.2 million and capital expenditures were $0.3 million of income due to a prior period adjustment. Average realized prices for the Developed Properties were $45.25 per Boe in May, as compared to $47.55 per Boe in April. Net profits for the month of May for the Developed Properties were $1.2 million.The current month’s calculation included $42,000 for the 7.5% overriding royalty on the Remaining Properties from Orcutt Diatomite and Orcutt Field.

The Underlying Properties and the Trust’s net profits and royalty interests are described in the Trust’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). As described in the Trust’s filings with the SEC, the amount of any periodic distributions is expected to fluctuate, depending on the proceeds received by the Trust as a result of actual production volumes, oil and gas prices, development expenses, and the amount and timing of the Trust’s administrative expenses, among other factors. For additional information on the Trust, please visit www.pacificcoastoiltrust.com.Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking InformationThis press release contains statements that are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements contained in this press release, other than statements of historical facts, are "forward-looking statements" for purposes of these provisions. These forward-looking statements include the amount and date of any anticipated distribution to unitholders. The anticipated distribution is based, in part, on the amount of cash received or expected to be received by the Trust from PCEC with respect to the relevant period. Any differences in actual cash receipts by the Trust could affect this distributable amount. The amount of such cash received or expected to be received by the Trust (and its ability to pay distributions) has been and will be significantly and negatively affected by prevailing low commodity prices, which have declined significantly, could decline further and could remain low for an extended period of time. Other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include expenses of the Trust and reserves for anticipated future expenses. Statements made in this press release are qualified by the cautionary statements made in this press release. Neither PCEC nor the Trustee intends, and neither assumes any obligation, to update any of the statements included in this press release.
