Dominion Diamond downgraded to market perform from outperform at BMO Capital
Dominion Diamond downgraded to market perform from outperform at BMO Capital

Dominion Diamond agrees to be acquired by The Washington Cos. for $1.2 billion
Canadian mining company Dominion Diamond Corp.  said Monday it has agreed to be acquired by The Washington Companies for $14.25 a share in cash, or $1.2 billion. The Washington Companies is a group of privately held North American mining, industrial and transportation businesses founded by Dennis Washington, an industrialist and entrepreneur. The price is equal to a 44% premium over Dominion's share price on March 17 and ends the company's review of strategic alternatives announced on March 27, the company said in a statement. Dominion will continue to operate as a standalone business with a new CEO based in Canada. The company will continue to operate the Ekati Diamond mine, which it controls, as well as the Diavik Diamond mine, in which it has a 40% interest. Both are located in the Northwest Territories in Canada. Dominion shares were halted premarket for the news, but have gained 39% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained about 10%.

Dominion Diamond downgraded to market perform from outperform at BMO Capital
Dominion Diamond downgraded to market perform from outperform at BMO Capital

Jul. 18, 2017 at 9:45 a.m. ET
by Tomi Kilgore









Dominion Diamond agrees to be acquired by The Washington Cos. for $1.2 billion
Canadian mining company Dominion Diamond Corp.  said Monday it has agreed to be acquired by The Washington Companies for $14.25 a share in cash, or $1.2 billion. The Washington Companies is a group of privately held North American mining, industrial and transportation businesses founded by Dennis Washington, an industrialist and entrepreneur. The price is equal to a 44% premium over Dominion's share price on March 17 and ends the company's review of strategic alternatives announced on March 27, the company said in a statement. Dominion will continue to operate as a standalone business with a new CEO based in Canada. The company will continue to operate the Ekati Diamond mine, which it controls, as well as the Diavik Diamond mine, in which it has a 40% interest. Both are located in the Northwest Territories in Canada. Dominion shares were halted premarket for the news, but have gained 39% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained about 10%.

							Dominion Diamond Corp. Names Jewelry Design Contest Winner					



 
Montreal-based La Pierre Précieuse Inc. designed this winning pendant featuring a 0.40-carat round brilliant CanadaMark diamond.  















						June 28, 2017					





	Yellowknife, Northwest Territories--Dominion Diamond Corporation has announced La Pierre Précieuse Inc. as this year’s winner of the CanadaMark Jewelry Competition. The annual competition serves to highlight Dominion’s CanadaMark diamonds, which are responsibly mined in the Northwest Territories and tracked through every stage of the supply chain.The mining company asked Canadian jewelers to submit designs for a pendant incorporating a CanadaMark certified diamond. This year’s theme was “Canada,” in honor of the country’s 150th birthday in 2017. Dominion chose 10 finalists based on overall creativity and style, then opened voting up to the public online for four weeks to select the winner. The winning pendant from Montreal, Quebec-based La Pierre Précieuse Inc. features a 0.40-carat CanadaMark round brilliant diamond set in a rose gold maple leaf setting. The design also incorporates Canadian maple wood. The CanadaMark Jewelry Competition Award was given at a special reception during JCK Las Vegas. The pendant was purchased by Dominion and will be given randomly to one of the consumers who voted online in the competition.

Home/ Operations/ Ekati Diamond Mine







  Ekati Diamond Mine 


The Ekati Diamond Mine (named after the Tlicho word meaning ‘fat lake’) is Canada’s first surface and underground diamond mine.  It officially began production in October 1998, following extensive exploration and development work dating back to 1981.  Like Diavik, the Ekati mine site is located in the Lac de Gras region of the Northwest Territories, approximately 300 kilometers northeast of Yellowknife. 
The Ekati mine is renowned for the premium gem quality diamonds it produces. The largest gem quality diamond produced to date at the mine is a 186-carat diamond from the Pigeon pit, which was recovered and sold in 2016. Cumulative production to January 2017 has totalled approximately 67.8 million carats. 
The Company operates the Ekati Diamond Mine in which it owns a controlling interest.  Over the mine’s early years, production was focused on six open pits and two underground operations. The current Reserves Base Case Mine Plan is based on production from six kimberlite pipes:  Misery Main, Pigeon, Sable, Lynx and Jay open pits, and Koala underground operations. Currently, Koala, Misery Main, Pigeon and Lynx pipes are being mined. Mining has not yet commenced at the Sable or Jay pipes. In addition, the Misery South and Southwest satellite material is being excavated as part of the Misery Main mining operations. This material is being stockpiled separately and is planned to be processed through the Ekati plant as a supplement to the Reserve Base Case Mine Plan, which we refer to as the Operating Base Case Mine Plan. The Ekati process plant has the capacity to process 4.3 million tonnes per year. Additional feed from Coarse Ore Rejects will be used to supplement mined ore. This material is not included in the reserves or resources and is therefore incremental to production.
 Jay was approved for construction by the Company in July 2016 and is the most significant undeveloped deposit at Ekati due to its large size and high grade and extends the mine life by approximately 10 years to 2033. The Company’s timetable for the development of Jay assumes the start of road construction in 2017, dike construction in 2018-2020, dewatering and start of pre-stripping in 2021, and mining and processing of Jay kimberlite by late 2022.     As of January 31, 2017, the Ekati Mine is reported to contain 26.0 million carats of probable reserves in the Core Zone and 79.4 million carats of probable reserves in the Buffer Zone for a total of 105.4 million carats of total probable reserves (on a 100% basis).  This web page contains forward-looking information. Forward-looking statements are provided for the purpose of providing information about management’s expectations and plans relating to the future.  Readers are cautioned that actual results may differ materially from those set forth herein and are referred to our Terms and Conditions for more information.
