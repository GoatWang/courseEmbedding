consolidation strategy in the semiconductor backend equipment
industry by complementing its exposure technology portfolio with

company’s lithography segment by adding a new product
line and core technology, both of which are highly complementary to
our existing exposure capability.” says Frank P.
Averdung, President and CEO of SÜSS MicroTec AG.
“SUSS MicroTec thereby becomes the leading backend
lithography equipment and solution provider by offering the most
comprehensive set of products and technologies to the market. This
enables us to uniquely satisfy a range of customer’s
needs and allows us to offer a broad product range to meet the
different price and performance points required by the
industry.”“We are pleased to become a part of
SUSS MicroTec, a company with a strong market position in
semiconductor backend lithography, a global sales and service

TMA Homeowner Annual Meeting Board Candidates



Tamarack Homeowners,
Please see below three new candidates that have stepped up to run for the TMA Board positions in which elections will be held at the annual meeting on August 30th. Please visit the tmaidaho.com website to see the current Board of Director’s Bio’s.   You may vote for the candidate that represents your specific property(s) type.  Class A Cabin includes owners of Cottages, Chalets and Town homes.  Class A Residential includes all Estate, Villa or Custom Chalet developed or undeveloped properties.   As more candidates come forward, I will post their Bio’s on here.  If you cannot attend this meeting, I will be happy to obtain your proxy and vote on your behalf.  It is important we obtain enough votes to reach a quorum.  Since I own both property types, I can proxy both classes.
 
CLASS A CABIN – JULIE HUTCHINSON
Julie Hutchinson is a long time Tamarack multiple property owner (since 2005), and also an ex-Tam employee (real estate controller 2005-2008), and would like to represent you on the board. Her college degree is in finance and accounting, and she has worked in her field for 25+ years, in a variety of industries. She and her family reside in Boise, and spend at least 40 weekends a year at Tamarack. She is very interested in the future of Tamarack. Having paid dues for almost 10 years, she has a strong understanding of how these costs affect the satisfaction of ownership.
Challenges we face in the upcoming year will be to:
Form a strong, healthy working relationship with David Papiez and New Trac, as we would all like to meet our expectations within our budget constraints.
Properly separate of BUA/TMA/LOMA monies. As TMA controller, Julie helped separate the TMA funds from the Tamarack LLC general funds, and strongly feels that clear differentiation of funds is necessary.
Examine the prospect of TMA living within their budget based on regular dues, which with the influx of developer dues should be possible.
And finally, to create transparency . Julie well understands the perplexing feelings of home ownership at Tamarack. The more we know and the easier it is to access information, the easier it is to quell speculation and increase homeowner satisfaction.
CLASS A CABIN – BEVERLY HELLMAN
My name is Beverly Hellman. I am a Cabin Class homeowner in Tamarack, and our Bitterroot Chalet at 71 Twin Creeks Ct. is our primary residence. As this has been our primary residence for 2.5 years, I would like to give back / contribute to our community by running for the Class A Cabin Residential representative to the TMA Board of Directors. I am very interested in representing the interests of you and other Townhome, Cottage and Chalet homeowners. I am therefore asking for your vote, either in person or via proxy, at the TMA Annual Members Meeting on August 30.
A little about me:
My husband, Kent, and I bought our first property in Tamarack during the Whitewater Release in Winter of 2005. Our Golden Bench townhouse was our vacation home from our February 2006 move-in through the time when we made our Bitterroot Chalet our primary residence. We still own an interest in a Golden Bench townhouse.
I am now retired and have the time to devote to TMA Board activities. I believe my background and experiences will allow me to help the Board make sound business decisions that meet the interests of the Tamarack community as a whole as well as those of the Cabin Class homeowners. This experience includes:
I live the majority of the year in Tamarack, know many homeowners and am accessible in the community.
My corporate management experience included responsibilities for budgeting, project financial justification, personnel management, process improvement and customer support.
For 21 years as a Marketing Representative and Systems Engineer with IBM I provided consulting services to clients, helping businesses and governments justify investments in computer hardware, software and business process re-engineering. This included cost/benefit analysis as well as payback period and return on investment analysis. I also helped them apply technology to solve their business problems.
I have taken advantage of many of the services TMA and the Resort have to offer. I ski and golf and have enjoyed rafting and other recreational activities available here. We use TVT for our internet and television services.
As a volunteer, my experience includes:
Board of Directors for the Santa Barbara Westside Boys and Girls Club, helping provide direction and raising funds for programs
Committee member for providing oversight and direction of my church’s Children’s and Youth Ministries programs
Human Resources committee member for my church which includes preparing and managing personnel budgets, planning for employee benefits and interviewing/hiring new employees.
Helping out at the Donnelly Food Pantry that provides food and clothing to those in need in our community.
As your representative to the Board, I would hope to keep open communications with you on TMA Board-related concerns and actions.
If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at bevhellman@hotmail.com or (805)689-0306.  – Bev Hellman
 
CLASS A ESTATE RESIDENTIAL – JOHN T EDWARDS
John Edwards has been attending TMA annual meetings since he (with his wife, Robyn) purchased their first Estate Property at the resort in 2011. John is on site in Tamarack over 100 days each year. Many of you have met John, Robyn and their 3 boys golfing, skiing, biking or hiking at our resort. When not living at Tripod Court, the Edwards family resides 90 miles away in Hidden Springs, Idaho.
A trial lawyer, John has made a career of representing “the little guy” (ordinary people) against large institutions and insurance companies. For 24 years John has practiced personal injury litigation — almost all of them representing regular people against whichever Goliath crosses their path. Oddly enough, it is his desire that the regular people of Tamarack be protected that draws him to seek a position on the board – that is to say that for John protection of the homeowners in their dealings with the TMA is as important as protecting the TMA in its dealings with its own Goliath(s) .
John brings a unique set of skills and knowledge to the board:
He is an excellent communicator, understanding that honest, open communication results in satisfaction in each process. For example, he understands what information is important as well as the importance of how it is presented to those adverse that allows them to justify resolution of disputes.
Over the course of years, he has developed relationships founded on experience and trust with those whom he opposes. Professionally, one of the biggest sources of John’s new clients are the very lawyers and adjustors whom he opposes daily.

Tamarack Resort Ownership and Management Update



INTRODUCTION



 
Tamarack Resort officially opened in 2004, and was lauded by national and international media as the most exciting new four-season destination in the United States, providing luxury services, accommodations, and facilities all in the stunning mountains of Central Idaho. Initially, Tamarack was able to exceed expectations and built a resort and real estate product comparable to many well-established resort destinations. The quality of the buildings, the design, the ski product, and the attention to detail was first-class.
The implosion of the US real estate market and arrival of the recession in early 2008, hit Tamarack hard, and foreclosure proceedings were soon filed against the Resort’s original developers by Credit Suisse, which had funded a loan to Tamarack in 2006. The ensuing six years of foreclosure and bankruptcy litigation eventually came to an end on March 10, 2014, when a conglomerate of lenders led by Credit Suisse conducted a sheriff’s sale to foreclose their mortgages on virtually all of the Resort and its assets.
Over the past six years, Tamarack has survived through the involvement of the non-profit Tamarack Municipal Association (TMA), which currently manages the ski mountain and golf course, as well as several for-profit companies that currently manage lodging, real estate resale, and other guest amenities such as the Zipline. The efforts of these organizations have kept life at the Resort and positioned it for resurgence under new ownership.
NEW OWNERSHIP & MANAGEMENT 
The conglomerate of lenders that foreclosed on the Resort at the March 10th sheriff’s sale, created a new holding company called New TR Acquisition Company, LLC (or “New TRAC”), to own the Resort and its assets. New TRAC is the successor declarant of Tamarack Resort LLC (TRLLC) and owns all the tangible and intangible property of the former development company with the exception of Village Plaza, four parcels of vacant land originally planned for a Fairmont hotel, the Osprey Meadows Golf Course and the Arling Center. New TRAC has a newly formed Board of Managers comprised of five extremely talented individuals drawn from the real estate and restructuring sectors. New TRAC is represented at the Resort by Project Manager David Papiez who was the former Asset Manager of TRLLC prior to the sheriff’s sale. New TRAC is committed to the success of Tamarack, is investing to restore and grow its operations, and is eager to continue the passion and dedication that the TMA and homeowners exhibited over the past six years.






New TRAC hired Replay Resorts Inc. as Asset Manager to help run the day-to-day operations of the Resort and to provide strategic guidance for future operations and real estate development. Replay was created by the founder and key leaders of Intrawest, which at one time was the largest ski resort operations company in the world. Managing Director David Hill heads up Replay’s engagement at Tamarack and brings with him a wealth of knowledge and experience garnered through a 25-year career in resort and real estate development. Replay employees directly engaged on Tamarack include Director of Business Development Yoav Olund, Development Manager Mariana Ishida, and Senior Analysis Eric Chan.
THE NEAR FUTURE 
New TRAC and Replay have been busy over the past several months working through a lengthy list of post-sheriff’s sale cleanup items and on short- and long-term goals for the Resort. On the operations side, numerous small projects are currently underway that include painting the Tamarack and Summit Express chairlifts, staining buildings, and repairing the snowmaking system. On the real estate side, four cottages in the Trillium neighborhood have been improved and are currently on the market. Special attention is being given to repairing the retaining walls, drainage system, and road surface in the Trillium neighborhood.
With the Resort long overdue for good news, Replay and New TRAC are working with the TMA to craft a new PR and advertising campaign in preparation for the upcoming ski season, which is right around the corner with opening day slated for mid-December!
STAY TUNED 
New TRAC and Replay are diligently working on various initiatives for the Resort and we invite everyone to visit our website and register to receive up-to-date information.

PRESS RELEASE
Tamarack Valley Energy Ltd. Announces Closing of Spur Resources Ltd. Acquisition and Increase in Borrowing Base to $220 Million
CALGARY, ALBERTA–(Marketwired – Jan. 11, 2017) –
Tamarack Valley Energy Ltd. (“Tamarack” or the “Company”) (TSX:TVE) is pleased to announce that it has successfully completed the previously announced acquisition (the “Acquisition”) of Spur Resources Ltd. (“Spur”) pursuant to a plan of arrangement under the provisions of the Business Corporations Act (Alberta). Immediately prior to the closing of the Acquisition, Spur conveyed all of its non-Viking assets to a newly formed private company, to be led by the former Spur management team. As a result, pursuant to the Acquisition, Tamarack acquired all of Spur’s concentrated, high netback, light oil-weighted Viking focused assets with complementary operations in southwestern Saskatchewan and southeastern Alberta. 





All of the issued and outstanding common shares of Spur were acquired by Tamarack for consideration consisting of approximately $57.3 million in cash and 90.1 million common shares of Tamarack (“Tamarack Shares”) as well as the assumption of Spur’s debt. Total consideration paid by Tamarack, including the assumed debt, was approximately $407.5 million based on a 10-day volume weighted average price of $3.60 per Tamarack Share prior to the Acquisition announcement. At Tamarack’s special meeting of shareholders to approve the issuance of the Tamarack Shares pursuant to the Acquisition, 66.44% of the outstanding Tamarack Shares were represented and the issuance was approved by 99.95% of the Tamarack Shares represented at the meeting. Immediately following completion of the Acquisition, Tamarack completed an amalgamation of Tamarack Acquisition Corp. and Spur. The amalgamated corporation will continue as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tamarack under the name “Tamarack Acquisition Corp.”.
The Company is also pleased to announce that concurrent with the closing of the Acquisition, its extendible revolving credit facilities (the “Credit Facilities”) were amended to increase the borrowing base by over 80% to $220 million from $120 million. After giving effect to this increase, the Credit Facilities are comprised of: (i) an extendible revolving syndicated term credit facility of $200 million (increased from $110 million); and (ii) an extendible revolving working capital credit facility of $20 million (increased from $10 million). 





Following completion of the Acquisition, Tamarack has approximately 227.6 million Tamarack Shares issued and outstanding which includes 500,000 Tamarack Shares issued on a “flow-through” basis on December 29, 2016 at a price of $5.00 per Tamarack Share (the “Flow-Through Shares”). The gross proceeds from the sale of the Flow-Through Shares will be used to incur and renounce Canadian exploration expenses pursuant to the Income Tax Act (Canada).
Peters & Co. Limited acted as financial advisor to Tamarack with respect to the Acquisition. CIBC World Markets and Macquarie Capital Markets acted as strategic advisors to Tamarack with respect to the Acquisition.
