Early life, education, and psychologist career[edit]
Murphy was born in Cleveland and is a native of Northfield, Ohio, where he attended St. Barnabas Catholic School and Walsh Jesuit High School. He received his Bachelor of Science from Wheeling Jesuit University, his MA from Cleveland State University, and his Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Pittsburgh.[2]
Upon leaving school, he became a practicing psychologist and an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh. He also made regular appearances on KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh from 1979 to 1995 as a health care expert.[3]
Murphy co-authored The Angry Child: Regaining Control When Your Child Is Out of Control (2002). The Angry Child won the National Parenting Publications Award and was featured on Book TV,[4] a program of C-SPAN. A few years later, he co-authored Overcoming Passive-Aggression: How to Stop Hidden Anger from Spoiling Your Relationships, Career, and Happiness (2005), both co-authored with Loriann Hoff Oberlin, a writer/author and mental health counselor.
Overcoming Passive-Aggression received abundant reviews, including those from the mental health field. Murphy has been interviewed by reporters from Psychology Today,[5] the Washington Post, USA Today, the CBS Early Show, CNN,[6] CBS Face the Nation,[7] C-SPAN, and others in the media on the topics of mental health, anger management and violence, parenting and relationships.
Pennsylvania Senate (1996–2003)[edit]
Elections[edit]
In 1996, Republican State Senator Mike Fisher decided not to run for re-election in order to run for Pennsylvania Attorney General. Murphy decided to run in Pennsylvania's 37th senate district. He won the Republican primary, defeating John Schnatterly 70%–30%.[8]
In the general election, he defeated State Representative Greg Fajt 55%–45%.[9] In 2000, he won re-election to a second term, defeating Joseph Rudolph 64%–36%.[10]
Tenure[edit]
He wrote the Pennsylvania Patient Bill of Rights and supported public funding for medical research. In 2002, the political website PoliticsPA named him to the list of "Smartest Legislators".[11] He resigned his state senate seat on January 3, 2003.

U.S. House of Representatives (2003–present)[edit]
Elections[edit]

2002

After redistricting, Murphy ran for the newly redrawn 18th Congressional District in 2002. The district had previously been the 20th, represented by four-term Democrat Frank Mascara. However, the legislature re-drew the district after the 2000 Census in such a way that a large portion of Mascara's district ended up in the neighboring Johnstown-based 12th District, represented by 28-year incumbent John Murtha. The new district lines were harshly criticized, in part because in some areas portions of several neighborhoods—and even streets—were split between districts. In some areas, one side of the street was in the 18th while the other was in the 12th. In the most extreme example, nearly all of Mascara's hometown of Charleroi was drawn into the 12th district, but Mascara's house stayed in the 18th. After a legal battle, the courts largely upheld Pennsylvania's redistricting plan after some minor modifications. Murphy was a member of the committee that redrew Pennsylvania's congressional map, and rumors abounded that he'd reconfigured the district for himself, even though numerous Democrats were also on the committee. Mascara challenged Murtha in the Democratic primary for the 12th District, since the newly configured 12th was geographically more his district than Murtha's. However, Murtha easily defeated Mascara. This removed a significant barrier to Murphy. Even though Democrats outnumbered Republicans by 70,000 registered voters, it was somewhat friendlier to Republicans than the old 20th had been.
Murphy won the Republican primary unopposed and won the general election, defeating Democrat Jack Machek 60%–40%.[12]

2004

Murphy won re-election to a second term, defeating Mark Boles 63%–37%.[13]

2006

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2006 § District 18
In 2006, Murphy was confronted by KDKA News reporter Andy Sheehan with evidence indicating his District Office employees were illegally working on his campaign.[14] Murphy was challenged by Democrat Chad Kluko, a telecommunications executive, in the November 2006 general election. Murphy won re-election to a third term, defeating Kluko 58%–42%.[15]

2008

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2008 § District 18
Murphy was challenged by Democrat Steve O'Donnell, a Monroeville health care executive. Murphy won re-election to a fourth term, defeating O'Donnell 64%–36%.[16][17]

2010

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2010 § District 18
Murphy was challenged by Democrat Dan Connolly. Murphy was endorsed by Veterans of Foreign Wars PAC[18] and the US Chamber of Commerce.[19] Murphy won re-election to a fifth term, defeating Connolly 67%–33%.[20]

2012

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2012 § District 18
For the first time in Murphy's career, he was challenged in the Republican primary. Evan Feinberg, also of Upper St Clair, was a 28-year-old political novice and "Tea Party" favorite,[21] was endorsed by Senators Rand Paul and Tom Coburn, FreedomWorks, and ABC Contractors. Murphy had the backing of two pro-life groups: National Right to Life Committee and PA Pro-Life Federation. He was also endorsed by former Governor Tom Ridge, former Congresswoman Melissa Hart, Allegheny County Republican Party Chairman Jim Roddey, State Representative Mark Mustio, State Senate candidate D. Raja, the National Rifle Association, and the Fraternal Order of Police of Allegheny County.[22][23][24] Murphy won the primary 63%–33%.[25][26] In the general election, he won re-election to his sixth term, defeating Washington County Commissioner Larry Maggi 64%–36%.[27][28]

2014

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2014 § District 18
Murphy successfully ran for re-election to a seventh term in the U.S. House in the 2014 election. He was re-nominated unopposed in the Republican primary and was unopposed in the general election, since no candidates filed to run in the Democratic primary.[29][30]

2016

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2016 § District 18
Murphy was unopposed in the primary and the general election. He was re-elected to his eighth term in the U.S. House.
Tenure[edit]
Murphy lives in Upper St. Clair, a suburb of Pittsburgh. However, he is listed on the official House roll as "R-Pittsburgh", although his district does not include any portion of Pittsburgh itself.
On November 26, 2005, Murphy was injured during a traffic accident in Iraq while riding in a van along with fellow Congressmen Jim Marshall and Ike Skelton. The van swerved off the road to avoid an oncoming vehicle and overturned, injuring Murphy and Skelton. The two were airlifted to Ibn Sina Hospital in Baghdad.
After an MRI indicated head and neck injuries, Murphy was flown to the U.S. Military's Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany for further tests, which indicated no permanent damage. After wearing a neck brace for a brief period, Murphy made a full recovery.[31][32]
He opposed both Wall Street bailouts in 2008, the $820 billion stimulus package supported by President Obama, and the climate change/greenhouse gas initiative bill known as "Cap and Trade."[33]
Murphy was named a "Hero of the Taxpayer" by Americans for Tax Reform.[34] Notably, he voted to increase the debt limit along with historic budget cuts in August 2011.[35] Prior to that, he approved the "short term" debt limit increase.[36]
Murphy supported a House earmark ban in theory but made nearly $14 million in earmark requests in 2010.[37] The progressive lobbying group called Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) released its third annual report on the most corrupt members of Congress titled "Beyond DeLay: The 22 Most Corrupt Members of Congress (and two to watch)".[38] Murphy was included on the list. CREW issued their analysis of Murphy's alleged ethical lapses.[39][39]
Murphy co-sponsored the Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act, along with Democratic Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio. The bill, which passed the House of Representatives on September 29, 2010, received bi-partisan support. The final vote was 348–79. The measure would authorize the United States Department of Commerce to impose tariffs and countervailing duties against goods from countries with currencies that it deems are undervalued.[40]
Murphy told WDUQ that the goal is to, “protect domestic manufacturers and the steel industry from countries unwilling to compete fairly in the global marketplace.” He added that by tying China's currency to the dollar and not floating its currency on the open market, China can undercut US manufactures by 40%. In other words, manufacturers in China can make and ship products to the US for less than a manufacturer here can buy the raw materials.[41] The Senate failed to take up the legislation, and Murphy reintroduced the bi-partisan measure in February 2011.[41]
As a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Murphy was at the forefront of exposing the approximately $500 million taxpayer funded green energy loan scandals involving Solyndra in 2011. In appearances on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360° and Fox News Channel, he highlighted the wasteful spending and political associations involved in the now bankrupt solar panel company.[42][43]
Following the shooting of Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ), Murphy and Mental Health Caucus Co-Chair Grace Napolitano (D-CA) spoke with national media about mental health issues.[44] Both members also held briefings for congressional staffers with questions on the Tucson shooting.[45]
In the 114th Congress, Murphy sponsored the Helping Families In Mental Health Crisis Act, a landmark mental health reform bill which, according to Fortune, "increase the availability of psychiatric hospital beds, establish a new assistant secretary for mental health and substance use disorders in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and boost treatment for young mental health patients, among other provisions."[46] The bill was passed by the House in a near-unanimous 422-2 vote,[47] The bill was considered the most significant attempt at mental health reform in decades.[48] The bill was folded into the 21st Century Cures Act and signed into law in December 2016.[49]
At the beginning of 2017, Murphy voted in favor of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) modification bill known as the American Health Care Act (AHCA). This was the 2nd time this bill was attempted with it being pulled in March 2017 for lack of support based largely on it's removal of protections for pre-existing conditions denying 24 million Americans affordable healthcare.[50][51] He has reportedly refused to host town hall meetings[52][53] The week after Murphy's health care votes one of the largest protests outside his office occurred.[54]
Murphy was ranked as the 49th most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the 114th United States Congress (and the fifth most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania) in the Bipartisan Index created by The Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy that ranks members of the United States Congress by their degree of bipartisanship (by measuring the frequency each member's bills attract co-sponsors from the opposite party and each member's co-sponsorship of bills by members of the opposite party).[55]
In May 2017 Tim Murphy voted YES for the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act.[56]

Early life, education, and psychologist career[edit]
Murphy was born in Cleveland and is a native of Northfield, Ohio, where he attended St. Barnabas Catholic School and Walsh Jesuit High School. He received his Bachelor of Science from Wheeling Jesuit University, his MA from Cleveland State University, and his Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Pittsburgh.[2]
Upon leaving school, he became a practicing psychologist and an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh. He also made regular appearances on KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh from 1979 to 1995 as a health care expert.[3]
Murphy co-authored The Angry Child: Regaining Control When Your Child Is Out of Control (2002). The Angry Child won the National Parenting Publications Award and was featured on Book TV,[4] a program of C-SPAN. A few years later, he co-authored Overcoming Passive-Aggression: How to Stop Hidden Anger from Spoiling Your Relationships, Career, and Happiness (2005), both co-authored with Loriann Hoff Oberlin, a writer/author and mental health counselor.
Overcoming Passive-Aggression received abundant reviews, including those from the mental health field. Murphy has been interviewed by reporters from Psychology Today,[5] the Washington Post, USA Today, the CBS Early Show, CNN,[6] CBS Face the Nation,[7] C-SPAN, and others in the media on the topics of mental health, anger management and violence, parenting and relationships.
Pennsylvania Senate (1996–2003)[edit]
Elections[edit]
In 1996, Republican State Senator Mike Fisher decided not to run for re-election in order to run for Pennsylvania Attorney General. Murphy decided to run in Pennsylvania's 37th senate district. He won the Republican primary, defeating John Schnatterly 70%–30%.[8]
In the general election, he defeated State Representative Greg Fajt 55%–45%.[9] In 2000, he won re-election to a second term, defeating Joseph Rudolph 64%–36%.[10]
Tenure[edit]
He wrote the Pennsylvania Patient Bill of Rights and supported public funding for medical research. In 2002, the political website PoliticsPA named him to the list of "Smartest Legislators".[11] He resigned his state senate seat on January 3, 2003.
Committee assignments[edit]

U.S. House of Representatives (2003–present)[edit]
Elections[edit]

2002

After redistricting, Murphy ran for the newly redrawn 18th Congressional District in 2002. The district had previously been the 20th, represented by four-term Democrat Frank Mascara. However, the legislature re-drew the district after the 2000 Census in such a way that a large portion of Mascara's district ended up in the neighboring Johnstown-based 12th District, represented by 28-year incumbent John Murtha. The new district lines were harshly criticized, in part because in some areas portions of several neighborhoods—and even streets—were split between districts. In some areas, one side of the street was in the 18th while the other was in the 12th. In the most extreme example, nearly all of Mascara's hometown of Charleroi was drawn into the 12th district, but Mascara's house stayed in the 18th. After a legal battle, the courts largely upheld Pennsylvania's redistricting plan after some minor modifications. Murphy was a member of the committee that redrew Pennsylvania's congressional map, and rumors abounded that he'd reconfigured the district for himself, even though numerous Democrats were also on the committee. Mascara challenged Murtha in the Democratic primary for the 12th District, since the newly configured 12th was geographically more his district than Murtha's. However, Murtha easily defeated Mascara. This removed a significant barrier to Murphy. Even though Democrats outnumbered Republicans by 70,000 registered voters, it was somewhat friendlier to Republicans than the old 20th had been.
Murphy won the Republican primary unopposed and won the general election, defeating Democrat Jack Machek 60%–40%.[12]

2004

Murphy won re-election to a second term, defeating Mark Boles 63%–37%.[13]

2006

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2006 § District 18
In 2006, Murphy was confronted by KDKA News reporter Andy Sheehan with evidence indicating his District Office employees were illegally working on his campaign.[14] Murphy was challenged by Democrat Chad Kluko, a telecommunications executive, in the November 2006 general election. Murphy won re-election to a third term, defeating Kluko 58%–42%.[15]

2008

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2008 § District 18
Murphy was challenged by Democrat Steve O'Donnell, a Monroeville health care executive. Murphy won re-election to a fourth term, defeating O'Donnell 64%–36%.[16][17]

2010

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2010 § District 18
Murphy was challenged by Democrat Dan Connolly. Murphy was endorsed by Veterans of Foreign Wars PAC[18] and the US Chamber of Commerce.[19] Murphy won re-election to a fifth term, defeating Connolly 67%–33%.[20]

2012

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2012 § District 18
For the first time in Murphy's career, he was challenged in the Republican primary. Evan Feinberg, also of Upper St Clair, was a 28-year-old political novice and "Tea Party" favorite,[21] was endorsed by Senators Rand Paul and Tom Coburn, FreedomWorks, and ABC Contractors. Murphy had the backing of two pro-life groups: National Right to Life Committee and PA Pro-Life Federation. He was also endorsed by former Governor Tom Ridge, former Congresswoman Melissa Hart, Allegheny County Republican Party Chairman Jim Roddey, State Representative Mark Mustio, State Senate candidate D. Raja, the National Rifle Association, and the Fraternal Order of Police of Allegheny County.[22][23][24] Murphy won the primary 63%–33%.[25][26] In the general election, he won re-election to his sixth term, defeating Washington County Commissioner Larry Maggi 64%–36%.[27][28]

2014

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2014 § District 18
Murphy successfully ran for re-election to a seventh term in the U.S. House in the 2014 election. He was re-nominated unopposed in the Republican primary and was unopposed in the general election, since no candidates filed to run in the Democratic primary.[29][30]

2016

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2016 § District 18
Murphy was unopposed in the primary and the general election. He was re-elected to his eighth term in the U.S. House.
Tenure[edit]
Murphy lives in Upper St. Clair, a suburb of Pittsburgh. However, he is listed on the official House roll as "R-Pittsburgh", although his district does not include any portion of Pittsburgh itself.
On November 26, 2005, Murphy was injured during a traffic accident in Iraq while riding in a van along with fellow Congressmen Jim Marshall and Ike Skelton. The van swerved off the road to avoid an oncoming vehicle and overturned, injuring Murphy and Skelton. The two were airlifted to Ibn Sina Hospital in Baghdad.
After an MRI indicated head and neck injuries, Murphy was flown to the U.S. Military's Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany for further tests, which indicated no permanent damage. After wearing a neck brace for a brief period, Murphy made a full recovery.[31][32]
He opposed both Wall Street bailouts in 2008, the $820 billion stimulus package supported by President Obama, and the climate change/greenhouse gas initiative bill known as "Cap and Trade."[33]
Murphy was named a "Hero of the Taxpayer" by Americans for Tax Reform.[34] Notably, he voted to increase the debt limit along with historic budget cuts in August 2011.[35] Prior to that, he approved the "short term" debt limit increase.[36]
Murphy supported a House earmark ban in theory but made nearly $14 million in earmark requests in 2010.[37] The progressive lobbying group called Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) released its third annual report on the most corrupt members of Congress titled "Beyond DeLay: The 22 Most Corrupt Members of Congress (and two to watch)".[38] Murphy was included on the list. CREW issued their analysis of Murphy's alleged ethical lapses.[39][39]
Murphy co-sponsored the Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act, along with Democratic Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio. The bill, which passed the House of Representatives on September 29, 2010, received bi-partisan support. The final vote was 348–79. The measure would authorize the United States Department of Commerce to impose tariffs and countervailing duties against goods from countries with currencies that it deems are undervalued.[40]
Murphy told WDUQ that the goal is to, “protect domestic manufacturers and the steel industry from countries unwilling to compete fairly in the global marketplace.” He added that by tying China's currency to the dollar and not floating its currency on the open market, China can undercut US manufactures by 40%. In other words, manufacturers in China can make and ship products to the US for less than a manufacturer here can buy the raw materials.[41] The Senate failed to take up the legislation, and Murphy reintroduced the bi-partisan measure in February 2011.[41]
As a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Murphy was at the forefront of exposing the approximately $500 million taxpayer funded green energy loan scandals involving Solyndra in 2011. In appearances on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360° and Fox News Channel, he highlighted the wasteful spending and political associations involved in the now bankrupt solar panel company.[42][43]
Following the shooting of Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ), Murphy and Mental Health Caucus Co-Chair Grace Napolitano (D-CA) spoke with national media about mental health issues.[44] Both members also held briefings for congressional staffers with questions on the Tucson shooting.[45]
In the 114th Congress, Murphy sponsored the Helping Families In Mental Health Crisis Act, a landmark mental health reform bill which, according to Fortune, "increase the availability of psychiatric hospital beds, establish a new assistant secretary for mental health and substance use disorders in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and boost treatment for young mental health patients, among other provisions."[46] The bill was passed by the House in a near-unanimous 422-2 vote,[47] The bill was considered the most significant attempt at mental health reform in decades.[48] The bill was folded into the 21st Century Cures Act and signed into law in December 2016.[49]
At the beginning of 2017, Murphy voted in favor of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) modification bill known as the American Health Care Act (AHCA). This was the 2nd time this bill was attempted with it being pulled in March 2017 for lack of support based largely on it's removal of protections for pre-existing conditions denying 24 million Americans affordable healthcare.[50][51] He has reportedly refused to host town hall meetings[52][53] The week after Murphy's health care votes one of the largest protests outside his office occurred.[54]
Murphy was ranked as the 49th most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the 114th United States Congress (and the fifth most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania) in the Bipartisan Index created by The Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy that ranks members of the United States Congress by their degree of bipartisanship (by measuring the frequency each member's bills attract co-sponsors from the opposite party and each member's co-sponsorship of bills by members of the opposite party).[55]
In May 2017 Tim Murphy voted YES for the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act.[56]

Early life, education, and psychologist career[edit]
Murphy was born in Cleveland and is a native of Northfield, Ohio, where he attended St. Barnabas Catholic School and Walsh Jesuit High School. He received his Bachelor of Science from Wheeling Jesuit University, his MA from Cleveland State University, and his Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Pittsburgh.[2]
Upon leaving school, he became a practicing psychologist and an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh. He also made regular appearances on KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh from 1979 to 1995 as a health care expert.[3]
Murphy co-authored The Angry Child: Regaining Control When Your Child Is Out of Control (2002). The Angry Child won the National Parenting Publications Award and was featured on Book TV,[4] a program of C-SPAN. A few years later, he co-authored Overcoming Passive-Aggression: How to Stop Hidden Anger from Spoiling Your Relationships, Career, and Happiness (2005), both co-authored with Loriann Hoff Oberlin, a writer/author and mental health counselor.
Overcoming Passive-Aggression received abundant reviews, including those from the mental health field. Murphy has been interviewed by reporters from Psychology Today,[5] the Washington Post, USA Today, the CBS Early Show, CNN,[6] CBS Face the Nation,[7] C-SPAN, and others in the media on the topics of mental health, anger management and violence, parenting and relationships.
Pennsylvania Senate (1996–2003)[edit]
Elections[edit]
In 1996, Republican State Senator Mike Fisher decided not to run for re-election in order to run for Pennsylvania Attorney General. Murphy decided to run in Pennsylvania's 37th senate district. He won the Republican primary, defeating John Schnatterly 70%–30%.[8]
In the general election, he defeated State Representative Greg Fajt 55%–45%.[9] In 2000, he won re-election to a second term, defeating Joseph Rudolph 64%–36%.[10]
Tenure[edit]
He wrote the Pennsylvania Patient Bill of Rights and supported public funding for medical research. In 2002, the political website PoliticsPA named him to the list of "Smartest Legislators".[11] He resigned his state senate seat on January 3, 2003.
Committee assignments[edit]

U.S. House of Representatives (2003–present)[edit]
Elections[edit]

2002

After redistricting, Murphy ran for the newly redrawn 18th Congressional District in 2002. The district had previously been the 20th, represented by four-term Democrat Frank Mascara. However, the legislature re-drew the district after the 2000 Census in such a way that a large portion of Mascara's district ended up in the neighboring Johnstown-based 12th District, represented by 28-year incumbent John Murtha. The new district lines were harshly criticized, in part because in some areas portions of several neighborhoods—and even streets—were split between districts. In some areas, one side of the street was in the 18th while the other was in the 12th. In the most extreme example, nearly all of Mascara's hometown of Charleroi was drawn into the 12th district, but Mascara's house stayed in the 18th. After a legal battle, the courts largely upheld Pennsylvania's redistricting plan after some minor modifications. Murphy was a member of the committee that redrew Pennsylvania's congressional map, and rumors abounded that he'd reconfigured the district for himself, even though numerous Democrats were also on the committee. Mascara challenged Murtha in the Democratic primary for the 12th District, since the newly configured 12th was geographically more his district than Murtha's. However, Murtha easily defeated Mascara. This removed a significant barrier to Murphy. Even though Democrats outnumbered Republicans by 70,000 registered voters, it was somewhat friendlier to Republicans than the old 20th had been.
Murphy won the Republican primary unopposed and won the general election, defeating Democrat Jack Machek 60%–40%.[12]

2004

Murphy won re-election to a second term, defeating Mark Boles 63%–37%.[13]

2006

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2006 § District 18
In 2006, Murphy was confronted by KDKA News reporter Andy Sheehan with evidence indicating his District Office employees were illegally working on his campaign.[14] Murphy was challenged by Democrat Chad Kluko, a telecommunications executive, in the November 2006 general election. Murphy won re-election to a third term, defeating Kluko 58%–42%.[15]

2008

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2008 § District 18
Murphy was challenged by Democrat Steve O'Donnell, a Monroeville health care executive. Murphy won re-election to a fourth term, defeating O'Donnell 64%–36%.[16][17]

2010

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2010 § District 18
Murphy was challenged by Democrat Dan Connolly. Murphy was endorsed by Veterans of Foreign Wars PAC[18] and the US Chamber of Commerce.[19] Murphy won re-election to a fifth term, defeating Connolly 67%–33%.[20]

2012

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2012 § District 18
For the first time in Murphy's career, he was challenged in the Republican primary. Evan Feinberg, also of Upper St Clair, was a 28-year-old political novice and "Tea Party" favorite,[21] was endorsed by Senators Rand Paul and Tom Coburn, FreedomWorks, and ABC Contractors. Murphy had the backing of two pro-life groups: National Right to Life Committee and PA Pro-Life Federation. He was also endorsed by former Governor Tom Ridge, former Congresswoman Melissa Hart, Allegheny County Republican Party Chairman Jim Roddey, State Representative Mark Mustio, State Senate candidate D. Raja, the National Rifle Association, and the Fraternal Order of Police of Allegheny County.[22][23][24] Murphy won the primary 63%–33%.[25][26] In the general election, he won re-election to his sixth term, defeating Washington County Commissioner Larry Maggi 64%–36%.[27][28]

2014

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2014 § District 18
Murphy successfully ran for re-election to a seventh term in the U.S. House in the 2014 election. He was re-nominated unopposed in the Republican primary and was unopposed in the general election, since no candidates filed to run in the Democratic primary.[29][30]

2016

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2016 § District 18
Murphy was unopposed in the primary and the general election. He was re-elected to his eighth term in the U.S. House.
Tenure[edit]
Murphy lives in Upper St. Clair, a suburb of Pittsburgh. However, he is listed on the official House roll as "R-Pittsburgh", although his district does not include any portion of Pittsburgh itself.
On November 26, 2005, Murphy was injured during a traffic accident in Iraq while riding in a van along with fellow Congressmen Jim Marshall and Ike Skelton. The van swerved off the road to avoid an oncoming vehicle and overturned, injuring Murphy and Skelton. The two were airlifted to Ibn Sina Hospital in Baghdad.
After an MRI indicated head and neck injuries, Murphy was flown to the U.S. Military's Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany for further tests, which indicated no permanent damage. After wearing a neck brace for a brief period, Murphy made a full recovery.[31][32]
He opposed both Wall Street bailouts in 2008, the $820 billion stimulus package supported by President Obama, and the climate change/greenhouse gas initiative bill known as "Cap and Trade."[33]
Murphy was named a "Hero of the Taxpayer" by Americans for Tax Reform.[34] Notably, he voted to increase the debt limit along with historic budget cuts in August 2011.[35] Prior to that, he approved the "short term" debt limit increase.[36]
Murphy supported a House earmark ban in theory but made nearly $14 million in earmark requests in 2010.[37] The progressive lobbying group called Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) released its third annual report on the most corrupt members of Congress titled "Beyond DeLay: The 22 Most Corrupt Members of Congress (and two to watch)".[38] Murphy was included on the list. CREW issued their analysis of Murphy's alleged ethical lapses.[39][39]
Murphy co-sponsored the Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act, along with Democratic Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio. The bill, which passed the House of Representatives on September 29, 2010, received bi-partisan support. The final vote was 348–79. The measure would authorize the United States Department of Commerce to impose tariffs and countervailing duties against goods from countries with currencies that it deems are undervalued.[40]
Murphy told WDUQ that the goal is to, “protect domestic manufacturers and the steel industry from countries unwilling to compete fairly in the global marketplace.” He added that by tying China's currency to the dollar and not floating its currency on the open market, China can undercut US manufactures by 40%. In other words, manufacturers in China can make and ship products to the US for less than a manufacturer here can buy the raw materials.[41] The Senate failed to take up the legislation, and Murphy reintroduced the bi-partisan measure in February 2011.[41]
As a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Murphy was at the forefront of exposing the approximately $500 million taxpayer funded green energy loan scandals involving Solyndra in 2011. In appearances on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360° and Fox News Channel, he highlighted the wasteful spending and political associations involved in the now bankrupt solar panel company.[42][43]
Following the shooting of Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ), Murphy and Mental Health Caucus Co-Chair Grace Napolitano (D-CA) spoke with national media about mental health issues.[44] Both members also held briefings for congressional staffers with questions on the Tucson shooting.[45]
In the 114th Congress, Murphy sponsored the Helping Families In Mental Health Crisis Act, a landmark mental health reform bill which, according to Fortune, "increase the availability of psychiatric hospital beds, establish a new assistant secretary for mental health and substance use disorders in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and boost treatment for young mental health patients, among other provisions."[46] The bill was passed by the House in a near-unanimous 422-2 vote,[47] The bill was considered the most significant attempt at mental health reform in decades.[48] The bill was folded into the 21st Century Cures Act and signed into law in December 2016.[49]
At the beginning of 2017, Murphy voted in favor of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) modification bill known as the American Health Care Act (AHCA). This was the 2nd time this bill was attempted with it being pulled in March 2017 for lack of support based largely on it's removal of protections for pre-existing conditions denying 24 million Americans affordable healthcare.[50][51] He has reportedly refused to host town hall meetings[52][53] The week after Murphy's health care votes one of the largest protests outside his office occurred.[54]
Murphy was ranked as the 49th most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the 114th United States Congress (and the fifth most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania) in the Bipartisan Index created by The Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy that ranks members of the United States Congress by their degree of bipartisanship (by measuring the frequency each member's bills attract co-sponsors from the opposite party and each member's co-sponsorship of bills by members of the opposite party).[55]
In May 2017 Tim Murphy voted YES for the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act.[56]

Early life, education, and psychologist career[edit]
Murphy was born in Cleveland and is a native of Northfield, Ohio, where he attended St. Barnabas Catholic School and Walsh Jesuit High School. He received his Bachelor of Science from Wheeling Jesuit University, his MA from Cleveland State University, and his Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Pittsburgh.[2]
Upon leaving school, he became a practicing psychologist and an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh. He also made regular appearances on KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh from 1979 to 1995 as a health care expert.[3]
Murphy co-authored The Angry Child: Regaining Control When Your Child Is Out of Control (2002). The Angry Child won the National Parenting Publications Award and was featured on Book TV,[4] a program of C-SPAN. A few years later, he co-authored Overcoming Passive-Aggression: How to Stop Hidden Anger from Spoiling Your Relationships, Career, and Happiness (2005), both co-authored with Loriann Hoff Oberlin, a writer/author and mental health counselor.
Overcoming Passive-Aggression received abundant reviews, including those from the mental health field. Murphy has been interviewed by reporters from Psychology Today,[5] the Washington Post, USA Today, the CBS Early Show, CNN,[6] CBS Face the Nation,[7] C-SPAN, and others in the media on the topics of mental health, anger management and violence, parenting and relationships.
Pennsylvania Senate (1996–2003)[edit]
Elections[edit]
In 1996, Republican State Senator Mike Fisher decided not to run for re-election in order to run for Pennsylvania Attorney General. Murphy decided to run in Pennsylvania's 37th senate district. He won the Republican primary, defeating John Schnatterly 70%–30%.[8]
In the general election, he defeated State Representative Greg Fajt 55%–45%.[9] In 2000, he won re-election to a second term, defeating Joseph Rudolph 64%–36%.[10]
Tenure[edit]
He wrote the Pennsylvania Patient Bill of Rights and supported public funding for medical research. In 2002, the political website PoliticsPA named him to the list of "Smartest Legislators".[11] He resigned his state senate seat on January 3, 2003.

U.S. House of Representatives (2003–present)[edit]
Elections[edit]

2002

After redistricting, Murphy ran for the newly redrawn 18th Congressional District in 2002. The district had previously been the 20th, represented by four-term Democrat Frank Mascara. However, the legislature re-drew the district after the 2000 Census in such a way that a large portion of Mascara's district ended up in the neighboring Johnstown-based 12th District, represented by 28-year incumbent John Murtha. The new district lines were harshly criticized, in part because in some areas portions of several neighborhoods—and even streets—were split between districts. In some areas, one side of the street was in the 18th while the other was in the 12th. In the most extreme example, nearly all of Mascara's hometown of Charleroi was drawn into the 12th district, but Mascara's house stayed in the 18th. After a legal battle, the courts largely upheld Pennsylvania's redistricting plan after some minor modifications. Murphy was a member of the committee that redrew Pennsylvania's congressional map, and rumors abounded that he'd reconfigured the district for himself, even though numerous Democrats were also on the committee. Mascara challenged Murtha in the Democratic primary for the 12th District, since the newly configured 12th was geographically more his district than Murtha's. However, Murtha easily defeated Mascara. This removed a significant barrier to Murphy. Even though Democrats outnumbered Republicans by 70,000 registered voters, it was somewhat friendlier to Republicans than the old 20th had been.
Murphy won the Republican primary unopposed and won the general election, defeating Democrat Jack Machek 60%–40%.[12]

2004

Murphy won re-election to a second term, defeating Mark Boles 63%–37%.[13]

2006

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2006 § District 18
In 2006, Murphy was confronted by KDKA News reporter Andy Sheehan with evidence indicating his District Office employees were illegally working on his campaign.[14] Murphy was challenged by Democrat Chad Kluko, a telecommunications executive, in the November 2006 general election. Murphy won re-election to a third term, defeating Kluko 58%–42%.[15]

2008

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2008 § District 18
Murphy was challenged by Democrat Steve O'Donnell, a Monroeville health care executive. Murphy won re-election to a fourth term, defeating O'Donnell 64%–36%.[16][17]

2010

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2010 § District 18
Murphy was challenged by Democrat Dan Connolly. Murphy was endorsed by Veterans of Foreign Wars PAC[18] and the US Chamber of Commerce.[19] Murphy won re-election to a fifth term, defeating Connolly 67%–33%.[20]

2012

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2012 § District 18
For the first time in Murphy's career, he was challenged in the Republican primary. Evan Feinberg, also of Upper St Clair, was a 28-year-old political novice and "Tea Party" favorite,[21] was endorsed by Senators Rand Paul and Tom Coburn, FreedomWorks, and ABC Contractors. Murphy had the backing of two pro-life groups: National Right to Life Committee and PA Pro-Life Federation. He was also endorsed by former Governor Tom Ridge, former Congresswoman Melissa Hart, Allegheny County Republican Party Chairman Jim Roddey, State Representative Mark Mustio, State Senate candidate D. Raja, the National Rifle Association, and the Fraternal Order of Police of Allegheny County.[22][23][24] Murphy won the primary 63%–33%.[25][26] In the general election, he won re-election to his sixth term, defeating Washington County Commissioner Larry Maggi 64%–36%.[27][28]

2014

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2014 § District 18
Murphy successfully ran for re-election to a seventh term in the U.S. House in the 2014 election. He was re-nominated unopposed in the Republican primary and was unopposed in the general election, since no candidates filed to run in the Democratic primary.[29][30]

2016

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2016 § District 18
Murphy was unopposed in the primary and the general election. He was re-elected to his eighth term in the U.S. House.
Tenure[edit]
Murphy lives in Upper St. Clair, a suburb of Pittsburgh. However, he is listed on the official House roll as "R-Pittsburgh", although his district does not include any portion of Pittsburgh itself.
On November 26, 2005, Murphy was injured during a traffic accident in Iraq while riding in a van along with fellow Congressmen Jim Marshall and Ike Skelton. The van swerved off the road to avoid an oncoming vehicle and overturned, injuring Murphy and Skelton. The two were airlifted to Ibn Sina Hospital in Baghdad.
After an MRI indicated head and neck injuries, Murphy was flown to the U.S. Military's Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany for further tests, which indicated no permanent damage. After wearing a neck brace for a brief period, Murphy made a full recovery.[31][32]
He opposed both Wall Street bailouts in 2008, the $820 billion stimulus package supported by President Obama, and the climate change/greenhouse gas initiative bill known as "Cap and Trade."[33]
Murphy was named a "Hero of the Taxpayer" by Americans for Tax Reform.[34] Notably, he voted to increase the debt limit along with historic budget cuts in August 2011.[35] Prior to that, he approved the "short term" debt limit increase.[36]
Murphy supported a House earmark ban in theory but made nearly $14 million in earmark requests in 2010.[37] The progressive lobbying group called Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) released its third annual report on the most corrupt members of Congress titled "Beyond DeLay: The 22 Most Corrupt Members of Congress (and two to watch)".[38] Murphy was included on the list. CREW issued their analysis of Murphy's alleged ethical lapses.[39][39]
Murphy co-sponsored the Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act, along with Democratic Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio. The bill, which passed the House of Representatives on September 29, 2010, received bi-partisan support. The final vote was 348–79. The measure would authorize the United States Department of Commerce to impose tariffs and countervailing duties against goods from countries with currencies that it deems are undervalued.[40]
Murphy told WDUQ that the goal is to, “protect domestic manufacturers and the steel industry from countries unwilling to compete fairly in the global marketplace.” He added that by tying China's currency to the dollar and not floating its currency on the open market, China can undercut US manufactures by 40%. In other words, manufacturers in China can make and ship products to the US for less than a manufacturer here can buy the raw materials.[41] The Senate failed to take up the legislation, and Murphy reintroduced the bi-partisan measure in February 2011.[41]
As a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Murphy was at the forefront of exposing the approximately $500 million taxpayer funded green energy loan scandals involving Solyndra in 2011. In appearances on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360° and Fox News Channel, he highlighted the wasteful spending and political associations involved in the now bankrupt solar panel company.[42][43]
Following the shooting of Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ), Murphy and Mental Health Caucus Co-Chair Grace Napolitano (D-CA) spoke with national media about mental health issues.[44] Both members also held briefings for congressional staffers with questions on the Tucson shooting.[45]
In the 114th Congress, Murphy sponsored the Helping Families In Mental Health Crisis Act, a landmark mental health reform bill which, according to Fortune, "increase the availability of psychiatric hospital beds, establish a new assistant secretary for mental health and substance use disorders in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and boost treatment for young mental health patients, among other provisions."[46] The bill was passed by the House in a near-unanimous 422-2 vote,[47] The bill was considered the most significant attempt at mental health reform in decades.[48] The bill was folded into the 21st Century Cures Act and signed into law in December 2016.[49]
At the beginning of 2017, Murphy voted in favor of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) modification bill known as the American Health Care Act (AHCA). This was the 2nd time this bill was attempted with it being pulled in March 2017 for lack of support based largely on it's removal of protections for pre-existing conditions denying 24 million Americans affordable healthcare.[50][51] He has reportedly refused to host town hall meetings[52][53] The week after Murphy's health care votes one of the largest protests outside his office occurred.[54]
Murphy was ranked as the 49th most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the 114th United States Congress (and the fifth most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania) in the Bipartisan Index created by The Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy that ranks members of the United States Congress by their degree of bipartisanship (by measuring the frequency each member's bills attract co-sponsors from the opposite party and each member's co-sponsorship of bills by members of the opposite party).[55]
In May 2017 Tim Murphy voted YES for the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act.[56]

Early life, education, and psychologist career[edit]
Murphy was born in Cleveland and is a native of Northfield, Ohio, where he attended St. Barnabas Catholic School and Walsh Jesuit High School. He received his Bachelor of Science from Wheeling Jesuit University, his MA from Cleveland State University, and his Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Pittsburgh.[2]
Upon leaving school, he became a practicing psychologist and an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh. He also made regular appearances on KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh from 1979 to 1995 as a health care expert.[3]
Murphy co-authored The Angry Child: Regaining Control When Your Child Is Out of Control (2002). The Angry Child won the National Parenting Publications Award and was featured on Book TV,[4] a program of C-SPAN. A few years later, he co-authored Overcoming Passive-Aggression: How to Stop Hidden Anger from Spoiling Your Relationships, Career, and Happiness (2005), both co-authored with Loriann Hoff Oberlin, a writer/author and mental health counselor.
Overcoming Passive-Aggression received abundant reviews, including those from the mental health field. Murphy has been interviewed by reporters from Psychology Today,[5] the Washington Post, USA Today, the CBS Early Show, CNN,[6] CBS Face the Nation,[7] C-SPAN, and others in the media on the topics of mental health, anger management and violence, parenting and relationships.
Pennsylvania Senate (1996–2003)[edit]
Elections[edit]
In 1996, Republican State Senator Mike Fisher decided not to run for re-election in order to run for Pennsylvania Attorney General. Murphy decided to run in Pennsylvania's 37th senate district. He won the Republican primary, defeating John Schnatterly 70%–30%.[8]
In the general election, he defeated State Representative Greg Fajt 55%–45%.[9] In 2000, he won re-election to a second term, defeating Joseph Rudolph 64%–36%.[10]
Tenure[edit]
He wrote the Pennsylvania Patient Bill of Rights and supported public funding for medical research. In 2002, the political website PoliticsPA named him to the list of "Smartest Legislators".[11] He resigned his state senate seat on January 3, 2003.

U.S. House of Representatives (2003–present)[edit]
Elections[edit]

2002

After redistricting, Murphy ran for the newly redrawn 18th Congressional District in 2002. The district had previously been the 20th, represented by four-term Democrat Frank Mascara. However, the legislature re-drew the district after the 2000 Census in such a way that a large portion of Mascara's district ended up in the neighboring Johnstown-based 12th District, represented by 28-year incumbent John Murtha. The new district lines were harshly criticized, in part because in some areas portions of several neighborhoods—and even streets—were split between districts. In some areas, one side of the street was in the 18th while the other was in the 12th. In the most extreme example, nearly all of Mascara's hometown of Charleroi was drawn into the 12th district, but Mascara's house stayed in the 18th. After a legal battle, the courts largely upheld Pennsylvania's redistricting plan after some minor modifications. Murphy was a member of the committee that redrew Pennsylvania's congressional map, and rumors abounded that he'd reconfigured the district for himself, even though numerous Democrats were also on the committee. Mascara challenged Murtha in the Democratic primary for the 12th District, since the newly configured 12th was geographically more his district than Murtha's. However, Murtha easily defeated Mascara. This removed a significant barrier to Murphy. Even though Democrats outnumbered Republicans by 70,000 registered voters, it was somewhat friendlier to Republicans than the old 20th had been.
Murphy won the Republican primary unopposed and won the general election, defeating Democrat Jack Machek 60%–40%.[12]

2004

Murphy won re-election to a second term, defeating Mark Boles 63%–37%.[13]

2006

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2006 § District 18
In 2006, Murphy was confronted by KDKA News reporter Andy Sheehan with evidence indicating his District Office employees were illegally working on his campaign.[14] Murphy was challenged by Democrat Chad Kluko, a telecommunications executive, in the November 2006 general election. Murphy won re-election to a third term, defeating Kluko 58%–42%.[15]

2008

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2008 § District 18
Murphy was challenged by Democrat Steve O'Donnell, a Monroeville health care executive. Murphy won re-election to a fourth term, defeating O'Donnell 64%–36%.[16][17]

2010

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2010 § District 18
Murphy was challenged by Democrat Dan Connolly. Murphy was endorsed by Veterans of Foreign Wars PAC[18] and the US Chamber of Commerce.[19] Murphy won re-election to a fifth term, defeating Connolly 67%–33%.[20]

2012

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2012 § District 18
For the first time in Murphy's career, he was challenged in the Republican primary. Evan Feinberg, also of Upper St Clair, was a 28-year-old political novice and "Tea Party" favorite,[21] was endorsed by Senators Rand Paul and Tom Coburn, FreedomWorks, and ABC Contractors. Murphy had the backing of two pro-life groups: National Right to Life Committee and PA Pro-Life Federation. He was also endorsed by former Governor Tom Ridge, former Congresswoman Melissa Hart, Allegheny County Republican Party Chairman Jim Roddey, State Representative Mark Mustio, State Senate candidate D. Raja, the National Rifle Association, and the Fraternal Order of Police of Allegheny County.[22][23][24] Murphy won the primary 63%–33%.[25][26] In the general election, he won re-election to his sixth term, defeating Washington County Commissioner Larry Maggi 64%–36%.[27][28]

2014

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2014 § District 18
Murphy successfully ran for re-election to a seventh term in the U.S. House in the 2014 election. He was re-nominated unopposed in the Republican primary and was unopposed in the general election, since no candidates filed to run in the Democratic primary.[29][30]

Murphy was unopposed in the primary and the general election. He was re-elected to his eighth term in the U.S. House.
Tenure[edit]
Murphy lives in Upper St. Clair, a suburb of Pittsburgh. However, he is listed on the official House roll as "R-Pittsburgh", although his district does not include any portion of Pittsburgh itself.
On November 26, 2005, Murphy was injured during a traffic accident in Iraq while riding in a van along with fellow Congressmen Jim Marshall and Ike Skelton. The van swerved off the road to avoid an oncoming vehicle and overturned, injuring Murphy and Skelton. The two were airlifted to Ibn Sina Hospital in Baghdad.
After an MRI indicated head and neck injuries, Murphy was flown to the U.S. Military's Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany for further tests, which indicated no permanent damage. After wearing a neck brace for a brief period, Murphy made a full recovery.[31][32]
He opposed both Wall Street bailouts in 2008, the $820 billion stimulus package supported by President Obama, and the climate change/greenhouse gas initiative bill known as "Cap and Trade."[33]
Murphy was named a "Hero of the Taxpayer" by Americans for Tax Reform.[34] Notably, he voted to increase the debt limit along with historic budget cuts in August 2011.[35] Prior to that, he approved the "short term" debt limit increase.[36]
Murphy supported a House earmark ban in theory but made nearly $14 million in earmark requests in 2010.[37] The progressive lobbying group called Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) released its third annual report on the most corrupt members of Congress titled "Beyond DeLay: The 22 Most Corrupt Members of Congress (and two to watch)".[38] Murphy was included on the list. CREW issued their analysis of Murphy's alleged ethical lapses.[39][39]
Murphy co-sponsored the Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act, along with Democratic Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio. The bill, which passed the House of Representatives on September 29, 2010, received bi-partisan support. The final vote was 348–79. The measure would authorize the United States Department of Commerce to impose tariffs and countervailing duties against goods from countries with currencies that it deems are undervalued.[40]
Murphy told WDUQ that the goal is to, “protect domestic manufacturers and the steel industry from countries unwilling to compete fairly in the global marketplace.” He added that by tying China's currency to the dollar and not floating its currency on the open market, China can undercut US manufactures by 40%. In other words, manufacturers in China can make and ship products to the US for less than a manufacturer here can buy the raw materials.[41] The Senate failed to take up the legislation, and Murphy reintroduced the bi-partisan measure in February 2011.[41]
As a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Murphy was at the forefront of exposing the approximately $500 million taxpayer funded green energy loan scandals involving Solyndra in 2011. In appearances on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360° and Fox News Channel, he highlighted the wasteful spending and political associations involved in the now bankrupt solar panel company.[42][43]
Following the shooting of Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ), Murphy and Mental Health Caucus Co-Chair Grace Napolitano (D-CA) spoke with national media about mental health issues.[44] Both members also held briefings for congressional staffers with questions on the Tucson shooting.[45]
In the 114th Congress, Murphy sponsored the Helping Families In Mental Health Crisis Act, a landmark mental health reform bill which, according to Fortune, "increase the availability of psychiatric hospital beds, establish a new assistant secretary for mental health and substance use disorders in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and boost treatment for young mental health patients, among other provisions."[46] The bill was passed by the House in a near-unanimous 422-2 vote,[47] The bill was considered the most significant attempt at mental health reform in decades.[48] The bill was folded into the 21st Century Cures Act and signed into law in December 2016.[49]
At the beginning of 2017, Murphy voted in favor of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) modification bill known as the American Health Care Act (AHCA). This was the 2nd time this bill was attempted with it being pulled in March 2017 for lack of support based largely on it's removal of protections for pre-existing conditions denying 24 million Americans affordable healthcare.[50][51] He has reportedly refused to host town hall meetings[52][53] The week after Murphy's health care votes one of the largest protests outside his office occurred.[54]
Murphy was ranked as the 49th most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the 114th United States Congress (and the fifth most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania) in the Bipartisan Index created by The Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy that ranks members of the United States Congress by their degree of bipartisanship (by measuring the frequency each member's bills attract co-sponsors from the opposite party and each member's co-sponsorship of bills by members of the opposite party).[55]
In May 2017 Tim Murphy voted YES for the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act.[56]

Early life, education, and psychologist career[edit]
Murphy was born in Cleveland and is a native of Northfield, Ohio, where he attended St. Barnabas Catholic School and Walsh Jesuit High School. He received his Bachelor of Science from Wheeling Jesuit University, his MA from Cleveland State University, and his Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Pittsburgh.[2]
Upon leaving school, he became a practicing psychologist and an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh. He also made regular appearances on KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh from 1979 to 1995 as a health care expert.[3]
Murphy co-authored The Angry Child: Regaining Control When Your Child Is Out of Control (2002). The Angry Child won the National Parenting Publications Award and was featured on Book TV,[4] a program of C-SPAN. A few years later, he co-authored Overcoming Passive-Aggression: How to Stop Hidden Anger from Spoiling Your Relationships, Career, and Happiness (2005), both co-authored with Loriann Hoff Oberlin, a writer/author and mental health counselor.
Overcoming Passive-Aggression received abundant reviews, including those from the mental health field. Murphy has been interviewed by reporters from Psychology Today,[5] the Washington Post, USA Today, the CBS Early Show, CNN,[6] CBS Face the Nation,[7] C-SPAN, and others in the media on the topics of mental health, anger management and violence, parenting and relationships.
Pennsylvania Senate (1996–2003)[edit]
Elections[edit]
In 1996, Republican State Senator Mike Fisher decided not to run for re-election in order to run for Pennsylvania Attorney General. Murphy decided to run in Pennsylvania's 37th senate district. He won the Republican primary, defeating John Schnatterly 70%–30%.[8]
In the general election, he defeated State Representative Greg Fajt 55%–45%.[9] In 2000, he won re-election to a second term, defeating Joseph Rudolph 64%–36%.[10]
Tenure[edit]
He wrote the Pennsylvania Patient Bill of Rights and supported public funding for medical research. In 2002, the political website PoliticsPA named him to the list of "Smartest Legislators".[11] He resigned his state senate seat on January 3, 2003.
Committee assignments[edit]

Aging and Youth

U.S. House of Representatives (2003–present)[edit]
Elections[edit]

2002

After redistricting, Murphy ran for the newly redrawn 18th Congressional District in 2002. The district had previously been the 20th, represented by four-term Democrat Frank Mascara. However, the legislature re-drew the district after the 2000 Census in such a way that a large portion of Mascara's district ended up in the neighboring Johnstown-based 12th District, represented by 28-year incumbent John Murtha. The new district lines were harshly criticized, in part because in some areas portions of several neighborhoods—and even streets—were split between districts. In some areas, one side of the street was in the 18th while the other was in the 12th. In the most extreme example, nearly all of Mascara's hometown of Charleroi was drawn into the 12th district, but Mascara's house stayed in the 18th. After a legal battle, the courts largely upheld Pennsylvania's redistricting plan after some minor modifications. Murphy was a member of the committee that redrew Pennsylvania's congressional map, and rumors abounded that he'd reconfigured the district for himself, even though numerous Democrats were also on the committee. Mascara challenged Murtha in the Democratic primary for the 12th District, since the newly configured 12th was geographically more his district than Murtha's. However, Murtha easily defeated Mascara. This removed a significant barrier to Murphy. Even though Democrats outnumbered Republicans by 70,000 registered voters, it was somewhat friendlier to Republicans than the old 20th had been.
Murphy won the Republican primary unopposed and won the general election, defeating Democrat Jack Machek 60%–40%.[12]

2004

Murphy won re-election to a second term, defeating Mark Boles 63%–37%.[13]

2006

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2006 § District 18
In 2006, Murphy was confronted by KDKA News reporter Andy Sheehan with evidence indicating his District Office employees were illegally working on his campaign.[14] Murphy was challenged by Democrat Chad Kluko, a telecommunications executive, in the November 2006 general election. Murphy won re-election to a third term, defeating Kluko 58%–42%.[15]

2008

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2008 § District 18
Murphy was challenged by Democrat Steve O'Donnell, a Monroeville health care executive. Murphy won re-election to a fourth term, defeating O'Donnell 64%–36%.[16][17]

2010

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2010 § District 18
Murphy was challenged by Democrat Dan Connolly. Murphy was endorsed by Veterans of Foreign Wars PAC[18] and the US Chamber of Commerce.[19] Murphy won re-election to a fifth term, defeating Connolly 67%–33%.[20]

2012

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2012 § District 18
For the first time in Murphy's career, he was challenged in the Republican primary. Evan Feinberg, also of Upper St Clair, was a 28-year-old political novice and "Tea Party" favorite,[21] was endorsed by Senators Rand Paul and Tom Coburn, FreedomWorks, and ABC Contractors. Murphy had the backing of two pro-life groups: National Right to Life Committee and PA Pro-Life Federation. He was also endorsed by former Governor Tom Ridge, former Congresswoman Melissa Hart, Allegheny County Republican Party Chairman Jim Roddey, State Representative Mark Mustio, State Senate candidate D. Raja, the National Rifle Association, and the Fraternal Order of Police of Allegheny County.[22][23][24] Murphy won the primary 63%–33%.[25][26] In the general election, he won re-election to his sixth term, defeating Washington County Commissioner Larry Maggi 64%–36%.[27][28]

2014

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2014 § District 18
Murphy successfully ran for re-election to a seventh term in the U.S. House in the 2014 election. He was re-nominated unopposed in the Republican primary and was unopposed in the general election, since no candidates filed to run in the Democratic primary.[29][30]

2016

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2016 § District 18
Murphy was unopposed in the primary and the general election. He was re-elected to his eighth term in the U.S. House.
Tenure[edit]
Murphy lives in Upper St. Clair, a suburb of Pittsburgh. However, he is listed on the official House roll as "R-Pittsburgh", although his district does not include any portion of Pittsburgh itself.
On November 26, 2005, Murphy was injured during a traffic accident in Iraq while riding in a van along with fellow Congressmen Jim Marshall and Ike Skelton. The van swerved off the road to avoid an oncoming vehicle and overturned, injuring Murphy and Skelton. The two were airlifted to Ibn Sina Hospital in Baghdad.
After an MRI indicated head and neck injuries, Murphy was flown to the U.S. Military's Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany for further tests, which indicated no permanent damage. After wearing a neck brace for a brief period, Murphy made a full recovery.[31][32]
He opposed both Wall Street bailouts in 2008, the $820 billion stimulus package supported by President Obama, and the climate change/greenhouse gas initiative bill known as "Cap and Trade."[33]
Murphy was named a "Hero of the Taxpayer" by Americans for Tax Reform.[34] Notably, he voted to increase the debt limit along with historic budget cuts in August 2011.[35] Prior to that, he approved the "short term" debt limit increase.[36]
Murphy supported a House earmark ban in theory but made nearly $14 million in earmark requests in 2010.[37] The progressive lobbying group called Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) released its third annual report on the most corrupt members of Congress titled "Beyond DeLay: The 22 Most Corrupt Members of Congress (and two to watch)".[38] Murphy was included on the list. CREW issued their analysis of Murphy's alleged ethical lapses.[39][39]
Murphy co-sponsored the Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act, along with Democratic Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio. The bill, which passed the House of Representatives on September 29, 2010, received bi-partisan support. The final vote was 348–79. The measure would authorize the United States Department of Commerce to impose tariffs and countervailing duties against goods from countries with currencies that it deems are undervalued.[40]
Murphy told WDUQ that the goal is to, “protect domestic manufacturers and the steel industry from countries unwilling to compete fairly in the global marketplace.” He added that by tying China's currency to the dollar and not floating its currency on the open market, China can undercut US manufactures by 40%. In other words, manufacturers in China can make and ship products to the US for less than a manufacturer here can buy the raw materials.[41] The Senate failed to take up the legislation, and Murphy reintroduced the bi-partisan measure in February 2011.[41]
As a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Murphy was at the forefront of exposing the approximately $500 million taxpayer funded green energy loan scandals involving Solyndra in 2011. In appearances on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360° and Fox News Channel, he highlighted the wasteful spending and political associations involved in the now bankrupt solar panel company.[42][43]
Following the shooting of Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ), Murphy and Mental Health Caucus Co-Chair Grace Napolitano (D-CA) spoke with national media about mental health issues.[44] Both members also held briefings for congressional staffers with questions on the Tucson shooting.[45]
In the 114th Congress, Murphy sponsored the Helping Families In Mental Health Crisis Act, a landmark mental health reform bill which, according to Fortune, "increase the availability of psychiatric hospital beds, establish a new assistant secretary for mental health and substance use disorders in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and boost treatment for young mental health patients, among other provisions."[46] The bill was passed by the House in a near-unanimous 422-2 vote,[47] The bill was considered the most significant attempt at mental health reform in decades.[48] The bill was folded into the 21st Century Cures Act and signed into law in December 2016.[49]
At the beginning of 2017, Murphy voted in favor of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) modification bill known as the American Health Care Act (AHCA). This was the 2nd time this bill was attempted with it being pulled in March 2017 for lack of support based largely on it's removal of protections for pre-existing conditions denying 24 million Americans affordable healthcare.[50][51] He has reportedly refused to host town hall meetings[52][53] The week after Murphy's health care votes one of the largest protests outside his office occurred.[54]
Murphy was ranked as the 49th most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the 114th United States Congress (and the fifth most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania) in the Bipartisan Index created by The Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy that ranks members of the United States Congress by their degree of bipartisanship (by measuring the frequency each member's bills attract co-sponsors from the opposite party and each member's co-sponsorship of bills by members of the opposite party).[55]
In May 2017 Tim Murphy voted YES for the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act.[56]

Justice and the Human Genome Project



Product Description: The Human Genome Project is an expensive, ambitious, and controversial attempt to locate and map every one of the approximately 100,000 genes in the human body. If it works, and we are able, for instance, to identify markers for genetic diseases long before they develop, who will have the right to obtain such information? What will be the consequences for health care, health insurance, employability, and research priorities? And, more broadly, how will attitudes toward human differences be affected, morally and socially, by the setting of a genetic "standard"?The compatibility of individual rights and genetic fairness is challenged by the technological possibilities of the future, making it difficult to create an agenda for a "just genetics...read more

                              and bioethicists. The 149 cases included in the book are grouped in nine chapters, each of which covers a key area of debate
                              in the field. Some of the case studies are classics, including the famous cases of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study (in which subjects
                              with syphilis were not given treatment) and the Willowbrook hepatitis studies (in which institutionalized subjects were intentionally
                              exposed to hepatitis). Others focus on such current issues as human embryonic stem cell research, cloning by somatic nuclear
                              transfer, and the design and function of institutional review boards. Each chapter begins with a brief introduction that places
                              the issues raised in context; this is followed by a number of cases (each of which is no more than a few pages). Study questions
                              meant to encourage further discussion follow each case." "After an introductory discussion of the history and tenets of ethics
                              in medical research, the book's chapters cover oversight and study design; informed consent; the selection of subjects; conflicts
                              of interest; the social effects of research; embryos, fetuses, and children; genetic research; the use of animals; and authorship
                              and publication. Following these chapters are appendixes with the texts of the Nuremburg Code and the Declaration of Helsinki,
                              two key documents in the establishment of bioethical standards for research. Also included are a glossary, a table of cases

                           worldwide
                           Gay Science is the first comprehensive examination of the ethical questions surrounding sexual orientation research. Bioethicist
                              Timothy Murphy presents the views of many gay men and women who detect ominous motives behind this research. If a genetic
                              marker were discovered for homosexual tendencies, would genetic screening be used to further discriminate against gay people?
                              If a method for changing sexual orientation were developed, would it be forced upon gay adults or children whose parents suspected
                              they might grow up to be gay? Given the potential for its misuse, is sexual orientation research fundamentally unethical?
                              Murphy acknowledges that much of sexual orientation research to date has been bad science, questionable in its motives and
                              methodologically unsound. He examines the social and historical conditions, from the 1880s to the present, that spawned this
                              research and reviews the findings that have often perpetuated confusion about homosexuality. He assesses five major studies
                              on sexual orientation undertaken in the 1990s, from neuroanatomist Simon LeVay's study of certain brain structures in gay
                              men to the work of psychologist Joseph Nicolosi. He questions the flawed and simplistic assumptions about sexuality made by
                              much of this research. Murphy argues that a true science of sexual orientation would not be focused exclusively upon homosexuality
                              nor presuppose its pathology
