SILVER SPRING, MD – October 22, 2009 – Larry J. Franklin has been elected as the new chairman of the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association (SGMA).  Franklin, president of Franklin Sports, Inc., based in Stoughton, Massachusetts, was elected for a one-year term at the SGMA’s annual business meeting in Chicago earlier this week.
Franklin succeeds Tom Rogge, (President/CEO; Cramer Products, Inc.) who served as SGMA Chairman from 2004-2009 and will remain on the board as Immediate Past Chairman.
Five executives were elected as new members of the board of directors for full terms (2009-2012).  They are Gary Barfield (Executive Vice President; Russell Brands); Scott Baxter (Coalition President; Imagewear, VF Corporation); Kerry Kligerman (Executive Vice President, Apparel; New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc.); Jeff Padovan (President; Polar Heart Rate Monitors); and Paula Schneider (President; Designer Swimwear Division, Speedo USA).
Four current directors were re-elected for full terms (2009-2012).  They are Carl Ferraro (President; Unisource Global Solutions); Carol Hochman (CEO; Triumph Apparel Marketing Corporation); George Napier (Chairman/CEO; Prince Sports, Inc.); and Lindsay Stewart (Special Advisor to the Chairman/CEO; Nike, Inc.). 
Newly elected directors will join existing board members:  Jim Baugh (President; Jim Baugh Consulting), Rich Bourne (President/COO; ASICS America Corporation), Dan Bower (President; Century, Inc.), Chris Considine (President; Wilson Sporting Goods Company), Paul Ehrlich (Vice President/Business Affairs & General Counsel; adidas), Kevin Plank (CEO; Under Armour Inc.), Jon Letzler (President/CEO; Augusta Sportswear Group), Chris Clawson (President/CEO; Johnson Health Tech North America), Steve Furniss (Executive Vice President; TYR Sport, Inc.), Andrea Gordon (President; Diamond Sports), Bob Puccini (President; Mizuno USA, Inc.), Robert Parish (President and General Manager; Jarden Team Sports), and Tom Cove (President/CEO; SGMA).  Carl Ferraro was re-appointed Treasurer of the association.
“Larry Franklin’s exemplary experience, record of accomplishment and reputation make him the ideal choice to serve as SGMA’s Chairman,” said SGMA President Tom Cove.  “He has been a successful leader of his company and within the SGMA for many years.  His passion and commitment to the sporting goods industry is well demonstrated and will undoubtedly serve SGMA well.”
“I’m proud and honored to be elected by the SGMA membership to lead our industry association,” said Franklin.  Over its 103-year history, the SGMA has served to promote sports participation and enhance a healthy, vibrant sporting goods industry.  I look forward to working with my peers on the board, my colleagues in the industry and with SGMA staff to continue this vital mission.”
“Having Gary Barfield, Scott Baxter, Kerry Kligerman, Jeff Padovan, and Paula Schneider join the SGMA Board of Directors is a dynamic addition to our group,” said Franklin.  “They bring years of experience and expertise to the board which I know they will share with fellow board members and the staff of the association.  On a personal and professional level, we welcome their willingness to help guide SGMA over the next few years.”
The Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association (SGMA), the #1 source for sport and fitness research, is the leading global trade association of manufacturers, retailers, and marketers in the sports products industry.  SGMA helps lead the sports and fitness industries by promoting favorable public policies, fostering participation through research, thought leadership and product promotion.  More information about SGMA membership, SGMA public policy platform, and SGMA's National Health Through Fitness Day can be found at www.SGMA.com  .

See what people like you are saying about BeenVerified







Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"

Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."


From the Press
U.S. News & World Report

From the Press
NBC 6 Miami
