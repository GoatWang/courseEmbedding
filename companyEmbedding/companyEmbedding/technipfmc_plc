      project, whereas the extension includes installation of the template 
      structure and manifold as well as delivery and installation of flowline 
      spool and umbilical. The project will be executed as an integrated 
      Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Installation (iEPCI).
    

      Hallvard Hasselknippe, President Subsea Projects of TechnipFMC, 
      commented: “This is our second iEPCI contract with Statoil. Our 
      first iEPCI contract for the Trestakk project is progressing well and we 
      are very honored that Statoil has again selected us for the Visund Nord 
      development."

History[edit]
TechnipFMC was formed through the merger of FMC Technologies Inc. and French oil-services Technip SA. On January 17, 2017, TechnipFMC announced that it is operating as a unified company after completion of the merge, which created a significant new player in an energy industry wracked by a nearly two-year slump in crude prices.[3] The company has three headquarters in Houston, Paris and London under new Houston-based CEO Doug Pferdehirt, who worked as FMC’s chief executive officer. Former Technip chairman and CEO Thierry Pilenko is the new executive chairman.
Through 2016-2017 the TechnipFMC fleet expanded with the addition of four pipe-laying vessels (PLSVs) constructed under the DOF-Technip partnership, two foreign (Skandi Açu and Skandi Buzios) and two Brazilians (Skandi Olinda and Skandi Recife).[4] Another ship who entered operations was the Deep Explorer, one of the most advanced diving support vessels (DSV) in the world.[5]
Organization[edit]
Technip was certified as one of the first five companies in the world as a Global Top Employer 2015 which recognizes first-class employee offerings globally and equally, so TechnipFMC holds those credentials. This independent certification delivered by the Top Employers Institute demonstrates the quality and consistency of the company’s human resources policies and practices all around the globe.
The company has also been certified as a top employer in 24 countries (Australia, Brazil, China, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Oman, Portugal, Qatar, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Venezuela and Vietnam) as well as in three regions (Asia-Pacific, Europe and Latin America).[6]
