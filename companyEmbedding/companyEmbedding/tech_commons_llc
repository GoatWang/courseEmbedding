UCF’s old computer center has been transformed into a welcoming, convenient place for all students. The Technology Commons is an epicenter for students to gather, communicate, interact, study and receive technical support. A state-of-the-art facility open to all of UCF, providing the resources for students and staff alike to find, assemble, and synthesize the information needed to tackle numerous diverse tasks. The individual areas of the computer center buildings amalgamate to form a diverse, thriving, technical community at the heart of UCF.

Technology Commons: Classroom Building I (Room 101)

In Spring 2015 CS&T unveiled a completely renovated lab located in the Classroom Building 1, room 101. This space is an extension of Technology Commons, and takes some of its best features and extends it cross campus. This renovation provides more students access to all the services and technology that has made Tech Commons so popular.
Besides new furnishings, the old computer lab received a complete overhaul with new computers, a Student Support Desk (SSD), and collaborative learning spaces spread throughout. The newly renovated lab boasts over 100 seats and more than 60 computers. Students have access to a dynamic space which offers the same level of support that is in high demand at Tech Commons.
Mobile technologies such as Macbook Air, Dell laptops, and the popular iPad are available for checkout. Collaborative spaces with 42″ monitors are available for group studies, along with rolling white boards available throughout the space for student convenience. Lounge seating provides casual comfort throughout the space for informal group work.
The computer lab itself has both Dell All–In-One and Apple iMacs. Wireless printing is available in addition to traditional printing.
Technology Commons: Classroom Building I is a general purpose computer lab available for both student and faculty use.
Equipment:

32 Dell AIO
32 iMAC
