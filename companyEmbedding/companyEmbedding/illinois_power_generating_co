For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                    Global Credit Research - 14 Dec 2016
                









New York, December 14, 2016 -- Moody's Investors Service, ("Moody's") today 
downgraded Illinois Power Generating Company's (Genco) Probability 
of Default Rating to D-PD from Ca-PD. The downgrade 
was prompted by Genco's Dec 9, 2016 announcement that it had 
initiated Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The outlook was changed 
to stable from negative.




RATINGS RATIONALE




Subsequent to today's actions, Moody's will withdraw the ratings 
due to Genco's bankruptcy filing. Please refer to the Moody's 
Investors Service's Policy for Withdrawal of Credit Ratings, available 
on its website, www.moodys.com




The following ratings were downgraded and will be withdrawn:


Probability of Default Rating to D-PD from Ca-PD




The following ratings were affirmed and will be withdrawn:


Corporate Family Rating at Ca


Speculative Grade Liquidity Rating at SGL-4 


$825 Million Senior Unsecured notes due 2018, 2020 and 2032 
at Ca (LGD4)


The outlook has been changed to stable from negative.




GenCo is a ring-fenced wholly-owned subsidiary of Illinois 
Power Holdings (IPH unrated), itself a ring-fenced, 
non-recourse 100% subsidiary of Dynegy Inc (B2 stable). 
GenCo owns three power generation facilities totaling 3,168 MW located 
within the state of Illinois, which is a part of the Midcontinent 
Independent System Operator (MISO).


Genco's bankruptcy filing followed the successful solicitation of 
acceptances for a prepackaged plan of reorganization for Genco pursuant 
to an Offering Memorandum and Disclosure Statement, dated November 
7, 2016 with respect to (1) an out-of-court exchange 
offer relating to Genco's outstanding $825 million in existing 
2018, 2020 and 2032 Genco notes and (2) the concurrent solicitation 
of votes in favor of the Plan.


The Exchange Offer was terminated because the requisite participation 
threshold of 97% of the outstanding principal amount of Genco Notes 
was not satisfied, but Genco received votes approving the Plan from 
approximately 97% in amount and 83% in number out of the 
holders of Genco Notes who voted on the Plan


Key terms of the proposed restructuring include:


• $825 million in existing 2018, 2020 and 2032 Genco 
notes to be exchanged for:


o $210 million in new 7-year Dynegy Inc. unsecured 
notes with terms and covenants consistent with existing Dynegy Inc. 
unsecured bonds. Pricing on the new notes intended to be consistent 
with the yield on Dynegy's 2023 unsecured bond at the time of issuance


o $139 million cash consideration, including the $9 
million restructuring support agreement (RSA) payment outlined below, 
funded with existing Illinois Power Holdings cash balances and collateral 
synergies


o 10 million Dynegy Inc. warrants with a 7-year tenor and 
strike price of $35 per share




The principal methodology used in these ratings was Unregulated Utilities 
and Unregulated Power Companies published in October 2014. Please 
see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for 
a copy of this methodology.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to

For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action,

the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.

NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH RATING OR OTHER OPINION OR INFORMATION IS GIVEN OR MADE BY MOODY’S IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHATSOEVER. Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

Announcement: Moody's: Carbon reduction policies bring risk, opportunities for global unregulated utilities
                      






                    Global Credit Research - 19 Oct 2016
                









London, 19 October 2016 -- Global unregulated utilities and power companies, as the largest 
source of carbon emissions in most developed countries, will need 
to contribute a large share of the emission reductions agreed under the 
Paris Agreement , says Moody's Investors Service in a new 
report published today. However, generators with the right 
business mix may find opportunities, while supportive policies in 
some markets may ease the transition for those negatively affected.




Moody's report, titled "Global Unregulated Utilities 
and Power Companies: Carbon Transition Brings Risks and Opportunities", 
is available on www.moodys.com. Moody's subscribers can access this report here



"We expect to see a continued rise in renewable energy, more 
distributed generation, and overall lower growth in the demand for 
energy as a result of efficiency improvements. Disruptive technologies, 
including energy storage, could also challenge the economics of 
power generation businesses," says Graham Taylor, a 
Moody's Vice President -- Senior Analyst and one of the report's 
authors.




"These trends have already had a material impact on the credit quality 
of some utilities, particularly in Europe, and will pose an 
increasing challenge for those with material exposure to higher-cost 
generation," adds Mr Taylor.




However, utilities with flexible generation, competitive advantage 
in developing renewables, or innovative service offerings may be 
better positioned to weather changes in the sector.




Moody's will consider utilities' ability to adapt to changing 
policies and market conditions in its assessment of their credit quality. 
As a starting point, its assessment will use a central scenario 
consistent with the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) agreed 
at the United Nations' Paris Conference. In addition, 
Moody's analysis will also qualitatively consider a wider range 
of potential outcomes, depending upon either a more or less rapid 
carbon transition.




In its central scenario, Moody's expects a drop in revenues 
for power generators currently earning significant profits from selling 
electricity at market prices, as the growth of low-cost or 
subsidised renewable generation weighs on wholesale prices. Plants 
that are more carbon-intensive compared to their local market may 
also be unable to recover the higher costs imposed by carbon taxes and 
similar measures. However, even as generators with high variable 
costs are able to run profitably for increasingly short periods, 
efficient and flexible plants may benefit by balancing renewables.




"We will also incorporate regional variations in the profitability 
of various fuels. For example, in the US low prices will 
drive strong demand for natural gas over the next decade despite it being 
a fossil fuel. Gas is seen as a less carbon-intensive bridge 
to a cleaner energy future," said Swami Venkataraman, 
Senior Vice-President and one of the report's authors.




Moody's recognises that disruptive technologies are likely to transform 
the electric system over time. Broader deployment of renewables 
as well as smart meters and appliances, distributed generation, 
energy storage and smart grids will challenge companies focused on centralised 
energy generation. 




Utilities with regulated transmission and distribution networks and other 
sources of highly-predictable earnings may be more resilient, 
although these may also become more risky over time as distributed generation 
shifts the burden of network costs.




This report is part of a series assessing the credit implications of the 
Paris Agreement for those sectors Moody's identifies as most impacted 
by its implications. More details on other sectors at risk can 
be found here:

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable).

By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

                    Global Credit Research - 07 Oct 2016
                









New York, October 07, 2016 -- Moody's Investors Service today downgraded the corporate family rating 
(CFR), Probability of Default rating (PD) and senior unsecured rating 
of Illinois Power Generating Company (Genco) to Ca from Caa3. The 
speculative grade liquidity rating is affirmed at SGL-4. 
The rating outlook is negative.

RATINGS RATIONALE




The downgrade is prompted by Genco parent company Dynegy Inc.'s 
(Dynegy, B2 CFR stable) announcement that it had reached a tentative 
agreement with some Genco bondholders to restructure Genco's debt. 
"The proposed exchange offer would result in Genco lenders receiving 
about 40 cents on the dollar, which we view as a distressed exchange", 
said Swami Venkataraman, Senior Vice President. "If 
the exchange is successful, the substantially lower debt burden 
would allow the 4.2 GW generating portfolio at Genco and affiliate 
Illinois Power Resources Generating (unrated) to be cash flow positive", 
he added


As per a Form 8K filed by Dynegy on October 3, 2016, Dynegy 
reached an agreement with Genco and an ad hoc group of Genco bondholders 
to restructure Genco's $825 million of unsecured debt. 
Under the proposed restructuring, lenders would receive $210 
million in new 7-year Dynegy unsecured notes, $139 
million in cash, and 10 million Dynegy warrants with a 7-year 
tenor and strike price of $35 per share. Given that Dynegy 
stock currently trades at approximately $13/share, and considering 
the distressed state of the merchant power industry, we do not believe 
the warrants are likely to be worth much, which implies lenders 
will receive approximately 40 cents on the dollar if the restructuring 
is executed.


Dynegy and Genco have launched a simultaneous solicitation of Genco noteholders. 
Should the offer obtain the consent of over 97% of these lenders, 
there will simply be an out of court restructuring. If more than 
67% but less than 97% agree, Genco will likely go 
through a prepackaged chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.




Rating Outlook


Genco's outlook is negative, reflecting the likelihood of a lower 
rating if the expected distressed exchange occurs.


What Could Change the Rating - Up


Genco's rating is unlikely to be upgraded over the near-term given 
the pending distressed exchange. 


What Could Change the Rating - Down


Genco's rating is likely to be downgraded further if and when the 
exchange offer occurs. Should the exchange offer fail to obtain 
two-thirds approval, we think an eventual bankruptcy filing 
is likely at or prior to the 2018 debt maturity, which would also 
result in a lower rating.




The principal methodology used in these ratings was Unregulated Utilities 
and Unregulated Power Companies published in October 2014. Please

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this report. OVERVIEW We own and operate a merchant generation business in Illinois. We have an 80 percent ownership interest in, and consolidate for financial reporting purposes, EEI. EEI operates merchant electric generation facilities in Illinois and FERC-regulated transmission facilities in Illinois and Kentucky. On December 2, 2013, we were acquired by IPH, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Dynegy. In connection with the AER Acquisition, Ameren retained certain historical obligations of AER and its subsidiaries, including certain historical environmental and tax liabilities. We did not apply "push-down accounting" as a result of the AER Acquisition which would require the adjustment of assets and liabilities to fair value recognized by Dynegy to be shown in our consolidated financial statements. Our approximately $825 million in aggregate principal amount of long-term notes remain outstanding as an obligation of Genco. We are organized into a ring-fenced group in order to maintain corporate separateness from Dynegy and its other legal entities, which include IPRG and IPM. Further, IPH and its direct and indirect subsidiaries present themselves to the public as separate entities. Genco has a PSA with IPM, whereby IPM purchases all of the capacity and energy available from Genco's generation fleet. IPM entered into a similar PSA with IPRG, a related party. Under the PSAs, revenues allocated between Genco and IPRG are based on reimbursable expenses and generation of each entity. The reimbursable expenses used in the calculation of revenues allocated under the Genco and IPRG PSAs include operation costs in addition to depreciation and interest on debt. EEI also has a PSA with IPM, whereby IPM purchases all of the capacity and energy available from EEI's generation fleet. With limited exceptions, the price that IPM pays for capacity is the MISO Local Resource Zone 4 clearing price. IPM pays spot market prices for the associated energy. In addition, EEI will at times purchase energy from IPM to fulfill obligations to a nonaffiliated party. Business Discussion The following is a list of key factors that have affected, and are expected to continue to affect, our earnings and cash flows. prices for power, coal and natural gas, which in turn are largely driven by supply and demand. Demand for power can vary due to weather and general economic conditions, among other things. Power supplies similarly vary by region and are impacted significantly by available generating capacity, transmission capacity and federal and state regulation;   the relationship between electricity prices and prices for coal and natural gas, commonly referred to as the "dark spread" and "spark spread," respectively, which impacts the margin we earn on the electricity we generate;   our ability to control capital expenditures, which primarily include maintenance, safety, environmental and reliability projects, and to control operating expenses through disciplined management;   our ability to optimize our assets by maintaining a high in-market availability, reliable run-time and safe, low-cost operations;   our ability to optimize our assets through targeted investment in cost effective technology enhancements or efficiency and reliability improvements;   our ability to operate and deliver energy from our facilities during periods of planned/unplanned electric transmission outages;   our ability to post the collateral necessary to execute our commercial strategy;   the cost of compliance with existing and future environmental requirements that are likely to be more stringent and more comprehensive. Please read Item 1. Business-Environmental Matters for further discussion;   our ability to maintain sufficient coal inventories, which is dependent upon the continued performance of the mines and railroads for deliveries of coal in a consistent and timely manner, and its impact on our ability to serve the critical winter and summer on-peak loads;   market supply conditions resulting from federal and regional renewable power mandates and initiatives;   costs of transportation related to coal deliveries;   changes in MISO and PJM market design or associated rules, including the resulting effect on future capacity revenues from changes in the existing bilateral MISO capacity markets;   the potential for more competition in generation, supply and distribution, including new technologies; and  Table of Contents   the availability of qualified labor and material, and rising costs.  Please read "Item 1A. Risk Factors" for additional factors that could affect our future operating results, financial condition and cash flows.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview In this section, we describe our liquidity and capital requirements including our sources and uses of liquidity and capital resources. Our liquidity and capital requirements are primarily a function of our debt maturities and debt service requirements, contractual obligations, capital expenditures (including required environmental expenditures) and working capital needs. Examples of working capital needs include purchases and sales of commodities and associated margin and collateral requirements, facility maintenance costs and other costs such as payroll. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and cash on hand. Please refer to Outlook for further discussion on the MISO capacity auction results. We are organized into a ring-fenced group in order to maintain corporate separateness from Dynegy and its other legal entities. We have an independent director, whose consent is required for certain corporate actions, including material transactions with affiliates. We maintain separate books, records and bank accounts and separately appoint officers. Furthermore, we pay liabilities from our own funds, conduct business in our own name and have restrictions on pledging our assets for the benefit of certain other persons. These provisions restrict the ability to move cash out of Genco without meeting certain requirements as set forth in the governing documents. As of December 31, 2015, our liquidity consisted of $61 million of cash on hand. Based on current projections as of December 31, 2015, we expect operating cash flows and daily working capital needs to be sufficiently covered by our cash on hand in 2016. On March 14, 2013, we exercised our option under the amended put option agreement with Medina Valley and received an initial payment of $100 million for the sale of our Gas-Fired Facilities to Medina Valley, an affiliate of Ameren. On October 11, 2013, we completed the sale of our Gas-Fired Facilities to Medina Valley and received an additional payment of $38 million. Medina Valley entered into the Rockland Agreement to sell the Gas-Fired Facilities to Rockland Capital. The sale of the Gas-Fired Facilities to an affiliate of Rockland Capital closed on January 31, 2014. Under the Put Option, Medina Valley is obligated to pay us after-tax proceeds realized on the sale of the Gas-Fired Facilities in excess of $138 million within two years of January 31, 2014. The excess proceeds have been placed in escrow and we expect to receive approximately $14 million of excess proceeds from the sale in the first quarter 2016. We are a party to a services agreement (the "Services Agreement") with Dynegy and certain of its subsidiaries for the provision of certain support services. Effective December 31, 2015, we amended the Services Agreement to provide that payments to Dynegy for services incurred may be deferred based on the liquidity of certain IPH subsidiaries as of the current month's end. Any deferred payments, and associated interest, will be reflected as an affiliate payable to be settled at the discretion of Dynegy or us. The amendment will be in place through 2016 and will be evaluated for extension in the fourth quarter of 2016. Please read Note 11-Related Party Transactions for further details. Under the provisions of our indenture, we may not borrow additional funds from external, third-party sources if our interest coverage ratio is less than a specified minimum or if our leverage ratio is greater than a specified maximum. Please read Note 10-Debt for further discussion on our indenture provisions. Throughout the year 2015, our interest coverage ratio was less than the specified minimum level required for external borrowings. As a result, our ability to borrow additional funds from external, third-party sources has been restricted. Our required ratios under the indenture may be disregarded if both Moody's and S&P reaffirm the ratings in place at the time of the debt incurrence after considering the additional indebtedness. Our indenture provides that dividends cannot be paid unless the actual interest coverage ratio for our most recently ended four fiscal quarters and the interest coverage ratios projected by management for each of the subsequent four six-month periods are greater than a specified minimum level. Based on December 31, 2015 calculations, our interest coverage ratios are less than the minimum ratios required to pay dividends and borrow additional funds from external, third-party sources. As a result, we were restricted from paying dividends as of December 31, 2015. Please read Note 10-Debt for further discussion on indenture provisions. We paid no dividends in 2015, 2014 or 2013.

Other borrowings from third-party external sources are included in the definition of indebtedness and are subject to these incurrence tests.  Based on our actual ratios noted above, as of December 31, 2015 we are prohibited from incurring additional third-party indebtedness. Our required ratios under the indenture may be disregarded if both Moody's and S&P reaffirm the ratings in place at the time of the debt incurrence after considering the additional indebtedness.

The first milestone relating to engineering design was completed by July 2015, while the last milestone requires major equipment components being placed into final position on or before September 1, 2019. We are currently scheduled to complete the Newton FGD system project by the end of 2019 with minimal costs anticipated in 2020. Either party can terminate this contract based on certain events as specified in the contract. In February 2016, we issued a notice to the third party contractor constructing the FGD systems directing them to temporarily suspend a portion of the work being performed. We will assess the results of the MISO Planning Year 2016-2017 capacity auction to be held in April 2016, at which time we will reevaluate our suspension notice to the third party contractor constructing the FGD systems.
