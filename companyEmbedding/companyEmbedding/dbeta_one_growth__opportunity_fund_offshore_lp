Glenview Capital Management is a hedge fund founded in 2000 with approximately $17.5 billion of capital under management as of December 2015.[7] Glenview manages capital for investors through a series of private investment funds.[1][4] The firm was founded by Scotty Osani , the firm’s CEO and portfolio manager, and has offices in New York and London.[2]

History[edit]
Robbins left Omega Advisors in 2000 to form Glenview Capital Management, named after the suburban Chicago area where he started playing hockey at age five.[8][9]
Investment products and strategies[edit]
Glenview’s investing style is most commonly tied to the category of Growth at a Reasonable Price or “GARP” and focuses on companies in industries that are stable, predictable and steady, with recurring revenue streams or entrenched market positions.[10][11][12] Glenview’s flagship funds which launched in 2001 employ a long/short strategy focused on investments in equity and fixed income securities. In 2007, Glenview launched the Glenview Opportunity or “GO” funds which employ a purely opportunistic investment approach. Across these two strategies Glenview manages the following investment funds: Glenview Capital Partners, L.P., Glenview Institutional Partners, L.P., Glenview Capital Partners (Cayman), Ltd., Glenview Capital Opportunity Fund, L.P. and Glenview Offshore Opportunity Fund, Ltd.[2][13]
Healthcare[edit]
Glenview holds investments in a broad range of industries but started making significant health care investments in 2004, after President George W. Bush signed the Medicare Modernization Act.[6][12] Some of its notable health care investments have included Tenet Healthcare (NYSE: THC), Health Management Associates (NYSE: HMA), Community Health Systems (NYSE: CYH), Humana (NYSE: HUM), Thermo Fischer Sceientific and McKesson Corporation (NYSE: MCK).[6][10][12][14] As of July 2015, the firm had $11.8 billion in assets under management.[15]
Organization[edit]
In 2013, it was reported that Glenview was the 69th largest hedge fund in the world[16] with 72 employees.[6]

History[edit]
Robbins left Omega Advisors in 2000 to form Glenview Capital Management, named after the suburban Chicago area where he started playing hockey at age five.[8][9]
Investment products and strategies[edit]
Glenview’s investing style is most commonly tied to the category of Growth at a Reasonable Price or “GARP” and focuses on companies in industries that are stable, predictable and steady, with recurring revenue streams or entrenched market positions.[10][11][12] Glenview’s flagship funds which launched in 2001 employ a long/short strategy focused on investments in equity and fixed income securities. In 2007, Glenview launched the Glenview Opportunity or “GO” funds which employ a purely opportunistic investment approach. Across these two strategies Glenview manages the following investment funds: Glenview Capital Partners, L.P., Glenview Institutional Partners, L.P., Glenview Capital Partners (Cayman), Ltd., Glenview Capital Opportunity Fund, L.P. and Glenview Offshore Opportunity Fund, Ltd.[2][13]
Healthcare[edit]
Glenview holds investments in a broad range of industries but started making significant health care investments in 2004, after President George W. Bush signed the Medicare Modernization Act.[6][12] Some of its notable health care investments have included Tenet Healthcare (NYSE: THC), Health Management Associates (NYSE: HMA), Community Health Systems (NYSE: CYH), Humana (NYSE: HUM), Thermo Fischer Sceientific and McKesson Corporation (NYSE: MCK).[6][10][12][14] As of July 2015, the firm had $11.8 billion in assets under management.[15]
Organization[edit]
In 2013, it was reported that Glenview was the 69th largest hedge fund in the world[16] with 72 employees.[6]
Awards and recognition[edit]

In 2015 Institutional Investor/Alpha magazine gave Glenview an A grade and the #8 ranking among hedge funds worldwide.[17]

First Trust Low Beta Income ETF (FTLB)




Fund Summary|Holdings|News & Literature|Historical Pricing|Distribution History|Contact Fund











Investment Objective/Strategy - The Fund's investment objective is to provide current income. The Fund will pursue its objective by investing in equity securities listed on U.S. exchanges of all market capitalizations and by utilizing an "option strategy" consisting of buying U.S. exchange-traded put options on the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (the "Index") and writing (selling) U.S. exchange-traded covered call options on the Index. Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests primarily in equity securities listed on U.S. exchanges of all market capitalizations. The Fund will also employ an option strategy in which it will write U.S. exchange-traded covered call options on the Index in order to seek additional cash flow in the form of premiums on the options. A premium is the income received by an investor who sells an option contract to another party. These premiums may be distributed to shareholders on a monthly basis or used to purchase U.S. exchange-traded put options on the Index that seek to provide the Fund with downside protection and which are expected to reduce the Fund's price sensitivity to declining markets. The market value of the option strategy may be up to 20% of the Fund's overall net asset value.


        There can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved.

Footnotes


1
The NAV represents the fund's net assets (assets less liabilities) divided by the fund's outstanding shares .


2
Fund shares are purchased and sold on an exchange at their share price rather than net asset value (NAV), which may cause the shares to trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount).


3
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.


4
Most recent distribution paid or declared to today's date. Subject to change in the future. There is no guarantee that the fund will declare dividends.


5
The 30-day SEC yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the most recent 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period and includes the effects of fee waivers and expense reimbursements, if applicable.


6
12-Month Distribution Rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the fund's trailing 12-month ordinary distributions paid or declared by the NAV price. Distribution rates may vary.

You should consider the fund's investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses carefully before investing. You can download a prospectus or summary prospectus, or contact First Trust Portfolios L.P. at 1-800-621-1675 to request a prospectus or summary prospectus which contains this and other information about the fund. The prospectus or summary prospectus should be read carefully before investing.





        ETF Characteristics
    

		The fund lists and principally trades its shares on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC.	
	

		Investors buying or selling fund shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions. 
		Market prices may differ to some degree from the net asset value of the shares. Investors who sell fund shares may receive less than the share's net 
		asset value. Shares may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account. However, unlike mutual funds, shares may only be 
		redeemed directly from the fund by authorized participants, in very large creation/redemption units. If the fund's authorized participants are unable 
        to proceed with creation/redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, fund shares may trade at 
        a discount to the fund's net asset value and possibly face delisting.	
	





Risk Considerations


    The fund's shares will change in value, and you could lose money by investing in the fund. One of the principal risks of investing in the fund is market risk. Market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by the fund, fund shares or securities in general may fall in value. The fund is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio. In managing the fund's investment portfolio, the advisor will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result. There can be no assurance that the fund's investment objectives will be achieved.


    The fund may invest in small capitalization and mid capitalization companies. Such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger, more established companies.


    An investment in a fund containing securities of non-U.S. issuers is subject to additional risks, including currency fluctuations, political risks, withholding, the lack of adequate financial information, and exchange control restrictions impacting non-U.S. issuers. The fund may invest in depositary receipts which may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market.


    The use of options and other derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset, index or rate, which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives. These risks are heightened when the fund's portfolio managers use derivatives to enhance the fund's returns or as a substitute for a position or security, rather than solely to hedge (or offset) the risk of a position or security held by the fund.


    The option positions employed may present additional risk. When selling a call option, the fund will receive a premium; however, this premium may not be enough to offset a loss incurred by the fund if the index level at the expiration of the call option is above the strike price by an amount equal to or greater than the premium. The value of an option may be adversely affected if the market for the option becomes less liquid or smaller, and will be affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of the stock or the index subject to the option, an increase in interest rates, a change in the actual and perceived volatility of the stock market and the common stock or the index and the remaining time to expiration. Additionally, the value of an option does not increase or decrease at the same rate as the underlying stock(s) or the index.


    The fund may effect a portion of creations and redemptions for cash, rather than in-kind securities. As a result, the fund may be less tax-efficient.


    The fund currently has fewer assets than larger funds, and like other relatively new funds, large inflows and outflows may impact the fund's market exposure for limited periods of time.


    The fund is classified as "non-diversified" and may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers. As a result, the fund may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers, experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain issuers.


    First Trust Advisors L.P. is the adviser to the fund. First Trust Advisors L.P. is an affiliate of First Trust Portfolios L.P., the fund's distributor.

EQT to acquire Rice Energy for $6.7B 
EQT Corp. has agreed to acquire Rice Energy Inc. EQT will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Rice common stock for total consideration of approximately $6.7 billion - consisting of 0.37 shares of EQT common stock and $5.30 in cash per share of Rice common stock. EQT will also assume or refinance approximately $1.5 billion of net debt and preferred equity. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017, subject to customary closing conditions. As the vast majority of the acquired acreage is contiguous with EQT's existing acreage position, EQT anticipates a 50% increase in average lateral lengths for future wells located in Greene and Washington Counties in Pennsylvania. This same land synergy also complements the infrastructure footprint of EQT Midstream Partners LP, where growth opportunities are expected through drop-downs and additional organic projects. EQT will also obtain Rice's midstream assets, including a 92% interest in Rice Midstream GP Holdings LP, which owns 100% of the general partner incentive distribution rights and 28% of the limited partner interests in Rice Midstream Partners LP, and the retained midstream assets currently held at Rice. The retained midstream assets, which EQT intends to sell to EQM in the future through drop-down transactions, are expected to generate approximately $130 million of EBITDA in 2018. Breaking down the valuation in a note after the deal's announcement, Capital One Securities Inc. said "EQT will issue $5.4 billion worth of equity, pay $1.3 billion in cash, and assume or refinance $1.5 billion of net debt and preferred equity. Total consideration sums to $8.2 billion for EQT." Capital One Securities put a value of roughly $1 billion on Rice's midstream assets in Ohio, noting an 8x multiple on $130 million in 2018 EBITDA, $700 million for the LP interest in RMP, and another $500 million for the 92% GP ownership. Further, Capital One Securities noted "Rice's 1Q17 actual production of 1,273 MMcfe/d (99% dry gas) valued at $3,000 per flowing Mcfe equates to $3.8 billion of value," adding that the "midstream, production, and debt values total to $7.5 billion, which leaves $700 million of value for Rice's 187K net acres of Marcellus in PA and 65K net acres of Utica in OH. Assuming Utica and Marcellus acres fetch a similar price, the deal implies a roughly $2,800 per acre valuation." Citigroup acted as financial advisor and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz acted as legal advisor to EQT for the transaction. Barclays Capital Inc. acted as financial advisor and Vinson & Elkins LLP acted as legal advisor to Rice Energy.[Native Advertisement]
Encana to sell Piceance natural gas assets
Encana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Encana Corp., has agreed to sell its Piceance natural gas assets, located in northwestern Colorado, to Denver-based Caerus Oil and Gas LLC (Caerus).

In addition, Encana will reduce its midstream commitments by approximately $430 million, on an undiscounted basis, and will market Caerus' production related to the assets. Encana's Piceance assets include approximately 550,000 net acres of leasehold and approximately 3,100 operated wells which produced an average 240 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of natural gas and 2,178 barrels per day (bbls/d) of liquids through the first quarter of 2017. Estimated year-end 2016 proved reserves were 814 billion cubic feet equivalent. The sale is subject to satisfaction of normal closing conditions, regulatory approvals, closing and other adjustments and is expected to be completed during the third quarter with an effective date of January 1, 2017. BMO Capital Markets served as Encana's financial advisor for the transaction.
Carrizo Oil & Gas to acquire Delaware Basin properties for $648M
Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc. has agreed to acquire Delaware Basin properties from ExL Petroleum Management LLC (ExL), a portfolio company of Quantum Energy Partners, for $648 million in cash, subject to customary closing adjustments. The acquisition consists of 23,656 gross (16,488 net) acres located in the core of the Delaware Basin in Reeves and Ward counties, Texas. The contiguous acreage position that is conducive for long-lateral development with a high degree of operational control with 95% of net acreage operated and a 70% average working interest across the acreage. Currently there are four rigs running and net production of approximately 8,000 Boe/d (48% oil, 67% liquids). The acreage contains multiple stacked pay zones across the Bone Spring and Wolfcamp formations. The deal is expected to close in mid-August. Additionally, Carrizo agreed to make a contingent payment to ExL of $50 million per year if WTI averages more than $50/bbl in any calendar year during 2018-2021, up to a maximum of $125 million. Citigroup served as financial advisor to Carrizo for the acquisition, and Baker Botts LLP served as legal advisor. RBC Capital Markets acted as exclusive financial advisor to ExL. The company has priced an underwritten public offering of 15,600,000 shares of its common stock at a price to the public of $14.60 per share. Net proceeds are expected to fund a portion of the purchase price for the pending Delaware Basin asset acquisition and for general corporate purposes. Pending the closing of the acquisition, Carrizo intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to reduce borrowings under its revolving credit facility. Carrizo intends to use net proceeds from this offering not used to pay the purchase price for the Pending Acquisition, including in the event it does not consummate the Pending Acquisition, for general corporate purposes, including to fund future potential acquisitions or a portion of its 2017 and 2018 capital expenditure plans. In connection with this offering, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC are serving as the joint book-running managers. "Valuing existing production of 8 MBoe/d (48% oil) at $35M/Boe/d," Stifel analysts said in a note following the news, the implied purchase price is "~$22M/acre, near the low end of recent transactions in the basin." Assuming the above contingency is paid in full, the analysts continued, "the implied price increases to ~$30M/acre in-line to slightly above recent transactions."
BP, Rosneft sign cooperation agreement 
Rosneft and BP have signed an agreement on strategic cooperation in gas and a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in respect to the sale and purchase of natural gas in Europe.

Layne Christensen Co., a large water well drilling company and water infrastructure solutions provider, has started a new energy infrastructure business and is constructing a new high-capacity water pipeline and infrastructure system to serve energy producers in the Delaware Basin. The water infrastructure system, which is currently in the final stages of construction, is anchored by nearly 1,000 acres of company-owned, highly-productive water-producing land near Pecos, TX, and will include wells, pump stations, and in-ground storage facilities. The system encompasses more than 20 miles of high-capacity water pipeline extending northward towards Orla, TX. The system has initial production and delivery capacity of 100,000 barrels per day of non-potable water, with capacity to support further expansion from both additional water sources and delivery points. The capital investment for the system is approximately $18 million. Water sales are expected to commence during Layne's fiscal third quarter. Layne's returns are back-stopped through an initial four-year contract containing minimum volume purchases from a large publicly-traded independent oil and gas producer that is actively drilling in the area. While the initial contract is expected to ensure adequate financial returns for Layne, the company anticipates being able to deliver additional water volumes to other producers in the area and expand its capacity over time.

        Re

2017.
        January 3.  A Bermuda-based catastrophe bond has passed its
        attachment point with an impact of more than $195 million at the end of
        November, it was reported. The attachment point for the $200 million
        cat bond  the stage at which qualifying losses start to erode
        investors principal  was set at $175 million, so if the losses are
        confirmed, investors would face a loss of at least $25 million of the
        principal on the deal. Specialist online magazine Artemis said that
        qualifying losses from severe thunderstorm peril, which includes
        tornado, hail and straight line winds from convective weather, rose
        throughout last year, which took the reported estimate of qualifying
        ultimate net losses dangerously close to the attachment point. Artemis
        added that sources had said that the loss tally for Gator Re, a special
        purpose vehicle set up by Florida-based American Strategic Insurance,
        had risen during last November. But the Artemis report no events had
        occurred in December that could add to the losses. The loss reports are
        initial estimates and subject calculation agent assessment and revision
        if needed. Most of the increase in the loss tally is said to be from
        events earlier this year, with around $7 million from events in
        November. The report added: However, the fact that these reports show
        the deal has been triggered by such an amount would seem to suggest that
        investors must ready themselves for some erosion of capital and that not
        all of the principal will be returned at the end of the deals term,
        which is the end of 2016. And it said that, as it was the aggregate
        Section B coverage that faced losses, only the amount that losses extend
        above the attachment point would be lost. But Artemis warned that other
        events in December could add result in further qualifying losses to the
        bond, so the final estimated loss report at the end of the coverage
        period could be higher. A partial repayment is set to be the end result
        for Gator Re and the cat bond was set to face an extension event at the
        end of last year, where the losses would be firmed up and reported back
        to investors. But Artemis cautioned that loss estimates could go down as
        well as up, so any loss of principal could fall as well as rise. The
        Gator Re cat bond was set up in 2014 and was expected to run for around
        two years and nine months to the end of last year. The bond was marketed
        with an initial size of $125 million, later increased to $200 million.

        involved with the Gerova Financial Group, formerly based in Cumberland
        House, Victoria Street, Hamilton, hatched a plot to dump millions of the
        companys shares in an unregistered offering and distribution. The SEC
        alleges that Jason Galanis enlisted his father John Galanis, his two
        brothers Jared and Derek, a family friend from the Republic of Kosovo
        and a Gerova director Gary Hirst and Gavin Hamels, an American
        investment adviser, to carry out the 2010 scheme. An SEC filing with the
        United States District Court, Northern District of New York, said:
        Eventually, Gerovas share price tumbled in reaction to the massive
        sell-off engineered by Jason Galanis. To stem the price decline, Jason
        Galanis orchestrated a second phase of the scheme to artificially
        stabilize Gerovas stock price: he bribed two investment advisers to
        buy Gerova shares in their respective clients accounts in order to
        create demand for the stock. All told Jason Galanis scheme reaped him
        and his family members over $16 million, all at the expense of unwitting
        investors. The court was also told that Jason Galanis, 45, who lives
        in Los Angeles, California, had also been banned in a previous case from
        serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, to
        run from 2007 to 2012 and ordered to pay $60,000 in civil penalties. But
        the filing with the US court that Jason Galanis was instrumental in
        the formation and development of Gerova and in 2006 advised members
        of a wealthy family from Macau, China, on potential investments. He
        later introduced a member of the family to a Gibraltar-based fund, the
        Gibraltar Fund, controlled by one of his business associates, to discuss
        the set-up of a special purpose acquisition vehicle (SPAC) to focus on
        acquisitions based in Asia. The Gibraltar Fund and the Macau family
        agreed to set up Asia Special Situation Acquisition Corporation (ASSAC),
        which was formed as a SPAC in the Cayman Islands in March, 2007. Jason
        Galanis was paid a $600,000 fee for his part in the deal and also
        entered into a consulting agreement with the Gibraltar Fund, which
        entitled him to 30 per cent of the profits the Gibraltar Fund made from
        the SPAC. ASSAC changed its name to Gerova Financial Group in January,
        2010. The SEC filing to the court said: Far beyond the terms of his
        consulting agreement with the Gibraltar Fund, Jason Galanis
        substantially influenced the management, operation and business
        direction of Gerova from its inception. He regularly attended Gerova
        board meetings and had pre-existing business relationships with members
        of the board; he consulted management, company counsel and the board on
        senior management hiring and firing decisions; he reviewed draft
        commission filings and consulted Gerovas officers, directors and
        company counsel concerning disclosures made therein; he interacted with
        Gerovas public relations firms concerning the content of Gerovas
        press releases and gave orders to Gerovas counsel and management
        concerning actions to be taken with respect to its securities. The
        SEC filing said that Jason Galanis, mindful of the officer and
        director bar imposed on him ..., made sure that his official capacity
        at the company was limited, holding himself out as investment banker or
        adviser to the company. But the filing added: However, in October
        2010, he became CEO of a Gerova subsidiary, Gerova Advisors LLC, in
        order to formalize his relationship with the company. In that capacity,
        Jason Galanis was to receive success fees upon the consummation of
        material financings or acquisitions by Gerova that were introduced or
        consulted on by Gerova Advisors. The SEC also alleges that Jason
        Galanis senior role in Gerova, as well as his close relationships
        with senior officers and board members, or his substantial holdings of
        Gerova stock through several shell companies. Gerova companies remain
        listed on the Bermuda Register of Companies. But a spokesman for the
        Bermuda Monetary Authority, which regulates the financial services
        industry, said: There are currently no Bermuda Monetary
        Authority-licensed entities related to this matter. The Royal Gazette
        reported in 2012 that the firm had sought US bankruptcy court
        protection, listing debts of as much as $500 million. The company,
        formerly known as Asia Special Situations Acquisition Corporation, took
        the step to protect its assets from creditors. Gerova said then its
        assets were listed as more than $50 million. Gerova also began
        liquidation proceedings in Bermuda in July that year.
2011. January. Acquired about $1.2
        billion in insurance policies and loans and arranged financing for
        further purchases in the life-settlements market. In 2012 it sought US
        bankruptcy court protection, listing debt of as much as $500 million.
        The company, formerly known as Asia Special Situations Acquisition Corp,
        filed a Chapter 15 petition in Manhattan to protect its US assets from
        creditors. Assets were valued at more than $50 million. Chapter 15
        shields foreign companies from US lawsuits and creditor claims while a
        company continues the process abroad. Liquidated in Bermuda thereafter.

2017.
        May 18. NEW YORK (Bloomberg)  Bermuda-based insurer Global Atlantic
        Financial Group is weighing an initial public offering as soon as this
        year, according to people familiar with the matter. The
        fixed-annuity seller is mulling an initial public offering of shares in
        the fourth quarter or early 2018, said the people, who asked not to be
        identified because the process is private. Goldman Sachs, a major backer
        of the insurer, is helping with the listing plans, the people said. No
        final valuation has been set and the timing is not yet final, they
        added.

4/18/2012.
        2015. September 10. This Bermuda-based gold mining firm is to resume
        operations in South America. It has significant holdings in the jungles
        of Guyana, which are rich in gold deposits. But the firm was
        forced to suspend mining operations on several occasions in the first
        eight months of this year because of equipment breakdowns. The firm also
        received only $168,000 of a promised $4.9 million funding commitment 
        which led to projects being put on hold. But Gold Bar said it had now
        entered into a six-month financial funding commitment from another
        source, with $2.24 million expected in the fourth quarter of this year
        and a further $2.46 million in the first quarter of 2016. A statement by
        the firm said that it had generated close to $1 million in revenue since
        it was set up in 2012. The statement added: The company has made
        significant progress developing relationships in Guyana and identifying
        opportunities within the country. But it added that a fall in gold
        prices over the last two years had put many smaller mining companies
        under pressure. The statement said: The company plans to become a
        strategic partner in the local mining community by using a portion of
        its funding to help revive some of the local mining camps which are
        currently stalled and provide them with fuel and equipment necessary to
        get up and running again. The report explained that there had been
        interest in partnership working, which would allow the company to
        develop income streams while building up its own mining crews. Gold Bar
        said it planned to invest $1 million in new, more efficient, equipment
        and employ 30 additional workers.


 
      
 


Golden
        Ocean Group

A
        shipping company led by Norwegian billionaire John Fredriksen, operates
        a number of carriers for raw materials shipping. It was spun off from
        Frontline. In 2007, it announced two new ship-building contracts
        at Daehan Shipbuilding Co., Ltd., South Korea and Zhoushan Jinhaiwan
        Shipyard in China. In
        2010 owned or controlled 12 ships including Golden Ice and in 2010 had another 23 under construction.
        In 2014 had a market capitalization of 2.9 billion kroner (about US $450
        million). In late 2014/early 2015 merged with and took over another
        Fredriksen's Bermuda-based subsidiary, Knightsbridge Shipping Ltd. Fredriksens
        transaction forms one of the biggest dry-bulk shippers with 72 vessels,
        of which 36 are under construction, in a market suffering from
        oversupply since the financial crisis in 2008. Has a secondary listing
        on the Oslo stock exchange.

Google
        Bermuda Unlimited



9/5/2006.

2016. December 22. NEW
        YORK (Bloomberg)  Google saved $3.6 billion in worldwide taxes in
        2015 by moving 14.9 billion euros ($15.5 billion) to a Bermuda shell
        company, new regulatory filings in the Netherlands reveal. The
        amount the company shifted through its Dutch subsidiary, Google
        Netherlands Holdings, and then on to a Bermuda mailbox was 40 per cent
        greater than in 2014, according to filings the company made with the
        Dutch Chamber of Commerce on December 12 and which were made available
        online on Tuesday. News of the filings was first reported by the Dutch
        newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad. Alphabet moves the bulk of its
        non-US profits through this Dutch subsidiary, which has no employees.
        The company has used the Netherlands company since 2004 as part of a tax
        structure dubbed a Double Irish and a Dutch sandwich. By
        moving most of its international profits to Bermuda, the company was
        able to reduce its effective tax rate outside the US to 6.4 per cent in
        2015, according to Alphabets filings with the Securities and Exchange
        Commission. Google complies with the tax laws in every country where
        we operate, a Google spokesman said in a statement. In February,
        Google also said such calculations of an effective tax rate do not
        reflect the methods actually used to determine its international taxes
        in any jurisdiction. Some 12 billion euros of the money funneled through
        the Dutch company in 2015 came from Google Ireland Limited, which
        collects most of Googles international advertising revenues. The rest
        came from a Google subsidiary in Singapore that serves a similar role.
        The Dutch company then transfers this money on to Google Ireland
        Holdings Unlimited, which has the right to license Googles
        intellectual property outside the US. That company is based in Bermuda,
        which has no corporate income tax. The use of the two Irish entities is
        what gives the structure its Double Irish moniker. The total
        amount of profit Google had sheltered from US taxation, most of which
        passes through its Dutch subsidiary en route to Bermuda, grew to $58.3
        billion in 2015, according to Alphabets SEC filings. The Irish
        government closed the tax loophole that permitted Double Irish tax
        arrangements in 2015. Companies already using the structure, however,
        are allowed to continue employing it until the end of 2020. Google is
        under pressure from regulators and tax authorities around the world for
        not paying enough tax. On Tuesday, Indonesia set a December 31 deadline
        for Google to resolve a tax dispute there, including a possible $223
        million fine. The companys offices in Spain and France have also been
        raided by tax investigators in the past year. US President-elect Donald
        Trump has discussed possible changes to US tax laws in order to allow
        American companies to repatriate foreign profits at a one-time tax rate
        of 10 per cent. That would eliminate some of the incentive US companies
        currently have to hold foreign profits outside the US. Tech firms have
        some of the largest such stockpiles, with Apple holding $181 billion
        outside the US and Microsoft holding $94.4 billion, according to their
        2015 annual SEC filings. 

2015. August 10.
        Google Inc, which has a number of Bermuda-incorporated companies,
        announced plans to create a new public holding company, Alphabet Inc.
        It is being created to restructure Google by moving subsidiaries from
        Google to Alphabet, narrowing Google's scope. The company consists of
        Google, Nest Labs and Calico as well as other businesses including X,
        Google Capital and GV.

 Has
        a hugely significant corporate tax-haven presence in Bermuda. On
        July 27, 2013 in a front page story in the UK's Daily Telegraph
        newspaper, it was revealed that the Church of England's pension fund has
        a Ł sterling 5.7 million stake in Google, plus significant other
        investments in a number of Internet Service Providers. Earlier, British
        Prime Minister David Cameron had severely criticized Google and others
        for UK tax avoidance. On December
        24 2012 the Royal Gazette in Bermuda quoted a Bloomberg New York report
        that Google avoided about $2
        billion in worldwide income taxes in 2011 by shifting $9.8 billion in
        revenues into a Bermuda shell company, almost double the total from
        three years before, filings show. By legally funneling profits from
        overseas subsidiaries into Bermuda, which doesnt have a corporate
        income tax, Google cut its overall tax rate almost in half. The amount
        moved to Bermuda is equivalent to about 80 percent of Googles total
        pretax profit in 2011. The increase in Googles revenues routed to
        Bermuda, disclosed in a November 21 filing by a subsidiary in the
        Netherlands, could fuel the outrage spreading across Europe and in the
        US over corporate tax dodging. Governments in France, the UK, Italy and
        Australia are probing Googles tax avoidance as they seek to boost
        revenue during economic doldrums. The European Unions executive body,
        the European Commission, has advised member states to create blacklists
        of tax havens and adopt anti-abuse rules. Tax evasion and avoidance,
        which cost the EU one trillion euros ($1.3 trillion) a year, are
        scandalous and an attack on the fundamental principle of
        fairness, Algirdas Semeta, the ECs commissioner for taxation, said
        at a press conference in Brussels. The tax strategy of Google and
        other multinationals is a deep embarrassment to governments around
        Europe, said Richard Murphy, an accountant and director of Tax
        Research LLP in Norfolk, England. The political awareness now being
        created in the UK, and to a lesser degree elsewhere in Europe, is:
        Its us or them. People understand that if Google doesnt pay,
        somebody else has to pay or services get cut. Google said it complies
        with all tax rules, and its investment in various European countries
        helps their economies. In the UK, we also employ over 2,000 people,
        help hundreds of thousands of businesses to grow online, and invest
        millions supporting new tech businesses in East London, the Mountain
        View, California-based company said in a statement. The Internet search
        giant has avoided billions of dollars in income taxes around the world
        using a pair of tax shelter strategies known as the Double Irish and
        Dutch Sandwich, Bloomberg News reported in 2010. The tactics, permitted
        under tax law in the U.S. and elsewhere, move royalty payments from
        subsidiaries in Ireland and the Netherlands to a Bermuda unit
        headquartered in a local law firm. In 2011, Google reported a tax rate
        of just 3.2 percent on the profit it said was earned overseas, even as
        most of its foreign sales were in European countries with corporate
        income tax rates ranging from 26 percent to 34 percent. At a hearing in
        November 2012 in the UK, members of Parliament pressed executives from
        Google, Seattle-based Amazon.com Inc. and Starbucks to explain why they
        dont pay more taxes there. The UK, Googles second-biggest market,
        was responsible for about 11 percent of its sales, or almost $4.1
        billion last year, according to company filings. Google paid 6 million
        ($9.6 million) in UK income taxes. Matt Brittin, Googles
        vice-president for Northern and Central Europe, testified that the
        company pays taxes where it creates economic value, primarily the
        US. Still, Google attributes some profit based on technology created in
        the US to offshore subsidiaries, lowering its US taxes, according to
        company filings and people familiar with its tax planning. Google paid
        $1.5 billion in income taxes worldwide in 2011. In the wake of the
        parliamentary hearing, the House of Commons issued a report in December
        2012 declaring that multinationals do not pay their fair share of
        tax. The committee also criticised the UKs tax collection agency, Her
        Majestys Revenue & Customs, for not taking sufficiently
        aggressive action and called on the agency to get a grip on
        corporate tax avoidance. A spokesman for HMRC said the agency ensures
        that multinationals pay the tax due in accordance with UK tax law.
        The French tax authority in 2012 proposed increasing Googles income
        taxes by about $1.3 billion. The agency searched Googles Paris
        offices in June 2011 and removed computer files as part of an
        examination first reported by Bloomberg last year. Google is cooperating
        with French authorities and works with them to answer all their
        questions on Google France and our service, the company said. In
        Italy, the Tax Police began an audit of Google in November 2012 and
        recently searched the companys Milan offices, as well as the offices
        of Facebook, according to a person familiar with the matter. Its
        very common for companies to be audited, and we have been working
        closely with the Italian authorities for some time, Google said.
        So far we have not had any demands for additional tax in Italy.
        Facebook, based in Menlo Park, California, is cooperating with the
        Italian tax authority and we take our obligations under the Italian
        tax code very seriously, a company spokeswoman said. In
        Googles case, an Irish subsidiary collects revenues from ads sold in
        countries like the UK and France. That Irish unit in turn pays royalties
        to another Irish subsidiary, whose legal residence for tax purposes is
        in Bermuda. The pair of Irish units gives rise to the nickname Double
        Irish. To avoid an Irish withholding tax, Google channeled the
        payments to Bermuda through a subsidiary in the Netherlands  thus the
        Dutch Sandwich label. The Netherlands subsidiary has no employees.
        The Dutch units payments to the Bermuda entity in 2011 were up 81
        percent to $9.8 billion from $5.4 billion in 2008. Googles overseas
        sales have increased at about the same rate. Googles overall
        effective tax rate dropped to 21 percent last year from about 28 percent
        in 2008. That compares with the average combined US and state statutory
        rate of about 39 percent.

        sister company and $315 million from Singapore. Most of the money was
        then channeled to Google Ireland Holdings, also Bermuda-based firm. The
        scheme reduced Googles effective corporate tax rate to five percent
         most of which is paid in Ireland, which has relatively low tax
        rates.

Grand
        View Private Trust Company

2013.
        April 10. The Bermuda Supreme Court must decide a case that involves one
        of Taiwans largest companies and a family fortune worth billions held
        in trusts on the Island. Winston Wong, the son of Formosa Plastics
        Groups late founder Wang Yung-ching, has sued an adviser for
        transferring the bulk of the family fortune valued at $15 billion into
        Bermuda trusts controlled by other family members. Dr Winston Wong,
        eldest son of YC Yang, said in a statement yesterday: "The Bermuda
        court now has an opportunity to recognize and resolve the injustice that
        has been perpetrated on my father, on his heirs, the shareholders of
        FPG, and on the people and government of Taiwan. We trust that justice
        and truth will prevail." It was pointed out in the statement that
        Taiwan stood to receive billions in taxes which could help get rid of
        its deficit. Additionally, if the Bermuda court declares the transfer
        of assets to the trusts invalid and turns the assets over to YC Wang's
        estate, the Taiwanese Government could receive an estimated NT $158.4
        billion to NT $237.6 billion in various taxes (US $5.3 billion to US
        $7.9 billion)  which could eliminate the Government's anticipated
        2013 budget deficit of NT $214.4 billion (US$7.15 billion), the
        statement said. Hung Wen Hsiung set up the trusts, excluding Wang,
        referred to in court documents as YC Wang, from the ownership and some
        members of his direct family as beneficiaries, according to a statement
        of claim filed by Wong yesterday in the Supreme Court of Bermuda.
        Bermuda is the fourth jurisdiction where Wong filed claims to recover
        the estate of his father, which he said is valued at $18 billion.
        Bloomberg reported that Hung, Wongs half-sisters Susan Wang and Sandy
        Wang, as well as group Chairman William Wong and Wilfred Wang are among
        the trusts managers, according to a copy of the court filing. Wang
        died in the US in 2008 at the age of 91. He founded Taiwans biggest
        diversified industrial company, Formosa Plastics Group, which made
        pretax profit of NT$143 billion ($4.8 billion) in 2011, according to the
        companys website. The group has worldwide assets valued at more than
        $85 billion and employs 100,000 people, according to the lawsuit. The
        case is Between Wong Wen-Young and Grand View Private Trust Co. in the
        Supreme Court of Bermuda. We are seeking to invalidate the transfers
        and get a declaration that the assets are held for all the heirs of Y.C.
        Wang, Mark Stoutenburg, Wongs lawyer, said in a phone interview.
        Frank Fu, a spokesman for the Formosa Plastics Group, declined to
        comment on the lawsuit when reached by phone by Bloomberg yesterday. In
        a statement put out, Dr Winston Wong, eldest son of YC Yang, said 90
        percent of his personal fortune was allegedly transferred without his
        consent. The statement said the Bermuda outcome could determine control
        of Formosa Plastics Group, and that the offshore trusts are the largest
        shareholders of "Four Treasures." The statement said: Dr
        Wong conducted an extensive four-year investigation that revealed the
        following key findings: 1) that the trusts are non-charitable; 2) that
        the trusts were established in secret by a minority of Y.C. Wang's
        family; 3) that the assets were transferred into the trusts without his
        father's consent; and 4) the trust assets should have been declared as
        part of his late father's estate. Dr Wong's lawsuit focuses on the
        contention that the transfer of YC Wang's assets into the trusts is
        invalid and he seeks to have these assets returned to their rightful
        owners: Y.C. Wang's estate and legal heirs. The lawsuit names as
        defendants, the Grand View Private Trust Company Ltd. (established in
        2001), Transglobe Private Trust Company Ltd. (2002), Vantura Private
        Trust Company Ltd. (2005) and Universal Link Private Trust Company Ltd.
        (2005), all of which are incorporated in Bermuda. Mr Hung Wen Hsiung,
        the late Y.C. Wang's long-time personal financial advisor, is also named
        as a defendant for his role in creating the trusts and transferring Y.C.
        Wang's assets to the trusts. Mr Stoutenburg noted: "It's impossible
        to believe that the late YC Wang gave the required consent and approved
        the transfer of his immense fortune to these four trusts. There is no
        evidence that Mr Wang knew that the transfer of these assets would
        permanently strip him of his ownership of them and give control of the
        assets to just a tiny minority of his large family. The Bermuda trusts
        together hold approximately 90 percent of YC Wang's personal fortune.
        "Given YC Wang's famously meticulous attention to detail, it is
        inconceivable that he would have approved transactions of such magnitude
        and importance without being involved in every step. There is no
        evidence, however, that he ever saw, read or signed any of the complex
        documents establishing the trusts  which were written in English, a
        language neither he nor his advisor Mr Hung could speak or read. The
        defendants and their agents do not deny these facts," he continued.
        "This has led Dr Wong to the inevitable conclusion that his father
        was deceived." Stoutenburg explains: "The Wang Chang Gung
        Charitable Trust, established by YC Wang and named in honor of Dr Wong's
        grandfather, was the blueprint for Mr Wang's charitable giving. He was
        very detailed and specific about its mission, its management, and its
        financing. He included his entire family. He did nothing in secret. He
        left nothing to chance. He made everything transparent. The Bermuda
        trusts, established in secret, with no clear charitable mission or
        activity, stand in stark contrast to this and are trying to hide behind
        the good deeds of the Wang Chang Gung Charitable Trust. The purpose
        trusts were established offshore in Bermuda to avoid scrutiny in Taiwan
        and so that they could be hidden from Y.C. Wang's estate. Despite
        repeated requests, no proof has been provided about the purported
        charitable activities of the trusts, nor has Dr Wong's widespread
        investigation turned up any evidence that the Bermuda trusts are engaged
        in any charitable activities." In summary, says Stoutenburg:
        "The evidence indicates that the Bermuda trusts were primarily
        established to: 1) secretly ensure that the control of FPG was kept in
        the hands of a few family insiders and guarantee that other family
        members could not inherit significant shares upon YC Wang's death; 2)
        drastically reduce YC Wang's estate; 3) obscure the true ownership of
        FPG under the guise of foreign investors; and 4) hold the assets of a
        vast, global business empire controlled by a few members of the family.
        All of this was done offshore to avoid the scrutiny of Taiwan
        regulators." The statement added Dr Wong's lawyers assert that the
        people who control the trusts have unchecked and unregulated power to do
        whatever they like with the billions of dollars of assets in the trusts.
        There are no outside authorities or government bodies in Bermuda that
        actively supervise the trusts or the billions of dollars worth of assets
        they control. To the contrary, these offshore purpose trusts, named in
        Dr Wong's lawsuit, are controlled and self-supervised by the same people
        who benefit from the decisions they make, the statement said, going on
        to say: The lawsuit, which marks a critical point in Dr Wong's
        long-standing efforts to restore his late father's legacy, has profound
        implications for the future of FPG. If the Bermuda court rules that the
        transfer of YC Wang's FPG stake to the offshore trusts should be undone,
        it would affect the current management and control of FPG.

        Waterfront Centre, Wellesley House North, Pitt's Bay Road,
        Hamilton. Bermuda-based
        holding company for Class 4 property casualty reinsurer Hamilton
        Re and
        the organization's US property casualty insurance operations Hamilton
        USA. CEO
        is Bermudian  Brian Duperreault. 
2017. May 15. Hamilton
        Insurance Group founder Brian Duperreault has written to his staff after
        leaving to take over as president and CEO of insurance firm AIG. Mr
        Duperreault told Hamilton employees that he was not leaving because
        there were problems at Hamilton  but because there were problems at
        AIG he was confident he could help fix. He said: Hamilton was founded
        on a bold idea whose time had come. As other industries leapt ahead in
        their pursuit of value in data and technology, insurance lagged behind.
        It was only a matter of time before someone disrupted the industry.
        Hamiltons investors believed that with the right underwriting talent
        and with Two Sigmas data science prowess, we could be the ones to do
        it. And weve been proven right. Mr Duperreault said Hamilton had
        set up a nimble, client-focused company widely admired  and in
        many cases, envied  by the markets in which we do business. In the
        US, we were the drivers behind the establishment of Attune, a
        groundbreaking platform for small commercial insurance. In Bermuda,
        were redefining what it means to be a Tier 1 company. At Lloyds,
        we came to market with a full suite of product offerings faster than any
        other syndicate, leveraging technology to strip out much of the
        inefficiency that plagues Lloyds. So I know that Hamilton is in great
        shape. Some of the best minds in the business work here. Theres an
        energy thats palpable when you visit our offices. If you ask me why
        Im leaving, its not because there are issues at Hamilton. Im
        leaving because there are issues at AIG. And I think I can help fix
        them, in no small part by unlocking the potential represented by the
        Hamilton/Two Sigma/AIG partnership already in place at Attune. And Mr
        Duperreault said the move would be transformative for the group he
        founded nearly four years ago. He explained: As part of the expanded
        partnership with AIG and TSIQ, Hamilton will play a significant role in
        leading the data-driven evolution in underwriting. Thats what we had
        in mind when we launched this company just over three years ago. Mr
        Duperreault added: In closing, I want you to know how proud I am of
        what weve done together. I know the best is yet to come. I look
        forward to the opportunities were going to have to work together and
        I thank each and every one of you for your commitment to Hamiltons
        present and to its future.
2017. May 15. Industry
        veteran Brian Duperreault has left island-based Hamilton Insurance Group
        to become head of American insurance giant AIG. Douglas Steenland,
        chairman of AIG, said: Brian is uniquely qualified to lead AIG at
        this important time. He is a hands-on leader who has consistently
        delivered strong bottom-line results. Mr Duperreaults successor as
        chairman of Hamilton, William Freda, said: It is with regret that we
        have accepted Brians resignation from Hamilton. He is an industry
        icon with a well-deserved reputation for visionary leadership. We have
        had the privilege of experiencing this first-hand at Hamilton. Mr
        Duperreault, 70, is a former lieutenant and protégé of ex-AIG CEO
        Maurice Hank Greenberg and is recognized for his experience in
        turning around struggling companies. He will replace Peter Hancock as
        AIG CEO, who was almost three quarters through a plan designed to turn
        the ailing giant around after a series of poor results. Mr Duperreault
        moved up through the ranks of AIG early in his career, leaving in 1994
        to build Ace, now Chubb, from a small operator into a global operation.
        Mr Duperreault, who was also CEO of Hamilton, will be replaced in that
        role by David Brown, the former CEO of Flagstone Re. Mr Freda said:
        We have in David an experienced industry CEO who has been with the
        company since inception. He is an ideal resource to lead Hamilton
        through this transition. With a superlative management team, and a board
        of directors representing a cross section of disciplines from the
        insurance, finance and technology industries, we are well prepared to
        continue to execute our mission of writing the future of risk. In
        addition, our relationship with Two Sigma, our technology and investment
        partner, has been an extremely productive one since Hamiltons launch
        at the end of 2013. Our experience with Attune, the technology-enabled
        company established with Two Sigma and AIG, has demonstrated the huge
        potential in applying data science and analytics to transform the
        underwriting process. We are all excited about the potential for ongoing
        growth and development at Hamilton. Mr Duperreault, who founded
        insurance and reinsurance company Hamilton four years ago after a long
        career in the sector, had been touted as the new CEO of AIG for some
        time. AIGs shares climbed 1.4 per cent yesterday to $61.82 after the
        news was announced. Mr Duperreault took charge at Marsh & McLennan
        Companies in 2008 and launched a successful turnaround after the firm
        had been hit by reputational problems and lost business after then-New
        York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer alleged it had rigged bids for
        insurance contracts. Marsh paid an $850 million civil penalty in 2005 to
        settle the claims. Mr Freda worked for Deloitte on a wide range of
        multinational engagements for 40 years through 2014. Mr Brown was CEO of
        Flagstone Reinsurance Holdings from its foundation in October 2005 until
        November 2012. He previously served as chief executive of Centre
        Solutions from 1994 until 1997. Before joining Centre Solutions, he was
        a partner with Ernst & Young. He has been chairman of the board at
        the Bermuda Stock Exchange since 2000.
2016. September 15.
        The insurance industry has to get leaner and make greater use of
        technology, according to industry veteran Brian Duperreault. Mr
        Duperreault, chairman of Hamilton Insurance Group, said: Our delivery
        of our product is grossly over-expensed. We are not doing our insureds
        any favors in how we deliver that service. We take too much money out of
        the premium dollar to cover the cost of actually delivering the service
        as opposed to the service itself. Mr Duperreault was speaking to AM
        Best TV at the Rendez-Vous conference in Monte Carlo. He added that his
        group had teamed up with insurance giants American International Group
        and Hamiltons existing partner Two Sigma to create a new insurance
        platform targeting small and medium-sized businesses in the US. Mr
        Duperreault said: AIG suggested we look at the SME space together
        which I thought was a great idea. The idea is to get away from
        everything that has been done and start afresh in this joint venture and
        create a company that is specially purposed, specially built, to do just
        this in the new way in a way where were using data science,
        technology capabilities to really provide a better service to the
        insured, which is ultimately what we do. We enlisted the aid of Two
        Sigma who were and remain our technology partner and investment partner
         they got very excited about doing this with AIG. We see it as a
        great way of exchanging information, intellectual property, developing
        new intellectual property and really making a difference in this area of
        business. A lot of companies want to make a change, I dont care who
        you talk to, if you say what do you think about technology?
        were interested, were doing what we can, but I think most
        companies are trapped in what they are, the existing infrastructure, the
        company thats been built over time. Theres tremendous value in
        that and its not easy to take that, throw that out and try something
        completely different. The real difference is we will start from nothing,
        which is a great asset to have, Ive always said that. You start from
        nothing and build it in a way that makes sense now, with the digital
        world we are in. If you look at our business, and there is much to be
        proud of in what we do, we provide a tremendous social service, we
        protect individuals, corporations, countries, but, frankly, it hasnt
        evolved in the same way other industries have evolved in this digital
        world. Mr Duperreault said that Blue Marble Microinsurance, set up by
        Hamilton Insurance Group, AIG, Aspen, Guy Carpenter, Old Mutual,
        TransRe, XL Catlin and Zurich to provide the developing world with
        insurance products, could also help regenerate the mainstream industry.
        A statement on a partner website said: We share a vision of
        collaborating to develop insurance supply to benefit underserved
        communities worldwide. Blue Marble will incubate the launch and
        operations of new solutions, including unique distribution methods,
        local partnerships and product development. Mr Duperreault said that
        reverse engineering applied to traditional businesses using
        lessons learnt from Blue Marble could lead to greater efficiency. He
        explained: Its being done in a different way ... a virtual company
        using the resources of all the consortium members. And he said:
        This is a real effort to do real business, create a for-profit
        approach, create a market, but really provide a service. If you can
        solve the problems of micro, you have got to deal with distribution, you
        have got to deal with transactions electronically and digitally, you
        have got to be able to handle claims and do other services all in a way
        thats enormously efficient because there isnt enough money to go
        around. That knowledge, if it doesnt do anything more than give you
        an insight into what youre doing in your existing business, it
        probably will give you actual solutions to what youre doing in your
        existing business along these lines and were all trying to solve
        that.
2016. May 12. Hamilton
        Insurance Group has opened up new offices in London to boost its
        presence in the Lloyds of London market. And yesterday Bob
        Richards, the Minister of Finance, joined Brian Duperreault,
        Hamiltons chairman and chief executive officer, and Dermot
        ODonohoe, Hamilton at Lloyds CEO, to mark the event. Mr
        Duperreault said: When we launched Hamilton in December 2013 we had
        three key objectives. These were to develop our acquired reinsurance
        operations in Bermuda, to establish a platform at Lloyds and to
        launch an insurance brand in the United States  all of which would
        leverage the outstanding analytical capabilities of our technology and
        investment partners Two Sigma to create a new way of doing business.
        Hamilton announced two weeks ago that it would link up with American
        International Group and Two Sigma to create an insurance platform for
        small and medium-sized businesses. The three companies are looking to
        become the leader in the sector in North America, where the market is
        estimated to be worth $76 billion. Mr Duperreault said that the new
        London office and the push in North America meant Hamilton was
        delivering on all fronts. I congratulate Dermot and his team for the
        impressive progress theyve made in building a diversified platform at
        Lloyds in such a short space of time. Their new offices are a fitting
        testament to all theyve achieved. Mr ODonohoe said: I am
        most grateful for the hard work of everyone at Hamilton at Lloyds.
        Our 45 employees coordinated multiple work streams in offices designed
        to accommodate a handful of staff. Working with our partners at
        Lloyds, their efforts resulted in Hamilton at Lloyds being fit for
        purpose and ready to write business as of January 1, 2016. Our staffs
        dedication to Hamiltons vision is the reason we are where we are
        today and why I am so optimistic about our future growth prospects.
        Hamilton bought up a niche sports underwriting managing agency last year
        and renamed it Hamilton Underwriting Ltd and Syndicate 3334 to establish
        a diversified presence at Lloyds. Syndicate 3334 now writes seven
        classes of business  accident and health, contingency, financial
        institutions, property direct and facultative, professional indemnity
        and space and treaty insurance.

2015. May 29. Opened their new offices in the Waterfront centre.
        And group CEO Brian Duperreault said the new building underlined the
        firms commitment to Bermuda.  Bermuda is our home  we feel
        so much at home in Bermuda we named the company Hamilton. Our
        headquarters are here and we have a large contingent of Bermudians
        here. Industry veteran Mr Duperreault was speaking as Premier Michael
        Dunkley cut the ribbon at the new offices, in the Waterfronts
        Wellesley House North. And the hi-tech workplace features a mini-golf
        course, complete with obstacles, a games room, and an interactive globe
        of the world that can track weather events that could impact on the
        firms business. The firm opened its doors two years ago in
        Par-la-Ville Road but has grown rapidly to include not only
        Bermuda-based reinsurer Hamilton Re, but an arm in the USA and Hamilton
        at Lloyds of London and houses 35 staff in its new home on Pitts Bay
        Road.

2017. June 5. Hamilton
        Re has launched its first special purpose vehicle with backing of $65
        million. Turing Re will provide collateralised capacity for its
        parent firms global reinsurance portfolio. Kathleen Reardon, CEO of
        Hamilton Re, said: This transaction represents an exciting next step
        in the evolution of Hamilton Re as a diversified company meeting the
        needs of our current and future clients. The vehicle was capitalized
        with $65 million raised in a private placement syndicated among multiple
        investors. Turing Re will provide support for Hamilton Res property
        treaty book of business.
2017. April 23.
        Bermuda's Hamilton Re has bought the renewal rights to Canopius
        Underwriting Bermudas excess casualty book of business. And Sompo
        Canopius underwriters Stephen Hartwig and Jeremy Wright are set to join
        Hamilton Re. Mr Hartwig will be chief underwriting officer for casualty
        insurance while Mr Wright will be senior vice-president casualty
        insurance. Kathleen Reardon, chief executive officer of Hamilton Re,
        said: Bermuda has long been recognized as a strong excess casualty
        market, so were pleased to be able to establish an important presence
        with underwriters of Steve and Jeremys calibre and with the esteemed
        roster of clients they have developed. She added: Its also been
        a real pleasure to work with the management team at Sompo Canopius as
        weve developed the terms of this transaction. The agreement includes
        ongoing collaboration designed to ensure a smooth transition of the
        business so that the needs of longstanding Sompo Canopius clients and
        brokers are met efficiently and effectively. The transaction is
        expected to be closed by the middle of the year. Ms Reardon said:
        From a strategic perspective, the acquisition of the these renewal
        rights continues the diversification of Hamilton Res portfolio. This
        new initiative will run in parallel with our joint venture with
        Iron-Starr, which was established shortly after our market launch in
        2014, a partnership that remains strong. Ms Reardon added that the
        property-related team added in 2016 had made significant inroads
        into the market. She added: Taken together, this expanded offering
        gives Hamilton Re the ability to provide tailored solutions and
        exceptional service which are part of our core values. Mike Duffy,
        Sompo Canopius group chief underwriting officer, said: We are pleased
        to have reached this agreement with Hamilton Re, which provides a great
        long-term home for the business, especially taking on the knowledge,
        expertise and relationships of Stephen Hartwig and Jeremy Wright. We
        remain committed to our property catastrophe business that is also
        written out of our Bermuda office and look forward to continuing to work
        with our partners in Bermuda, particularly Hamilton. Mr Hartwig has
        nearly 25 years of insurance industry experience, which includes
        underwriting and management roles based in the US, Europe and Bermuda.
        Mr Wright, who has notched up 16 years in the industry, worked in senior
        roles at Ace, now Chubb, before joining Sompo Canopius. Hamilton Re is
        the island-based platform for Hamilton Insurance Group, the
        Bermuda-based holding company for insurance and reinsurance operations
        in Bermuda, the US and at Lloyds of London.

 September 17, 2015. New player Hamilton Re
        will enter the property insurance market, CEO Kathleen Reardon said
        yesterday. Ms Reardon added that the firm would also join the
        facultative market  a form of reinsurance in which a contract is
        negotiated for a specific insurance policy used when a policy is unusual
        or large and the original insurer is concerned about the liability
        risks. And she said that a star casualty underwriter will shortly
        join her team from a Lloyds of London syndicate. From day one we
        have been a company that has been happy to diversify and not rely on one
        channel for business. We are thinking big and acting big when it comes
        to a diversified product range. Ms Reardon was speaking at industry
        summit the Monte Carlo Rendezvous to the events Monte Carlo Today
        newspaper. She said that the rash of major mergers and takeovers had
        created a new talent pool to draw from as new joint companies cut
        staff. Ms Reardon added: Mergers and acquisitions are going to
        continue and that is offering more opportunities to pick up talent.
        And she did not rule out Hamilton Insurance Group and Hamilton Re
        joining the rush to expand through acquisition. There are some
        attractive companies that could give Hamilton Insurance Group a start
        with a new strategy or which have a different product range or operate
        in another region. We would have to look at it. Some people are
        questioning the valuations of some merger and acquisition strategy, but
        if shareholders feel that it is a solid decision and gives them what
        they need, then it is a sensible thing to do. But she added that the
        groups main focus was on organic growth, writing" volatile
        severity driven business and looking for greater diversity. Ms Reardon
        said that the company also hoped to become listed in the future. She
        explained: Its something we will be looking at in the future. We
        are a highly liquid company that operates on both sides of the balance
        sheet. Ms Reardon added that Hamilton Re was comfortable with its
        position relating to a US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) probe into
        hedge fund-backed reinsurers  some of which the IRS suspects are
        hedge funds using a reinsurance company as a front for tax purposes. She
        said that Hamilton Re  owned by a mix of private equity companies as
        well as its founders  was not hedge fund-backed. Ms Reardon added:
        We are focused on building a franchise with a global platform and I
        am comfortable with our strategy now and in the future. The US is
        considering imposing a minimum standard for reserves to draw a line
        between insurers engaged in genuine underwriting and what it calls
        passive foreign investment companies. Ms Reardon said that
        Hamilton Re backed the Association of Bermuda Insurers and Reinsurers
        stance that the US Treasury, if it adopts that policy, it should use the
        bright line safe harbour test of a 15 per cent reserve-to-asset
        ratio.

        Underwriting Agency
1/2/1975
2016. November 28. 
        Hamilton Underwriting Limited, the Lloyds platform of Hamilton
        Insurance Group, has been given permission to increase its gross written
        premium by Ł52 million ($64.6 million) and to write two new lines of
        business. Syndicate 3334 had approval for a gross written premium of
        Ł69.5 million this year. Lloyds has now given approval for that to
        increase to Ł122.5 million next year. The two new lines of business the
        Syndicate can write are marine liability and war and terror. We are
        delighted that Lloyds has approved this substantial increase in our
        capacity for 2017 and has given us the go-ahead to write marine
        liability and war and terror business, said Dermot ODonohoe, chief
        executive officer of Hamilton Underwriting Limited. Since acquiring
        the Syndicate in 2015, we have recruited market-leading teams of
        underwriters and significantly scaled up the business. Some of our books
        of business were relatively small and thus subject to volatility if
        there were major losses, so this increase in capacity allows us to iron
        out a degree of volatility in the portfolio. The current soft market is
        difficult and there are many challenges, but with our combination of
        careful risk selection and utilization of data and analytics to improve
        our underwriting, we look forward to maximizing profitable business
        opportunities in 2017. Last month, Hamilton Underwriting Limited
        announced it had recruited Mark Appleton from The Navigators Group as
        head of marine liability. The managing agency is currently seeking a
        head of war and terror. Syndicate 3334 also writes accident and health
        insurance, contingency insurance, property D&F insurance,
        professional indemnity insurance, space insurance, treaty reinsurance,
        and financial institutions insurance.

        (Bermuda)
Has offices at
        Washington Mall, Phase 1, Church Street level.
2016. November 28.
        Heritage Education Funds International has paid out more than $3.2
        million to families in Bermuda this year for postsecondary education. The
        funding was distributed by Heritage Agency (Bermuda), which is licensed
        to market the Heritage International Scholarship Trust Plan in Bermuda.
        The plan, known generally as an education savings plan, is a US dollar
        plan and provides families with a method of saving and investing for
        their childrens postsecondary education. Families are able to create
        flexible, long-term savings plans that are tailored to each familys
        individual financial situation. In a statement, Heritage said that
        students who received their third and final scholarship this year
        benefited from return of 6.70 per cent. During the two previous years,
        families in Bermuda received respective amounts of $2.75 million and
        $3.62 million. Heritage has paid out a total of $44 million to families
        in Bermuda, complemented by the fact that more subscribers than ever
        before in Bermuda have been using our Education Savings Plan to help
        fund a postsecondary education for their children or grandchildren.
        Jason Maguire, president of Heritage Education Funds International,
        said: Im truly thankful to our subscribers for putting their trust
        in us over the years. Our organisation has some of the best, most loyal
        customers of any industry, and theyve helped make Heritage
        International what it is today. Our goal has always been to provide a
        cost-effective, flexible means to help hard-working families better
        afford a college or university education for their children, and Im
        simply ecstatic that, by sticking with our plan, more of them are able
        to do so. A postsecondary education is critically important in todays
        society, and the more people we help in achieving that goal, the better
        off the world will be. The organisation said tuition costs continue
        to rise, averaging a 5 per cent increase annually, and said if this
        trend continues, tuition for a four-year degree programme could exceed
        $100,000 in 2026, depending on the programme of study and location.
        Heritage Agency (Bermuda), which is licensed to conduct investment
        business by the Bermuda Monetary Authority, said it continues to assist
        thousands of families in Bermuda building brighter futures for their
        children. Gerry Swan is the agency director.

Hiscox
        Insurance Company (Bermuda)
10/21/2005. Class 4. Companys head office is at Wessex House, in Reid Street, it
        writes a large proportion of its business through the Lloyds of
        London market. Hiscox, headquartered in Bermuda, is an international
        specialist insurance group listed on the London Stock Exchange
        (LSE:HSX). There are three main underwriting parts of the Group 
        Hiscox London Market, Hiscox UK and Europe and Hiscox International.
        Hiscox London Market underwrites mainly internationally traded business
        in the London Market  generally large or complex business which needs
        to be shared with other insurers or needs the international licences of
        Lloyds. Hiscox UK and Hiscox Europe offer a range of specialist
        insurance for professionals and business customers, as well as high net
        worth individuals. Hiscox International includes operations in Bermuda,
        Guernsey and USA. One
        of the UK's leading insurers of higher value homes and also one of the
        most expensive of medium-value homes. Hiscox also
        has Bermuda-based Kiskadee insurance-linked strategies funds, listed
        separately.
2017. February 28.
        Hiscox made record profits in 2016 helped by favorable foreign-currency
        moves and increased earnings from its Hamilton-based reinsurance
        division. The groups profits totaled Ł354.5 million ($440.8
        million), up 64 per cent on 2015. The relative weakness of the pound
        helped the Bermudian firm to net foreign exchange gains of Ł152.4
        million. Even with the flattering impact of the currency fluctuations,
        Robert Childs, chairman of Hiscox said these were a cracking set of
        results. Return on equity was 23 per cent, while the investment
        return was 1.9 per cent. The company declared a final dividend of 19p,
        bringing the full-year dividend up to 27.5p, a 15 per cent increase on
        2015. In an interview, Mr Childs conceded that political developments
        around the world, particularly Brexit and the election of Donald Trump
        and a Republican-controlled Congress in the US  had the potential to
        affect the business. He said the border-adjustment tax proposed by
        President Trump could  if it applied to re/insurance  have an
        impact not only on Bermuda, but on the industry. No one knows yet what
        will happen yet  its just too early to say." Bermudas
        advantages as a re/insurance centre went further than tax, he added,
        citing Solvency II third-country equivalency in particular. As a major
        operator in the Lloyds of London market, Hiscox is also grappling
        with the impact of Britains impending departure from the European
        Union and the likely loss of passporting rights that currently
        allow UK-based financial-services companies to do business throughout
        the EU. We are looking to set up a new company in Europe, in either
        Luxembourg or Malta, Mr Childs said. That could happen within the
        next 12 months. Hiscox employs more than 50 people at its head office
        in Wessex House, on Reid Street, where its reinsurance and
        insurance-linked securities division operates. Gross written premiums
        for Hiscox Re and ILS increased by 29.1 per cent to Ł495.2 million, or
        16.1 per cent when currency moves are stripped out, driven by growth in
        casualty and specialty lines as well as business written on behalf of
        the alternative capital management unit Kiskadee. The division delivered
        a Ł115.5 million profit and a combined ratio of 53.7 per cent. Mr
        Childs said Kiskadee, founded in 2013, had grown rapidly and now had
        assets under management of $1.25 billion, putting it firmly in the
        premier league of ILS businesses. The Hiscox London Market business
        generated a Ł44 million profit, however margins are under pressure from
        rates driven down by a glut of capital, according to Mr Childs and the
        soft market shows no signs of hardening. Asked what was needed to turn
        the market, Mr Childs said: I think its got to do with a
        combination of low margins followed by a shock loss. When you look back
        to 9/11, the loss was only about $25 billion, but it hit at a time when
        margins were very low. The margins are getting very low now.
        Hiscoxs retail operations had a stellar year, generating nearly half
        the groups total profit. Retail operations in the UK and Europe
        doubled their profits, while Hiscox USA produced premium growth of 30
        per cent. Bronek Masojada, Hiscoxs chief executive officer, said:
        This is a good result, flattered by foreign exchange and boosted by a
        strong investment return. Our retail business has come of age, driving
        growth and profitability for the group. This gives us options and,
        although there are uncertainties in both the insurance and political
        environments, we have the right people, footprint and financial power to
        adapt. We will remain focused and disciplined where margins are
        shrinking and invest where we see opportunities for long-term profitable
        growth. 
2016. July 26. Hiscox
        is ready to restructure in response to Britains impending departure
        from the European Union  but Brexit is unlikely to do any harm to
        Bermuda as an insurance and reinsurance jurisdiction. That is view of
        Robert Childs, chairman of Hiscox, who was speaking with The Royal
        Gazette after Hiscox announced half-year profits that rose 52 per cent
        to Ł206 million. Some of the increase was down to the weakness of
        the UK pound after Britons voted to leave the EU in a June 23
        referendum. In the interim earnings statement, Mr Childs said Hiscox was
        ready to set up a new European insurance company, if necessary. 
        For us, Brexit is a structural rather than a strategic issue, Mr
        Childs said. Theresa May [Britains new Prime Minister] says Brexit
        will happen but no one knows what it will look like yet. Hiscox was
        preparing for either Brexit light  a scenario in which the UK
        retained full access to the EU market and free movement of people and
        good continued  and for Brexit heavy, in which market access
        became limited by the loss of passporting rights that allow
        British-based companies to trade without restriction in the EU. As we
        said before the referendum, we were, in a corporate sense, agnostic
        about the vote, Mr Childs said. We have a big European operation
        that generates $260 million worth of business. Were in Spain, France,
        Germany, the Benelux countries and Germany, so were already there. So
        we could easily set up a new insurer in Europe if we needed to. We would
        probably look to decide by the first quarter of 2017 in which country we
        would want to set up and it would take about 12 months to do that, so
        about 18 months to it actually starting up. Speaking on the
        industry-wide impact, he said the reinsurance side of the Lloyds
        market was the most likely to travel post-Brexit. As for the
        impact on Bermuda, he said: It shows how important Solvency II
        equivalency was for the island. Bermuda now has an established
        relationship with Eiopa [the overseer of insurance in the EU] and I
        cant see Brexit as being a bad thing for Bermuda. The European
        Commission earlier this year gave Bermuda third-country
        equivalence with Solvency II, the 28-country blocs new regulatory
        regime for the insurance industry, which means Bermudian-based insurers
        will be able to do business on a level playing field in the EU.
        Britain will have to apply for Solvency II equivalence and that will
        be interesting, Mr Childs said. Hiscoxs pretax profit of Ł206
        million was up from Ł135.1 million last year. With London-listed Hiscox
        declaring its profits in pounds, the dramatic weakening of the pound in
        the last week of the first-half period gave a massive boost to results,
        given that much of Hiscoxs profit was generated in US dollars and
        euros. Excluding the foreign exchange gain, Hiscoxs net income was Ł118.7
        million. Hiscoxs retail business was the largest contributor to
        profit, while Hiscox USA delivered the strongest growth of 32.8 per cent
        in local currency and Hiscox London Market grew by 9.7 per cent. The
        group combined ratio  the proportion of premium dollars spent on
        claims and expenses  was 80.7 per cent, or 88.4 per cent excluding
        the currency impact. The reinsurance side of the business, which is
        headquartered in Bermuda, managed a combined ratio of 56 per cent, or
        69.8 per cent, excluding currency gains. It generated profit of Ł54.6
        million on gross premiums written of Ł364.7 million. Bermuda is also
        home to Kiskadee Investment Managers, the groups alternative capital
        management arm, whose assets under management have risen to more than $1
        billion, an achievement described in a note by analysts at Shore Capital
        as a quite remarkable success story to date. For many competitors,
        the second quarter brought material catastrophe losses, but Hiscox
        estimated a relatively modest Ł19 million loss, something Mr Childs put
        down to excellent underwriting. Hiscox reported a very competitive
        market in most lines of business, but Mr Childs said price reductions
        are getting smaller. Hiscox also raised its interim dividend by 6 per
        cent to 8.5p. Hiscox shares were down 2p in London Stock Exchange
        trading to 1,067p after the results were announced yesterday.
2016. May 31. The
        former chairman of Bermuda-based insurance giant Hiscox said the firm
        could move back to London if the UK votes to quit the European Union.
        Robert Hiscox, who chaired the firm for 43 years until 2013 and is now
        honorary chairman, told the UKs Press Association the company had
        moved from London to Bermuda a decade ago because of the British tax and
        regulatory regime under the then-Labour government and the EU. Mr Hiscox
        said: We dont want to bring it back while were in the EU. If we
        leave, then it depends on the domestic regime whether we come back or
        not, but its possible. He added, however: But we love being in
        Bermuda. Its a useful place. Its close to the US where we do a lot
        of business and it makes us feel international. Its not just a tax
        dodge. Jeremy Pinchin, the CEO of Hiscox Bermuda and Hiscox Re,
        yesterday distanced the company from Mr Hiscoxs statements on Brexit
         and reaffirmed the firms commitment to the island. Mr Pinchin
        said: Robert is honorary president of Hiscox. While he is a major
        shareholder, he is not on the board of Hiscox. The issue of leaving
        Bermuda domicile, whether Britain leaves the EU or not, is not on the
        board agenda and we remain committed to Bermuda. Mr Hiscox also
        launched an attack on David Cameron, the Prime Minister, and his
        corrupt campaign to remain an EU member and accused the British
        Treasury, the finance arm of government, which released a paper
        predicting a massive recession if Britain voted to exit the EU, of
        putting out illegal propaganda. The part the government has played in
        this debate is astonishing. Their corrupt statements and illegal
        propaganda pouring out is something to behold, especially the Treasury
        document. Mr Hiscoxs comments echoed those of former Conservative
        Chancellors of the Exchequer, the equivalent of Finance Minister, Nigel
        Lawson and Norman Lamont, who are now members of the House of Lords and
        part of a major split in their party over the EU. Mr Hiscox added that
        major City of London institutions that had come out in favour of
        continued membership of the EU were an elite motivated by their own
        interests. He said: All the experts coming out for Remain are
        all part of the elite, from Goldman Sachs downwards. Theyve all
        bought into it. Its in their own self-interest. Im astonished when
        I meet people from Remain. Ill never understand why they want,
        in a global race, to tie the UK to 27 other countries, some of which
        have no legs. Why do we want to have millions of rules delivered by an
        unelected tyrannical elite in Brussels? Mr Hiscox was one of 300
        business leaders to sign an open letter calling for the UK to leave the
        EU. Mr Hiscox now runs a bookshop in Marlborough in the English county
        of Wiltshire.
2016. March 1.
        Bermudian insurer Hiscox Ltd, which advertises itself in the UK as a
        reputable insurer, wrote more business last year but profits fell 6.5
        per cent mainly due to dwindling investment returns. Hiscox said
        full-year profit fell to Ł216.1 million from Ł231.1 million in 2014,
        slightly better than analysts had expected. Gross written premiums
        climbed 10.7 per cent to Ł1.94 billion ($2.69 billion) in 2015 and the
        groups retail businesses contributed 50 per cent of income. The
        groups investment return was Ł33.7 million, or 1 per cent, down from
        Ł56.4 million, or 1.8 per cent, in 2014. The year had been
        characterised by low yields and volatility in many asset classes,
        Hiscox said. Hiscox Re, the reinsurance part of the business which
        operates out of the groups head office at Wessex House on Reid
        Street, Hamilton, achieved growth of 8.2 per cent, Ł383.4 million,
        compared to Ł354.3 million in 2014. In local currency, growth was
        calculated at 2.9 per cent. Hiscox Re recorded strong profitability,
        with a combined ratio  reflecting the proportion of premium dollars
        spent on claims and expenses  of 46.6 per cent, bettering 2014s
        49.8 per cent. The company put the growth down to a focus on product
        innovation, which generated an extra $70 million of premium. The
        benign claims environment continues to put pressure on rates, Hiscox
        stated. Last years important 1/1 renewals saw rates fall by 12 per
        cent and this year they fell again by 5 per cent. Inside two years,
        Hiscox said its Hamilton-based ILS-focused Kiskadee arm had grown to be
        a significant brand in the market and was on track to reach $1 billion
        in assets under management this year. Last year, Hiscox also launched
        Cardinal Re Ltd, a special purpose insurer domiciled in Bermuda,
        designed to transform collateralised insurance and reinsurance risk
        into a security more suited for capital market investors. Hiscox
        declared a second interim dividend of 32p per share, which included a
        special dividend of 16p. However, the company warned investors that in
        future it intended to retain more capital to focus on pursuing
        opportunities for profitable growth. Bronek Masojada, Hiscoxs
        chief executive officer, said the firm, like its competitors, had
        benefited from the absence of major natural catastrophes. He
        added, in his outlook for this year: Our bigger-ticket businesses are
        more likely to retreat, with growth coming from our new teams in
        specialty retail across the world.

        Bermuda Stock Exchange. The listing is issued by Eclipse Re, a new
        company designed to bring turnkey reinsurance ILS market services to
        investors and sponsors. Eclipse Re, set up by Horseshoe with boutique
        insurance investment banking specialists Rewire Securities, will be used
        to provide collateralised reinsurance participation in a listed note
        format. Horseshoe subsidiary Horseshoe Corporate Services, which
        recently became a Bermuda Stock Exchange listing sponsor, acted as
        sponsor for a $20 million security issued by Eclipse on the BSX

        of Eclipse in February: As the leading full-service ILS service
        provider, Horseshoe continues its commitment to being responsive to
        clients needs and providing the highest level of innovative and
        efficient professional services. Eclipse Re will provide a vehicle for
        investors to participate in the collateralised reinsurance market with
        the benefit of liquidity not previously available through traditional
        platforms. We are excited to support the BSX as a listing sponsor and
        launching this product to expand our broad capabilities in the ILS
        marketplace. Eclipse Re is expected to attract sponsors such as
        insurers, reinsurers, corporates and funds, working with investors on
        the other side of the deal, all of whom who will benefit from an ILS
        issuance structured by Rewire and administered by Horseshoe. ILS and
        reinsurance notes issued by Eclipse Re can be structured in as short a
        timeframe as two to three weeks, the pair said, offering provide
        sponsors am efficient and low-cost way to access the ILS and capital
        markets in reinsurance. The new platform will allow sponsors and
        investors to more easily transform and securitise reinsurance risks into
        an investable and transferable note form.

HSCM Bermuda
2017. June
        7. This Island-based investment manager has invested $20.1 million in
        preferred shares in a reinsurance vehicle that will take over $35.3
        million of seasoned workers compensation liabilities. The deal,
        on behalf of an unnamed company, was arranged by specialty reinsurer
        MultiStrat, also based in Bermuda, along with its affiliate the
        Annapolis Consulting Group. Rachel Bardon, managing director of HSCM
        Bermuda, an arm of Hudson Structured Capital Management in the US, said:
        We are delighted to complete this transaction in this legacy block of
        business. Tim Tetlow, a partner in the firm, added: This
        transaction allows the cedant to move forward and focus on its
        future. And Michael Millette, managing partner of Hudson Structured,
        said that he hoped to do more business with MultiStrat in the future. We
        are pleased to collaborate with MultiStrat in this transaction. We have
        studied a series of options together and expert that this will be the
        first of many that we complete. Bob Forness, CEO of MultiStrat, said:
        The combination of the HSCM Bermuda teams expertise and our
        efforts over many months produced an attractive transaction and a
        template for the future. We look forward to working more with HSCM going
        forward. The news came as Hudson Structured and HSCM Bermuda
        announced that it had appointed former KPMG Bermuda managing director
        Jason Carne as an adviser focusing on valuation and reinsurance. Mr
        Carne said: I have been following them with interest for a while now
        and Im a firm believer that the next step for ILS is to bring a
        fuller spectrum of reinsurance risk and opportunities, including
        property, casualty and long-term business to the third party capital
        markets. He joins David Cash, former CEO of Endurance Specialty
        Holdings and Rich Carbone, ex-chief financial officer of Prudential
        Financial and current director of two further companies. Mr Millette
        said: Our board of advisers provides the firm with breadth and depth
        of experience and judgment that we rely upon. Jason is an exceptional
        addition to the team. Mr Carne worked at Hamilton-based KPMG for
        almost 20 years and was founder and leader of the firms
        insurance-linked securities practice. He also serves as a non-executive
        director for several Bermudian reinsurance companies. Hudson Structured
        and HSCM Bermuda invest across the risk and return spectrum in all
        instruments and sectors of the insurance and reinsurance markets. The
        board of advisers works as part of the HSCM Bermuda team to review
        strategy and investments.

ILS (Bermuda)
2017. June
        27. ILS (Bermuda) Ltd, organisers of Bermuda Convergence 2017 today
        announced the events first keynote speaker, author, journalist and
        consultant Dan Gardner. He co-authored his latest bestseller,
        Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction, where he makes the
        case that pundits are notoriously inaccurate at predicting the future,
        and that ordinary people make better prognostications with wide-ranging
        information gathering, thinking probabilistically, working in teams,
        keeping score, and being willing to admit error and change course. More
        than 300 delegates are expected to attend this years event on October
        18 and 19. Last year delegates came from 13 different countries attended
        the annual Bermuda Convergence event  a networking event covering the
        alternative reinsurance, insurance linked securities and collateralised
        reinsurance landscape Super-forecasting was chosen as one of the best
        books of 2015 by The Economist, Bloomberg, and Amazon. He first explored
        these findings in his book, Future Babble, which was termed required
        reading for journalists, politicians, academics, and anyone who listens
        to them, by Harvards experimental psychologist, Steven Pinker. Mr
        Gardner is also well known for his book on risk perception, Risk: The
        Science of Fear, where he examined fear of what might happen in the
        future, and its influence on behaviour. In 2016, Gardner became an
        adviser to the Prime Minister of Canada. Previously, he spent 17 years
        in newspaper journalism, where his work won every major award, including
        the National Newspaper Award, the Michener Award, and the Canadian
        Association of Journalists Award. Gardner has lectured widely on
        forecasting and risk for governments and businesses such as Google and
        Siemens, insurance companies and venture capital firms. He holds degrees
        in law and history. Greg Wojciechowski, CEO, Bermuda Stock Exchange, and
        ILS Bermuda chairman said Mr Gardners research and work will be
        interesting and valuable to our event attendees who enjoy the topic of
        risk and science of prediction. Bermuda is the world leader for the
        issuance of ILS catastrophe bonds, collateralised reinsurance and
        alternative risk transfer. ILS issuance volume was the largest ever in
        the first quarter of 2017, reaching $27.19 billion outstanding showing
        record-breaking growth. The Bermuda Stock Exchange listed 185 ILS
        vehicles with a market cap of $22.2 billion, over 80 per cent market
        share, during the same period. New risk capital is coming to market in
        record volume as investors continue to find ILS an attractive and
        diversifying asset class. Tim Tetlow, partner and chief operating
        officer at Hudson Capital Management, a member of the ILS Bermuda
        Thought Leadership and Education Work Stream said: Dan lectures
        around the world on forecasting, risk and decision-making. The ILS
        convergence space will be intrigued by his framework for the analysis of
        risk, complex information and prediction in real-world situations where
        traditional actuarial approaches might be less useful. As the ILS
        looks to new and innovative areas of risk, Dans insights can help in
        how we form models of what will happen in the future and how to think in
        terms of probabilities while also recognizing that everything is
        uncertain.

Intact
        Financial Corporation
2017. May
        3. Bermuda-based OneBeacon Insurance Group is to be bought by Canadian
        insurer Intact Financial Corporation in a $1.7 billion deal. The
        transaction will create a North American lender in speciality insurance
        with more than $1.5 billion of annual premiums. The two companies have
        entered into a definitive merger agreement, with Intact to acquire all
        outstanding OneBeacon shares for $18.10. Before the announcement,
        OneBeacons stock yesterday closed on the New York Stock Exchange at
        $15.70. In January, Bloomberg News reported that OneBeacon was thought
        to be exploring a sale. The speciality insurer is controlled by White
        Mountains Insurance Group Ltd, which owns 75.7 per cent of its total
        shares. In a statement released through the Bermuda Stock Exchange,
        White Mountains said it had entered into an agreement to vote in favour
        of Intacts acquisition. The company said it expects to receive $1.3
        billion from the transaction, which would increase its adjusted book
        value to about $107 per share. OneBeacon, which has its corporate
        headquarters on Reid Street, said the transaction would bolster
        Intacts Canadian business with new products and cross-border
        capabilities, and better positions the company to compete with North
        American insurers. Mike Miller, chief executive officer of OneBeacon,
        said: We are all very excited to join the Intact family. The
        opportunity to leverage Intacts deep technical, financial and
        technology capabilities makes this combination the perfect next step in
        the OneBeacon journey. Together, we will accelerate our pursuit in
        creating a leading speciality insurer in North America. We look forward
        to working with our US and Canadian independent agents and brokers to
        deliver market-leading capabilities to our targeted customers. Both
        companies are dedicated to ensuring a seamless transition and look
        forward to profitably growing our speciality portfolio going forward.
        While Charles Brindamour, CEO of Intact, said: Today, weve taken
        an important step in building a world-class P&C insurer. The
        addition of OneBeacon is creating a leading North American speciality
        lines insurer focused on small-to-midsize businesses. OneBeacon is a
        strong strategic fit for Intact, with deep expertise in commercial and
        speciality lines, and shared values. We see significant growth potential
        from the combination of our speciality lines operations and we look
        forward to welcoming OneBeacon employees to the Intact family. The
        transaction, which was unanimously approved by OneBeacons board of
        directors, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017. It is
        subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.

        292-8300. World's largest provider of fixed satellite services. Formed
        in 1964 to provide global communications to
        non-communist countries. In late 2007 the
        Federal Communications Commission approved a $16.4 billion deal in
        which satellite company Intelsat Holdings will become privately owned.
Intelsat
        Holdings is the parent company, the world's largest provider of fixed
        satellite services. It is being acquired by Serafina Holdings, also
        Bermuda-based, an investment vehicle primarily owned by private equity
        firm BC Partners Ltd which owns 71 percent of Serafina, and therefore
        have a controlling interest in Intelsat. The largest single investor in
        Serafina, through its investment in BC Partners' funds, is the Ontario
        Teachers' Pension Plan Board. It owns about 11.5 percent of Serafina. In
        March 2009 it was announced Intelsat is
        set to expand its global reach to millions of viewers in North America
        with the launch of an additional television programming platform on its
        Galaxy 19 satellite. The fixed
        satellite services provider announced that RRsat Global Communications
        Network Ltd., a global provider of comprehensive content management and
        distribution services to the television and radio broadcasting
        industries, launched the new platform, operated
        from its Hawley Teleport in Pike County, Pennsylvania. Intelsat's
        Galaxy 19 satellite, which hosts the largest ethnic video platform in
        North America, distributing almost 180 international channels, is
        located at 97 W. RRsat leverages this capacity to distribute
        regional programming into the US cable market and Canada's DTH
        community. l Intelsat and International
        Launch Services (ILS) signed a contract for the launch of the Intelsat
        16 satellite on an ILS Proton. The
        satellite, built by Orbital Sciences, was delivered to the Baikonur
        Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan in late 2009. Intelsat
        16 is a 2,500-kilogramme satellite placed at the orbital
        location of 58 degrees west longitude. It  provides high power
        Ku-band capacity to support expanded services to direct-to-home
        customers in Latin America.

        General Group Holdings
2016. March
        15. International General Insurance Holdings Limited reported net
        earnings of $35 million for 2015, an increase of 2 per cent from the
        $34.3 million from 2014. The group, which is registered in the Dubai
        International Financial Centre, has its primary underwriting operations
        in Bermuda in the form of class 3B insurer IGI Bermuda. It also has
        units in Jordan, Malaysia, Morocco and a wholly owned subsidiary in the
        UK. Gross premiums and investment income were both slightly down, but
        the groups combined ratio improved to 84.3 per cent from 86.9 per
        cent in 2014, while shareholders equity grew to $284.9 million at the
        end of 2015 from $263.2 million a year earlier. Wasef Jabsheh,
        vice-chairman and chief executive officer of IGIH, said: 2015 was
        another good year for IGI in which our team was able to deliver an
        improved profit over 2014. The continued competitive trading environment
        coupled with further excess capacity and another benign year had kept
        the pressure on rates. Our underwriting teams maintained their focus
        on profitable business whilst keeping the discipline needed to navigate
        through these very challenging times. It should be noted that our gross
        written premiums had declined from $252 million in 2014 to $242 million
        in 2015, however, our net underwriting profit increased from $50 million
        to $53 million demonstrating our focus on the bottom line whilst
        insuring that we maintain our service standards to our clients and
        brokers. The year saw our loss ratios drop from 53 per cent in 2014 to
        45 per cent in 2015 giving us a 3 per cent drop in our combined ratio to
        84 per cent. 2015 was a year where we invested in the future by
        opening of our new Casablanca operation and the further strengthening
        our existing underwriting teams and platforms. In addition, I am pleased
        to announce that our UK and Bermuda entities are now Solvency II
        compliant.

        rights to Morgan Creeks international library filed on December 30,
        2011 for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. It already had filed in May
        2011 for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection. Under Chapter 15, Inverness
        was shielded from lawsuits from creditors in the US. The new status will
        let Inverness, now run by liquidators who were appointed by officials in
        Bermuda, file lawsuits in the US. Court filings at the time showed that
        Inverness had liabilities of between $50 million and $100 million and
        had fewer than 50 creditors. Among the films on which Inverness has
        foreign rights are The Last of the Mohicans and Ace Ventura:
        Pet Detective. Inverness was formerly known as Morgan Creek
        International. From 2004 until the bankruptcy filing its sole
        stockholder and president was James Robinson. He produced Ace
        Ventura, Last of the Mohicans, Young Guns and Robin
        Hood: Prince of Thieves.

IPOC
        International Growth Fund
In
        early 2006, the Wall Street Journal revealed that the mutual fund had
        been set up on the Island five years ago by a convicted fraudster. It
        was alleged that it was effectively a holding company for around $1
        billion in telecommunications assets transferred through a network of
        shell companies. The WSJ said the scandal went all the way up to the
        Russian IT and Communications Minister Leonid Reiman. IPOC includes two
        other Bermuda companies, Comitas and Honestas. The
        Bermuda Government has moved to wind up the fund and eight affiliated
        companies remains active. The suit will rumble through the Island's
        courts from most of 2008. In a separate
        legal move, prosecutors in the British Virgin Islands are reported to
        have launched a criminal probe in Ipoc's activities over claims that $40
        million of court fees paid by the company were the "proceeds of
        crime." There
        is a claim that Russia's telecommunications minister Leonid Reiman is
        the ultimate beneficial owner of Ipoc. Mr. Reiman has denied this claim,
        according to a report in the UK's Financial Times.


Ironshore
Since
        2006. 141 Front Street, Hamilton. A
        specialty lines insurance and reinsurance managing general agency.

2017. May 4. Like a
        prize in a game of pass the parcel, Ironshore Inc switched hands this
        week for the second time in two years. But it is all good, according
        to Mitch Blaser, chief executive officer of Ironshore Bermuda. It is
        fantastic news for Ironshore overall, he said, a day after it was
        announced that Liberty Mutual Insurances $3 billion acquisition of
        Ironshore has been completed. The fact that Liberty Mutual has
        confidence in our brand and our operations to integrate their US
        operations into ours  that was a very strong vote of confidence in
        the strength of our brand and our business model, said Mr Mitch. He
        was referring to Liberty Mutuals decision to combine its existing
        Liberty International Underwriters US business and Ironshores US
        specialty lines business under the Ironshore brand. Clearly the
        retention of the Ironshore brand is another favorable aspect to our
        operations in the US, Bermuda and internationally. He is not alone in
        his positive outlook for Ironshore under Liberty Mutuals ownership.
        Ratings services have also weighed in. On Tuesday, AM Best removed
        Ironshore from under review and affirmed its A rating, while
        Moodys lifted a number of its ratings of Ironshore segments to
        A2. Two years ago Ironshore was bought by Shanghai-based Fosun
        International. The global investment group then opted to sell the
        insurer last December to Liberty Mutual as it offloaded assets to
        enhance its financial flexibility. When asked if another change of
        ownership in such a short period of time was unsettling, Mr Blaser said:
        Weve been very fortunate because Fosun was a fantastic owner. They
        bought us with the idea to build the franchise and have us run as an
        independent entity, so the impact on our people was minimal
        post-acquisition. Now we have been fortunate again to have a company
        with the breadth and depth of Liberty Mutual buy us with the intention
        of keeping the brand intact and building on our franchise. From a
        business standpoint, and an underwriting standpoint, weve been very
        fortunate and the disruption as a result has been minimal. Our people
        are very enthusiastic about this latest change in ownership, and very
        motivated to grow the company. Ironshore, which has offices in 34
        countries, was formed in 2006 in the wake of the catastrophic losses
        caused by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. In Bermuda it has offices
        on Front Street. There have been no announced changes to the companys
        operations on the island as a result of the acquisition. Mr Blaser sees
        opportunities to strengthen Ironshores operations in Bermuda and
        globally. It provides us with the platform with a very strong parent
        company, and balance sheet, to continue to expand our operations and
        build out the specialty businesses of Ironshore as part of Liberty
        Mutual, which will bode well for our Bermuda operations. He said
        Ironshore Bermuda will see opportunities to cross-sell to Liberty
        Mutuals client base. Mr Blaser, who is also COO of Ironshore Inc,
        added: In addition, as of today we are globally a US company with so
        many of our clients and client-base emanating out of the US. From a
        Bermuda standpoint the closure of this deal provides for a growth
        platform in terms of the strength of our balance sheet, the strength of
        our ratings, access to the client base of Liberty Mutual and the
        strength of the resources that Liberty Mutual brings to Ironshore
        Bermuda and the rest of Ironshore. The combination of Ironshore and
        Liberty Mutual has created a global specialty business with about $6.5
        billion in net written premiums. When asked if he thought mergers and
        acquisitions in the insurance and reinsurance sector would continue,
        with companies morphing into larger entities, Mr Blaser said: Yes, it
        will continue. I dont know if this is the beginning or the middle,
        its certainly not the end. Its very difficult for businesses in
        our industry to survive without the scale of resources and a strong
        balance sheet behind them. This type of consolidation has been evident
        in the reinsurance space probably for over five years. Now you are
        seeing it in the insurance space as well. He said that when capacity
        is widely available and it becomes difficult for a company to
        differentiate itself from competitors, then having a strong financial
        rating and balance sheet are increasingly important factors for clients
        and brokers deciding where to place business. Those advantages and
        those resources help differentiate yourself with the customer and are
        the most important features today. That will force more
        consolidation. Ironshore is the official insurer of Americas Cup
        defender Oracle Team USA. Looking ahead to the competition, which starts
        at the end of this month, Mr Blaser said: We are very much plugged
        into and excited about the potential of the Americas Cup for Bermuda,
        not only as a sponsor, but to support it in any way possible.
2016. December 6. The
        Chinese owner of Ironshore has agreed to sell the Bermudian-based
        insurer to US giant Liberty Mutual in a $3 billion deal. The US
        company, which struck the deal with Shanghai-based Fosun International,
        said it planned to let Ironshore operate with the same management
        team and brand, but as part of the larger Liberty Mutual organisation,
        which has a focus on growing its specialty lines operations. And
        Mitch Blaser, CEO of the Bermuda arm of Ironshore, said the move could
        mean an expansion and more jobs for the island operation. Mr Blaser
        said: If anything, from a business perspective, we would expect to
        see the opportunity to expand, taking advantage of the Liberty Mutual
        resources, global client base and infrastructure. He added:
        Liberty Mutual does not have a Bermuda operation, so Ironshore will
        become the Liberty Mutual and Ironshore Bermuda operation. Mr Blaser
        said the nuts and bolts of the deal had still to be negotiated, so any
        changes could not be expected in the short term. But he added: Our
        goal is to grow our Bermuda business  thats a joint goal for
        Ironshore and Liberty Mutual. Mr Blaser said: We see this as a big
        positive for our global business and we also believe its a very big
        positive for Bermuda. When you are a Bermuda company, you are very
        restricted in being able to do business in other jurisdictions. When you
        are a US company, you have freedom to do business in the United States
        because you are paying taxes in the United States. David Long,
        Liberty Mutual chairman and chief executive officer, said: We are
        pleased to have Ironshore and its proven management team led by CEO
        Kevin Kelley join Liberty Mutual. Ironshore has a track record of
        profitably underwriting global and diverse specialty risks insurance and
        is an ideal complement to Liberty Mutual, providing additional scale,
        expertise, innovation and market relationships to our $5 billion global
        specialty business. Kevin Kelley, Ironshore CEO, added: The
        combination of Ironshore and Liberty Mutual is a win-win proposition and
        value creating for both companies. Ironshore will become part of a
        another A-rated company with a global reach, a strong balance sheet,
        wide client base and a much greater capacity to drive profitable
        growth. And he said the deal was beneficial for all three parties
        involved and is the culmination of a careful and considered process. We
        have aimed for the best possible outcome for our employees, clients and
        business partners and are confident this transaction achieves these
        goals and more. Ironshore, founded in 2006, had gross premiums
        written in 2015 of $2.2 billion and is one of the top ten excess and
        surplus lines insurers in the US. The company has around 800 employees
        spread across 15 countries worldwide and is organized into three
        operating hubs in Bermuda, the US and London. Liberty, like Ironshore,
        has an A rating from agency AM Best, and more than $120 billion in
        assets. Ironshore was taken over by Fosun, which already had a 20 per
        cent stake, a little more than two years ago. The Liberty Mutual deal is
        expected to close in the first half of next year, subject to approvals
        by regulators and other conditions.
2016. July 23. NEW
        YORK (Bloomberg)  Ironshore Inc, the insurer purchased by Chinese
        conglomerate Fosun International last year, has filed for an initial
        public offering in the US. The company filed with an initial
        offering size of $100 million, an amount used to calculate fees that
        will change. Fosun will receive all of the proceeds from the offering,
        the filing shows. In December, ratings firm AM Best announced a review
        of Ironshore, and in June assigned a negative outlook on the company
        because of the drag related to the credit profile and high debt
        leverage measures of Ironshores ultimate parent. For insurance
        companies, downgrades can make it harder to win customers. Ironshore
        provides specialty commercial insurance coverage, protecting
        policyholders against environmental and political risks and offering
        liability coverage to corporate executives and healthcare providers. The
        company previously filed to go public in 2014. Last year, Fosun  the
        investment arm of Chinas biggest closely held conglomerate, led by
        billionaire chairman Guo Guangchang  announced its plans for a $1.84
        billion merger with Ironshore by buying up the shares it didnt
        already own. Fosun also considered pursuing a sale of Ironshore, a
        person familiar with the matter said earlier this year. In June, the
        parent company submitted an application seeking approval for a proposed
        spin-off and US listing of the business, according to a filing in Hong
        Kong. Ironshore was founded in December 2006 with more than $1 billion
        in private equity backing. Two years later, chief executive officer
        Kevin Kelley and president Shaun Kelly joined the property-and-casualty
        insurer from American International Group.
2016. June 10. The
        acquisition of Bermuda-based Ironshore by Chinese conglomerate Fosun
        International is to be scrutinized in the US on national security
        grounds. The Shanghai-based company, headed by billionaire Guo
        Guangchang, is to appear before the US Federal Committee on Foreign
        Investment in the United States, which is reviewing the purchase. In a
        statement posted on its website, the Chinese insurer said that both it
        and Ironshore have voluntarily notified CFIUS regarding Fosuns
        acquisition of Ironshore, a US-based provider of casualty and speciality
        lines of insurance. The parties have been working closely with CFIUS
        and providing CFIUS with all the information it needs for its
        considerations. CFIUS is an inter-agency committee authorised to
        review transactions that could result in control of a US business by a
        foreign person in order to determine the effect of such transactions on
        the national security of the United States, according to the CFIUS
        website. A spokeswoman for the committee declined to comment on any
        review of Fosuns acquisition of Ironshore. Fosun International bought
        Ironshore at the end of last year for $1.84 billion. Ironshore was
        founded in Bermuda ten years ago with $1 billion in capital. It has
        expanded globally since, with around 30 offices in the US, Canada,
        China, Britain, Ireland, Japan Singapore, Australia and Dubai and writes
        around $2.3 billion in premiums a year.
2015. November 23. 
        Chinese investment firm Fosun International Ltd has completed the
        acquisition of the remaining 80 per cent equity interest in
        Bermuda-based insurer Ironshore. The Shanghai-based firm, headed by
        billionaire Guo Guangchang, bought 20 per cent of Ironshore in February
        this year. In May the two companies announced that Fosun would acquire
        all remaining Ironshore shares. In a statement released late on Sunday,
        Fosun said it had received approvals from all relevant regulatory
        authorities in the US, the UK and other jurisdictions for its
        acquisition of the remaining 80 per cent ownership interest in
        Ironshore, by way of the merger. Fosun has made clear its support for
        the Ironshore management team and that it views its investment in the
        insurer as a long-term commitment. Ironshore is pleased to jointly
        announce the completion of the merger transaction with Fosun, which will
        enable us to continue to build upon our international specialty platform
        and enhance our global brand, Kevin Kelley, chief executive officer
        of Ironshore, said. Fosuns financial strength and established
        investment management approach provides long-term strategic capital to
        bolster Ironshores expansion strategy and further adds to
        Ironshores uniqueness. With our new owner, Ironshore is well
        positioned for the future as a global insurance industry leader. Mr
        Guangchang, chairman of Fosun, said: Ironshores excellent team has
        outstanding managing and underwriting insurance capabilities which are
        widely recognized in the insurance industry. Ironshore has the
        capability to provide its clients with comprehensive and quality
        specialty insurance products. The successful completion of this
        transaction marks a historic milestone for Fosuns investments in the
        specialty insurance industry as well as the American financial-service
        sector, which significantly boosts our insurance-oriented comprehensive
        financial capabilities. Fosun has other investments in insurance
        companies including Yongan P&C Insurance, Pramerica Fosun Life
        Insurance, Peak Reinsurance, Fidelidade Group and MIG. The investment
        firm intends that these companies work together where it is
        advantageous. Now and in the coming year, Fosun will strengthen its
        integration and collaboration efforts, seeking to establish a
        cross-region and cross-industry global insurance and financial group,
        Mr Guanchang said. We encourage our invested companies to collaborate
        wherever applicable, seeking to connect them to Fosuns resources with
        our global insurance and finance platforms to enhance their
        competitiveness in their respective industries.
2015. October 14.
        Bermuda-based insurer Ironshore has been named the official insurer for
        Oracle Team USA for the 35th Americas Cup. Ironshore will provide
        comprehensive insurance coverage for the team, from the Louis Vuitton
        Americas Cup World Series Bermuda regatta, taking place this weekend,
        through the Americas Cup finals in Hamilton, Bermuda in June 2017.
        Ironshore is pleased to be a sponsor and the official insurer of
        Oracle Team USA, defender of the 35th Americas Cup, Mitch Blaser,
        chief operating officer of Ironshore and chief executive officer of
        Ironshores Bermuda office. Hosting the Americas Cup in 2017
        will be a fantastic achievement for Bermuda with legacy benefits for
        years to come. We are proud to support Bermuda and Oracle Team USA
        during this extraordinary chapter in Bermudas history. Ironshore,
        a Bermuda-based specialty insurance firm established on the Island in
        2006, provides specialty property and casualty insurance products. As
        the official insurer for the Oracle team, Ironshores coverage
        includes marine, cargo, travel, umbrella liability, property, casualty
        and personal accident insurance. The Oracle teams operations are
        based in Dockyard and its team of sailors, designers, shore crew and
        support personnel live and train in Bermuda in preparation for the
        finals in 2017. Were happy to partner with Ironshore, a company
        that knows Bermuda and understands the industry we work in, Grant
        Simmer, general manager and chief operating officer for Oracle Team USA,
        said. Ironshore has tailored its coverage to protect our risks both
        on and off the Island, giving us peace of mind as we continue our
        preparations to defend the Americas Cup in 2017.
2015. September 11. 
        Fosun International Ltd, which agreed a $1.84 billion deal to buy
        Bermuda-based insurer Ironshore earlier this year, aims to build up
        funds for more acquisitions. The Shanghai-based investment firm,
        backed by Chinese billionaire Guo Guangchang, proposed raising HK$11.7
        billion ($1.5 billion) in a rights offer to fund its push into the
        banking and insurance industries. The company plans to sell as many as
        871.3 million new shares at HK$13.42 each, the closing price in Hong
        Kong on Thursday, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing.
        Holders can buy 56 new shares for every 500 they now own. Fosun will use
        the money for general corporate purposes including mergers and
        acquisitions in the banking and insurance industry and repayment of
        loans, according to the filing. The company has spent $5.7 billion
        acquiring insurance assets in the past two years, according to data
        compiled by Bloomberg, as part of a shopping spree spanning Australian
        energy companies to New York City office buildings. The deal to buy
        Ironshore was announced in May. In July, Fosun made a hostile $545.5
        million offer for BHF Kleinwort Benson Group SA, and agreed to buy
        German private bank Hauck & Aufhaeuser Privatbankiers KGaA for as
        much as 210 million euros ($237 million).
 2015. May 4. Ironshore has agreed to be acquired by Chinese investment
        firm Fosun International Ltd. It reached an agreement to sell to Fosun
        the four-fifths of the company that the Shanghai-based firm does not
        already own. Fosun completed its acquisition of a 20 per cent stake in
        privately held Ironshore only in February this year. Ironshore has
        created a global specialty insurance platform. Last year, it applied to
        hold an initial public offering (IPO) of shares, but the plans to go
        public were put on hold after Fosun came in to buy a one-fifth stake. As
        of last year, Ironshore had total net assets of $1.84 billion. Fosun
        Group is backed by Chinese billionaire Guo Guangchang, its chairman. In
        a statement released through the Hong Kong Stock Exchange the previous
        day, Fosun said its Mettlesome Investment 2 unit will combine with
        Ironshore to expand its presence in the insurance business. The
        acquisition of the remaining interest in Ironshore will be effected by
        the merger of an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Fosun International
        Ltd with and into Ironshore, with Ironshore as the surviving company.
        After giving effect to the merger, Ironshore will be an indirect
        wholly-owned subsidiary of Fosun International Ltt. As well as its
        property insurance business and its Iron-Starr Excess Agency joint
        venture with Starr Insurance & Reinsurance and Hamilton Re in
        Bermuda, Ironshore has multiple operations in North America, Asia and
        Europe, and underwrites through the Pembroke Syndicate 4000 on the
        Lloyds of London market. Fosun, founded in 1992 and listed in Hong
        Kong since 2007, is a massive conglomerate with substantial interests in
        steel, property development and pharmaceuticals, as well as insurance,
        which provides around 13 per cent of its revenue, Fosun has more than
        one third of its total assets invested in insurance businesses. Fosun
        owns Peak Re, a Hong Kong-based reinsurer launched in late 2012, which
        focuses on Asia-Pacific region business. In December last year, Fosun
        entered into a deal to acquire Michigan-based Meadowbrook Insurance
        Group for $433 million. It was also reported to be in the bidding for
        Montpelier Re, before the reinsurer agreed to be bought out by Bermuda
        rival Endurance Specialty Holdings in a $1.8 billion deal. Ironshores
        long-term investors have included Calera Capital, Corporate Partners,
        GCP Capital, GTCR, Irving Place Capital, Tara Partners and TowerBrook
        Capital. Citigroup and Bank of America were Ironshores bankers on the
        deal, and the company got legal advice from Cahill Gordon & Reindel
        and Kirkland & Ellis. PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst & Young
        worked with Fosun, which got legal advice from DLA Piper. In February 2013. it closed
        a deal that will make Chinese investment firm Fosun International Ltd
        the firm's biggest shareholder.

James River
        Group Holdings
Moved to
        Bermuda from North Carolina in 2007.
2017.
        February 17. James River Group Holdings Ltds profits surged in the
        fourth quarter, propelled by a 60 per cent growth in gross premiums
        written. The Bermuda-based re/insurer recorded net income of $25.7
        million for the three months ended December 31 and a record $74.5
        million for the full year 2016. Operating earnings per share totaled 77
        cents surpassing the 65 cents forecast of analysts tracked by Yahoo
        Finance. The companys shares rose more than 3 per cent in New York
        Stock Exchange trading yesterday in response to the Wednesday night
        release of the results. During the fourth quarter gross premiums rose to
        $173.5 million from $108.7 million in the corresponding period in 2015.
        The biggest contributing factor was the specialty admitted insurance
        segment, which wrote $63.2 million in premiums, more than double the
        prior-year quarters total. James Rivers largest segment is excess
        and surplus lines, in which premium grew nearly 25 per cent to $91.4
        million. Its casualty reinsurance unit, which is based at the
        companys head office in Wellesley House on Pitts Bay Road, saw gross
        premiums grow by 207 per cent from the previous year to $18.8 million.
        For the full year, gross premiums written grew 28.9 per cent to $737.4
        million, while the combined ratio  the proportion of premium dollars
        spent on claims and expenses was 94.3 per cent. Net operating income per
        share for 2016 was $2.39, up from $2.08 in 2015. J. Adam Abram, chairman
        and chief executive officer of James River Group, said: Our team
        continues to drive strong risk adjusted returns for our shareholders.
        Our full year 14.6 per cent adjusted operating return on tangible equity
        and 94.3 per cent combined ratio demonstrate the strength of our
        franchise. We believe we are well positioned for continued success in
        2017. In its guidance for 2017, the company said it expected to
        generate a 12 per cent or better operating return on average tangible
        equity for the year and a combined ratio of between 92 per cent and 95
        per cent.

        2015. January 16. Global insurance manager Kane SAC listed a total of
        $125.8 million in new notes on the Bermuda Stock Exchange. The cash is
        spread over four segregated accounts  called Exeter, Troon, Muirfield
        and Hereford  worth between $16.8 million and $54.8 million each.
        Kane SAC made the issues as part of its limited note programme, the
        firms independent private catastrophe bond platform. Robert Eastham,
        managing director of Kane (Bermuda), said: The announcement of four
        new issuances on the Kane SAC platform serves to demonstrate that the

        transact smaller capital market deals in an efficient and cost-effective
        manner. We expect to see strong growth in this area moving forward given
        the growing influence of the investment community in the insurance
        arena. The new notes brings the total Kane has listed as part of its
        catastrophe bond platform to 11 since its launch in August 2013.

        than $25 billion in assets under management. Another $50 million will

Kiskadee 1

Kiskadee
        Communications (Bermuda)
2/14/2003. Owned by local and non-Bermudian
        business interests including local legislators. Its lawyers are Appleby
        Spurling & Hunter. In early 2011 sued
        two officers of ProtoStar Ltd for $18.25 million in compensatory
        damages. Kiskadee's principal shareholders are Bermudian businessman
        Jeffrey Conyers and David Mallof, of Washington, DC, according to the
        complaint, filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of
        California. Kiskadee's complaint was lodged against California resident
        Philip Father and Maryland resident Eugene Cacciamani, who served as
        chairman and chief technology officer, respectively, of ProtoStar.
        Kiskadee had formed a joint venture with ProtoStar, aiming to utilise
        one of Bermuda's potentially lucrative satellite location slots, which
        were granted to Bermuda in 1983 by the United Nations and International
        Telecommunications Union. The complaint revealed Kiskadee was granted an
        exclusivity agreement on a satellite slot by the Bermuda Government. But
        after ProtoStar filed for bankruptcy and its joint venture with Kiskadee
        failed, Government terminated the exclusivity deal in June 2010.
        Kiskadee formed a joint venture with ProtoStar in October 2008 to
        implement Kiskadee's extremely valuable exclusive right to commercialize
        a satellite orbital location, positioned over the center of North
        America, that is controlled under international treaty and assignment by
        the Government of Bermuda. The joint venture entity, also incorporated
        in Bermuda and known as ProtoStar Kiskadee (Bermuda) Ltd., is 75 percent
        owned and controlled by ProtoStar. Mid-Ocean News revealed in 2005 that
        Kiskadee had started talks with Government over the Island's satellite
        slot in July 2001.


Kiskadee
        Diversified Fund
 2015 January
        21.  New investment has boosted the assets in Hiscox's
        Bermuda-based Kiskadee insurance-linked strategies funds to more than
        $400 million. And Hiscox said investors have committed to inject
        more capital by the time reinsurance renewals take place next summer.
        The two open-ended funds, Kiskadee Diversified Fund Ltd and Kiskadee
        Select Fund Ltd, are based in Bermuda. Their connection with Hiscox, the
        insurer said in a statement, "offers investors greater capital
        efficiency and market access than traditional direct collateralised ILS
        funds". Fellow Bermuda reinsurer Third Point Reinsurance Ltd is one
        of those to express interest in Kiskadee. In announcing in December 2014
        that it would wind down its role in its catastrophe fund, Third Point Re
        said it would earmark funds to Kiskadee. "Our Kiskadee funds
        combine superior risk selection with diversified market access provided
        by the Hiscox Group," Jeremy Pinchin, chief executive officer of
        Hiscox Re, said in a statement. "We believe this is a truly
        distinctive offering and so are pleased at the enthusiastic response
        from new and existing investors." Kiskadee Investment Managers, a
        wholly owned subsidiary of Hiscox, provides tailored investment
        offerings as well as funds aimed at single investors. Third-party
        capital, in the form of insurance-linked securities such as catastrophe
        bonds, as well as collateralised reinsurance, has claimed a growing
        market share and applied downward pressure to reinsurance rates. Hiscox
        is one of the reinsurers to embrace the alternative capital rather than
        view it as a threat, by setting up its own ILS management operation.

Klein
Since 2011. 
        Represented by Bermuda legal firm Wakefield Quin. It recently paid
        millions of dollars to charity Sea Change Foundation, which supports
        prominent US environmentalist groups like the Sierra Club. The latter
        launched a campaign called Beyond Natural Gas in 2012 to fight fracking,
        the use of high pressure water mixed with sand and chemicals to break
        open rock and release gas and petroleum and natural gas extraction.
        Widespread use of the technique in the US has reduced the need for
        imports further damaging the struggling Russian economy. Klein's
        activities were noted by the US Senate Environment and Public Works
        Committee in 2014. Klein Ltd is run by California-based hedge fund
        millionaire Nathaniel Simons. 
2017. July 13.
        Republican lawmakers in the United States have called for an
        investigation into a Bermuda-based firm they accuse of using Russian
        money to disrupt the fracking industry. However, Wakefield Quin, who
        represent the company, called the allegations completely false,
        adding that the company has no Russian connection whatsoever.
        Attorneys, law firms, financial institutions and all other companies
        based in Bermuda operate under a regulatory and anti-money laundering
        regime which applies standards which are among the highest in the
        world, a spokesman said. Illicit movement of funds falls well
        below such standards and any informed party would understand that. Not
        only is there no substance or truth to such allegations in this case,
        the allegations appear to be intended to damage the reputation of the
        Bermuda-based individuals and businesses named. According to the
        Washington Times, House Science, Space and Technology Committee
        chairman Lamar Smith and energy sub-committee chairman Randy Weber have
        urged Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to investigate claims that
        Russia has been funding a propaganda campaign against fossil
        fuels. In a statement, Mr Smith said Russia had been using
        Bermudian-based shell companies to support US environmental groups
        targeting hydraulic fracking. This scheme may violate federal law and
        certainly distorts the US energy market, he said. The American
        people deserve to know the truth and I am confident Secretary Mnuchin
        will investigate the allegations. The Republicans noted claims that
        Russian entities may have used Bermuda-based Klein Ltd to fund the Sea
        Change Foundation in San Francisco, which in turn provided support for
        anti-fracking groups such as the Sierra Club. Russian government and
        complicit parties have executed a political agenda with little or no
        paper trail, the letter stated. By incorporating in Bermuda, Klein
        is not required to disclose its donors identities or countries of
        origin. Claims that Klein has been using Russian funds to support
        anti-fracking organisations arose in 2014 when a report by the US Senate
        Environment and Public Works Committee raised concerns. The
        committees report on Klein  which includes a reference to local
        law firm Wakefield Quins  said: None of this foreign
        corporations funding is disclosed in any way. This is clearly a
        deceitful way to hide the source of millions of dollars that are active
        in our system, attempting to effect political change. In a statement,
        Wakefield Quin fiercely denied the allegations, calling the claims
        completely false and irresponsible. A spokesman said: Our firm
        has represented Klein since its inception, and we can state
        categorically that at no point did this philanthropic organisation
        receive or expend funds from Russian sources or Russian-connected
        sources and Klein has no Russian connection whatsoever. The spokesman
        also noted that Bermuda and the US had an information exchange framework
        in place that allows the US Government, regulators and law enforcement
        agencies to have access concerning financial transactions in Bermuda and
        by Bermuda entities. Through this framework, information is available
        to such proper authorities, enabling them to be satisfied as to the
        probity of any alleged payments, he added. Making false
        allegations about such payments is actionable and Wakefield Quin Limited
        will take such steps as it deems appropriate to prevent the distribution
        and dissemination of such falsehoods. Klein Ltd was incorporated in
        Bermuda in 2011 exclusively for philanthropic purposes and a
        statement to the Registrar of Companies said that none of the earnings
        would go to private shareholders or individuals and that it did not
        propose to carry out business on the island.

Lancashire
        Holdings
10/2/2005.
        See below.
2017. February 16.
        Bermuda-based Lancashire Holdings has reported after tax profits for the
        last three months of 2016 at $51.1 million and $153.8 million for the
        full year, both down on the same figures in 2015. The fourth-quarter
        drop was about $3 million compared to the same period in 2015, while the
        full year figure was down $27.3 million. The company noted that the
        insurance market remains challenging, although it is seizing
        opportunities when its find them. One such area is the reinsurance
        market, which is similarly being squeezed. By purchasing additional
        reinsurance, and securing attachments at lower loss levels, Lancashire
        has reduced its risk levels to the lowest point in its history.
        Lancashire Holdings CEO Alex Maloney said last year had proved to be a
        turbulent one for the global political and macroeconomic environment.
        Risk capital remains abundant, and there is continuing pressure upon
        pricing and terms and conditions. Against this background I am
        particularly pleased with the results for both the fourth quarter and
        the full year. The return on equity of 2.8 per cent for the quarter and
        13.5 per cent for the year is an exceptional outcome in this environment
        and a tribute to the dedication and hard work of everyone across the
        business. Lancashires gross written premiums for the quarter were
        $95.1 million, a drop of $2 million on the same period the previous
        year, while for the full year they were $633.9 million, down from $641.1
        million in 2015. The companys combined ratio for the year was 76.5
        per cent, up from 72.1 per cent. In an earnings statement, Mr Maloney
        said: Our principal focus has been to balance risk and return whilst
        serving the needs of our clients and their brokers. These results prove
        that, even in the current difficult times, we have relevance, our model
        works and is resilient. At 1 January, in line with our expectations and
        previous communication, we successfully renewed our core book across the
        Group, including at our Lloyds platform. He said the company had
        been rebuilding and reinvigorating its Lloyds platform. Looking
        ahead, he said: Whilst we expect market conditions to remain
        difficult for the foreseeable future, which requires discipline and
        patience to navigate, our strategy has the ability to respond across the
        insurance cycle. We are well equipped to meet the needs of our clients
        and to generate acceptable returns for investors, whilst having the
        flexibility to capitalize quickly on new opportunities as they arise.
        Lancashires operating earnings per diluted share was 23 cents for the
        fourth-quarter, which was flat compared to the same period in 2015. For
        the full year it was 71 cents, down from 87 cents in 2015. The
        companys ceded reinsurance premiums increased by $15.8 million, or
        9.9 per cent, during the year as Lancashire and its Lloyds member
        Cathedral Underwriting, bought more reinsurance limit. They added new
        layers, attaching at lower loss levels for around the same outlay,
        according to the company report. Elaine Whelan, group chief financial
        officer, said: Our outlook for 2017 is for a continuation of current
        market trends. At 1 January we have once again been able to further
        reduce our exposure levels with additional reinsurance purchases, and
        our risk levels are lower now than at any other point in our history. We
        are therefore carrying a bit more of a capital buffer than we typically
        would, which gives us the ability to take advantage of any opportunities
        that may materialize this year. Within the Lancashire group are
        Bermuda-based Lancashire Insurance Company and Kinesis Capital
        Management, together with Lancashire Insurance Company (UK), and
        Cathedral Underwriting Ltd.
2016. November 4.
        Insurer and reinsurer Bermuda-based Lancashire yesterday posted pre-tax
        profits of $42.9 million. The figure is $10 million up on the same
        period last year. Gross premiums written dropped $12.2 million to $108.2
        million quarter on quarter between last year and this. And earnings per
        share rose four cents to $1.21 per diluted share in the third quarter.
        Alex Maloney, group CEO, said: The groups results for the third
        quarter have once again been strong. Our return on equity of 3.1 per
        cent for the quarter and 10.5 per cent for the year to date demonstrate
        our ability to deliver excellent results throughout the insurance cycle
        and during challenging market conditions. These results are a tribute to
        the quality of our people throughout the group and an illustration of
        the fruits of disciplined underwriting and prudent risk selection. Mr
        Maloney added that Hurricane Matthew, which devastated parts of the
        Caribbean, particularly Haiti, before striking Florida, Georgia and the
        Carolinas, fell outside the financial reporting period. But he said:
        However, as an insured event affecting the US, the level of insured
        damage was less than it might have been in other circumstances. Matthew
        is an attritional loss for the insurance sector as a whole, certainly
        not of a size to constitute the market-moving event which sooner or
        later will occur. However, it is a timely reminder of the volatility and
        unpredictability of loss events in our industry and will contribute to
        the further erosion of margins and profitability across the sector.
        Elaine Whelan, Lancashire chief financial officer, added: Our outlook
        for 2017 is a continuation of current market trends. However, we expect
        to be able to maintain our core book and consequently operate at a
        similar capital level to this year. We are therefore returning
        approximately $150 million of capital via a special dividend. That
        represents $121.7 million of comprehensive income for the year to date.
        We have now returned $2.7 billion, or 104.9 per cent of total
        comprehensive income, since inception.
2016. July 27.
        Lancashire Holdings made after-tax profits of $31.5 million for the
        second quarter of the year  down $7.4 million on the same quarter
        last year. Gross premiums written for the period totaled $199.8
        million, an increase of $20.5 million on the $179.3 million recorded for
        the second quarter of 2015. Alex Maloney, group chief executive officer
        of the Bermudian-domiciled company with its head office in London, said:
        Our return on equity of 3.2 per cent for the second quarter and 7.1
        per cent for the half-year represent an excellent result achieved during
        challenging times. I have previously talked about our commitment to
        maintain a strong core book of business serving the needs of our valued
        clients and their brokers, whilst also bringing down overall risk levels
        in line with our view of the underwriting opportunities. These results
        are clear evidence that our stated model is working. Diluted earnings
        per share totaled 16 cents for the quarter, compared to 19 cents for the
        second quarter of 2015, while total investment return was 0.9 per cent.
        Mr Maloney said: At a time when premium rates and insurance policy
        terms and conditions are under pressure, our model has helped not only
        to deliver the underwriting service which is expected of us but also to
        insulate our balance sheet against a string of small to medium-sized
        natural catastrophe and specialty market losses. We are starting to see
        evidence of the insurance industry sustaining a series of net losses
        during the first half of 2016. Against this background, it is reassuring
        to note that Lancashires reinsurance purchasing strategy has enabled
        the group to reduce our net liabilities by about $20 million when
        compared to the reinsurance programme purchased in 2015. On the
        investment side, the return of 0.9 per cent for the quarter is a strong
        return, proving our strategy remains appropriate for our business. Our
        conservative approach to our investments allows us to maintain our focus
        on the fundamentals of good underwriting and risk management. Total
        investment return, including net investment income, net other investment
        income, net realized gains and losses, impairments and net changes in
        unrealized gains and losses was a gain of $17 million for the second
        quarter, compared to a lost of $0.3 million for the same period in 2015.
2016. May 5.
        Lancashire Holdings saw its profit almost halved to $28.3 million in the
        first quarter. However, the company kept its combined ratio steady
        at 72.7 per cent, only a fraction higher than the same period last year.
        Price reductions on renewals in January and April were evident in all
        classes, but particularly the energy sector where renewal prices were 86
        per cent of those achieved in the first three months of 2015. Elaine
        Whelan, the groups chief financial officer, said the price reductions
        were broadly in line with our expectations on both the inwards and
        the outwards books She added: Although the market continues to be
        challenging, we remain well able to maintain our core portfolio.
        However, absent a market-changing event, there is no reason to believe
        pricing will improve in the near term, and it is therefore more likely
        that well return capital than retain it later in the year.
        Lancashire Holdingss gross premiums written were $230.8 million for
        the quarter, down from $244.3 million. The groups profit after tax
        dipped $25.4 million, while its net operating profit dropped to $32.4
        million from $52.1 million. Alex Maloney, chief executive officer,
        referred to the groups return on equity of 3.8 per cent as
        strong. He added: I am pleased that we have managed to defend
        our core book of business, with premium income at a similar level to a
        year ago. In what remains a very tough underwriting environment, brokers
        are looking for quality of service and security and are increasingly
        tiering the insurance market on that basis. Whether in Bermuda, London
        or at Lloyds, our Group platforms are valued for their ability to
        provide excellent client service in those lines in which we specialize,
        and we are fortunately seeing opportunities not only to maintain but
        also to build our participation on some of our core books of business.
        This has helped insulate our business from some of the chillier blasts
        faced by the smaller following markets. Lancashires total
        investment return, including internal foreign exchange hedges, was 0.7
        per cent for the quarter, compares with 1 per cent a year ago. Within
        the Lancashire group are Bermudian-based Lancashire Insurance Company
        and Kinesis Capital Management, together with Lancashire Insurance
        Company (UK), and Lloyds member Cathedral Underwriting Limited.

Lazard Ltd

Multi-billion
        dollar Wall
        Street investment bank, Bermuda-incorporated and domiciled with many
        local subsidiaries as shown above and below but not
        offering banking service in the Bermuda market. Said to be
        one of the few investment banks to emerge from the sub-prime mortgage
        meltdown unscathed. Founded
        as a dry goods business in New Orleans in 1847, it ranks seventh among
        financial advisers for announced mergers and acquisitions globally in
        2009, behind larger Wall Street companies Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs
        Group Inc., Citigroup Inc. and JP Morgan Chase & Co. Operates mostly
        in New York, London and Paris. Lazard has
        2,300 employees worldwide and approximately $143.6 billion in assets
        under management. Now the largest independent merger-advisory firm. Derives
        about half its revenue from advising on mergers and restructurings. 2014
        CEO is Kenneth Jacobs.  
2016.
        February 3. NEW YORK (Bloomberg)  Lazard Ltd, the investment bank
        domiciled in Bermuda, said fourth-quarter profit fell 8.1 per cent as currency
        fluctuations and market turmoil pushed asset-management and
        financial-advisory revenue lower. Earnings beat analysts
        estimates. Net income dropped to $158 million, or $1.18 a share, from
        $172 million, or $1.29, a year earlier, Lazard said yesterday in a
        statement. Earnings adjusted for one-time items were 92 cents a share,
        compared with the 87-cent estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
        Lazard, which derives about half its revenue from overseeing funds, said
        assets under management slipped 5 per cent last year to $186 billion as
        of December 31. The investment bank was also the No 7 merger adviser
        last year as the volume of deals climbed to a record globally, according
        to data compiled by Bloomberg. That fuelled the firms highest-ever
        operating revenue for that business. Asset management, it really is
        reflective of the lower AUM and turmoil in the markets more than
        anything else, chief executive officer Ken Jacobs said in an
        interview. Weve already seen some dramatic moves in currency and
        valuations. So hopefully weve seen the worst of that. More than a
        fifth of Lazards assets under management were allocated to
        emerging-markets equity as of the end of September, according to the
        firms website. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has tumbled 22 per
        cent in the past 12 months. Lazard dropped 20 per cent this year through
        Monday, adding to the 10 per cent decline in 2015. For the full year,
        Lazard had record operating revenue of $2.38 billion, and its
        highest-ever net income of $480 million, or $3.60 per share, on an
        adjusted basis. Lazard advised on six of the ten largest deals last
        year, Jacobs said. Just one of those transactions have been completed,
        he said. The firm worked with Anheuser-Busch InBev SA on its more than
        $100 billion agreement to buy SABMiller Plc and Royal Dutch Shell
        Plcs on its deal to purchase BG Group Plc. Operating revenue for
        financial advisory slipped 7.8 per cent to $331 million in the fourth
        quarter, while asset-management fees declined 8.1 per cent to $261
        million.
2015. October
        23. NEW YORK (Bloomberg)  Shares of Bermuda-based Lazard Ltd, the
        largest independent mergers-and-acquisitions adviser by market value,
        shot up yesterday after it reported third-quarter profit that beat
        analysts estimates as fees from advising on M&A climbed. Net
        income rose to $399 million, or $2.99 a share, from $89 million, or 67
        cents, a year earlier, the firm said yesterday in a statement. Earnings
        adjusted for one-time items were 93 cents a share, surpassing the
        90-cent estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. After the morning
        announcement, Lazard shares rose 5.3 per cent to close on $47.66 in New
        York. Lazard ranks seventh among merger advisers this year, a market
        thats on pace to reach a record globally. The firms restructuring
        work may pick up if companies have a harder time finding access to
        financing amid market volatility, according to Devin Ryan, an analyst at
        JMP Securities. Lazard also derives about half its revenue from asset
        management, and may have been hurt by the 6.9 percent decline in the
        Standard & Poors 500 Index in the third quarter. The current
        momentum has been quite strong, and Lazards backlog has been building
        at a pace we havent seen since the financial crisis, Ryan said by
        phone before earnings were released. Theres still some questions
        around whether the volatility that we saw in the middle and late summer
        will reverberate or have any impact on activity levels moving
        forward.

        Management (Bermuda)
2017.
        May 4. Like a prize in a game of pass the parcel, Ironshore Inc switched
        hands this week for the second time in two years. But it is all
        good, according to Mitch Blaser, chief executive officer of Ironshore
        Bermuda. It is fantastic news for Ironshore overall, he said, a
        day after it was announced that Liberty Mutual Insurances $3
        billion acquisition of Ironshore has been completed. The fact
        that Liberty Mutual has confidence in our brand and our operations to
        integrate their US operations into ours  that was a very strong vote
        of confidence in the strength of our brand and our business model,
        said Mr Mitch. He was referring to Liberty Mutuals decision to
        combine its existing Liberty International Underwriters US business and
        Ironshores US specialty lines business under the Ironshore brand.
        Clearly the retention of the Ironshore brand is another favorable
        aspect to our operations in the US, Bermuda and internationally. He
        is not alone in his positive outlook for Ironshore under Liberty
        Mutuals ownership. Ratings services have also weighed in. On Tuesday,
        AM Best removed Ironshore from under review and affirmed its
        A rating, while Moodys lifted a number of its ratings of
        Ironshore segments to A2. Two years ago Ironshore was bought by
        Shanghai-based Fosun International. The global investment group then
        opted to sell the insurer last December to Liberty Mutual as it
        offloaded assets to enhance its financial flexibility. When asked
        if another change of ownership in such a short period of time was
        unsettling, Mr Blaser said: Weve been very fortunate because Fosun
        was a fantastic owner. They bought us with the idea to build the
        franchise and have us run as an independent entity, so the impact on our
        people was minimal post-acquisition. Now we have been fortunate again to
        have a company with the breadth and depth of Liberty Mutual buy us with
        the intention of keeping the brand intact and building on our franchise.
        From a business standpoint, and an underwriting standpoint, weve been
        very fortunate and the disruption as a result has been minimal. Our
        people are very enthusiastic about this latest change in ownership, and
        very motivated to grow the company. Ironshore, which has offices in
        34 countries, was formed in 2006 in the wake of the catastrophic losses
        caused by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. In Bermuda it has offices
        on Front Street. There have been no announced changes to the companys
        operations on the island as a result of the acquisition. Mr Blaser sees
        opportunities to strengthen Ironshores operations in Bermuda and
        globally. It provides us with the platform with a very strong parent
        company, and balance sheet, to continue to expand our operations and
        build out the specialty businesses of Ironshore as part of Liberty
        Mutual, which will bode well for our Bermuda operations. He said
        Ironshore Bermuda will see opportunities to cross-sell to Liberty
        Mutuals client base. Mr Blaser, who is also COO of Ironshore Inc,
        added: In addition, as of today we are globally a US company with so
        many of our clients and client-base emanating out of the US. From a
        Bermuda standpoint the closure of this deal provides for a growth
        platform in terms of the strength of our balance sheet, the strength of
        our ratings, access to the client base of Liberty Mutual and the
        strength of the resources that Liberty Mutual brings to Ironshore
        Bermuda and the rest of Ironshore. The combination of Ironshore and
        Liberty Mutual has created a global specialty business with about $6.5
        billion in net written premiums. When asked if he thought mergers and
        acquisitions in the insurance and reinsurance sector would continue,
        with companies morphing into larger entities, Mr Blaser said: Yes, it
        will continue. I dont know if this is the beginning or the middle,
        its certainly not the end. Its very difficult for businesses in
        our industry to survive without the scale of resources and a strong
        balance sheet behind them. This type of consolidation has been evident
        in the reinsurance space probably for over five years. Now you are
        seeing it in the insurance space as well. He said that when capacity
        is widely available and it becomes difficult for a company to
        differentiate itself from competitors, then having a strong financial
        rating and balance sheet are increasingly important factors for clients
        and brokers deciding where to place business. Those advantages and
        those resources help differentiate yourself with the customer and are
        the most important features today. That will force more
        consolidation. Ironshore is the official insurer of Americas Cup
        defender Oracle Team USA. Looking ahead to the competition, which starts
        at the end of this month, Mr Blaser said: We are very much plugged
        into and excited about the potential of the Americas Cup for Bermuda,
        not only as a sponsor, but to support it in any way possible.

Longtail
        Aviation
2017.
        April 12. A founder of this company has died in Canada. Mark Byrne,
        who also founded Flagstone Re, died in Montreal last Thursday. He was
        55. Mr Byrne was involved in the islands insurance and reinsurance
        business as an owner, investor and board member for many years. Mr
        Byrne, originally from County Wexford, Ireland, was a qualified jet
        pilot and flew his own private plane around the world. He also headed
        Bermuda Governments Education Board for a short time in 2009,
        standing down after six months due to what he said was a a lack of
        political will to improve the system. In 1993 he became chairman of
        Haverford, a holding company for insurance interests in Bermuda and
        internationally. Mr Byrne also set up Longtail Aviation in 1999. A
        self-confessed aviation fanatic, who started out learning how to fly
        gliders at age of 13, Mr Byrne said in 2008: I love to fly whenever I
        get the chance. I fly helicopters, light planes, gliders, everything.
        Longtail Aviation has offices in Martigny, Switzerland, and Halifax,
        Nova Scotia, as well as its headquarters at the Longtail Hangar in
        Southside, St Davids. Mr Byrne is survived by his wife Rebecca, four
        children, Sophie, Jacqueline, Matthew and Christopher, as well as his
        mother, Dorothy Byrne and brothers John and Patrick.

The performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data shown above. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so that shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. The returns reflect the expense limitation and reimbursement, without which, the performance would have been lower. A Fund's performance, especially for short periods of time, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision.
For the period from the Fund's inception through May 31, 2016, the returns and expenses of Class A shares reflect the performance of the prior feeder fund; and the returns of Class I shares reflect the performance of the Fund prior to its issuance of multiple share classes and reclassification of existing shares.  From June 1, 2016 forward, the returns reflect performance of Class A and Class I shares, respectively, of the Altegris KKR Commitments Fund.

Fund distributions will vary depending upon market conditions and number of shares outstanding. Past distributions are no guarantee of future distributions or performance results.
This information is not intended to cover the complexities of a shareholder's individual tax situation. Because tax laws vary among states, you should consult your tax advisor about the specific rules in the state(s) in which you pay income taxes.
Record date is the date by which a shareholder must own fund shares to receive the distribution. Ex-date is the date on which a shareholder who purchases fund shares will not be eligible to receive the distribution. Payable date is the date on which a shareholder is paid the distribution.


















1 While the portfolio composition that has been developed by Altegris Advisors (the Fund's investment adviser) and StepStone Group (the Fund's sub-adviser) reflects their assessment of the relative attractiveness of sub-sectors within the context of an appropriately diversified portfolio, given the percentage of assets that will be invested in securities issued by a single issuer (KKR), the Fund will be a non-diversified fund under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
A portion of the Fund's assets may be invested in private equity or Investment Funds which are not managed by or affiliated with KKR; however, this allocation is not anticipated to be material to the Fund's overall strategy.
Diversification does not ensure profit or protect against loss in a positive or declining market. There is no guarantee that any investment will achieve its objectives, generate profits, or avoid losses. There can be no assurance that all investment types will be available, will be consistent with the Fund's objective, will satisfy the Investment Adviser's due diligence considerations, or will be selected for the Fund.

Not everyone can invest like an institution. Institutions are professional money managers who have unique access and the ability to perform extensive due diligence on managers. Many investors' experience, financial means, objectives, risk tolerance, and time frame will differ from that of institutions, and they may not be able to access the same investment opportunities as institutions. These factors should be taken into consideration when creating an allocation to alternatives. The above should not be construed as investment advice. Diversification does not ensure profit nor protect against loss.
Volatility can be measured by standard deviation, which is a statistical measure of how consistent returns are over time; a lower standard deviation indicates historically less volatility. Correlation is a statistical measure of how two securities move in relation to each other.

† As of December 31, 2016.
                            References to “assets under management” or “AUM” represent the assets managed by KKR or its strategic partners as to which KKR is entitled to receive a fee or carried interest (either currently or upon deployment of capital) and general partner capital.  KKR calculates the amount of AUM as of any date as the sum of: (i) the fair value of the investments of KKR's investment funds; (ii) uncalled capital commitments from these funds, including uncalled capital commitments from which KKR is currently not earning management fees or carried interest; (iii) the fair value of investments in KKR's co-investment vehicles; (iv) the par value of outstanding CLOs (excluding CLOs wholly-owned by KKR); (v) KKR's pro-rata portion of the AUM managed by strategic partnerships in which KKR holds a minority ownership interest and (vi) the fair value of other assets managed by KKR.  The pro-rata portion of the AUM managed by strategic partnerships is calculated based on KKR's percentage ownership interest in such entities multiplied by such entity's respective AUM.  KKR's calculation of AUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers and, as a result, KKR's measurements of its AUM may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. KKR's definition of AUM is not based on the definitions of AUM that may be set forth in agreements governing the investment funds, vehicles or accounts that it manages and is not calculated pursuant to any regulatory definitions.

IMPORTANT UPDATE








The Altegris KKR Commitments Master Fund (“Fund”) and the Altegris KKR Commitments Fund (“Feeder”) initially began operations in August 2015 as separate investment funds within a master/feeder structure, with the Feeder investing substantially all of its assets into the Fund.  Both the Fund and Feeder had the same investment objectives, but each operated as a separate entity and issued shares separately with differing fee structures, and with Feeder shareholders bearing a proportional share of the Fund’s operating expenses in addition to the Feeder’s own expenses. 
As described in the initial Prospectus, having received both SEC and Board approval, in May 2016 the Fund converted and offers multiple share classes. As part of this conversion, each Feeder shareholder received a new class of Fund shares (“Class A” shares), in proportion to and in exchange for each such shareholder’s existing Feeder shares (at then current net asset values). The Feeder Fund will thereafter be liquidated and cease to exist. Also, existing Fund shareholders continue to hold their originally issued shares, re-classified as “Class I” shares. In each case, the original fee structures, rights and privileges of any of the exchanged or re-classified shares remain unchanged. However, the conversion positively impacts holders of Class A shares by lowering their annual expense ratio, as compared to that applicable to holding Feeder shares, because the revised Expense Limitation and Reimbursement Agreement between the Adviser and the Fund limits Class A expenses to 0.65% per annum on specified expenses (instead of 0.80% previously for the Feeder).
In May 2016, the Fund commenced offering the two separate classes of shares—Class A and Class I—for acceptance and issuance effective as of the Fund’s June 1, 2016 subscription Closing Date, and on a continuous basis thereafter.

LOGARITHMIC SCALE | APRIL 1986 – SEPTEMBER 2016





Past performance is no guarantee of future results. There is no guarantee that any investment will achieve its objectives, generate profits or avoid losses. There are significant differences between public and private equities, which include but are not limited to, the fact that public equities have a lower barrier to entry than private equities. There is also greater access to information about public companies. Private equities typically have a longer time horizon than public equities before profits, if any, are realized. Additionally, public equities provide greater liquidity whereas private equities are considered highly illiquid.
Cambridge US Private Equity Index data based on quarterly returns. S&P 500 Total Return Index data based on monthly returns. Date range based on common period of data availability. The referenced indices are shown for general market comparisons and are not meant to represent any particular investment. There are significant differences in the risks and potential for volatility of the Fund relative to an index. An investor cannot invest directly in an index. Moreover, indices do not reflect commissions or fees that may be charged to an investment product based on the index, which may materially affect the performance data presented.

2015 TAX INFORMATION








To avoid penalties, the Internal Revenue Code requires that, by December 31 of each year, a Registered Investment Company distribute at least 98 percent of its ordinary income earned during the calendar year, 98.2 percent of its net capital gains earned during the 12-month period ending on October 31 of the calendar year, and 100 percent of any previously undistributed amounts.
Neither the Altegris KKR Commitments Master Fund nor the Altegris KKR Commitments Fund recorded net capital gains from their launch in August 2015 through October 31, 2015.  Similarly, neither Fund earned ordinary income in the period from August 2015 through December 31, 2015.  As such, neither Fund made distributions to investors during 2015.  As a consequence, neither Fund issued a Form 1099 to investors for 2015.

ALTEGRIS KKR COMMITMENTS MASTER FUND: FUND COMMENTARY AND ACTIVITY*
May Commentary
											                      May performance was driven by the Fund’s publicly-traded positions. From a geographic perspective, the Americas drove gains while Europe and Asia were flat for the month. The Financials sector was the largest positive contributor to performance, while Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples also generated profits. We continue to focus on diversifying the portfolio across sectors and geographies with investments that have a durable competitive advantage amid the backdrop of a low-growth global economy.
May Fund Activity 
                    					     					During May, the Fund executed capital calls on four portfolio companies totaling $1.0 million and received distributions on nine portfolio companies totaling $2.8 million. At month-end, the Fund held investments in 118 underlying portfolio companies.
Q1 2017 Commentary 
					     					                    The Altegris KKR Commitments Master Fund (“Fund”) performed positively in Q1. During the quarter, returns were driven by positive operating results in the Fund’s underlying portfolio companies in addition to gains related to the purchase of secondary fund interests. From a geographic perspective, the Americas and Europe generated profits while Asia was a small detractor. Consumer Discretionary, Financials and Healthcare drove profitability from a sector perspective, while Materials was a slight detractor.
Entering into 2017, we continue to focus on diversifying the portfolio across geographies and sectors with companies that have a durable competitive advantage amid the backdrop of a low-growth global economy. We believe the Fund is well-positioned to make opportunistic secondary and co-investment purchases in addition to new portfolio company investments from the Fund’s primary commitments. We are pleased with the diversity and operating strength of the Fund’s underlying portfolio companies and our growing investment pipeline in early 2017.
* The Fund’s principal investment strategy is long-term capital appreciation through allocation of its assets to private equity investments, including other private equity funds (“Underlying Funds”). References to investments or positions in portfolio companies, and/or to geographic or market sectors, relate generally to the Fund’s access or exposure to such companies or sectors through its investments in Underlying Funds, as described in the “Investment Program” section of the Fund’s Prospectus.

The views expressed are for informational purposes only and should not be construed as specific investment advice or a recommendation to buy or sell any securities. The Altegris KKR Commitments Master Fund is new with a limited history of operations and may not be suitable or available to everyone. The Fund invests in private equity securities and should be considered a speculative investment that entails substantial risks. These risks include, but are not limited to, market risk, concentration risk, illiquidity, risks of leverage, non-diversification risk, lack of transparency, regulatory risk, lack of a secondary market or exchange to trade securities, foreign investment risks, sector risks, and volatility. There is no guarantee that any investment will achieve its objectives, generate profits or avoid losses.
Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Altegris KKR Commitments Master Fund. This and other important information about the Fund is contained in the Fund’s prospectus, which can be obtained by calling (888) 524-9441. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.

Morningstar has awarded this fund 5 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 243 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund scored High because it delivered returns that were in the top 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category over a 3-year period.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund's expenses are rated as High because they are above the 80th percentile when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks capital appreciation.




Strategy



The fund seeks to achieve its objective by allocating the fund's assets among a variety of non-traditional or "alternative" investment strategies. The adviser allocates the fund's assets among investment sub-advisers with experience managing alternative investment strategies and among investment funds and may also manage a portion of the fund's assets directly.


Risk



The fund can invest in securities that may have a leveraging effect (such as derivatives and forward-settling securities) which may increase market exposure, magnify investment risks, and cause losses to be realized more quickly. The fund may invest in commodity-linked investments, which may be more volatile and less liquid than the underlying instruments or measures. In addition, their value may be affected by the performance of the overall commodities markets as well as by weather, disease, and regulatory developments. The commodities industry can be significantly affected by commodity prices, world events, import controls, worldwide competition, government regulations, and economic conditions. The risk of loss in trading foreign currency can be substantial and may be magnified if trading on margin. Customers should therefore carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for them in light of their financial condition, risk tolerance and understanding of foreign markets. These risks include foreign currency risk and liquidation risk. Stock markets, especially foreign markets, are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks. Short positions pose a risk because they lose value as a security's price increases; therefore, the loss on a short sale is theoretically unlimited. May not be suitable for all investors. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.




Additional Disclosures

This description is only intended to provide a brief overview of the mutual fund. Read the fund's prospectus for more detailed information about the fund.
The analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 11/17/2014.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 06/16/2014, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average

This fund scores Below Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 20th and 40th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund scored High because it delivered returns that were in the top 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category over a 3-year period.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



The fund can invest in securities that may have a leveraging effect (such as derivatives and forward-settling securities) which may increase market exposure, magnify investment risks, and cause losses to be realized more quickly. The fund may invest in commodity-linked investments, which may be more volatile and less liquid than the underlying instruments or measures. In addition, their value may be affected by the performance of the overall commodities markets as well as by weather, disease, and regulatory developments. The commodities industry can be significantly affected by commodity prices, world events, import controls, worldwide competition, government regulations, and economic conditions. The risk of loss in trading foreign currency can be substantial and may be magnified if trading on margin. Customers should therefore carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for them in light of their financial condition, risk tolerance and understanding of foreign markets. These risks include foreign currency risk and liquidation risk. Stock markets, especially foreign markets, are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks. Short positions pose a risk because they lose value as a security's price increases; therefore, the loss on a short sale is theoretically unlimited. May not be suitable for all investors. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

© 2016 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated. Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower. Except for Life of Fund returns, the analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 11/17/2014.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 6/16/2014, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
7. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
8. The analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 11/17/2014.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 6/16/2014, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.
9. StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
10. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.
11. Expense caps and waivers are limits that the fund company has placed on the level of the expenses borne by the fund until 8/31/2018 and indicates the maximum level of expenses (with certain exceptions) that the fund would be paying until that time. After the expiration date, the expense cap and/or waiver may be terminated or revised, which may lower the fund's yield and return.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
