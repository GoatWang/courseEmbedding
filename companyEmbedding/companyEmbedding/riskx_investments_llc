Copyright © 2017 Manifold Fund Advisors, LLC
Information found on this site is directed to U.S. Investors.
All investments involve risk including the loss of principal. Investing in a single-sector mutual fund involves greater risk and potential reward than investing in a more diversified fund. By concentrating on a small number of holdings, the fund carries greater risk because each investment has a greater effect on the fund’s overall performance. The return of principal in bond funds is not guaranteed. Bond funds have the same interest rate, inflation, and credit risks that are associated with the underlying bonds owned by the fund. Generally, the value of a bond fund rises when interest rates fall and falls when interest rates rise. 
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses of a Fund carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information about the Fund. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.
Portfolio diversification and active risk management do not assure a profit or protect against losses in a declining market. 
Investing in the Funds involves risk. Equity securities are more volatile and carry more risk than other forms of investments. The Funds may invest in small and mid-cap securities which are more volatile than large cap stocks. Value-based investments are subject to the risk that the broad market may not recognize their intrinsic value. Investments in fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risks. The principal value of a bond falls when interest rates rise and rises when interest rates fall. During periods of rising interest rates, the value of a bond investment is at greater risk than during periods of stable or falling rates.
General ETF Risk. The cost to a shareholder of investing in the Fund may be higher than the cost of investing directly in ETF shares and may be higher than other mutual funds that invest directly in equities. You will indirectly bear fees and expenses charged by the ETFs in addition to the Fund’s direct fees and expenses.
Foreign Securities Risk. International investing involves risks, including risks related to foreign currency, limited liquidity, less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risks often are heightened for investments in emerging/developing markets or smaller capital markets.
Quantitative Investment Strategies Risk. Manifold Partners may rely on quantitative models (both proprietary models developed by Manifold Partners and those supplied by third parties) and information and data supplied by third parties (“Models and Data”) in managing the Fund. Models and Data are used to assist in determining investments and to provide risk management insights.
Models and Data may prove to be incorrect or incomplete. In such cases, any decisions made in reliance thereon can expose the Fund to potential risks. Some of the models used by Manifold Partners are predictive in nature. Predictive models generally depend on the assumption that the future performance of a specific investment can be predicted based on the correlation of the past performance of the investment with the past performance of other investments or economic or financial data. The use of predictive models presents inherent risks. Because predictive models are usually constructed based on historical data supplied by third parties, the success of relying on such models may depend heavily on the accuracy and reliability of the supplied historical data. Additionally, market dynamics change over time and correlations that existed in the past may diminish or end. A model may fail to provide correct predictions, and a model that has been successful in the past may be less successful or ineffective in the future. Most statistical formulae cannot fully match the complexity of the financial markets and a model may be flawed or may not work as anticipated. During unforeseen or low probability scenarios, models may produce unexpected results, which may result in losses for the Fund. 
Tracking Error Risk. ETFs typically trade on securities exchanges and their shares may, at times, trade at a premium or discount to their net asset values. In addition, an ETF may not replicate exactly the performance of the benchmark index it seeks to track for a number of reasons, including transaction costs incurred by the ETF, the temporary unavailability of certain index securities in the secondary market or discrepancies between the ETF and the index with respect to the weighting of securities or the number of securities held.
Emerging Markets Risk. The Fund may invest in foreign securities that may include securities of companies located in developing or emerging markets, which entail additional risks, including: less social, political and economic stability; smaller securities markets and lower trading volume, which may result in less liquidity and greater price volatility; national policies that may restrict securities investment opportunities, including restrictions on investments in issuers or industries, or expropriation or confiscation of assets or property; and less developed legal structures governing private or foreign investment.
Commodities Risk. Investments in commodities, such as gold, or in commodity-linked instruments, will subject the Global Tactical Allocation Fund's portfolio to volatility that may also deviate from price movements in equity and fixed income securities.
Equity Securities Risk. In general, prices of equity securities are more volatile than those of fixed income securities. The prices of equity securities fluctuate, and sometimes widely fluctuate, in response to activities specific to the issuer of the security as well as factors unrelated to the fundamental condition of the issuer, including general market, economic and political conditions.
For a complete list of fund risks, please see the prospectuses.
For more complete information on the American Independence and AI Funds, you can obtain a prospectus containing complete information for the Funds by calling 866.410.2006 or by visiting www.americanindependence.com. You should consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before you invest or send money. Information about these and other important subjects is in the Funds’ prospectus. The prospectus and, if available, the summary prospectus, should be read carefully before investing.

Mergers











FolioMetrix is to merge with American Independence Financial Services, LLC (AIF) to create a new company, RiskX Investments, LLC, offering an array of risk-intelligent investment solutions. 
The transaction is expected to close in September 2015. Terms of the deal have not been disclosed.
RiskX Investments will manage, post-merger, approximately USD1.1 billion in funds and separately managed accounts, comprised of the American Independence Funds (single-manager sub-advised funds and separately managed accounts) and the FolioMetrix Rx Fund Series (multi-strategy tactical mutual funds).
American Independence Funds offer exposure to select sub-advisors of equity, fixed income, international, and risked-managed portfolios. The AIF management team averages over 25 years of experience building and distributing investment solutions to the financial industry. 
"The decision to merge with FolioMetrix was an easy one to make. Its team shares our dedication to continuously seeking new ways to deliver better investment outcomes during any market conditions," says John J Pileggi, Managing Partner of American Independence, who will become CEO of RiskX Investments. "We are eager to join forces and deliver a wide array of risk-intelligent products to the marketplace as partners in RiskX Investments."
FolioMetrix is the creator of a proprietary research platform that mixes strategies from carefully selected portfolio managers with different tactical overlays for portfolio diversification in up and down markets. The firm also provides a suite of client engagement, workflow management, and portfolio design and construction programs for advisors and institutions.
"Joining forces with American Independence provides us with the leadership and distribution expertise needed for advisors to access our extensive research, covering the full spectrum of active risk management within a diverse line of investment products," says Jerry Murphey, President and CEO of FolioMetrix, who will become President of RiskX Investments.
Grail Partners LLC, through a fund invested with an undisclosed partner, has provided funds to both companies and initiated the merger. "Today, financial markets change faster than do investor expectations, so investors need tactical risk management as well as traditional asset allocation," says Donald H Putnam, Managing Partner of Grail Partners. "RiskX Investments will combine two great firms to promote active risk management of all types for all clients. We will help the RiskX Investments team pursue organic growth and strategic partnerships."

Important Disclosures
Investing involves risk. Equity securities are more volatile and carry more risk than other forms of investments. 
Equity Securities Risk. In general, prices of equity securities are more volatile than those of fixed income securities. The prices of equity securities fluctuate, and sometimes widely fluctuate, in response to activities specific to the issuer of the security as well as factors unrelated to the fundamental condition of the issuer, including general market, economic and political conditions. 
Fixed-Income Securities Risk. Fixed-income securities are subject to the risk of the issuer's inability to meet principal and interest payments on its obligations (i.e., credit risk) and are subject to price volatility resulting from, among other things, interest rate sensitivity, market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (i.e., market risk). Generally fixed-income securities will decrease in value if interest rates rise and will increase in value if interest rates decline. Securities with longer durations are likely to be more sensitive to changes in interest rates, generally making them more volatile than securities with shorter durations. Lower rated fixed-income securities have greater volatility because there is less certainty that principal and interest payments will be made as scheduled. 
General ETF Risk. The cost to a shareholder of investing in the Fund may be higher than the cost of investing directly in ETF shares and may be higher than other mutual funds that invest directly in equities. You will indirectly bear fees and expenses charged by the ETFs in addition to the Fund's direct fees and expenses. 
For a complete list of fund risks, please see the prospectuses. 
For more complete information on the American Independence Funds, you can obtain a prospectus containing complete information for the Funds by calling 866.410.2006 or by visiting www.americanindependence.com.

Copyright © 2017 Manifold Fund Advisors, LLC
Information found on this site is directed to U.S. Investors.
All investments involve risk including the loss of principal. Investing in a single-sector mutual fund involves greater risk and potential reward than investing in a more diversified fund. By concentrating on a small number of holdings, the fund carries greater risk because each investment has a greater effect on the fund’s overall performance. The return of principal in bond funds is not guaranteed. Bond funds have the same interest rate, inflation, and credit risks that are associated with the underlying bonds owned by the fund. Generally, the value of a bond fund rises when interest rates fall and falls when interest rates rise. 
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses of a Fund carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information about the Fund. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.
Portfolio diversification and active risk management do not assure a profit or protect against losses in a declining market. 
Investing in the Funds involves risk. Equity securities are more volatile and carry more risk than other forms of investments. The Funds may invest in small and mid-cap securities which are more volatile than large cap stocks. Value-based investments are subject to the risk that the broad market may not recognize their intrinsic value. Investments in fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risks. The principal value of a bond falls when interest rates rise and rises when interest rates fall. During periods of rising interest rates, the value of a bond investment is at greater risk than during periods of stable or falling rates.
General ETF Risk. The cost to a shareholder of investing in the Fund may be higher than the cost of investing directly in ETF shares and may be higher than other mutual funds that invest directly in equities. You will indirectly bear fees and expenses charged by the ETFs in addition to the Fund’s direct fees and expenses.
Foreign Securities Risk. International investing involves risks, including risks related to foreign currency, limited liquidity, less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risks often are heightened for investments in emerging/developing markets or smaller capital markets.
Quantitative Investment Strategies Risk. Manifold Partners may rely on quantitative models (both proprietary models developed by Manifold Partners and those supplied by third parties) and information and data supplied by third parties (“Models and Data”) in managing the Fund. Models and Data are used to assist in determining investments and to provide risk management insights.
Models and Data may prove to be incorrect or incomplete. In such cases, any decisions made in reliance thereon can expose the Fund to potential risks. Some of the models used by Manifold Partners are predictive in nature. Predictive models generally depend on the assumption that the future performance of a specific investment can be predicted based on the correlation of the past performance of the investment with the past performance of other investments or economic or financial data. The use of predictive models presents inherent risks. Because predictive models are usually constructed based on historical data supplied by third parties, the success of relying on such models may depend heavily on the accuracy and reliability of the supplied historical data. Additionally, market dynamics change over time and correlations that existed in the past may diminish or end. A model may fail to provide correct predictions, and a model that has been successful in the past may be less successful or ineffective in the future. Most statistical formulae cannot fully match the complexity of the financial markets and a model may be flawed or may not work as anticipated. During unforeseen or low probability scenarios, models may produce unexpected results, which may result in losses for the Fund. 
Tracking Error Risk. ETFs typically trade on securities exchanges and their shares may, at times, trade at a premium or discount to their net asset values. In addition, an ETF may not replicate exactly the performance of the benchmark index it seeks to track for a number of reasons, including transaction costs incurred by the ETF, the temporary unavailability of certain index securities in the secondary market or discrepancies between the ETF and the index with respect to the weighting of securities or the number of securities held.
Emerging Markets Risk. The Fund may invest in foreign securities that may include securities of companies located in developing or emerging markets, which entail additional risks, including: less social, political and economic stability; smaller securities markets and lower trading volume, which may result in less liquidity and greater price volatility; national policies that may restrict securities investment opportunities, including restrictions on investments in issuers or industries, or expropriation or confiscation of assets or property; and less developed legal structures governing private or foreign investment.
Commodities Risk. Investments in commodities, such as gold, or in commodity-linked instruments, will subject the Global Tactical Allocation Fund's portfolio to volatility that may also deviate from price movements in equity and fixed income securities.
Equity Securities Risk. In general, prices of equity securities are more volatile than those of fixed income securities. The prices of equity securities fluctuate, and sometimes widely fluctuate, in response to activities specific to the issuer of the security as well as factors unrelated to the fundamental condition of the issuer, including general market, economic and political conditions.
For a complete list of fund risks, please see the prospectuses.
For more complete information on the American Independence and AI Funds, you can obtain a prospectus containing complete information for the Funds by calling 866.410.2006 or by visiting www.americanindependence.com. You should consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before you invest or send money. Information about these and other important subjects is in the Funds’ prospectus. The prospectus and, if available, the summary prospectus, should be read carefully before investing.

RiskX Investments Created to Help Advisors Build Risk-Intelligent Portfolios

New Firm Born Through Merger of American Independence and FolioMetrix




Aug 5, 2015, 12:30pm EDT














NEW YORK, Aug. 5, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- RiskX Investments, LLC ("RiskX Investments"), the investment advisory and mutual fund firm created through the merger of American Independence Financial Services, LLC ("American Independence") and FolioMetrix, closed on July 31, 2015. RiskX Investments includes both the American Independence single-manager sub-advised funds and separately managed accounts, and the Rx Funds multi-strategy tactical mutual fund series.

"This merger unites American Independence's management expertise and proud tradition of active investing with FolioMetrix's progressive approach to investment management research and portfolio design," said RiskX CEO John Pileggi, who previously served as Managing Partner of American Independence. "We are now one company with one philosophy."
"Financial markets change faster than investors' expectations, so investors need tactical risk management as well as traditional asset allocation," added Jerry Murphey, President of RiskX Investments and formerly President and CEO of FolioMetrix. "Our mission is to deliver value to financial advisors by providing the missing ingredient between investor expectations and market movement. Delivering information, education, training, and the essential portfolios, in every format, are critical to achieving our mission."
RiskX Investments brings a passion and commitment to delivering products designed to provide meaningful returns in up markets and mitigation of losses in down markets. The company's proprietary research process and database of managers provides financial advisors and institutions access to a range of carefully selected sub-advisers and strategists, including some of the most respected names in the industry.  
The firm is led by a well-rounded and highly productive team of seasoned investment professionals and has the backing and financial resources to carry out its ambitious growth plans. 
About RiskX InvestmentsRiskX Investments offers access to a wide array of boutique asset managers and tactical strategists within a series of sub-advised mutual funds and separately managed accounts.

Important Disclosures
Investing involves risk. Equity securities are more volatile and carry more risk than other forms of investments. 
Equity Securities Risk. In general, prices of equity securities are more volatile than those of fixed income securities. The prices of equity securities fluctuate, and sometimes widely fluctuate, in response to activities specific to the issuer of the security as well as factors unrelated to the fundamental condition of the issuer, including general market, economic and political conditions. 
Fixed-Income Securities Risk. Fixed-income securities are subject to the risk of the issuer's inability to meet principal and interest payments on its obligations (i.e., credit risk) and are subject to price volatility resulting from, among other things, interest rate sensitivity, market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (i.e., market risk). Generally fixed-income securities will decrease in value if interest rates rise and will increase in value if interest rates decline. Securities with longer durations are likely to be more sensitive to changes in interest rates, generally making them more volatile than securities with shorter durations. Lower rated fixed-income securities have greater volatility because there is less certainty that principal and interest payments will be made as scheduled. 
General ETF Risk. The cost to a shareholder of investing in the Fund may be higher than the cost of investing directly in ETF shares and may be higher than other mutual funds that invest directly in equities. You will indirectly bear fees and expenses charged by the ETFs in addition to the Fund's direct fees and expenses. 
For a complete list of fund risks, please see the prospectuses. 
For more complete information on the American Independence Funds, you can obtain a prospectus containing complete information for the Funds by calling 866.410.2006 or by visiting www.americanindependence.com. You should consider the Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses, carefully before you invest or send money. Information about these and other important subjects is in the Fund's prospectus. The prospectus and, if available, the summary prospectus should be read carefully before investing.
Shares of the American Independence Funds are distributed by Matrix Capital Group, Inc., which is not affiliated with American Independence Financial Services, LLC, RiskX Investments, or FolioMetrix LLC.
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Funds carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information about the Funds. A copy of the prospectus is available at ncfunds.com or by calling Shareholder Services at 800-773-3863. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.
The RiskX Funds are distributed by Capital Investment Group, Inc., Member FINRA/SIPC, 17 Glenwood Ave, Raleigh, NC, 27603. There is no affiliation between the RiskX Funds, including its principals, and Capital Investment Group, Inc.
