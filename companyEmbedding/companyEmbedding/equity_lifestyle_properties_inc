(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and with the information under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.  We generate the majority of our revenues from customers renting our Sites, or entering into right-to-use contracts (also referred to as membership products) which provide our customers access to specific Properties for limited stays. Our MH community Sites and annual RV resort Sites are leased on an annual basis. Seasonal Sites are leased to customers generally for one to six months. Transient Sites are leased to customers on a short-term basis. The revenue from seasonal and transient Sites is generally higher during the first and third quarters. We consider the transient revenue stream to be our most volatile as it is subject to weather conditions and other factors affecting the RV customer's vacation and travel preferences. Sites designated as right-to-use Sites are primarily utilized to service the approximately 106,500 customers who have entered into right-to-use contracts (otherwise referred to as "memberships" or "membership dues"). We also have interests in joint venture Properties for which revenue is classified as Equity in income from unconsolidated joint ventures in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The breakdown of our Sites by type are as follows (amounts are approximate):  Total Sites as of June 30, 2017  Community Sites 71,100 Resort Sites: Annual 26,600 Seasonal 11,200 Transient 10,500 Right-to-use (1) 24,100 Joint Ventures (2) 3,600 147,100 _________________________  (2) Joint ventures have approximately 2,700 annual Sites, approximately 400 seasonal Sites and approximately 500 transient Sites and includes Crosswinds Mobile Home Park joint venture that we entered into during the quarter ended June 30, 2017.  In our Home Sales and Rental Operations business our revenue streams include home sales, home rentals, brokerage services and ancillary activities. We generate revenue through home sales and rental operations by selling or leasing Site Set homes that are located in Properties owned and managed by us. We continue to focus on our rental operations, as we believe renting our vacant new homes may represent an attractive source of occupancy and the opportunity to convert to a new homebuyer in the future. We also sell and rent homes through our joint venture, ECHO Financing, LLC (the "ECHO JV"). We provide brokerage services to residents of our Properties who move from a Property but do not relocate their home. In addition, we operate ancillary activities at certain Properties, such as golf courses, pro shops, stores and restaurants. In the manufactured housing industry chattel financing options are limited. Financing options available today include community owner funded programs or third party lender programs that provide subsidized financing to customers and require the community owner to guarantee customer defaults. Third party lender programs have stringent underwriting criteria, sizable down payment requirements, short loan amortization and high interest rates. We have a limited program under which we purchase loans made by an unaffiliated lender to purchasers of homes at our Properties.  Management's Discussion (continued)  managing our Properties to increase operating margins by increasing occupancy, maintaining competitive market rents and controlling expenses. We actively seek to acquire and are currently engaged in various stages of negotiations relating to the possible acquisition of additional properties, which may include contracts outstanding to acquire such properties that are subject to the satisfactory completion of our due diligence review. In addition to Net income computed in accordance with GAAP, we assess and measure our overall financial and operating performance using certain Non-GAAP supplemental measures, which include: (i) FFO, (ii) Normalized funds from operations ("NFFO"), (iii) Income from property operations, (iv) Income from property operations, excluding deferrals and property management, (v) Core Portfolio income from property operations, excluding deferrals and property management, (operating results for properties owned and operated in both periods under comparison) and (vi) Income from rental operations, net of depreciation. We use these measures internally to evaluate the operating performance of our portfolio and provide a basis for comparison with other real estate companies. Definitions and reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included below in this discussion. Results Overview  Net income available for Common Stockholders increased $4.0 million, to $39.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to $35.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. Net income available for Common Stockholders increased $10.3 million, to $96.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $86.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Both FFO per diluted share and NFFO per diluted share for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 were $0.81 compared to $0.75 for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 driven by improved Core and Non-Core income from property operations. Both FFO per diluted share and NFFO per diluted share for the six months ended June 30, 2017 were $1.81 compared to $1.67 for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  For the quarter ended June 30, 2017 property operating revenues in our Core Portfolio, excluding deferrals, were up 5.5% and property operating expenses in our Core Portfolio, excluding deferrals and property management, were up 6.5% from the quarter ended June 30, 2016, resulting in an increase in our income from property operations before deferrals and property management of 4.8%, from the quarter ended June 30, 2016. For the six months ended June 30, 2017 property operating revenues in our Core Portfolio, excluding deferrals, were up 4.9% and property operating expenses in our Core Portfolio, excluding deferrals and property management, were up 5.9% from the six months ended June 30, 2016, resulting in an increase in our income from property operations before deferrals and property management of 4.3%, from the six months ended June 30, 2016. We continue to focus on the quality of occupancy growth by increasing the number of manufactured homeowners in our Core Portfolio. Our Core Portfolio average occupancy consists of occupied home sites in our MH communities (both homeowners and renters) and was 94.2% for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to 94.0% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 and 93.3% for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. During the quarter ended June 30, 2017, we increased occupancy of manufactured homes within our Core Portfolio by 114 sites with an increase in homeowner occupancy of 204 sites compared to occupancy as of March 31, 2017. By comparison, as of June 30, 2016, our Core Portfolio occupancy increased 128 sites with an increase in homeowner occupancy of 229 sites compared to occupancy at March 31, 2016.  Management's Discussion (continued)  increased the awareness of our product offering and our customers are increasingly choosing the web as a vehicle to transact with us.   Type of Property Location Property Transaction Date Sites Total Sites as of January 1, 2016 143,938 Acquisitions: Rose Bay Port Orange, Florida RV January 27, 2016 303 Portland Fairview Fairview, Oregon RV May 26, 2016 407 Forest Lake Estates Zephryhills, Florida RV, MH June 15, 2016 1,168 Riverside RV Arcadia, Florida RV October 13, 2016 499 Paradise Park Largo Largo, Florida MH May 10, 2017 108 Joint Venture: Crosswinds St. Petersburg, Florida MH June 15, 2017 376 Expansion Site Development and other: Net Sites added (reconfigured) in 2016 295 Net Sites added (reconfigured) in 2017 13 Total Sites as of June 30, 2017 147,107  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  Management's Discussion (continued)  Funds from Operations ("FFO") and Normalized Funds from Operations ("NFFO") We define FFO as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains and actual or estimated losses from sales of properties, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, impairments, if any, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. We compute FFO in accordance with our interpretation of standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. We receive up-front non-refundable payments from the entry of right-to-use contracts. In accordance with GAAP, the upfront non-refundable payments and related commissions are deferred and amortized over the estimated customer life. Although the NAREIT definition of FFO does not address the treatment of non-refundable right-to-use payments, we believe that it is appropriate to adjust for the impact of the deferral activity in our calculation of FFO. We define NFFO as FFO excluding the following non-operating income and expense items: a) the financial impact of contingent consideration; b) gains and losses from early debt extinguishment, including prepayment penalties and defeasance costs; c) property acquisition and other transaction costs related to mergers and acquisitions; and d) other miscellaneous non-comparable items. NFFO presented herein is not necessarily comparable to NFFO presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same methodology for computing this amount.  Management's Discussion (continued) The following table reconciles Net income available for Common Stockholders to Income from property operations for the quarters and six months ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016 (amounts in thousands): Quarters ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Computation of Income from Property Operations: Net income available for Common Stockholders $ 39,498 $ 35,490 $ 96,385 $ 86,073 Series C Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock Dividends 2,316 2,316 4,613 4,613 Income allocated to non-controlling interests - Common OP Units 2,649 2,998 6,539 7,308 Equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures (1,040 ) (765 ) (2,190 ) (1,646 ) Income before equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures 43,423 40,039 105,347 96,348 Total other expenses, net 61,852 59,905 122,938 119,208 Income from home sales operations and other 547 758 (97 ) 241 Income from property operations $ 105,822 $ 100,702 $ 228,188 $ 215,797  The following table presents a calculation of FFO available for Common Stock and OP Unit holders and Normalized FFO available for Common Stock and OP Unit holders for the quarters and six months ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016 (amounts in thousands):   Quarters ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Computation of FFO and Normalized FFO: Net income available for Common Stockholders $ 39,498 $ 35,490 $ 96,385 $ 86,073 Income allocated to common OP units 2,649 2,998 6,539 7,308 Right-to-use contract upfront payments, deferred, net 1,321 798 2,096 1,100 Right-to-use contract commissions, deferred, net (112 ) (116 ) (196 ) (12 ) Depreciation on real estate assets 27,608 26,362 55,061 52,370 Depreciation on rental homes 2,639 2,667 5,296 5,314 Amortization of in-place leases 958 428 1,990 763 Depreciation on unconsolidated joint ventures 364 305 811 595 FFO available for Common Stock and OP Unit holders 74,925 68,932 167,982 153,511 Transaction costs 220 398 324 598 Normalized FFO available for Common $ 75,145 $ 69,330 $ 168,306 $ 154,109 Stock and OP Unit holders Weighted average Common Shares outstanding - fully diluted 93,063 92,264 93,041 92,163  Management's Discussion (continued) Results of Operations Comparison of the Quarter Ended June 30, 2017 to the Quarter Ended June 30, 2016 Income from Property Operations The following table summarizes certain financial and statistical data for the Core Portfolio and the total portfolio for the quarters ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 (amounts in thousands).

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.

                   3.

4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
