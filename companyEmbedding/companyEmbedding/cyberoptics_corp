QX150™
Tabletop With In-Line Performance





Electronics Assembly Inspection » Automated Optical Inspection » QX150™ 


The QX150™ is powered by an all-new SIM (Strobed Inspection Module) with enhanced illumination – designed to deliver true, in-line inspection performance. The SIM enables on-the-fly inspection making the QX150™ the fastest tabletop ever at 150 cm²/sec. A higher sensor resolution (12µm) offers superior quality images for more accurate defect review. And, as always, the SIM is calibration-free.
The QX150™ delivers quick setup and fast programming with AI² (Autonomous Image Interpretation) technology. A dramatic 90 percent reduction in examples and full support for unsupervised and semi-automatic model training means significantly lower tuning time and quality results with a single panel inspection. Perfect for those high-mix, low-volume applications!
QX150™ also offers 100% program compatibility with all QX inline AOI systems.
Key Features & Benefits
 World’s fastest tabletop at 150 cm²/sec
True, in-line inspection capability with all-new SIM (Strobed Inspection Module)

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM)  18.62 (07/27/17)      EPS (TTM)  $1.27      Market Cap $168.02 M     Shares Outstanding 6.94 M     Public Float 6.78 M     Yield CYBE has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.     Latest Dividend N/A     Ex-Dividend Date N/A       ?    Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.02      Net Money Flow ($)  8,858    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock. A ratio above one suggests greater buying pressure, below one suggests greater selling.

WAFER TRANSFER
Photonics SpectraMar 2007CyberOptics Corp.Request Info 
        

CyberOptics Semiconductor Inc. has unveiled the WaferSense automatic teaching system, a measurement technology for 200- and 300-mm semiconductor process equipment. The wireless and wafer-like device provides accurate wafer transfer coordinates for robotic handling and reduces equipment downtime and wafer scrap. It uses machine vision to “see” targets that mark wafer transfer locations and then transmits their digital coordinates to the operator. A camera captures live video from inside semiconductor equipment as an image processor reports the X-Y-Z offset from the teaching wafer to a target inside the equipment. Software logs data for comparison and analysis and helps to “train” the device to recognize new types of targets.Visit company websitehttp://www.cyberoptics.comAbout this supplier/Company.aspx?CompanyID=3317
