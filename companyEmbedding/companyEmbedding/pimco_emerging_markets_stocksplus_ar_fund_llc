 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Overview of the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment ETF | Direxion


























 






























Why KNOW? Why now?
Since inception, the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares ETF (Ticker: KNOW) has outperfomed the major U.S. stock indexes including the: S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, S&P SmallCap 600 and S&P1500 (source: Morningstar Direct). 
It makes sense. Corporate insiders− top officers, boards of directors, and major shareholders − have a natural edge over retail investors, and even financial analysts, because they typically know their businesses and industries better than anyone. That’s why, no matter how much research you do, or how much financial news you consume, you’re always a step behind those “in the know”.
The Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares (KNOW) is designed to help long term-investors pursue better portfolio outcomes by using insider sentiment to seek alpha relative to S&P 500® Index.
With a net expense ratio of just 0.65%, this strategic index-based ETF provides investors with cost-effective access to stocks that corporate officers, directors, and shareholders who own more than 5% of each company’s stock, are accumulating.
This insider sentiment selection uses a screening methodology based on public-company filings and positive earnings analysis that provides the basis for the funds’ quantitatively-weighted indexes. The ETF is comprised of 100 companies selected from the S&P 1500 Index.

EMSD - WisdomTree Strong Dollar Emerging Markets Equity Fund
































































                                    Emerging markets continue to offer diversification and growth potential, 
                                    but the U.S. dollar’s recent strengthening trend has strongly affected returns.
                                    

                                    The WisdomTree Strong Dollar Emerging Markets Equity Fund (EMSD) enables investors to capitalize 
                                    on the emerging market companies and sectors expected to perform better in strong U.S. 
                                    dollar environments, while maintaining diversification.

                                                    This Fund is new and has limited operating history.
                                                    


                                                        Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, 
                                                        charges and expenses of the Fund before investing. To obtain a 
                                                        prospectus containing this and other important information, please call 866.909.WISE (9473), 
                                                        or visit wisdomtree.com to view a prospectus online. Read the prospectus carefully before you invest.
                                                    


                                                        There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal. 
                                                        Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency 
                                                        fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty. Funds focusing on a single sector 
                                                        generally experience greater price volatility. Investments in emerging, offshore or 
                                                        frontier markets are generally less liquid and less efficient than investments in 
                                                        developed markets and are subject to additional risks, such as risks of adverse 
                                                        governmental regulation and intervention or political developments. 
                                                        A Fund that has exposure to one or more sectors may be more vulnerable to any single 
                                                        economic or regulatory development. The Fund invests in the securities included in, 
                                                        or representative of, its Index regardless of their investment merit, and the Fund does 
                                                        not attempt to outperform its Index or take defensive positions in declining markets. 
                                                        Please read the Fund’s prospectus for specific details regarding the Fund’s risk profile.

Last week, Professor Siegel and I chatted with Marc Chandler, Head of Global Markets Strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, about his views on divergent central bank policy actions, implications for the U.S. dollar, euro and yen, as well as his thoughts regarding emerging markets (EM). Below is a summary of our conversation.
Spotlight on the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the European Central Bank (ECB) 
Markets have become increasingly convinced that the Fed will embark on interest rate normalization at its policy meeting today. Professor Siegel agreed it would happen, barring a large market swoon early in the week. As a result, divergent central bank policy in the developed markets is anticipated to be in focus. With the ECB pledging to extend its quantitative easing (QE) program and taking its monetary policy rate deeper into negative territory, and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) in the midst of QE, the question remains how policy divergence will impact their local currencies.  
Understanding Fed Funds Futures 
The Fed Funds Target Rate implied by futures market pricing is the average effective rate over the course of the month. Many pricing models assume the Fed will target its effective rate at the midpoint of the Fed’s target range (currently 0 to 25 basis points [bps] ). But that is not necessarily the case, and the Fed may actually target a lower half of the range when setting the policy rate. Given that the board includes a large number of doves, this may be the more likely scenario, in which case the Federal Funds futures market probabilities estimating a rate hike—those based on the midpoint of the range—are understating the actual chance of a hike. That said, a hike today is widely anticipated, and it would be more disruptive to markets if the Fed did not move.  
Would a Rate Hike Be Good for Stocks?  
Professor Siegel and Marc Chandler both believe that markets may continue to perform well, despite a rate hike from the Fed. Chandler states that investors have had a long time to digest this rate hike and it could be seen as good housekeeping, where the economy is strong enough to withstand policy normalization. While the markets do not typically respond well to tightening policy rates, the removal of uncertainty over this hike may become a positive force going into the end of the year.  
Interest Rate Differentials to Drive Euro Lower  
Interest rate differentials are a large driver of currency trends. Chandler outlines the current market environment: at the end of 2007, Germany’s two-year bund yielded more than 100 basis points higher than the U.S. two-year. Today the U.S. two-year yields more than 125 basis points above the German two-year bund. This could drive capital flows to the U.S.  
Against the backdrop of the Fed’s continuing to hike next year and the ECB potentially having to do more QE if inflation remains low, interest rate differentials may stay in favor of the U.S. As a result, it is likely that the U.S. dollar will remain well supported from the perspective of interest rate differentials.  
Challenging Environment for EM Currencies  
While EM currencies are currently inexpensive based on historical measures of valuations, Chandler states that they are likely to get even less expensive. There are a host of factors that contribute to this general pessimism, the first of which being lower-for-longer commodity prices that are likely to push EM currencies lower. Additionally, lower commodity prices have led to a decrease in companies’ profitability—particularly in the metals, mining and energy sectors—which have, subsequently, led to cuts in dividends. EM currencies can account for a large chunk of underperformance across both the equity (historically one-third of returns) and fixed income asset classes (historically two-thirds of volatility in returns).  
Secondly, there are serious geopolitical issues in the EM block. The geopolitical landscape for many EM countries—Russia, Brazil, South Africa, Turkey and Malaysia, to name a few—makes the perspectives for EM currencies less encouraging.  
 
China Unlikely to Drastically Weaken Currency 
Chandler believes it is more likely that China will weaken its currency only modestly. While a strong dollar is appropriate for the U.S., it is increasingly inappropriate for China, given the country’s growth considerations—having pegged its currency to a large degree to the U.S. dollar. Chandler believes it is likely for the Chinese yuan to experience a slow depreciation, possibly moving 3%–5% next year. Given China’s large trade surplus, which ranges between $50 and $60 billion per month, the political backlash may be severe if China depreciates its currency drastically.  
Bottom Line 
In summary, divergent central bank policies in developed markets are likely to result in further U.S. dollar strength against the euro and the yen. While the current market environment may be challenging for EM, a first rate hike from the Fed and a subsequent slow pace of hikes may provide the region with some temporary reprieve.

Important Risks Related to this Article
Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty.
Investments in emerging, offshore or frontier markets are generally less liquid and less efficient than investments in developed markets and are subject to additional risks, such as risks of adverse governmental regulation and intervention or political developments.
Investments focused in Japan or Europe increase the impact of events and developments associated with those regions, which can adversely affect performance.

		Investors in 2017 are facing a world in transition. The result of the U.S. presidential election and the earlier vote by British citizens to leave the European Union potentially reflect populist sentiment that appears to be challenging the decades-long march of globalization. What’s more, investors are recognizing that aggressive central bank stimulus may have reached its limits, and a transition to fiscal policy is at hand. Where should investors turn in such an environment? Our 2017 Outlook takes a trip around the globe, detailing the most important economic and investment themes as well as the portfolio implications from investing in a changing world.
	

		The global economy continues along its low-growth path, but there are a number of bright spots. In the U.S., despite the political uncertainty, a strengthening consumer is driving stronger growth. A large fiscal stimulus under the new administration could well provide another boost to the U.S. economy. And in many emerging markets the rebound that began in 2016 appears to have momentum, supported by higher commodities prices and structural reforms. Europe remains challenged by uncertainty about the future of the European Union, low growth and high unemployment. 
	

		A seven-year equity bull market has lifted stock valuations in the U.S., but many parts of the world are trading at discounts. Emerging markets and international markets are both below their 10-year average price-to-earnings ratio. Political and economic uncertainty remains, but there are bargains to be found for active investors seeking solid companies at attractive prices.
	

		U.S. government bond yields are near record lows, but are actually quite high relative to the rest of the world. Currently, 10-year Treasuries yield more than 85% of developed market sovereign debt. Even if U.S. rates rise and the new presidential administration’s policies are inflationary, the “lower for longer” trend seems sustainable well into next year while Europe and Japan continue to experiment with negative policy rates and quantitative easing.
	

		Results from the U.S. presidential election and Britain’s vote to leave the European Union highlighted a year where political populism gained momentum. But even amid that uncertainty, markets climbed a wall of worry in 2016. The lesson for this? It’s better to stick to your long-term plan and not get distracted by the latest political drama. Looking ahead, policy changes will affect individual businesses in different ways, so active investors will have an opportunity to build attractive company-by-company portfolios.
