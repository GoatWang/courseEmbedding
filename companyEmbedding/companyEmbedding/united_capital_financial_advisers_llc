Talk Is Cheap: Automation Takes Aim at Financial Advisers—and Their Fees
Posted by hkarner  -  28. Juli 2017

Date: 27-07-2017
Source: The Wall Street Journal
Services that use algorithms to generate investment advice, deliver it online and charge low fees are pressuring the traditional advisory business
Automation is threatening one of the most personal businesses in personal finance: advice.
Over the past decade, financial advisers in brokerage houses and independent firms have amassed trillions in assets helping individuals shape investment portfolios and hammer out financial plans. They earn around 1% of these assets in annual fees, a cost advisers say is deserved because they understand clients’ particular situations and can provide assurance when markets fall.
In the latest test of the reach of technology, a new breed of competitors— including Betterment LLC and Wealthfront Inc. but also initiatives from established firms such as Vanguard—is contending even the most personal financial advice can be delivered online, over the phone or by videoconferencing, with fees as low as zero. The goal is to provide good-enough quality at a much lower price.
“It’s always been questionable whether or not advisers were earning our money at 1% and up,” said Paul Auslander, director of financial planning at ProVise Management Group in Clearwater, Fla., who says potential clients now compare him with less expensive alternatives. „The spread’s got to narrow.”
The shift has big implications for financial firms that count on advice as a source of stable profits, as well as for rivals trying to build new businesses at lower prices. It also could mean millions in annual savings for consumers and could expand the overall market for advice.
Competitors across the spectrum agree the demand is there. Advice “is big and growing—it’s what clients are looking for,” said Roger Hobby, executive vice president of private wealth management at Fidelity Investments.
The hunger for help marks a shift from the 1990s, when do-it-yourself investing was in vogue. Back then, the adoption of 401(k) plans moved responsibility for investment choices to company employees just as one of the biggest bull markets in history was boosting individuals’ confidence in their investing prowess. Meanwhile, pioneering online brokerage firms made trading inexpensive and convenient.
After internet stocks collapsed in 2000, along with the broader stock market eight years later, many individuals sought help. In the past decade, baby boomers started to retire and wanted technical guidance on drawing down their assets.
The advice industry expanded with the demand. Besides managing people’s investment portfolios—handling the trades, not merely suggesting them—some financial advisers also provide help with budgets or tax and estate planning.
Note: Based on firms with at least $100 million in total assets under management. Assets charted are those for which the firm, rather than the client, makes investment decisions. Data for 12-month periods ending March 31.
Source: Securities and Exchange Commission
The number of advisory firms grew to almost 3,900 in 2017, up from fewer than 750 in 2002, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Securities and Exchange Commission data. This universe of firms handles at least $100 million in assets each and provides both investment management and financial planning to individuals.
As of March 2017, such firms collectively had $5.5 trillion in assets on which they made investment decisions, the Journal’s analysis found. That is about six times as much as in 2002.
Throughout this period, advice fees have largely held steady—typically 1% of assets, with a potential discount for big accounts. One reason the standard held is many clients value aspects of advice that can’t always be measured or easily compared.
C. Lansdowne Hunt, 72, of Burke, Va., said he became more price-conscious after his portfolio fell 31% in the late-2008 stock-market meltdown. So in 2012, he switched to a less expensive adviser, and this year, asked for a discount on its 0.9% fee.
After being rebuffed, Mr. Hunt shopped for a new adviser for his $1.3 million portfolio at firms including Charles Schwab Corp., TD Ameritrade Inc. and Edward Jones. The former Naval officer and defense-contractor employee concluded his current Virginia advisory firm offers services, such as tax-sensitive investing and stock picking, that might be hard to replicate for a lower cost.
“I couldn’t get the exact twin,” he said.
Many firms are wagering that other customers will take less, for less.
About two years ago, Vanguard Group, known for serving do-it-yourselfers, started undercutting the financial-adviser industry with an annual advice fee of 0.3%.
Assets in its service, which combines recommendations from computer-driven algorithms with phone, video and email consultations with human advisers, grew to about $35 billion in the first year and to $83 billion by end of last month, according to the firm.
Joe McDonald of Titus, Ala., was an early customer. Long a do-it-yourself investor, he decided he needed an adviser after making an ill-timed move into an all-cash portfolio after Barack Obama’s 2008 election.
“I pulled out and stayed in cash until 2014, which was a terrible mistake,” said the 74-year-old retired electrical engineer. “I found I didn’t really have the discipline to stick with my own plan.”
He thought about hiring a traditional adviser in Florida who charges 1% of assets under management. His wife wasn’t comfortable entrusting money with someone she didn’t know, he said.
Mr. McDonald said he first invested in a mutual fund from Vanguard in 1983. He liked its 0.3% fee on an account with advice, and moved his roughly $500,000 in retirement accounts there.
“Expenses don’t mean a whole lot if you are making 10% a year,” Mr. McDonald said, ”but if you are making 2% or 3% a year, they are a real big deal.”
At Schwab, assets handled by financial advisers, including those at independent firms that use Schwab’s services, now account for more than half of the firm’s total assets. In recent years, the discount brokerage firm has added a range of options for those seeking advice, including a “robo” service introduced in 2015 that uses algorithms to build and monitor portfolios.
At Fidelity, assets handled with financial advice, either from the firm or from independent advisers who use its services, have nearly doubled over five years.
Part of the shift is generational, as younger adults appear to trust technology more than what they see as salesmanship. “Kids are saying to their parents, ‘Why the hell are you paying so much to your adviser? Is it worth 1% a year to have somebody to play golf with?’ ” said Joe Duran, chief executive of United Capital Financial Advisers LLC, an investment-management and financial-planning firm that also provides services to advisers.
Independent robo advisers that target younger customers—with fees as low as zero for the smallest accounts—have enjoyed hefty growth. Betterment and Wealthfront say they manage $9.7 billion and $7.1 billion in assets, respectively, up from $5.1 billion and $3.5 billion a year ago.
Morgan Stanley , UBS Group AG, Wells Fargo & Co. and Bank of AmericaCorp.’s Merrill Lynch, known for providing full-frills service at top rates, are testing or have already launched automated-advice ventures that charge less than their standard fees. The goal is to keep fee-conscious and lower-balance customers.
Some dealmakers are buying up traditional financial advisers with an eye toward consolidating and cutting costs, saying the industry has too many firms with outmoded technology and high overhead. The first half of 2017 was the most active yet for mergers and acquisitions among financial advisers, according to consulting and investment-banking firm DeVoe & Co.
The myriad pressures have traditional financial advisers investing in timesaving technology to cut costs. Some are passing along part of the savings to clients through fee reductions, while others are adding services to justify maintaining their fees. According to a survey from research firm Cerulli Associates, 79% of executives at advisory firms expect their fees to fall within the next five years.
Ann Gugle, a principal at Alpha Financial Advisors in Charlotte, N.C., said her firm recently cut its annual fee on assets of over $5 million to 0.125% from 0.25%. “If you do the math, you realize your practice will be worth significantly more if you’re smart about aligning your pricing with the value you deliver,” said Ms. Gugle. “If not, you’re going to be mincemeat.”
Robert Schmansky, a solo practitioner in Livonia, Mich., dropped his advisory fee to 0.85% from 1% earlier this year.
Until recently, Mr. Schmansky said, he has mainly marketed himself as a fiduciary—someone committed to working in the client’s best interests. Now he finds himself in direct competition with Vanguard, Schwab and others that also call themselves fiduciaries. “My key marketing distinction is being eroded by these firms in some ways.”
He said he works with a lot of younger investors, and “when I tell them my fee is 1%, they know immediately that Betterment costs less.”
Of all the initiatives, Vanguard’s is widely cited as the most threatening to the status quo. The firm’s size, brand recognition and aggressive pricing will create a challenge unlike anything independent advisers have seen before, said Michael Kitces, director of wealth management at Pinnacle Advisory Group Inc. in Columbia, Md.—much as Vanguard’s index funds have wreaked havoc on the traditional mutual-fund business.
Vanguard’s Personal Advisor Services (minimum investment: $50,000), has gained traction because customers want it, said Karin Risi, head of the firm’s retail investor group: “They didn’t just want to invest in a fund with us—they were saying they needed more help.”
So far, only about 10% of assets in the program comes from clients new to the firm. Advisers and industry analysts say it is only a matter of time before the service starts poaching more clients from competitors.
Vanguard has devoted about 500 financial advisers to its venture, said Ms. Risi. She expects the firm to hire roughly 100 advisers annually for the next several years. Clients with more than $500,000 get a dedicated adviser, who is a certified financial planner; those with less interact with rotating advisers drawn from a pool, some not yet CFPs.
Many traditional advisers suggest that partially automated services such as Vanguard’s provide basic, cookie-cutter advice inferior to what an experienced financial planner can provide. Ms. Risi said the firm’s advisers go through “pretty impressive training.”
Elyse Foster, an adviser in Boulder, Colo., has taken note. Three years ago, she cut financial-planning fees by an average of 40% at her firm, Harbor Financial Group Inc. It also has invested in technology that allows clients to open accounts online, automatically rebalances portfolios to a target mix of stocks and bonds, and shares software so clients can simulate their own planning scenarios.
“We are aware consumers are more price-conscious and are lowering our fees proactively,” said Ms. Foster. “We are trying to stay ahead of the industry.”

United Capital Seeks Acquisitions
May 4 16
United Capital Financial Advisers LLC is seeking acquisitions. "As the FinLife technology platform takes off, we’re going to tighten the filter even further around acquisitions,” said Matt Brinker, head of national partner development at United Capital. “We’ve always been selective, but I think our selectivity is going to go up a couple notches.” Matt Brinker says the firm is going to look more closely at geography; United Capital wants to partner with firms located in markets where there are opportunities for growth, sub-acquisitions and the ability to attract next generation talent. United Capital launched its white-label advisor technology package last month. The product takes pressure off of United Capital to continue its strategy of growth through acquisitions, and also moves the RIA toward a new role as technology vendor.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
