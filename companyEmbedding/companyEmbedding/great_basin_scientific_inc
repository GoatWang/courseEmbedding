Great Basin Scientific: How $3.23 Equals $14,700 - Great Basin Scientific, Inc. (NASDAQ:GBSN) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Great Basin Scientific: How $3.23 Equals $14,700Apr.22.16 | About: Great Basin (GBSN) Seattle Contributor Deep Value, special situations, contrarian, long/short equitySummaryTwo reverse splits and a de-listing letter have crippled the stock.Liquidity concerns raise doubts regarding the viability of the company.Short sellers smell blood.Great Basin Scientific (NASDAQ:GBSN) 

 is not (and has never been) a common name when talking about well performing stocks. Unlike most companies that have had a 99.999% drop in their stock price, GBSN has sales of actual products and has a large staff of full-time employees and has actual FDA approvals for their equipment. It is worth mentioning at this time that GBSN is not a start-up drug company. So what is going on with the stock? A History of Great Basin's Stock Great Basin commenced their Initial Public Offering on October 8, 2014. Per the company's 2014 SEC Annual Report filing: "On October 8, 2014, the SEC declared effective our initial public offering registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-197954) related to 1,150,000 shares of common stock and 1,150,000 Series A Warrants, which were sold in combinations of one share of common stock and one Series A Warrant at a public offering price of $7.00 per unit. Each Series A Warrant is exercisable for one share of common stock and one Series B Warrant. In addition, the managing underwriter, Dawson James Securities, Inc. exercised its option to purchase 172,500 Series A Warrants." From the humble beginnings of that 1.15 million share public offering GBSN went on an unprecedented dilution spree. In December 2015 a 1:60 reverse split was effected. Subsequently, just four months later in March 2016 a 1:35 reverse split was effected. Adjusted for these two splits the IPO shares have fallen from $14,700 a share to the current $3.23 at the close of trading April 21, 2016, despite trading on the NASD CM platform. So lets examine how that transpired.
 

 So what led to the free fall in the stock price? Thanks to warrants offerings and conversions the company issued shares at a pace that was similar to the pace of water falling from Niagara Falls. 

 Management has been forthright regarding the dilution and the need for it to change in the future. In the most recent press release where the company discussed their results they stated: "As we've outlined in two recent press releases, we are preparing our plan for returning to compliance, continuing compliance with Nasdaq rules on the market value of listed securities. And we are very optimistic that we will be granted the extension we need to regain compliance. The plan for returning to compliance is also the same as the plan for simplifying our capital structure. And over the past four months, we have made significant progress in reducing those risks as well. We eliminated the highly dilutive series C warrants. We have also eliminated the series E warrants at a significantly reduced level of dilution than we would have faced at a later date. And our finance team, led by our CFO, Jeff Rona and our new banker, ROTH Capital Partners, has worked to assure that our two recent financings have each been progressively less dilutive than the financings that preceded them. And we are committed to do all we can to continue that trend as we look to return to the capital markets in the second half of 2016."
 That last sentence is the one that stands out. Earlier this year GBSN announced that they received a delisting notice from NASD. The company has requested a hearing with NASD to explain how they will be NASD compliant in the future, but the company is offering no specifics to shareholders at the current time. It is likely that it is this return to the capital markets that will enable GBSN to be NASD compliant in 2016. Hopefully this capital raise will not be highly dilutive to current shareholders, but based on history that is an unlikely scenario. Operational Metrics As mentioned earlier, GBSN does indeed have actual products and sales. Here is the company description per their 10-K: "We are a molecular diagnostic testing company focused on the development and commercialization of our patented, molecular diagnostic platform designed to test for infectious disease, especially hospital-acquired infections." As of December 31, 2015, GBSN had 134 full-time employees. Great Basin is not a shell company or a scam. That is undisputed. What is disputed is whether the company has a viable business plan that will enable it to survive. Growth In the April 14, 2016, GBSN business update conference call extracted from SA's archives CEO Ryan Ashton made the following comments regarding the business:  Earlier this afternoon, we released our preliminary first quarter revenues and customer numbers. It was our strongest quarter to date by a significant margin with - where revenue increased 59.4% year-over-year to approximately $731,000. This also represented a sequential increase of 19.5% over the prior quarter, the fourth quarter of 2015. We also announced that we ended the first quarter with 222 revenue generating customers, an increase of 36 customers from 186 at the end of the fourth quarter. This is more than double our customer acquisition rate in the first quarter of 2015 when we added 17 new customers. In 2015 we added 102 customers, ending the year at 186. And today, we are providing guidance on our customer acquisition. We expect to add between 115 and 140 new customers in 2016 and end the year with between 300 and 325 customers. The guidance for 2016 and 2017 are that in 2016 we expect to end the year with 300 to 325 customers and four FDA cleared tests, another five tests either in trial or already submitted to the FDA. And in 2017, we expect to end the year with 500 to 550 customers, nine FDA cleared tests, and another five to six tests either in trial or already submitted to the FDA. 
 There is no question that the company has products/machines that are needed. These products/machines are FDA approved. The company is selling them. But they are losing more and more money with every unit they sell. How can GBSN reverse this and stop the need for more capital (and subsequent dilution)? From the 2015 Annual Report, here are the revenue and P/L numbers:  

 For 2015 Great Basin recorded a net loss of $57.9 million (of which $19.7 million was an operating loss) on revenues of just $2.142 million. To put it bluntly, for every dollar in revenues the company generated they lose almost $10 in 2015. This is a major deterioration from the ~$5 lost for every revenue dollar generated in 2014. In other words, the more GBSN sells the more they lose. The company's products are manufactured manually. The lack of automation allows no economies of scale. In 2015 GBSN ended the year with two FDA cleared tests. The company guidance calls for 2016 to end with the company having four cleared FDA tests and 2017 projections are for nine FDA cleared tests (with another five to six tests either in trial or submitted to the FDA). Research and Development Spending Full speed ahead! That is the only way of describing the R&D spending of GBSN. Spending increased from $4.6 million in 2014 to $8.5 million in 2015. Between the positive comments made by Mr. Ashton regarding 2016 and 2017 guidance and the corresponding R&D spending, GBSN does indeed seem to have the potential to be a market mover in the coming years (as long as the cash flow allows it). Short interest The stock of GBSN has clearly been on the radar of shorts and momentum players lately. The following is the short interest as reported by NASDAQ.com:
 

 While 219,500 shares does not seem to be a large number, you need to remember that there are only 3.3 million shares of GBSN stock outstanding. Also of note is that for April 2016 the average trading volume is over 2 million shares a day. That represents over 60% of the shares outstanding changing hands every day. Clearly this is not ordinary trading activity for GBSN or "any" stock. Conclusion So what does it all mean? The business model may not be broken, but it definitely exhibits stress fractures. There seems to be a definite need for Great Basin's products. Sales are ramping up quickly. Great Basin however needs to find a way to produce their test units for less money. This is key to their survival. If we are to take management at their word regarding both the growth and the company's willingness to control future dilution, GBSN is a VERY speculative opportunity. With a market capitalization of $10 million, most of the risk seems to have been eliminated. Disclaimer: Investing in penny stocks such as Great Basin can be risky.

                                   GBSN http://www.gbscience.com/    GREAT BASIN SCIENTIFIC, INC., 2441 SOUTH 3850 WEST, SALT LAKE CITY, UT 84210 PHONE: 801-990-1055; TOLLFREE: 888-360-4022; CUSTOMER SUPPORT: 888-333-9793     ***News Out: 6/27/2017 Great Basin Provides Business Update***   http://gbscience.com/great-basin-provides-business-update/   New Business Pipeline exceeds $5.0 million in potential new revenue; Nearly $2.0 million in potential pipeline revenue is from Stool Bacterial PathogensPanel, currently awaiting FDA clearance  Salt Lake City, June 26, 2017 – Great Basin Scientific, Inc. (OTCQB: GBSN), a molecular diagnostics company, today provided a general business update on the Company, focusing on its efforts to drive growth in second half 2017 and into 2018 through an expanded menu of diagnostic panels and tests.  Highlights include:  New business pipeline exceeds $5.0 million, an increase of 123% over the fourth quarter of 2016; 	Pipeline includes $1.96 million in expected annual revenue from the Company’s Stool Bacterial Pathogens Panel (SBPP), currently awaiting expected 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA); 	Average expected annual revenue of sites in evaluation increases 279% to $47,866 compared with $12,620 in the second quarter of 2016; and 	New customer sites now comprise 34% of new business pipeline.  “We are pleased to see such exciting results from the large investments we made in 2016 to diversify and expand our product menu. Already, we believe the potential revenues of our new business pipeline exceed our revenues for all of fiscal year 2016,” said Ryan Ashton, co-founder and chief executive officer of Great Basin Scientific. “Especially encouraging has been the response to our most important product, the Stool Bacterial Pathogens Panel, currently awaiting FDA clearance. We will not commence sales and marketing outreach on that panel until we receive FDA clearance, but inbound demand has been promising, and, based on the pre-clearance demand, we expect to see our new business pipeline growth accelerate once we receive FDA clearance for this important assay.” Ashton continued, “In addition to menu expansion and new business progress, we also continue to execute our cash management program, which was initiated in late 2016. This program is intended to re-align Company resources from a heavy focus on product development to an increased focus on customer acquisition and revenue growth. We expect our cash burn rate to continue to decline during 2017, and reiterate our target for total operating expenses at or below $4.0 million for the third quarter of 2017, proving our dedication to executing on the fundamentals that will both serve our target market and our stockholders.” New Business Pipeline and Product Mix As of June 22, 2017, the Company had approximately $5.0 million of potential new revenues in the new business pipeline. These potential revenue estimates, as well as those below are based on the evaluating site’s own estimate of their expected testing volumes multiplied by the product price offered to the prospective customer[1]. The Company’s highest-value multiplex panels – Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel (SIDR) and Stool Bacterial Pathogens Panel (SBPP) SBPP – comprise 34% of new customer site evaluations in the new business pipeline. Staph ID/R has a list price 50% above that of the Company’s low-plex tests, with the same general cost-of-goods as the low-plex assays. SBPP, which is awaiting 510(k) clearance from the FDA, comprises 25% of the new customer evaluations in the pipeline. SBPP, when commercially available, will have a list price 2-3 times higher than the Company’s low-plex tests. Based on customer feedback, the Company anticipates significant pipeline growth for SBPP once it receives FDA clearance and the Company is free to market the panel. The new business pipeline follows: To the extent these evaluations and scheduled evaluations are converted into customers, we expect such conversions to occur between the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018. The Company’s historical “win rate” (those evaluations that elect to become customers) has been 82%. New Customers from Larger Hospitals and Labs Mark Largest Evaluation Growth A substantial increase in the number of larger hospitals and labs in the new business pipeline, along with greater interest in the Company’s newest and higher-priced panels, is resulting in significant growth in the Company’s expected average annual revenue per customer. Expected annual revenue from new customers evaluating the Company’s products increased approximately 279% from the second quarter of 2016 and 186% from the third quarter of 2016. This significant increase occurred prior to launch of the Company’s first mid-plex panel, its Staph ID/R Blood Culture Panel for blood sepsis caused by staphylococcus species. The Company believes its expanded product mix of low-, mid- and multi-plex assays is the primary driver of the increase in expected average revenue per customer, and believes this trend will accelerate with the addition of SBPP to its commercial offerings, as well as the anticipated development of other, higher-priced assays in the future. The chart below shows the average expected annual revenue of new customer evaluation starts by quarter: Stool Bacterial Pathogens Panel (SBPP) The Company expects its SBPP assay to be its primary growth driver in 2018, having already seen large demand for this assay pre-FDA clearance. The Company believes this response has been driven by three factors:  SBPP addresses, by far, the largest market of any of the Company’s products—that for the approximately 48 million food-borne illnesses that occur annually in the United States; 	The assay fulfills an unmet need by providing a powerful, focused set of answers that allow clinicians to quickly and accurately diagnose and treat their patients suffering from food-borne gastrointestinal distress; and 	The Company’s low-cost structure allows it to offer its hospital and lab customers a powerful value proposition. The test will be priced below expected reimbursement rates, which means SBPP can be run profitably by customers.  According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), there are 48 million food-borne (bacterial) illnesses annually in the United States. SBPP powerfully addresses this large market where current solutions are either too slow (culture) or too expensive relative to reimbursement rates (mega-plex panels). The Company believes its low-cost, easy-to-use solution will drive placements for its system, accelerating revenue growth and, because of SBPP’s higher selling price and exceptional gross margins, resulting in profitability. In late December 2016, the Company submitted its 510(k) application for SBPP to the FDA. Previous 510(k) clearances for the Company’s assays have been approximately 180 days from submission to clearance, with the Company’s first FDA-cleared mid-plex panel, Staph ID/R, requiring 205 days. Mid-Plex Panels and Reimbursement as a Competitive Driver In late April 2017, Medicare contractor Palmetto GBA issued a draft of Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs)[2] proposing reimbursement coverage for a variety of diagnostic panels, including Foodborne Gastrointestinal Panels Identified by Multiplex Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs), recommending the use of smaller, more targeted panels over larger and broader panels. Their reasoning for non-coverage included the fact that the pathogen targets in larger (more than five pathogens) panels don’t represent a common syndrome, and that many targets can be very rare. “A panel that includes pathogens that are very rare, or a panel in which all pathogens do not cause overlapping clinical syndromes, or when some pathogens are found only in specific patient populations (immuno-compromised patients) is not reasonable and necessary,” Palmetto wrote. This recommendation supports Great Basin’s mid-plex panel approach of smaller panels that represent a common syndrome, for which there is broad applicability and, per Palmetto’s recommendation, offers a lower rate of reimbursement denial. “In ongoing discussions with customers and prospects, they report a strong preference for smaller panels targeting the most common pathogens, noting high-cost molecular diagnostic mega-panels are meeting reimbursement resistance from payors and clinical resistance from clinicians who prefer a more targeted, therapy-focused set of answers for their patients. This preference maps to the updated reimbursement recommendations being issued from payors like Palmetto, reinforcing our mid-plex panel strategy,” said Sandra Nielsen, senior vice president of sales and marketing for Great Basin Scientific. “We are excited about the opportunity to serve the needs of clinicians with SBPP and our in-development Stool Parasite Panel, two right-sized, cost effective panels that we believe will offer a significant competitive advantage over either culture or our competitors’ high-cost molecular diagnostic mega-panels.” About Great Basin Scientific Great Basin Scientific is a molecular diagnostics company that commercializes breakthrough chip-based technologies.

These bacteria attach to the cilia (tiny, hair-like extensions) that line part of the upper respiratory system. The bacteria release toxins (poisons), which damage the cilia and cause airways to swell. Pertussis is a very contagious disease only found in humans. It is spread from person to person. People with pertussis usually spread the disease to another person by coughing or sneezing or when spending a lot of time near one another where you share breathing space. Many babies who get pertussis are infected by older siblings, parents, or caregivers who might not even know they have the disease.

Dedicated to developing simple yet powerful point-of-care technology and products

The System 

Great Basin’s diagnostic system provides the answers health care providers need to rule out possible causes and define a clear treatment path which means a huge time-savings for a strained healthcare system and quicker recovery for patients.
Overview
Great Basin’s diagnostic system employs an integrated disposable cartridge containing all necessary reagents, and an inexpensive bench-top analyzer that executes the assay, interprets the results and provides electronic output to the clinician.
The Process
A clinician places an unprocessed clinical specimen into the cartridge, caps, then places the cartridge into the analyzer. The test routine is initiated in the analyzer for a simple automated process.  Within the instrument, simple mechanical valves are present to control the flow of fluid through the cartridge and to pierce the blister packs.  Low cost and reliable heaters are present for assay processing.  Imaging occurs with a simple CCD camera placed over a window in the cartridge above the chip.  The image is converted into a clinical result that is provided to the clinical laboratory.
The disposable cartridge contains—in blister packs or lyophilized—all of the reagents required to run the test.  The main analytical steps of the assay (sample prep, amplification, and detection) are performed in chambers present on the cartridge; all waste is collected in a chamber and the system is closed so that no contamination of the laboratory occurs.
To simplify processing within the analyzer, fluids are moved within the cartridge through relatively large channels by exploiting pressure differences.  Proprietary features have been designed into the cartridge to allow for bubble-free fluid movement and novel sensor design permits accurate and precise volumetric delivery.

					Full Description



Great Basin Scientific, Inc., incorporated on August 12, 2008, is a molecular diagnostic testing company. The Company is focused on the development and commercialization of its molecular diagnostic platform designed to test for infectious diseases, especially hospital-acquired infections. The Company has commercially available tests for clostridium difficile (C. diff) and Group B Strep. Its system includes an analyzer and a diagnostic cartridge. Each analyzer contains a module into, which individual test cartridges are placed. Its other diagnostic assays in the late stages of product development include a pre-surgical nasal screen for Staphylococcus aureus (SA), food borne pathogen panel, panel for candida blood infections, test for pertussis and a test for Chlamydia tracomatis (CT)/Neisseria gonorrhea (NG). It also has a pipeline of assays in an early stage of development, including respiratory testing and sepsis (blood infection) panels. The Company markets a platform of molecular testing in small to medium sized hospitals.The Company's C. diff test is a rapid medical diagnostic test for the detection of C. diff, a gram-positive bacteria that causes severe diarrhea and other intestinal disorders. The test detects the presence of the C. diff toxin B gene, or tcdB gene, in the pathogenicity locus (PaLOC) region of C. diff, present in all known toxigenic strains, to diagnose the toxin in a patient's stool. The test requires minimal sample preparation and can deliver results in over 90 minutes. The Company's Group B Strep test is designed to detect Group B Strep from an anal/vaginal swab taken from a pregnant woman. Hospitals can use its test to identify Group B Strep colonization in pregnant women, who can then be treated with antibiotics to reduce the risk of transmission to the baby, reducing the risk of development of sepsis in the newborn. Its Group B Strep test utilizes polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The Company sells its diagnostic tests through a direct sales force in the United States, as well as through distributors in the European Union and New Zealand.The Company's assays in clinical trials include Staphylococcus identification and resistance blood infection panel, which is designed to identify species of Staphylococcus infections, detect the mecA gene that confers drug resistance directly from positive blood cultures, and provide information on the antibiotic resistance profile of the bacteria, and Shiga Toxin Producing E.Coli (STEC) Test, which is a rapid test that identifies shiga toxin produced by E. coli, including Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:H7. Its assays, which are in development include Staphyloccocus aureus pre-surgical nasal screen, a rapid test for the presence of SA in the nasal passages of a pre-surgical patient; food borne pathogen panel, which is designed to detect the causes of food poisoning, and Candida blood infections panel that is designed to identify the five species of Candida directly from positive blood cultures. Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is a respiratory disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis is in pre-clinical development. The Chlamydial infections in women can lead to serious consequences, including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), tubal factor infertility, ectopic pregnancy and chronic pelvic pain. The Company's CT/NG test is in pre-clinical development. Its technology is engaged in the detection of on-chip helicase dependent amplification (HDA) reactions. Its technology can detect deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) target strands of interest by attaching complementary strands of DNA to the chip surface, called capture probes, using its technology and processes.The Company competes with Cepheid, Meridian Bioscience, Inc., Nanosphere, Inc., Qiagen NV, Roche Diagnostics, Quidel Corporation, bioMerieux, T2 Biosystems, Becton, Dickinson and Company, GenMark Diagnostics, Inc. and Hologic.
