QuickLogic: Pre-Q2 2017 Results - Accumulate Opportunistically - QuickLogic Corporation (NASDAQ:QUIK) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»QuickLogic: Pre-Q2 2017 Results - Accumulate OpportunisticallyJul.21.17 | About: QuickLogic Corporation (QUIK) Jay Deahna Long/short equity, value, Growth, techSummaryQuickLogic will report C2Q2017 in early August - maintain $4 stock price target and recommend acquiring shares opportunistically in the $1.25-1.75 range prior to the results.Recent design wins illustrate holistic value of the EOS S3 and are encouraging.Samsung Gear Fit Pro applied for FCC approval, so may finally be happening soon, perhaps with the expected Samsung Galaxy Note 8 launch in August.In my last report on QuickLogic (NASDAQ:QUIK) in May, I stated the following:  QuickLogic CEO Brian Faith stated on the recent 1Q2017 results conference call that he would likely be able to discuss more specific design wins in general when the company reports C2Q2017 results that should drive the beginning of a potentially sustained revenue uptick in the third and fourth quarters of this year.  From my view, the company is ready for revenue in terms of new product maturity, design tools, and ecosystem partners, but it has to execute design engagements to design wins, to revenue, then broaden its penetration of existing customers and use new business as reference points to penetrate even more new customers. So, the bottom line, the runners are all lined up, and we just need to hear the starter’s pistol fire so QuickLogic can start showing its investors the money!! Maintain a $4 stock price target and recommend acquiring shares opportunistically over the next few months.  First, on the stock, I maintain the same position and recommend accumulating the stock anywhere in $1.25-1.75 range prior to C2Q2017 results in early August, as I think QuickLogic is poised to start a sustained revenue ramp that should slowly but surely gain momentum and possibly hit an acceleration point sometime in 2018. Maintain $4 stock price target. Regarding design wins, there were two announced via press release in late June, both in China, and I suspect there are more that the company is not authorized to announce. One design win is for a voice-enabled Bluetooth headset with a company called Qiwo that should start to generate revenue for QuickLogic in 4Q2017. It doesn’t look like this deal is going to move the needle a lot in terms of near-term company-wide revenue acceleration, but there are a number of interesting dynamics around this that seem to bode well for QuickLogic in the market, in general.
  The EOS S3 is the host processor in the headset, which means it is a critical component that enables the functionality of the device. As such, the ASP should be in the $2 range, which is a very good, high margin price point for QuickLogic. The ultra low power usage of the EOS S3 device was important in this design win. The solution utilizes two of QuickLogic’s ecosystem partners, Sensory for voice recognition and AI Speech, a new partner, for word recognition for connection to the AI Speech cloud-based digital assistant. Importantly, there was an encouraging quote from the CEO of Qiwo: “The QuickLogic EOS S3 SoC provided us the lowest possible power consumption for new voice enabled headsets” and “With its multi-core design, integrated voice technology and inherent flexibility to address multiple use cases, we look forward to incorporating the EOS S3 solution in future wearable and IoT designs. We believe this strategy will help us accelerate new product development, address multiple use cases from a single platform and leverage broad market penetration that Qihoo has established in China”.  So, relative to my statement above from my last report, regarding the need to penetrate new customers and obtain actual design wins and then translate that into more business on other products with the same customers, this is a prime example of what I am looking for. QuickLogic penetrated the account on the strength of its technology and its ecosystem AND impressed the customer enough that they plan to develop other products with QuickLogic. This is good in and of itself, and also good for marketing to other potential customers. So, it appears the initial design win that should generate initial revenue in C4Q2017 should ultimately lead to decent business with this customer in general in the large and rapidly growing Chinese market. This looks like solid tactical execution of QuickLogic’s market penetration strategy, in general, and in China, specifically. Now, as investors in QuickLogic, we need to see more of the same proliferate. Bottom line, this is encouraging news flow. I get why it popped the stock.
 The second announced design win is with another Chinese company called Janyun for a voice-enabled GPS smartwatch. This design win also utilizes ecosystem partner Sensory and looks to be the start of a broader array of business for QuickLogic with Janyun for various wearable and IoT products. This is a decent initial product penetration for QuickLogic and also comes with nice executive commentary from Janyun indicating deeper involvement between the two companies over time. Similar to the Qiwo deal, this also represents a nice tactical execution of the broader customer and market penetration strategy in an important region. What was most impressive to me is the commentary from Janyun regarding how creative it was in utilizing all of the available blocks within the QuickLogic EOS S3 System-on-Chip (SOC) product, which is unique in the market compared to straight microcontrollers, and this is a very good sign, in my view. Also, the ultra low power competitive edge seems to have played a role in this design win as well and appears to validate QuickLogic’s arguments on the advantage of its ultra low power consumption. Of interest, the ARM Cortex M4F embedded into the EOS S3 is the core host processor for the smartwatch. The Flexible fusion Engine (FFE) block is used to process proprietary Janyun algorithms at ultra low power while integrated Sensory technology is utilized to deliver the voice interface, also at ultra low power. The onboard eFPGA block is programmed specifically for Janyun as the display driver and GPS interface. Despite the tiny size of the EOS S3, this is a sophisticated overall use of the device and clearly illustrates the System-on-Chip nature of the device versus competitive and more generic microcontrollers, especially the eFPGA block that is quite unique. Combined, these two design wins and the likelihood of more from both customers are quite encouraging in terms of executing the sales and marketing objectives required to ramp material revenue for QuickLogic overall in a steady and consistent manner. If QuickLogic can maintain a portfolio of design wins at numerous customers, meaning multiple products, it substantially reduces the risk of “round trip” product cycle revenue on one major product and helps cement a longer term relationship, or as investors like to see, a sustained competitive advantage.
 At a minimum, solid initial penetrations with these two accounts, in my view, and we will see what kind of revenue ultimately materializes from these two new customers and how “growthy” and sustainable it becomes. As I said in my last note, as a tiny company at present, it will be a challenge for QuickLogic to penetrate and serve a multitude of customers from a sales, marketing, and engineering support perspective (not production), but success in this endeavor should drive a more diversified and lower risk revenue growth scenario over time, compared to a few large smartphone design wins that may or may not sustain themselves over time from model to model. I expect to hear about new design engagements, but more importantly, other design wins on the C2Q2017 results call in addition to those mentioned above. If so, that will be important. With that said, I expect C3Q2017 revenue guidance to be up sequentially from 2Q but somewhat lackluster with indications of more to come in 4Q. 4Q should be a decent uptick with contribution from both EOS S3 and ultra high margin eFPGA licensing deals. 2018 should be a pretty decent year with the potential for revenue acceleration at some point, but I don’t expect a vertical maneuver. Just steady growth, but at some point, an inflection to accelerated revenue growth as a dozen or more customers begin to ramp multiple products and new customers scale in. On another note, there was news flow within the past week on the long awaited Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) “Gear Fit Pro” getting FCC approval. It appears that it really is coming and maybe soon. The New Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is supposed to be announced in August, so maybe in line with that. We will see. Here is a news article on the product: Samsung's Gear Fit Pro Shows Up At The FCC | Androidheadlines.com Assuming QuickLogic reports C2Q2017 results in early August before Samsung officially announces the Gear Fit Pro, QuickLogic may not be able to include potential C3Q2017 revenue from Samsung for this product in its third quarter guidance but may allude to a potentially imminent introduction. This is one reason I don’t expect overly enticing C3Q2017 revenue guidance, but I think there really is a solid chance this time that some will show up in 3Q with a full quarter of contribution likely in 4Q along with a bunch of other EOS S3 design wins that are slated for initial revenue in 4Q and new eFPGA licenses.
 Bottom line, I think the QuickLogic story has some fundamental forward motion that should pick up in terms of pace a bit in the next quarter or two. So, with that said, I’m still on board with QUIK as a long investment and think we will finally start to see some decent and sustainable appreciation in the stock as the second half of 2017 unfolds – more 4Q-weighted I suspect – and into the first half of 2018, assuming new account penetration continues. Risks The primary downside risks to the QuickLogic story and thus QUIK shares are a failure to execute broad-based new design win penetration with the company’s flagship EOS S3 sensor processing device and to attract a broad array of eFPGA licensees.

From my view, the company is ready for revenue in terms of new product maturity, design tools, and ecosystem partners, but it has to execute design engagements to design wins, to revenue, then broaden its penetration of existing customers and use new business as reference points to penetrate even more new customers. So, the bottom line, the runners are all lined up, and we just need to hear the starter’s pistol fire so QuickLogic can start showing its investors the money!! Maintain a $4 stock price target and recommend acquiring shares opportunistically over the next few months.  First, on the stock, I maintain the same position and recommend accumulating the stock anywhere in $1.25-1.75 range prior to C2Q2017 results in early August, as I think QuickLogic is poised to start a sustained revenue ramp that should slowly but surely gain momentum and possibly hit an acceleration point sometime in 2018. Maintain $4 stock price target. Regarding design wins, there were two announced via press release in late June, both in China, and I suspect there are more that the company is not authorized to announce. One design win is for a voice-enabled Bluetooth headset with a company called Qiwo that should start to generate revenue for QuickLogic in 4Q2017. It doesn’t look like this deal is going to move the needle a lot in terms of near-term company-wide revenue acceleration, but there are a number of interesting dynamics around this that seem to bode well for QuickLogic in the market, in general.
  The EOS S3 is the host processor in the headset, which means it is a critical component that enables the functionality of the device. As such, the ASP should be in the $2 range, which is a very good, high margin price point for QuickLogic. The ultra low power usage of the EOS S3 device was important in this design win. The solution utilizes two of QuickLogic’s ecosystem partners, Sensory for voice recognition and AI Speech, a new partner, for word recognition for connection to the AI Speech cloud-based digital assistant. Importantly, there was an encouraging quote from the CEO of Qiwo: “The QuickLogic EOS S3 SoC provided us the lowest possible power consumption for new voice enabled headsets” and “With its multi-core design, integrated voice technology and inherent flexibility to address multiple use cases, we look forward to incorporating the EOS S3 solution in future wearable and IoT designs. We believe this strategy will help us accelerate new product development, address multiple use cases from a single platform and leverage broad market penetration that Qihoo has established in China”.  So, relative to my statement above from my last report, regarding the need to penetrate new customers and obtain actual design wins and then translate that into more business on other products with the same customers, this is a prime example of what I am looking for. QuickLogic penetrated the account on the strength of its technology and its ecosystem AND impressed the customer enough that they plan to develop other products with QuickLogic. This is good in and of itself, and also good for marketing to other potential customers. So, it appears the initial design win that should generate initial revenue in C4Q2017 should ultimately lead to decent business with this customer in general in the large and rapidly growing Chinese market. This looks like solid tactical execution of QuickLogic’s market penetration strategy, in general, and in China, specifically. Now, as investors in QuickLogic, we need to see more of the same proliferate. Bottom line, this is encouraging news flow. I get why it popped the stock.
 The second announced design win is with another Chinese company called Janyun for a voice-enabled GPS smartwatch. This design win also utilizes ecosystem partner Sensory and looks to be the start of a broader array of business for QuickLogic with Janyun for various wearable and IoT products. This is a decent initial product penetration for QuickLogic and also comes with nice executive commentary from Janyun indicating deeper involvement between the two companies over time. Similar to the Qiwo deal, this also represents a nice tactical execution of the broader customer and market penetration strategy in an important region. What was most impressive to me is the commentary from Janyun regarding how creative it was in utilizing all of the available blocks within the QuickLogic EOS S3 System-on-Chip (SOC) product, which is unique in the market compared to straight microcontrollers, and this is a very good sign, in my view. Also, the ultra low power competitive edge seems to have played a role in this design win as well and appears to validate QuickLogic’s arguments on the advantage of its ultra low power consumption. Of interest, the ARM Cortex M4F embedded into the EOS S3 is the core host processor for the smartwatch. The Flexible fusion Engine (FFE) block is used to process proprietary Janyun algorithms at ultra low power while integrated Sensory technology is utilized to deliver the voice interface, also at ultra low power. The onboard eFPGA block is programmed specifically for Janyun as the display driver and GPS interface. Despite the tiny size of the EOS S3, this is a sophisticated overall use of the device and clearly illustrates the System-on-Chip nature of the device versus competitive and more generic microcontrollers, especially the eFPGA block that is quite unique. Combined, these two design wins and the likelihood of more from both customers are quite encouraging in terms of executing the sales and marketing objectives required to ramp material revenue for QuickLogic overall in a steady and consistent manner. If QuickLogic can maintain a portfolio of design wins at numerous customers, meaning multiple products, it substantially reduces the risk of “round trip” product cycle revenue on one major product and helps cement a longer term relationship, or as investors like to see, a sustained competitive advantage.
 At a minimum, solid initial penetrations with these two accounts, in my view, and we will see what kind of revenue ultimately materializes from these two new customers and how “growthy” and sustainable it becomes. As I said in my last note, as a tiny company at present, it will be a challenge for QuickLogic to penetrate and serve a multitude of customers from a sales, marketing, and engineering support perspective (not production), but success in this endeavor should drive a more diversified and lower risk revenue growth scenario over time, compared to a few large smartphone design wins that may or may not sustain themselves over time from model to model. I expect to hear about new design engagements, but more importantly, other design wins on the C2Q2017 results call in addition to those mentioned above. If so, that will be important. With that said, I expect C3Q2017 revenue guidance to be up sequentially from 2Q but somewhat lackluster with indications of more to come in 4Q. 4Q should be a decent uptick with contribution from both EOS S3 and ultra high margin eFPGA licensing deals. 2018 should be a pretty decent year with the potential for revenue acceleration at some point, but I don’t expect a vertical maneuver. Just steady growth, but at some point, an inflection to accelerated revenue growth as a dozen or more customers begin to ramp multiple products and new customers scale in. On another note, there was news flow within the past week on the long awaited Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) “Gear Fit Pro” getting FCC approval. It appears that it really is coming and maybe soon. The New Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is supposed to be announced in August, so maybe in line with that. We will see. Here is a news article on the product: Samsung's Gear Fit Pro Shows Up At The FCC | Androidheadlines.com Assuming QuickLogic reports C2Q2017 results in early August before Samsung officially announces the Gear Fit Pro, QuickLogic may not be able to include potential C3Q2017 revenue from Samsung for this product in its third quarter guidance but may allude to a potentially imminent introduction. This is one reason I don’t expect overly enticing C3Q2017 revenue guidance, but I think there really is a solid chance this time that some will show up in 3Q with a full quarter of contribution likely in 4Q along with a bunch of other EOS S3 design wins that are slated for initial revenue in 4Q and new eFPGA licenses.
 Bottom line, I think the QuickLogic story has some fundamental forward motion that should pick up in terms of pace a bit in the next quarter or two. So, with that said, I’m still on board with QUIK as a long investment and think we will finally start to see some decent and sustainable appreciation in the stock as the second half of 2017 unfolds – more 4Q-weighted I suspect – and into the first half of 2018, assuming new account penetration continues. Risks The primary downside risks to the QuickLogic story and thus QUIK shares are a failure to execute broad-based new design win penetration with the company’s flagship EOS S3 sensor processing device and to attract a broad array of eFPGA licensees.

QuickLogic: Buy The Pullback - QuickLogic Corporation (NASDAQ:QUIK) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»QuickLogic: Buy The PullbackMar.21.17 | About: QuickLogic Corporation (QUIK) Jay Deahna Long/short equity, value, Growth, techSummaryQuickLogic is raising money but this time it is offensive not defensive.A substantial round of design engagement to production negotiations for EOS products is about to unfold and QuickLogic wants to be in a stronger financial position for these discussions.Revenue should bump in 2Q and accelerate in 3Q and beyond aided by the new super high margin eFPGA business.For shareholders, "dilution" is generally considered a dirty word and an evil concept. However, for tiny tech companies with compelling and emerging technology with a ripening market, winning on the strength of their technology but losing on balance sheet weakness is even worse. For about 15 years, I covered the semiconductor capital equipment industry as a sell side equity research analyst, and I can tell you that I saw many small cap semiconductor equipment companies fail to convert solid technology evaluations to production business with major customers due to balance sheet weakness or fear of not being able to keep up with a fast ramp despite winning on technology. Which brings us to QuickLogic's (NASDAQ:QUIK) current conundrum. But let me step back 12 months. Last year about this time, QuickLogic did a secondary offering that could be described as a "desperado" deal that was predicated on survival. The company was a few months away from delivering its initial samples of the EOS S3 device, but its "real deal" design tools for customers were over six months away, its ecosystem was not yet at critical mass, and the company's long-time CEO was about to step down for health reasons. Fast-forward to this year and the story is quite different. As of three or four months ago, the company was finally ready to fully engage potential sensor processing customers with readily available silicon, quick turn design tools, and a critical mass ecosystem. Additionally, the company entered a new line of business, which is actually a new market for its original programmable logic technology that is a high-margin technology licensing and royalty business for embedded field programmable gate arrays or more commonly referred to as eFPGA.
 This new business line has attracted interest from institutional investors and has certainly played a role in the stock price appreciation in QUIK shares from a low of $0.75 when I wrote my first article on QuickLogic last November to the $2.00 area now. At the present time, QuickLogic is in engagement/design in mode with a dozen or more wearable and smartphone makers, many of whom have only begun to gain serious momentum in the past quarter or so since the "real deal" design tools and critical mass ecosystem partnerships have been available. Anticipating that many of these pipeline deals will likely blossom from engagements to design and production "wins" over the next several months, QuickLogic management has decided to proactively "bite the bullet" and strengthen the balance sheet to improve the company's working capital situation to prevent a potential technology win, balance sheet loss situation relative to new and potentially compelling business opportunities. The company also believes that the eFPGA opportunity could be larger than originally thought as recently as four months ago and would like to step up R&D in that area for future process technology nodes. Assuming this business ramps, it will be a material margin driver and likely a stock multiple/valuation enhancement vehicle. Possibly more than enough to offset the dilution from the current deal assuming the eFPGA opportunity wasn't present. So, I postulate that the money raise this year is offensive in nature into emerging fundamental opportunity within a much more "ready for prime time" market than the scenario surrounding the defensive deal last year. To use a football analogy, QuickLogic is looking to draft two stud offensive linemen with their first two draft picks to enhance the likelihood of success by their skill players as a new season begins. Also, as a sign that the deal is more offensive, or a step up in quality, QuickLogic has been able to upgrade the lead banker on this deal compared to last year.
 Referring back to my semiconductor equipment analogy, there are key differences between QuickLogic and them. They were small companies that manufactured their own machines and serviced them throughout the world. Large chipmakers were afraid that these companies might not be able to keep up with them in the case of strong production ramps. QuickLogic is different as it has the huge Global Foundries to build its chips for them and there is no need for global service. I can't imagine a scenario where Global Foundries couldn't keep up with any potential ramp in demand for QuickLogic devices short of working capital for QuickLogic. QuickLogic's devices are very small and many of them can fit on one wafer. So the real issue for QuickLogic is beefing up its working capital. It doesn't have to worry about factory expansion or field service. With that said, as QuickLogic grows, it will need more sales and engineering staff to engage more customers, but that is relatively easy and a good problem to have. Gear Fit Pro In my last article, I postulated that the Top Tier smartphone maker fitness wearable that QuickLogic has a design win for is likely from Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and could be called the Gear Fit Pro according to a recent brand name registration in Europe. QuickLogic management stated in its 3Q2016 earnings call in early November that the product would likely be introduced between late December and Mobile World Congress, which was a few weeks ago. However, there has not yet been an announcement. As such, all eyes are on the expected Samsung Galaxy S8 announcement on March 29th to see if a next generation Gear Fit wearable will be announced also. We will see if Samsung held it back to introduce it at its own event where it will likely get more attention than it would have at Mobile World Congress. On March 14th, a website called "Wareable" (wareable.com) published an article based on an interview with Mark Notton, Samsung's European Head of Product Management. Mr. Notton stated that wearables are a "key area" of focus for Samsung and that it plans to launch multiple new devices this year in several wearables categories including smart watches, fitness devices, and virtual reality among others. He believes the new products should be innovative enough that others will "follow its lead."
 The article stated: "these new devices will start to drop (i.e., be introduced) in the coming months." The article further speculated that new wearable(s) from Samsung could be part of the Galaxy 8 introduction. It quotes Notton regarding the upcoming product introduction next week: "we've got lots to unveil," suggesting more than one new device is in the cards for the event. On March 20th, an article in Wareable stated that Samsung has acknowledged "Bixby," its voice activated digital assistant technology like Siri" for Apple and it is likely to be launched on March 29th as well. The article in Wareable suggested it is slated for the Gear smart watches and the Gear Fit fitness devices from Samsung. So bottom line, despite not being introduced at Mobile World Congress, it does appear that the Gear Fit Pro, assuming that is the wearable design QuickLogic is waiting to ramp, is inching closer to a market introduction and could be part of the Galaxy S8 launch on March 29th. If not, it seems it will be coming soon thereafter. 2017 Revenue Progression QuickLogic management continues to stand by its fairly long held view that it can ramp its revenues towards break-even by C4Q2017. With that said, the delay in ramping the above-mentioned wearable and the likelihood that the new wearable and smartphone business is more likely a fall event than a spring event, it does look like more of a back-half loaded "hockey stock" revenue growth scenario is taking shape for C2017 as opposed to a somewhat more linear progression, at least through the first half. It would certainly be nice to see a little more revenue in the first half, but a significantly more back-half loaded revenue growth scenario was always the expectation. The skeptic in me would say, here we go again, same old QuickLogic, everything gets pushed out and where's the beef? Conversely, the more pragmatic me thinks that it has only been four months since EOS S3 samples began to be seeded into the market with "ready for prime time" development tools and a more mature ecosystem, including Sensory and CyWee algorithms. In semiconductor time, six months or less to get new design wins on new products is pretty darn fast.
 Given the timing of the money raise, it looks like several design engagements are poised to enter more serious negotiations in terms of potential production orders in the very near future. Assuming this process starts to unfold as the second quarter plays out, I think it is safe to think about a more meaningful revenue ramp starting in 3Q2017, and that would certainly be a positive stock catalyst. In the meantime, I think it is safe to expect some level of revenue growth in 2Q2017 from the Gear Fit Pro device discussed above. That should initiate the process of propelling the new product revenue scenario at QuickLogic into more "chunky" sequential quarterly increases. Because of customer delays more than execution issue with QuickLogic, this process would appear to be a quarter behind where I had expected it to be when I wrote my initial article on QuickLogic in November. It is likely that the money raise was partially catalyzed by this revenue ramp delay but I believe it was driven more by the desire to increase the odds of flipping as much new design activity into production orders as possible early in the EOS S3 life cycle. If the revenue ramp is a quarter behind schedule, then why is the stock up? I think the answer to that is two-fold. First off, despite a delay at Samsung, the timing of a real sensor processing revenue ramp is getting closer and investors that have been watching the story and biding their time - to avoid "dead money" but to eventually get in before a ramp - have likely begun to buy the stock. I believe this is an institutional concept as much if not more than retail investors. Secondly, and potentially more important in the recent past, is the emergence of the eFPGA business. According to a discussion with QuickLogic management, this new business opportunity has garnered a lot of interest, especially among the institutional investor crowd - based on interactions the company has had with investors. The potential of the bottom line impact on this business for QuickLogic became initially visible when the company provided 1Q2017 guidance.
 Revenue was guided up marginally, but gross margin was guided to 40% (midpoint) from 33% in 4Q2016. The primary driver of the increased gross margin guidance for 1Q2017 are initial licensing fees for its eFPGA offering, which I estimate to be less than $200K of revenue in the quarter. There are very minimal costs associated with the eFPGA business outside of future technology node migration that I alluded to earlier and some design assistance I presume. The eFPGA business drives up front licensing fees. Then, after a design enters volume production sometime later, it drives unit volume-based royalties. Assuming QuickLogic can get to $20 million in eFPGA revenue in 2-3 years, at a 70% after-tax margin, it could drive about $0.20 of EPS assuming 75 million shares. At a 20x P/E multiple, that would drive $4.00 of share price. Any way you look at it, this business will very likely be a margin enhancement vehicle for the overall company and is also likely to be a stock-multiple enhancement driver. Over the past four months since introduction, management is seeing solid interest from customers for the eFPGA business, including its first licensing payment this quarter and investor interest has steadily increased. As an aside, once QuickLogic reaches steady profitability and has more than enough cash flow to fund growth, hopefully by late 2018 or in 2019, I think further growth in the eFPGA business will potentially be a nice cash flow kicker that can be deployed for stock buybacks, which in my mind has to be a priority for QuickLogic once it hits its stride and generates excess cash flow. Compared to four months ago, prior to the announcement of this new business line, this is a dynamic to be incrementally positive about in any analysis on the company. Especially relative to future margin, earnings, cash flow, and stock multiple potential. Stock In my last article a few weeks before QuickLogic reported its C4Q2016 results, I stated the following:  My gut feeling is the stock is likely to "digest" for a little while in the $1.00 to $1.75 range and exhibit some choppiness, but that is really a guesstimate. The stock has moved off the bottom and I just don't think QuickLogic has super compelling revenue growth guidance in its pocket for 1Q given that this wearable will likely only contribute towards the second half of the quarter or later and any "lightness" in revenue guidance will likely bring out the liquidity boo birds. But as I suggested above, other potentially compelling positive news flow could "trump" those concerns (excuse the pun please). QuickLogic clearly can't control its customer's introduction dates. But it will continue to focus on penetrating the market and driving new design wins as fast as possible and the initial design win at Samsung is certainly a good relationship sign for potentially penetrating its massive smartphone business in the future. As such, despite the potential for some near-term choppiness, I believe QUIK shares are on a trajectory to move higher as 2017 unfolds and I reiterate my $4 stock price target. 
 In fact, QUIK shares did trade in a range after the results that indeed included light revenue guidance for 1Q2017 on the Samsung Gear Fit Pro push-out. But it was a relatively tight $1.50-$1.75 range. There is no doubt in my mind that the post 4Q2016 results trading range in QUIK shares was supported by the "other potentially compelling news flow," which was the emergence of the eFPGA business and the "tease" on future margin potential/impact to the overall company embedded (excuse the pun) into the 1Q2017 guidance. Meaning the 40% gross margin guidance for 1Q2017, up from 33% in 4Q2016 on minimal revenue growth. However, a few weeks ago, QUIK shares surged from $1.60 to a high of $2.50 over three days on very high volume. In the absence of any public news flow, the main conclusion for me on this surge is that an institution or two decided to stake out a substantial position in QUIK, wanted it done fast, and didn't care if they moved the stock to do it. To do it in this manner, they must have a pretty compelling upside target price. I'm not a fan of chasing stocks when there are temporary demand surges unfolding. Conversely, I am a fan of buying stocks when there are temporary sell surges in an otherwise uptrend. I believe the recently announced secondary offering is driving the sell surge that is technically correcting the recent buy surge. I also feel like the Samsung Gear Fit Pro introduction is likely coming sooner than later and the start of a potentially meaningful and sustained revenue ramp is also getting closer. Additionally, after the deal prices, which is scheduled for Wednesday, March 22nd, I believe several new investors to QuickLogic via the deal are likely to begin building larger positions in the open market. As such, I recommend using near-term weakness to accumulate QUIK shares and I continue to believe QUIK shares are on a trajectory to move higher as 2017 unfolds and I reiterate my $4 stock price target. Risks: Here is what I said in early February: The primary downside risk to the QuickLogic story and thus QUIK shares is failure to execute broad-based new design win penetration with the company's flagship EOS S3 sensor processing device. Also, success in penetrating the market with EOS S3 devices but a delay in timing could drive a need for QuickLogic to raise money, which may or may not be a dilutive event if it happens. 
 Well, the money raise risk played out. As such, I reiterate and emphasize the first part of the risk story, which is the need or risk associated with converting design engagements to production orders.

Just like the pump leading into Barcelona or CES.  There should be a Seeking Alpha RUMOR story out there to just pump up the endless possibilities.   The RUMOR Mill profit strategy.  Buy on the rumor sell on the news once you find out the rumored deal is just another money losing engagement with a no name flyby night Chinese Company.Reply10AAnonymousFrom Quik's web site:5. We have fun!“Weeeeeeeeeeee!” − Roller Coaster RiderIt’s easy to say a company offers a fun work environment’…but it takes more than an old ping pong table gathering dust in the corner to actually have one. Whether it’s Taco Truck Tuesday, a hastily-called beer bash on a random Friday, or company-sponsored trips to cheer for the San Francisco Giants, QuickLogic offers an environment that truly is fun.MoreReplyReplies (2)00AAnonymousare there any longs left that still believe that this so call company will deliver 50+ rev growth this year? i mean the bar is so low and they can't even achieve that?? they need 300% yoy rev growth to impress and they don't have it. zero traction with top tear players. the only deals that are announced is with some unknown chinese companies that nobody cares about..ReplyReplies (3)10AAnonymousupcoming conference call playbook: the future is brighter than ever, we have tons of engagements with top tier oems etc etc.. and now lets turn it over to sue for next Q guidance... baaaaarf..Reply10LLaurieOverall I think we will see upside for QUIK in the short-term.

Traders remorse settling in.   HA HA HA>Reply10MMeWhere are the posts from dumb & dumber today?  It's ironic what a great contrary indicator they've been.

This is our first ever investor presentation in China and more than 200 financial investment groups have been invited to attend.Just a few days ago, we announced that we have opened a Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise (WFOE) in Shanghai. That effort reflects our commitment to further developing and supporting our ongoing EOS™ S3 Sensor Processing and eFPGA engagements and design win activities in China.This morning we announced a few of the designs we’ve recently won with Qiwo and Janyun. These are not among the designs we’ve discussed during our quarterly conference calls. We also issued a press release covering collaboration with AISpeech, Ltd. AI Speech has a significant presence in the Chinese market and its cloud-based AI digital assistant (similar to Alexa in the U.S.) that has already established a substantial presence in China. We were able to easily accommodate Qiwo’s request to enable the AI Speech digital assistant by leveraging the voice trigger agnostic technology used in our EOS S3 solution.Sue and I are looking forward to the opportunity to tell our story to the Chinese investment community.http://blog.quicklogic.com/corporate/building-momentum-in-china/#sthash.aJoO7GLy.dpbsMoreBuilding Momentum in China!I’m very excited to announce that our CFO, Dr. Sue Cheng and I will present the QuickLogic story at the Reach China Investment Conference in Beijing on Tuesday, June 27th.

For the entire 15 years this POS has been going down, someone has a wet dream and all of a sudden I am wrong.  This is still a POS and will not make money EVER!

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        LegalZoom.com has received 3.76 out of 5 stars based on 33 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

QuickLogic Announces Orion Reference Design Supporting TI's Sitara(TM) ARM(R) Cortex(TM) Processor-Based Mobile Enterprise ProductsHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0QuickLogic Announces Orion Reference Design Supporting TI's Sitara(TM) ARM(R) Cortex(TM) Processor-Based Mobile Enterprise ProductsMarketwireSeptember 10, 2012ReblogShareTweetShareSUNNYVALE, CA--(Marketwire - Sep 10, 2012) - QuickLogic Corporation (  NASDAQ :  QUIK )Meets connectivity needs for applications such as Portable Data Terminals, Mobile Point-of-Sale Terminals, Handheld Scanners and Industrial Tablets   Flexible solution enables OEMs to aggregate optimal number of UART and Secure Access Module (SAM) controller peripherals to TI Sitara SDIO interface QuickLogic Corporation (  NASDAQ :  QUIK ), the innovator in low-power Customer Specific Standard Products (CSSPs), is proud to announce the immediate availability of its new Orion Reference Design. This CSSP-enabled reference design improves connectivity between the Sitara™ ARM® Cortex™ processors from Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) and peripherals based on Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART) and High Speed Protocol Secure Access Module (HSP SAM) standards.Portable Data Terminals, Handheld Scanners and Industrial Tablets Mobile enterprise products tend to have an excess of lower bandwidth wireless, sensor, and I/O connectivity requirements which often go beyond what is typically deployed in smartphones and tablets. These UART-based peripherals include 2G wireless modules, high-frequency modules, 1D and 2D barcode scanners, GPS modules, RS-232 ports, IrDA controllers, Bluetooth®  modules and more. While mobile enterprise product capability is increasing, the Sitara ARM application processors currently being used typically do not offer an appropriate number of UARTs for many mobile applications.Mobile Point-of-Sale Terminals For products with embedded point-of-sale capability, merchants are moving to upgrade their systems to ensure worldwide payment compatibility and enhanced security through the adoption of SAMs. Commonly used application processors, such as Sitara ARM Cortex processors, do not have sufficient SAM controllers or do not support the emerging HSP standard. As a result, there is a need for an integrated HSP SAM bridge solution to augment the application processor's functionality. QuickLogic's Orion Reference Design can be attached to application processor-based systems via a standard SDIO connector. As a result, Orion is a very flexible hardware solution that can be connected to most application processor reference designs on the market today and in the future. "We are very pleased to provide a much needed solution to the mobile enterprise market, in the form of our fully system-verified Orion Reference Design," said Mehul Kochar, senior business development manager for QuickLogic. "We have purposefully architected Orion with flexibility in mind, allowing QuickLogic to tailor the exact number of UARTs and HSP SAM controllers used, based on OEM size and cost requirements." 3rd Party Compatibility The Orion Reference Design has been verified with a BeagleBoard, based on a Sitara ARM processor. It has been designed to plug into any application processor reference board with a standard SDIO connector. Linux and Windows® CE software drivers are available to ease OEM integration of the QuickLogic solution.Availability The Orion Reference Design, as well as the UART and HSP SAM proven system blocks are available today. For more information, please visit http://www.quicklogic.com/reference-designs/orion/About the Texas Instruments Design Network  QuickLogic is a member of the TI Design Network, a premier group of independent, well-established companies that offer products and system-level design and manufacturing services complementing TI's semiconductors to a worldwide customer base to accelerate product innovation and time-to-market.
