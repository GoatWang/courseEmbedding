As one of the leading healthcare executive search firms - and the only top ten search firm dedicated to healthcare recruiting - Witt/Kieffer has served as trusted advisors to the nation’s hospitals, health systems, academic medical centers, physician groups and other healthcare enterprises for more than 45 years.  

Our healthcare recruiters connect with your organization’s vision, structure and leadership needs. We rely on our proven search methodology and the knowledge and collaboration of more than 100 expert search professionals nationwide.

Integral to every healthcare assignment we conduct are our Leadership Solutions, rooted in an industry-specific competency assessment model which helps to evaluate an executive’s potential for success. Based upon 16 core competencies critical to healthcare leadership, it helps organizations’ define what great leadership is according to their needs.
Not all healthcare executive search firms are alike. When you need confidence in your choice - one who knows the industry and recognizes great leadership - Witt/Kieffer is your clear choice.

If this is your company...



We may be able to find you a more suitable carrier for your business insurance.  We have extensive data on carriers, their coverage, and company rates.  Rather than having an agent sell you, why not find which carrier is best for your business and approach them?  Contact Us to see if there is a better fit for your business.  We are not insurance agents, and are not trying to sell you anything.  We will simply tell you some carriers that may be better suited, and suggest agents in your area.

What is an Experience Mod Rating?



The Mod Rating is one of the two most important factors that effect a carrier's premium for workers comp insurance.  Each business in a state is provided a mod rating by the state's rating bureau which is a reflection of the amount of workers comp claims they have had.  If someone has an accident at work, your mod rating will increase and so will your premium.

×Close
What is an LCM?



A Loss Cost Multiplier, or LCM, is a rating for an insurance carrier that reflects their overhead in providing coverage for workers comp insurance.  It is one of the two main ratings that effect an insurance premium.  You are more likely to get a better premium from a carrier with a lower LCM, so it is important to know what your carrier's LCM is.  While a premium is generally the result of a formula, carriers are able to deviate plus or minus 25% from that formula.
