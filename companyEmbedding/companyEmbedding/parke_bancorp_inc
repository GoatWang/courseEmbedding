WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP, N.J., July 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Parke Bancorp, Inc. ("Parke Bancorp") (NASDAQ:   "PKBK"), the parent company of Parke Bank, announced its operating results for the quarter ended June 30, 2017.








Parke Bancorp reported net income available to common shareholders of $3.4 million, or $0.45 per common share and $0.37 per diluted common share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2017. This compares to net income available to common shareholders of $8.3 million, or $1.11 per common share and $0.88 per diluted common share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, a decrease in net income of $4.9 million. Net income available to common shareholders year-to-date was $6.6 million or $0.72 per diluted common share, compared to $10.7 million, or $1.15 per diluted common share, for the six months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease in net income of $4.1 million. The prior periods includes an approximately $9.3 million pre-tax gain from the sale of our SBA related assets in April of 2016, which includes a $7.6 million gain on sale and relief of $1.7 million of related allowance for loan losses. Net of the income recorded in 2016 on the SBA assets, year-to-date net income exceeded the prior year by $2.5 million. 
The following is a recap of significant items that impacted the second quarter of 2017 compared to the same quarter last year:  an increase of $1.3 million in interest income, primarily attributable to higher loan volumes, partially offset by an increase of $253,000 in interest expense due to higher deposit volumes and higher rates paid on deposits; a $1.6 million increase in the provision for loan losses; a $7.9 million decrease in noninterest income; and a $430,000 decrease in noninterest expense, all primarily attributable to the sale of Parke Bancorp's SBA business in the second quarter of 2016.
At June 30, 2017, Parke Bancorp's total assets increased to $1.043 billion, from $1.016 billion at December 31, 2016. An increase of $26.7 million or 2.6%
Parke Bancorp's total investment securities portfolio decreased to $44.1 million at June 30, 2017 from $47.1 million at December 31, 2016, a decrease of $3.0 million or 6.3%.
Parke Bancorp's net loans increased to $928.6 million at June 30, 2017 from $852.0 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $76.6 million or 9.0%.
At June 30, 2017, Parke Bancorp had $8.5 million in nonperforming loans representing 0.9% of total loans, a decrease of $2.8 million or 24.8% from $11.3 million at December 31, 2016. OREO at June 30, 2017 was $8.7 million, compared to $10.5 million at December 31, 2016 a decrease of 17.2%. OREO consisted of 11 properties, the largest being a condominium development in Absecon, NJ, recorded at $2.7 million. Nonperforming assets (consisting of nonperforming loans and OREO) represented 1.7% of total assets at June 30, 2017 as compared to 2.1% of total assets at December 31, 2016. Loans past due 30 to 89 days were $3.4 million at June 30, 2017, an increase of $1.8 million from the previous quarter end. A past due loan relationship totaling $2.7 million is expected to be resolved in the third quarter. 
At June 30, 2017, Parke Bancorp's allowance for loan losses was $16.6 million, as compared to $15.6 million at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the growth in the loan portfolio. The ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans was 1.8% at June 30, 2017 and at December 31, 2016. The ratio of allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans improved to 194.8% at June 30, 2017, compared to 137.9%, at December 31, 2016.
At June 30, 2017, Parke Bancorp's total deposits were $790.5 million, up from $788.7 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $1.8 million or 0.2%.
Parke Bancorp's total borrowings were $113.1 million at June 30, 2017, an increase of $20.0 million from December 31, 2016, or 21.5%.
Total shareholders' equity increased to $132.3 million at June 30, 2017 from $127.1 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $5.2 million or 4.1%.
Vito S. Pantilione, President and Chief Executive Officer of Parke Bancorp and Parke Bank, provided the following statement: 
"We continue to work very hard to enhance shareholder value which is evidenced by our strong loan growth and the continued strength of our earnings. Equally important is that we remain committed to reducing our NPAs. Our non-performing loans were reduced 25% and OREO reduced 17% since December 31, 2016. This reduction was accomplished without sacrificing profitability or shareholder value. We are proud that we once again increased our quarterly cash dividend this quarter, an increase of 20% to 12 cents per quarter."

Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.
