Randy James Rose is a native of Green Bay, Wisconsin, and a graduate of the University of Wisconsin. Randy also has executive certificates from Cornell University in Food Marketing, and University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business.

Randy joined Enzymatic Therapy, Inc. in September 2002, as President and Chief Executive Officer, returning to his home town in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where Enzymatic Therapy, Inc. is headquartered. He previously held positions of significant responsibility in Procter and Gamble, Ralston Purina, and Energizer Holdings, Inc., where he served as President and Chief Operating Officer. 

Randy is married to Deborah Ann and have celebrated over 30 years of marriage. Randy and Deborah have two children, Brianne and Chelsea. 

Randy, you've worked in several different kinds of leading industries. Based on your bio, it seems like a real change to switch gears and work for a natural medicine company. 

From a personal perspective it really wasn't a total change. I have always been physically active, and interested in health and nutrition. Due to participation in sports, I used supplements for many years to improve my health--especially my "football knees". 

That's right--you were a professional athlete when you first graduated from college, weren't you? 

Ha, very briefly! I played four years of varsity football in college--as a wide receiver at University of Wisconsin for the Badgers. Following graduation, I joined the Green Bay Packers, and was a professional football player for all of 11 weeks! 

It was a real change of perspective, competing at that level. I ran a 4.5 seconds time for the 40 yard dash--pretty fast for the Big 10 conference at the time. When I came to the Packers, I was the slowest of the wide receivers. One of the other wide receivers won the Bronze medal in the '72 Olympics and ran a 4.25. 

Your degree choice in college seems untraditional--especially for a football "jock". How did you become involved with Asian Studies? 

I became very interested in Asian studies during my time at the University in Madison. 

I was fascinated with the philosophies: the concept of balance, the paradox of tension and harmony, and the deep seated, traditional respect for the inter-relationship of people and nature. 

As a result my personal beliefs incorporate a blend of Eastern philosophies --with the many positive influences of a traditional Midwest work ethic, and this squares with the mission of Enzymatic Therapy and Integrative Therapeutics. 
So how did this path lead you to Enzymatic Therapy? 

I was very fortunate in my business career to reach a point where I could begin to look for how I might "give back". I am very fortunate, and I wanted to have the opportunity to contribute to the betterment of society and people, and work for a noble cause. 

When I connected with Enzymatic Therapy, I knew that I found the right alignment for me, as the mission of the company is to provide "what BETTER feels like!" to all. Our entire team is very passionate about improving the lives and well being of people through our natural medicines and educational focus. This is truly the "right path" for me. 

What are your goals for Enzymatic Therapy moving forward? What do you see in the future? 

Improving the lives of our consumers and customers every day has always been, and will always be our goal. The feedback we get from consumers who have seen real-life benefits from our products is very positive. And, so is our relationships with our business partners, who are primarily medical professionals and progressive retailers. 

I think we're fortunate to have tremendous talent within our company, all committed to helping people live healthier, longer, and pain free lives. The richness of our experience and our long-term interaction with medical professionals, natural food stores and health-focused retailers provides us with an incredibly diverse and rich base for ideas that will further elevate health care solutions and business opportunities for our partners. 

I'm proud of our team and our accomplishments to date, but we learn and grow every day. Our company has the highest standards of ethics across every area of operation--our products, our approaches to business with our customers and consumers, and our interaction with all of our stakeholders. 

We're dedicated to continuous improvement every day. That means we are constantly elevating our quality, potency, purity, and the integrity of our supply linkage. As you may know, we are meet all pharmaceutical standards, and are inspected by the FDA as a drug facility, and we hold an organic certification in compliance with the USDA requirements. 

Enzymatic Therapy is perfectly positioned at the forefront of advancing health through innovative natural therapies that combine the best of scientific research and development, with the highest quality natural ingredients. 

Like all of our Associates, I feel very fortunate to be here and have this opportunity. 

Thank you.
