Not for Him
Bought this to try for my husband to wear under his coveralls when snowblowing and running the plow. Hoped that less bulk would mean less restrictive movement. Maybe it was his build,(he is a solid husky guy), but they seemed to twist in the arms and legs when he tried them on, and he didn't feel comfortable in them. So Jockey cheerfully let us return them no questions asked, and we bought him a set of the waffle weave in blue.

Perfect for casual warmth!
These are the best made long underwear, that fit well, and keep me warm on those casual days, that have me in and out. Not too warm, but keep the chill out!

Great product
I am short so I like the short waist to crotch that keeps the waist band in the right place.  I would like to see a ankle cuff to make the fit snug around the ankles.  I will order some more.

I really like the 3D–Innovations fabric.  I would buy more, but they are no longer offered in my size.  Hope to see offered in 2XL again very soon!

Shrinkage in laundry
Disappointed in the UPS/USPS delivery: ordered/shipped 1/14, arrived at local hub and given to USPS 1/17 where sat 1 week, delivered 1/27.  Glad to have tracking number, but if sent only UPS would have delivered 1/18.  Felt package languished at USPS -- was it placed into bulk delivery? Talked to Customer Service 1/21 who reassured me still within acceptable delivery time; I was afraid someone else was enjoying my long johns. Product arrived in good condition a week later than I expected with them in my immediate area.1/21 Order from another supplier from a more distant warehouse arrived here 1/24 by UPS in same weather conditions.

Fine design and fit
Wonderfully form fitting and heat retaining. I planned to wear them under winter long johns but so far they have worked well by themselves under normal trousers or windbreaker pants in close to zero temperatures.

Great quality long underwear.
These are the perfect thermals for more casual use, when you will be both in and outside. Won't overheat when inside.

Great Product, Great Fit
I loved it, bought it for my boyfriend but I own two (of the female version which is made out of the same fabric) and it feels great! I love the fit and the feel of it, it doesn't make you hot when it's not that cold and it keeps you warm when it is. Plus it fits nicely under your clothes. For the mountains though I would recommend a Jockey waffle which I also own (just the pants not the top but I'm assuming the top is as nice as the pants).

Very comfortable, a bit cold
I got these hoping the 97 percent cotton content would be more comfortable than my previous pair of waffle polyester blends. It definitely is, but then the wind chill definitely leaks through these more too. Shame, because if thin and warmth could come in the same package I'd be set. Wonderfully designed pair otherwise, very sharp-looking.

Great Longjohns
I liked these longjohns because they are lightweight and I can wear them underneath a suit walking about 1/2 mile from the parking garage to my office. On a cold day where the windchill is near zero, these protect my legs from the cold, yet they aren't so heavy that I melt once in the office.

Love these long underwear!
I was extremely impressed with Jockey's customer service line. I clicked on a link and Jockey's customer service CALLED ME!!! The gal that called me was extremely helpful and I spent a lot of time on the phone with her. She helped me determine the best products for my husband and they arrived in a timely fashion and he was extremely pleased with the products.

too much whiz and not enought bang
Way, way too small. Sizes aren't even close to reality.  I wear a 31 or 32 and I ordered a large (36-38), washed it in cold and dryed it on low and it was ridiculously small, very uncomfortable when bending my knees.Bad experience.

Long underwear that actually fits well!
Exactly what you'd expect from the Jockey 3D line, these long johns fit very well and move with you. It's like a second skin. I'm ready for winter!

Best Long Underwear for Daily Wear
I wear these daily under my office clothing.  I spend a lot of time indoors and outdoors and for the first time my long underwear isn't bulky, ill fitting and doesn't cling to my clothing. These have a body hugging quality that allows my outer clothes to hang naturallly yet I get a full comfortable layer of added warmth. The best I have yet for everyday. I will reorder.

                The owner of Long John Silver's has acquired 10 restaurants in Columbus.            

                Long John Silver's            








 



Long John Silver’s is dropping anchor in Columbus.
The Louisville, Kentucky-based fast food seafood chain last October got back in the restaurant owning business – it had been just a franchisor since 2007 – and Central Ohio now is one of its biggest markets.

                            The owner of Long John Silver's has acquired 10 restaurants in Columbus.                        
Long John Silver's










 


Owner LJS Partners LLC has acquired 49 of its more than 1,100 units across the country including 10 in and around Columbus.
“There is credibility to be gained,” Marilyn Nicholson, vice president of media, promotions and marketing, told me. “We want to lead by example and that dialogue is a little different when you’re out there like franchisees experiencing what they’re experiencing.”
LJS bought the decades-old chain from previous owner Yum Brands Inc. (NYSE:YUM) in 2011.




Nicholson said two things attracted the company to Columbus – history and reputation.
“Columbus is a legacy market for us,” she said. “We opened our first unit in 1969 and came to Columbus in 1978.”
Three of the 10 restaurants purchased opened in 1978 – Whitehall, Mount Vernon and Washington Court House.
The restaurant at 1002 S. High St. near German Village closed last year, but otherwise she said local sales are solid and same-store sales are up since the ownership change.
“There are very loyal customers in Columbus,” she said. “It’s a legacy market for us for a reason.”
The attention now turns to the future for the brand. With corporate ownership, the local market also is set to become a product testing and franchisee training ground for Long John Silver’s.




 


Nicholson said the chain is building its product development pipeline now. She declined to share specific dishes, but said new shrimp and chicken creations will be tested as will a special Lent offer that might appear locally this year with potential national use next year.
This is the busiest time of year for the chain. Ash Wednesday sales jump 75 percent for the company compared with a normal day. Through the next 40 days Long John Silver’s anticipates selling more than 20 million pieces of fish along with enough tartar sauce to fill up nine tanker trucks. The company has an assortment of Lent promotions.

Nicholson declined to share the cost of acquiring the 10 local units, but said it was from multiple franchisees.
Central Ohio is home to 15 restaurants, the rest of which remain franchised.
There aren’t plans for new restaurants yet, though Nicholson said the company is open to it. It does plan to add to the 130 workers it has between the 10 shops.
“We feel a little under-employed right now,” she said.
Other corporate markets are Pittsburgh; Washington D.C.; Wheeling, West Virginia; Clarksburg/Weston, West Virginia. It also picked up 10 restaurants in Chicago just this week.

Sac Indie Expo 2017
Jul10

by DBethel
on 10 July 2017
at 1:48 PM





 


This weekend will be the inaugural show for the Sac Indie Expo, a show that “brings the top local indie artists, creators, and writers under one roof.” This time, that roof will be owned by the local craft brewer, Big Sexy Brewing Company. Here are some details about the event.

WHEN: Saturday, July 15, 2017.  12-5pm.
WHERE: Big Sexy Brewing Company. 5861 88th St. #800. Sacramento, CA. 95828
ADMISSION: FREE
WHO: Nate Flamm, Karen Garvey, Kyrun Silva/Big Tree Comics, Megan E. Risk, Iron and Wood Artisans, Ghost Thunder Collective (list may not be comprehensive)
WHAT: I’ll be exhibiting with Volume 1 Hellrider Jackie artist, Josh Tobey, with both volumes of Long John so far, two Long John prints, the Logan-inspired “Legacy” print, and bookmarks.
WHY: A fine excuse to drink good local beer and to show support for your hard-working local creatives (like myself).

I hope to see you there!

D. Bethel Draws Long John #08
Jul07

by DBethel
on 7 July 2017
at 12:15 AM






I’ve been asked if I worry about these videos spoiling anything in the upcoming chapter. That had crossed my mind, but it’s not something I’m particularly worried about. A single panel shouldn’t be enough to ruin a story.
To be honest, I am being a little selective about what I show in these videos, and even though I show the full page at the end of the video, I think that the story is only fully appreciated when read in its final form, which is definitely not what is being shown here. Once so far, I have redacted images from the video, but that was more to have fun than to actually safeguard readers from any potential spoilers.
This video shows a lot of how decisions are made in the art. The pencils are usually pretty loose, allowing for decisions about adding details to be made during inking, usually. In addition to details, the choice about rendering (adding elements to indicate lighting, depth, etc.) are usually left for the inking as well. With the panel inked in the above video, I really was aiming for a specific look which I mostly hit, but the final panel is a bit messier than what I had wanted and, had I done more planning, it would look better. But, that would go against, a bit, about the creative ethos of how I create Long John. I want it to be a learning experience that will rely on my experience in making comics for ten years (TEN YEARS) now (well, in September) and to trust my talent and sensibilities to guide the art for the comic.
Such trust also allows for happy accidents, which has happened often; however, this also allows for stumbled attempts along the way. There have been a fair amount of wobbly perspective, strange anatomy, and bad compositions. With that in mind, it all still passes my own bar for clarity. As poorly drawn as a panel could be, I always ask the question, “Does this make it hard for the reader to understand the page?” If yes, I redraw the panel, usually on a separate piece of paper that I cut out and tape over the rejected one––that has happened a few times. If no, which is most often, I roll with the punches or try to improve it with coloring. The one thing I don’t do is use Photoshop to redraw, remove, or replace any art. What is on the page ends up on the screen for the reader (with some very, very slight exceptions), because that’s the comic I want to make.
At this point in my creative development, I would rather have my best efforts in the hands of the reader than a “perfect” comic. The latter would just be boring.

Another week in and more Long John pages are getting churned out and I’m always surprised at how much of a blast it is do get these done.
I’ve been vocal about how frustrating I feel that drawing is, but I’m usually pretty satisfied with the end results. While making these videos, I wonder where, exactly, the switch flips to being fun and rewarding.
Honestly, I feel the layouts are the most creative part, but are also very difficult. It’s at that stage where I’m bouncing back and forth between scripting and thumbnailing that all of my insecurities come out as a storyteller and getting to the point where I say “I’m done” is really more of an act of contrition than satisfaction.
I think putting pencils down is the trough of the process for me. I don’t feel particularly creative while doing it––though it may be one of the most literally creative parts of the process––because I’m really just embellishing what was already done on the layouts. Also, this is the most frustrating part for me because this is where the logistics of the scene must be worked out and whittled into a shape I can live with. For instance, with last week’s video where I inked the lineup of the bad guys (spoilers, I guess), that was a profoundly frustrating and exhausting page overall (since I basically had to draw that panel twice). First, laying out the characters was daunting because I wanted the lineup to look imposing but I didn’t want to draw thirty guys. Second, I basically designed each person on the page (with the exception of the guy in the middle); I bounced between them, making them as different from each other as possible. Because they were all new characters, I needed to be detailed with the pencils––what is called “tight” pencils––and, once I was done, I noticed that I had made the middle guy much bigger than the rest. While I designed the panel to emphasize that middle character, there were some lines of fantasy that I just couldn’t cross.
Inking, while time-consuming, I think is where things start to lighten up for me. Putting ink down makes the choices permanent be they good or bad, and when combined with my confidence knowing how this world is supposed to look and its overall aesthetic, it suddenly becomes a known quantity and I can start to have some fun making these drawings start to look like a finished comic.
This week’s video is an example of that. It’s not a perfect panel by any means––I could have worked a bit more on the perspective on the house (the eye line is off) and the dude in the black bowler looks a bit funky, but I had fun playing with depth. Most importantly, I think it reads clearly and easily. We know who the important characters are and where they are and we get a sense of the story as well as the personalities of the characters.
I’m not saying insecurity doesn’t bleed through; I certainly lay down ink that shouldn’t be there. But that kind of thing is an easy fix. A line can be removed or changed, but if the entire composition is off, then no amount of lines can save it.

Additional Information






Long John is the model of one of the most popular shads in the world. The stretched shape of a body provides it with the unique effect of “wriggling” lure. This shad is justly known as a real pike-perch „killer”. The Long John – new edition lure is applied both to fishing with classic jig and with other spinning rods tackles. It is completed not only with renewed shape of the well-known lure, but also with a new formula of an attractant with mackerel flavour integrated into the lure material composition. The modern colour-grade can turn every event of fishing to be fascinating and profitable. Perfectly chosen sizes of the body and the tail always provide steady operation of the lure with loads of different weights. The lures Long John – new edition 7.9 and 10.7 cm comes in nineteen different colours.
