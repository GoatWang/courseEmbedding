	Aegon calls USD 1,050 million in perpetual capital securities



	Aegon today announces that it will call for the redemption of perpetual capital securities with a coupon of 7.25% issued in 2007 (ISIN code: NL0006056814,
	CUSIP code: N00927348). The redemption will be effective June 15, 2014, when the principal amount of USD 1,050 million will be repaid with accrued interest.


	Aegons decision to call the perpetual capital securities supports the companys target to maintain a fixed charge cover within a range of 6 to 8
	times. As a result of todays call and the recent issuance of EUR 700 million subordinated notes, Aegons fixed charge cover is expected to increase approximately 0.7 times on an annualized basis.


	The securities are currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange with symbol AEF. This listing will be terminated following the redemption of the
	securities.

you displayed, copied, duplicated, reproduced, sold, re-sold or 
exploited for any purpose.
If you use computer programming routines that are intended to 
aggregate records or reports from the Sites and Services or otherwise 
damage, interfere with, disrupt, impair, disable or otherwise overburden
 the Sites and Services, you agree to pay One Hundred Dollars ($100) for
 each report or record that is aggregated, disrupted, damaged or 
otherwise affected by you.
Except as set forth in the foregoing subparagraphs (a) through (c), 
inclusive, you agree to pay the actual damages suffered by SmooFi, 
including, but not limited to attorneys' fees and court costs, to the 
extent such actual damages can be reasonably calculated. Notwithstanding
 any other provision of these Terms of Use, we reserve the right to seek
 the remedy of specific performance of any term contained herein, or a 
preliminary or permanent injunction against the breach of any such term 
or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in these Terms of Use, or
 any combination thereof.

20.	NOTICE
By use of the Sites and Services, you consent to receive electronic 
communications from SmooFi (via email or via a posting on the Sites), 
and you agree that any such communications satisfy any legal requirement
 to make such communications in writing. You also agree that SmooFi may 
communicate any notices to you under these Terms of Use, through 
electronic mail, regular mail or posting the notices on the Sites and 
Services. All notices to SmooFi will be provided by either sending: (i) 
an email to  helpdesk @smoofi.com; or (ii) a letter, first class 
certified mail, to SmooFi, 1031 Calle Recodo Ste B, San Clemente, CA. 
92672, Attn: Member Services. Such notices will be deemed delivered upon
 the earlier of the verification of delivery or two (2) business days 
after being sent.
21.	ENTIRE AGREEMENT
These Terms of Use and other agreements, rules, and policies 
incorporated by reference to this Terms including, without limitation, 
the Privacy Policy, constitutes the entire agreement between you and 
SmooFi. It supersedes any prior or contemporaneous negotiations, 
discussions or agreements, whether written or oral, between you and 
SmooFi regarding the subject matter contained in these Terms of Use. 
Additional terms and conditions may exist between you and third parties,
 including but not limited to, Service Providers and others. You 
represent and warrant that those third party agreements do not interfere
 with your obligations and duties to SmooFi under these Terms of Use.
22.	GOVERNING LAW
These Terms of Use and the relationship between you and SmooFi will 
be governed by the laws of the State of Nevada, notwithstanding the 
choice of law provisions of the venue where any action is brought, where
 the violation occurred, where you may be located or any other 
jurisdiction. You agree and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
 state or federal courts located in Indianapolis, Indiana and waive any 
defense of lack of personal jurisdiction or improper venue or forum non 
conveniens to a claim brought in such court, except that SmooFi may 
elect, in its sole discretion, to litigate the action in the county or 
state where any breach by you occurred or where you can be found. You 
agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim 
or cause of action arising out or related to your use of the Sites and 
Services or these Terms of Use shall be filed within one (1) year after 
such claim or cause of action arose or will forever be barred.
23.	MISCELLANEOUS 
If you breach any term of this Terms of Use or other agreement with 
SmooFi, SmooFi may pursue any legal or equitable remedy available, 
including but not limited to, direct, consequential, and punitive 
damages and injunctive relief. SmooFi’s remedies are cumulative and not 
exclusive. Failure of SmooFi to exercise any remedy or enforce any 
portion of the Terms of Use at any time shall not operate as a waiver of
 any remedy or of the right to enforce any portion of the Agreement at 
any time thereafter. If any provision of the Terms of Use is found to be
 unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated
 to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms shall otherwise 
remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Terms of Use is 
not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with SmooFi 
prior written consent. We may transfer, assign or delegate the Terms and
 its rights and obligations without consent. Users of this Sites and 
Services are responsible for compliance with all applicable regulations 
and laws. No joint venture, partnership, employment or agency 
relationship exists between you and SmooFi as a result of these Terms of
 Use or use of the Sites and Services. You acknowledge and agree that 
each of the Released Parties shall be an intended third party 
beneficiary of these Terms of Use.
