Maxwell Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:MXWL) was upgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “sell” rating to a “hold” rating in a report released on Tuesday. 
According to Zacks, “Maxwell leads the growing ultracapacitor market and benefits from increasing demand for its utility infrastructure, renewable energy, public transportation and space programs. It has also completed its restructuring initiatives, which called for focus on high-growth opportunities, the sale of non-core assets, consolidation of U.S. manufacturing units and a reduction in operating costs by lowering headcount. However, Maxwell's share price has underperformed the Zacks categorized Electronics-Miscellaneous Components industry price over the last one year due to uncertainty associated with the China bus market as well as short-term changes in the Chinese government's deployment strategy for wind turbines, which is affecting Maxwell’s wind market revenues. Again, the company’s dependence on a limited number of customers and vertical markets remains a major challenge.”
Several other analysts also recently issued reports on the company. ValuEngine upgraded Maxwell Technologies from a “strong sell” rating to a “sell” rating in a research note on Friday, June 2nd. Roth Capital  reiterated a “neutral” rating and set a $6.00 price target on shares of Maxwell Technologies in a research note on Friday, April 14th. Finally, Cowen and Company  reiterated a “neutral” rating and set a $6.00 price target (down previously from $7.00) on shares of Maxwell Technologies in a research note on Friday, April 14th. One equities research analyst  has rated the stock with a sell rating and five have issued  a hold rating to the company’s stock. Maxwell Technologies  has a consensus rating of “Hold” and an average target price of $5.50.




Maxwell Technologies (NASDAQ MXWL) traded down 1.02% during trading on Tuesday, reaching $5.81. The company had a trading volume of 37,017 shares. The stock has a 50 day moving average of $5.77 and a 200-day moving average of $5.44. The company’s market capitalization is $187.06 million. Maxwell Technologies has a 12 month low of $4.20 and a 12 month high of $6.48. 
Maxwell Technologies (NASDAQ:MXWL) last released its quarterly earnings results on Tuesday, May 9th.
