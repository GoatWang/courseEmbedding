							KaZoom is the first digital publishing company in the United States focusing exclusively on the multicultural market, and most precisely Black and Latino readers.

			Chicago, IL, 
			December 9, 2016			(Newswire.com) -
	​truCrowd.com - the funding portal that helps US startups and small businesses to raise funds from anyone under Regulation Crowdfunding, announced today that KaZoom Kids Books, Inc,  a multicultural, digital-interactive children book publishing company, is open for investing.
Currently based in Chicago KaZoom’s flagship product is KaZoom Kids iStoryBooks – a digital interactive platform, where the company publishes multicultural books and apps for ages 3 to 8. The books engage children with sight, sound, read-along narration, touch and animation through interactive technology.
“If you are an African-American or Hispanic mother of young children you can seldom find children book that reflect your life, family and community, says Donna Beasley, Co-Founder and publisher. There is a void in the publishing industry for multicultural children books. In 2014 only 5% of children literature included children of color.  These few books are not nearly enough when you consider that 43% of students in our nation's public school system are Black and Hispanic children and our country is growing more culturally diverse each year.

At KaZoom we believe every child should be able to find themselves and their community in the pages of a book. This lack of diversity in children's literature creates a gap in the sense of self-love that comes from recognizing oneself in a text, from the understanding that your life and lives of people like you are worthy of being told, thought about, discussed and even celebrated.

At KaZoom we believe every child should be able to find themselves and their community in the pages of a book. This lack of diversity in children literature creates a gap in the sense of self-love that comes from recognizing oneself in a text, from the understanding that your life and lives of people like you are worthy of being told, thought about, discussed and even celebrated.”
“The multicultural children book segment in the United States is one of the biggest untapped markets,” says truCrowd CEO Vicent Petrescu. KaZoom gives truCrowd investors not only the opportunity to become shareholders and to support a cause but also to become a character in a book or to tell their life story. I personally think it is pretty exciting to have a children book written around your life story or that of someone you love, don’t you think?”
Taking advantage of the new Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF) companies can raise up to $1 million per year from non-accredited investors including friends, family, customers and partners in exchange for equity. Becoming a shareholder it is not reserved anymore only to accredited investors. Anyone can own shares in a startup or small business for as little as $100.

Who are we
Executive Summary
 
kulaBrands is dedicated to locating unique inventions that are looking for a way to get manufactured and find channels of distribution. By leveraging its community of members to bring these inventions to market successfully, kulaBrands is the answer that these inventors are looking for.
 
As a home-based business, kulaBrands sells memberships to those interested in joining the kulaBrands opportunity. Members, in turn, receive royalties for products they choose to crowdfund, promote, or sell. Members also receive royalties on members activity referred by them, giving them the power to leverage the kulaBrands model.
 
kulaBrands™ Inc is a new, innovative company inspired by the idea of creating a company for the people that radically changes the home-based business model. As the brainchild of inventor and businessman Peter Gantner, kulaBrands has evolved to a functioning business through the collaboration and committed efforts of our dynamic team and kulaBrands community, including Doug Kyle, Yaan Gulledge, and Cory Moran who have brought it all together. In addition, the successful businessman, Mr. Jeff Hoffman (co-founder Priceline.com), is a co-founder, board member and spokesperson. Mr. Hoffman is quoted as saying, “kulaBrands is one of the first business models I have ever seen designed right from the ground up.”
 
By developing a business model that utilizes collaboration and fosters innovation and has developed a support mechanism through collaboration, kulaBrands has built a dynamic, synergistic paradigm that has revolutionized a shift in the home-based business. kulaBrands invites inventors, creative artists, and entrepreneurs to join forces in a unique patent-pending business model to collaborate and launch new products, as well as their respective companies!
 
kulaBrands business was developed by recognizing and combining several powerful trends. Crowdfunding, social media marketing, crowd intelligence, work from home movement, and the collaborative business structure. This is like the perfect storm, bringing together most innovative and strongest elements of the trending online market to form what will become most likely the market changing model of the future.
 
By combining collaboration, technology and online social networks with community-based crowdfunding (social funding), direct sales (social selling), and social branding/marketing, the products we decide to launch can go beyond the traditional home-based business format to the shelves of the traditional retail marketplace worldwide both off and online.
 
In compliance with our community Bill of Rights, a community-elected kulaBrands member will always have a seat on the Board of Directors. This ensures that kulaBrands members are represented in every aspect of our business. With our business model, the kulaBrands community, inventors and company succeeds together, and everyone benefits from everyone else’s success.
 
Company Overview
 
kulaBrands™, Inc. (the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, is a community-based, patent-pending business model in the collaborative home-based business space that perpetually rewards its members for supporting inventors and project creators. The patent is based on Dynamic Reverse Royalty Allocation Systems and Methods US Pat. App. No.:15/441,735, which are paid by an inventor or an artist to the kulaBrands for supporting them in the three key areas needed to build a successful brand/company. The three areas are social funding (reward-based crowdfunding), social branding/marketing and social selling (direct sales). These activities are accomplished using proprietary software, internet, crowdfunding platforms, social media sites and community co-operation. The Company operates kulaBrands.com, kulafunded.com, shopkula.com and kulaforum.org websites and facilitates activities performed by the community members (the “Community”).
 
The Community membership is governed by member-specific agreements to explain the rights, obligations, and terms of membership with kulaBrands. As a community-driven company, the Company aims to include the members in the management and operational decisions of kulaBrands and welcomes their thoughts and suggestions regarding their agreement. Members joining the Community agree to the terms and conditions of the signed agreement (including the Compensation Plan). In addition to receiving reverse royalties, mentioned above, members joining in 2016 paid a one-time lifetime membership fee of $199 to join the Community. Currently the lifetime membership fee is $249.
 
From February 28, 2016 to December 31, 2016, the Company signed contracts engaging two inventors and launched two products while the membership count was 1960. As of the date of issuance of the reviewed financials, the Company has signed contracts with an additional six inventors, launched one more product and the membership count increased to 2500. 


Problem
What Makes kulaBrands Different?
 
kulaBrands difference is our understanding and focus on the kulaBrands community. We understand that the true power of the model is members of the community. We have developed a business model and culture of every activity of each member helps build royalties for themselves as well as other community members. We exemplify a rising tide raise all ships.  Our belief is that collaborative business models are the future of modern society.
 
Challenges of Crowdfunding
 
Even before an idea is launched on a crowdfunding platform, many inventors have already spent a great deal of time, and often a significant sum of money on writing, video production, graphic design and prototype development.
Once a project is approved by crowdfunding sites such as Kickstarter or Indiegogo, and the inventor has specified a fundraising goal, the hope is that enough people will make a pledge (or back the project) to help the inventor achieve that goal. However, only a few projects reach their goal as illustrated below:
 

 
Building a community before listing on a crowdfunding platform is the most powerful key to success. Knowing exactly who is committed to pledging on the project during the first day that it goes “live” and leveraging social capital increases chances of success. 


Solution
Why Companies Need kulaBrands’ Services
 
Branding and marketing are among the top most costly expenses for a business. Development of a company’s messaging, logo design and how a consumer interacts with those aspects of the business requires preparation and expertise. Entrepreneurs often grossly underestimate how much time and money is required to market a product effectively. Before the days of the internet, the traditional model of Branding and Marketing looked like the image below.
 

 
Many of those classic marketing methods are still in use today, and at very high costs to the entrepreneur or business owner. These days we have internet marketing, social media marketing, and now kulaBrands.
 
 How kulaBrands Helps Inventors Succeed
 
The kulaBrands patent-pending business model provides a unique opportunity to build business relationships. kulaBrands provides a ready-made, active Community that supports the inventor. Known as pre-pledging, kulaBrands Community members always vote on every project. Pre-pledging determines how many members are interested in backing a project once it is posted on a crowdfunding website. Not every member will be interested in every project.
If there are enough votes in favor of the project, the business owner or inventor can be assured that they have enough backing (“social capital”) to reach their funding goal within 24 hours of going live on the crowdfunding platform. The inventor now has money, as well as the continued support of the kulaBrands Community once the project leaves the crowdfunding platform and is launched into the mass marketplace.
 
kulaBrands Leverages Social Platforms to Drive Sales
 
Social selling simply means using the internet’s social media platforms to create brand awareness and to drive product sales. Because kulaBrands begins driving online sales immediately after a crowdfunding project closes, the creator or inventor is able to preserve capital in the business just when he/she needs it most—at startup.
kulaBrands also helps increase income for the inventor at a time when sales are historically slow—at startup. Each kulaBrands member has his/her own sales portal website, dedicated to the sale of products from kulaBrands-supported projects.
All initial sales take place online and can be shipped right from the inventor’s own business location.
 
Top Reasons Inventors Work with kulaBrands
 
kulaBrands is a complete solution to inventors. It provides development funds, working capital via reward based crowdfunding, revenue via direct sales, and social branding and marketing. This complete solution is provided without selling any equity in their business. Another key reason is the kulaBrands model helps reduce the cost of performing the previuos mentioned activeties. This allows better utilization of availible capitial. Improving the chance of success for the business. Business owners and inventors can enjoy the following benefits when partnering with kulaBrands:
 
 


Achievement & Traction
 
Inventors Teamed with kulaBrands

Currently, there are eight additional products backed by the Community in various stages of funding. Park Smarts for Kids reached a 337% over-goal funding on Kickstarter in December 2016. MobiCardUSA with a 116% funding and The Freedom Charger with a 547% funding were successful campaigns on Indiegogo.
Two projects, the Easy Breezy Messenger Bag and the Trifecto Infinity Pen, are presently active campaigns on Kickstarter. With pledges over $50,000 the messenger bag has more than doubled its goal of $20,000. The Trifecto Pen surpassed its $5,000 goal with over $26,000 in pledges 512% of goal.

Milestones
 
 


Business Model
 
Key Operational Process
 
The kulaBrands business model covers three critical success factors that a company needs to become profitable. Without these three things, a product will not survive in the market place.

Crowdfunding Assistance: Through the reward-based crowdfunding process, kulaBrands helps inventors and entrepreneurs obtain capital to manufacture and launch their product.
Branding and Marketing: kulaBrands provides social media marketing services to build trust and brand awareness.
Advertising and Sales: The kulaBrands community leverages the power of the internet to help promote and drive sales for all products that are supported by kulaBrands.

 
 
 
Whenever a kulaBrands-supported product makes a sale, anywhere in the world, kulaBrands members earn a reverse royalty, if they supported that product in at least one of the three kulaBrands pools.
kulaBrands also offers a one-time fee to join the Community—that is a lifetime membership with no monthly fees or auto ship requirements. The unique business model provides a Bill of Rights that truly gives the Community set rights within the Company and with the Community. Additionally, kulaBrands reserved a seat on the Board of Directors for an elected community member because we believe it is important for community members to be involved in every aspect of our business
kulaBrands is truly a part-time business model where, on a couple hours a week of time over the course of 3-5 years, people can build a substantial residual income. There is no requirement to recruit and although that aspect is available, it is not necessary for a person to create and build a residual income.
 
 
 
In addition to using our own Community to generate revenue in their contacts and connections, we also leverage existing systems and existing distribution channels to distribute inventor products. So, in the early stages, kulaBrands is the one driving and creating sales for those products. As we move forward, our goal is to use much bigger distribution channels, which in turn allows us to have a much larger number of the Community making large incomes as well as everyone generating some income monthly.
 
Funding is dramatically more accessible through the mechanism of reward-based crowdfunding. Relevant market exposure is achieved by a hybrid, of our engaged community members and our own at-will, automated social media publishing software. Sales revenue is driven by our highly incentivized community of influencers, through tried and true affiliate commission programs, using high converting sales pages, as well as word of mouth advertising for success in both on and offline sales channels. With these three aspects working in concert we can use the $300 billion direct sales industry to leverage the power of the $26 TRILLION global retail market and develop these projects into international brands.
 
Today’s technology facilitates greater individual social reach and leverage, which when used to its full advantage, provides a blue ocean of opportunity, in which our members can monetize their activity making it easier, faster, and more likely for a project to have a successful launch into the marketplace.
 
Royalties are one of the ideal revenue sources in the world. However, until now, royalties have been available only to a small segment of the population. The kulaBrands business model makes that income accessible to anyone with access to the Internet and opens an opportunity for large-scale collaboration, generating royalty income for the people who need it most.

Risk Warning

Investing in start-up and early stage businesses can be very rewarding, but investing in those businesses involves a number of risks. To invest in businesses through truCrowd, you need to understand the following five important risks:
1. Risk of Loss of Investment
Most startup businesses fail and therefore investing in these businesses may involve significant risk and it is likely you may lose all, or part, of your investment. You should only invest an amount that you are willing to lose and should build a diversified portfolio to spread risk. If a business you invest in fails, neither the company - nor truCrowd - will pay you back your investment.
2. Risk of Lack of Liquidity
Liquidity is the ease with which you can sell your shares after you have purchased them. Buying shares in businesses pitching through truCrowd cannot be sold easily as they are unlikely to be listed on a secondary trading market such as NASDAQ, AMEX or the New York Stock Exchange. Even successful companies rarely list shares on such an exchange. In addition, if you purchase B Investment Shares, these are non-voting shares and may not be attractive to potential buyers. Without a public market to find a buyer for shares it may be more difficult to sell them. Investment in crowdfunding assets should be viewed as a long term and illiquid investment. Current rules state you must generally keep any purchased shares at least twelve months from the acquisition date.
            
3. Risk of Rarity of Dividends
Dividends are payments made by a business to its shareholders from the company's profits. Most of the companies seeking financing via equity crowdfunding are startups or early stage companies, and these companies will rarely pay dividends to their investors. Profits are typically reinvested into the business to fuel growth and build shareholder value. Businesses have no obligation to pay shareholder dividends.
4. Risk of Possibility of Dilution
Any investment made through equity crowdfunding may be subject to dilution in the future. Dilution occurs when a company issues more shares. Dilution affects every existing shareholder who does not buy any of the new shares being issued. As a result, an existing shareholder's proportionate shareholding of the company is reduced, or 'diluted'. This has an effect on a number of things, including voting, dividends and value. Some businesses who pitch through equity crowdfunding offer Seed  Shares, which may include pre-emption rights that protect an investor from dilution. In this situation the business must give shareholders with Seed  Shares the opportunity to buy additional shares during a subsequent fundraising round so that they can maintain or preserve their shareholding. Please research the pitch and the Articles of the company to see if the shares you are buying will have these pre-emption rights. 
5. Risk of the Need for Investment Diversification
Diversification consists of spreading your money across multiple investments to lessen your investment risk. Unfortunately, while diversifying is a crucial part of investing, it will not reduce every type of risk. You should only invest a portion of your available investment funds through truCrowd and balance your truCrowd investment with safer, more liquid investments. Please note that diversification does not assure a profit or provide a guarantee against investment loss.

Pitch

Who are we
RANDY’S REMEDY™ powered by CANNAKA™ products from G. Randall & Sons, Inc. (GR&S), currently marketed online at randysclub.com, contain CANNAKA, a safe, all natural, non-toxic, non-intoxicating, botanically complete hemp extract of consistent quality, offered as a nutraceutical additive that complies with all state and federal regulations. It unlocks the body’s innate healing abilities, promotes a natural inflammatory response, and supports the central nervous system.
 
This offering provides funds to expand GR&S’s marketing campaigns that spread the word about the scientific breakthrough and excellent products, expand distribution/sales networks to handle sales growth and underwrite R&D of new products for RANDY’S REMEDY and strategic partnerships. Investors should consider GR&S a stepping stone in today’s rapidly evolving regulatory environment to a global 21st century business. GR&S, the Strause Group, is family operated, founded by Linda, Tyler, and Brendon Strause in memory of their husband and father, George Randall Strause. 


Problem
When Randy Strause was diagnosed with glioblastoma; an incurable brain cancer, he used medical marijuana but was concerned about the side effects and legal risk of THC. The need was apparent for an over-the-counter product with some of the same benefits of medical marijuana but in a safe, natural, non-toxic, non-intoxicating, consistent quality, measurable, legal, and without stigma. Currently, products containing cannabinoids are either available by prescription only, have long-term health complications, and/or struggle in the state by state medicinal marijuana (MMJ) marketplaces.
GR&S was formed to navigate and capitalize on the legal, regulatory and social changes surrounding hemp health products with a single goal from the beginning, “to create the products we wished we had when our father/husband was alive.” 


Solution
GR&S has entered the multi-billion dollar Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) market with the RANDY’S REMEDY powered by CANNAKA line of products:

Contains CANNAKA, a botanically complete hemp ingredient rich in naturally occurring cannabinoids
Found beneficial by customers from all walks of life dealing with a wide range of inflammatory and mood disorders
Supports the central nervous system
Works with the body to promote a healthy inflammatory response
Non-toxic, non-intoxicating
Scientifically formulated utilizing the whole plant plus terpenes
A scientific breakthrough that engages the endocannabinoid system (ECS), the largest system of “neuromodulators” in the body, binding to over a hundred cannabinoids to produce the documented “entourage effect,” by which the whole “plant” is greater than the sum of its parts
Formulated for consistent quality and potency for oral and topical products
Available as drops, as a soothing, deep-acting skin lotion, and as a new product, RANDY’S COMPANION for pets
Compliant with state and federal guidelines for sale in all 50 states
Pioneering development and sales of the highest quality hemp based nutraceuticals for mainstream consumption
Poised to be a leader in the rapidly growing CAM market
Scalable as the consumer public is educated to its advantages, sales grow, and new applications are introduced
Developing relationships in the Biopharma industries to develop IP-protected technology
 


Achievement & Traction
Since GR&S's inception in April 2014, we have steadily built a foundation upon which to launch a major national brand. At first, we relied on consulting contracts to sustain the company and cultivate relationships with our customers to learn more about them and our products. Today we have a solid supply chain of raw material from domestic sources and international sources as needed. We have the capabilities to expand our packaging and distribution to quickly ramp up production to 100K+ units/month and beyond as demand requires. 
 
We have adeptly applied the limited marketing funds available to create content for social media and our customers. We consistently rate higher than the national average for click rate, open rate, and conversions. From our last bi-annual website report, we beat the national average in almost all the categories. Here is a link to that Bi-annual report. 
 
There is genuine excitement in the marketplace for this product. We will continue our marketing effort and expand it as the business grows. Continually monitoring our metrics, we will bolster the most successful content channels. We will expand our wholesale distribution network and are implementing an affiliate marketing program. We also plan to increase sales by reaching out to health and wellness professionals and their professional organizations, small to medium size retail stores, and by forming strategic alliances with other health and dietary brands. 


Market
In an emerging market, there are few ways to estimate market size. Our first research looked at the CAM market. We worked with CR Insights, a strategic market research firm, to determine the potential market for Randy’s Remedy. While the whole CAM market is a $40B/year market and growing, we were able to identify a more targeted initial market in which Randy’s Remedy would be successful. There are over 65 million adults with the requisite disposable income in the U.S. struggling with inflammation, psoriasis, or seizures. These three conditions alone account for over $1B of the CAM marketplace. We have chosen these to focus on because the benefits are visible and the customer is able to feel the benefits quickly.

Another way to look at the potential is by analyzing the growing MMJ and adult-use marijuana markets. The market research shows how consumers are changing their minds regarding cannabinoid products. Randy's Remedy products address many of the concerns for people who are wary of these types of products. Randy's Remedy products are non-smoking, non-intoxicating, consistent, and reproducible, able to capitalize on the public’s growing acceptance of hemp products. 


Competition
While keeping in mind the challenges in launching a product in this emerging industry, there are a few direct competitors selling hemp-based nutritional products. Some of these competing companies are larger in size and have financial resources greater than GR&S. However, we believe that Randy’s Remedy products are the only “botanically complete” ones currently on the market, have the highest quality, and offer many advantages over the competition (see “Solution” above). The following are five (5) such competitors that GR&S has identified:

Dixie Botanicals: Dixie Botanicals is an established company that delivers hemp oil products. The company sells a variety of hemp oil products with various levels of potency. Its products sell for between $22 and $420, depending on the particular product and content. 
Real Scientific: Real Scientific Hemp Oil is a direct competitor of GR&S. The company sells CBD-rich hemp oils of varying potency. Its products sell for between $195 and $2,250, depending on the particular product and content. 
BlueBird Botanicals: BlueBird Botanicals is a direct competitor of GR&S. The Company sells a variety of hemp oil products with various levels of potency. Its products sell for between $12 and $850, depending on the product and its concentration. 
CannaVest Corporation: CannaVest Corporation is a direct competitor of GR&S. The company develops, produces, and sells end-consumer products containing industrial hemp-based compounds with a focus on CBD. CannaVest has at least five lines of CBD-related products that it currently offers customers, ranging from hemp oil food products to beauty/health products which contain CBD. Information about the price of CannaVest Corporation's products was not available this date. 
HempMeds: HempMeds is a direct competitor of GR&S. The company produces and sells a variety of CBD-infused products, including hemp oil, drops and capsules, topical ointments, hair products, chewing gum, and protein bars. HempMeds' products sell for between $40 and $440, depending on the size and type of product. 
Other Competitors and Competitive Products: In addition, there may be other competitors, currently unknown to us, that are developing or offering hemp-based nutritional products and that are greater in size or have greater financial resources than GR&S.
Other products competitive with Randy’s Remedy are products under the CAM umbrella. These natural products have the same marketing and advertising regulations as Randy’s Remedy and other natural products.
 


Business Model
Our business model is simple. We manage our supply chain to keep costs down while delivering an exceptional product, both direct to consumer and through select retail or health professional storefront locations. 
 
Although we are yet to show a profit, we believe that with additional resources we will increase sales and soon cross the profit threshold and enhance the company’s valuation. We are experiencing 12% month over month increase in sales. Our margins are currently at 50% (wholesale) and 75% (direct to consumer) and we don’t expect that to change in the near future. Our objectives are to sell more product, continue utilizing the subscription model to retain our customers and make Randy’s Remedy an authority for hemp health products. 
 
Due to the uncertainty and growth of this market, we are also developing relationships in the Biopharma market to develop IP-protected technology. This technology may be licensed to other companies for use and/or it can be utilized in our own line of products to increase effectiveness, quality and lower costs. 


Team
The GR&S team is well suited for growth in this space. Our team includes recognized experts in the global pharmaceutical field, nutrition, and cannabis and hemp industries. Our legal and industry advisors have first-hand knowledge of the regulatory and legislative bodies and serve as industry advocates so that we are prepared to respond quickly and lobby even while regulations are being drafted.
 
Our team is led by The Strause Group, Linda Strause, Ph.D. and her two sons, Tyler and Brendon. Together they founded G. Randall & Sons, Inc. (GR&S), named in memory of their husband/father whose life and death from incurable brain cancer inspired their vision and defined their principles.
 
Dr. Linda Strause brings over 30 years’ experience and expertise in scientific rigor, clinical trial conduct, human nutrition, and higher education. Tyler Strause has over six years as a subject matter expert, covering all aspects of the plant; its cultivation, extraction, manufacturing, and chemistry. Brendon Strause has worked closely with Tyler forming Randy’s Club, a California mutual benefit non-profit, and is responsible for personnel oversight, finances, and management.
 
Additionally, Omar Kaczmarczyk is the Chief Marketing Officer with area expertise in crowdfunding market development and engagement. He has 40 years of experience in film and transmedia production, having consulted on over 140 international productions and movies worldwide. His experience brings immense knowledge of the worldwide transmedia marketplace. Mr. Kaczmarczyk is our lead strategist for branding, marketing, and sales in the hemp health products market.
 
Susan Snow is the Chief Financial Officer of GR&S. Joining the team in the beginning, she is in charge of but are not limited to identification of key partners from attorneys to bankers, assisting with the development of corporate documents, and overseeing all activities of the company pertaining to financial processes and tracking and corporate governance. Ms. Snow’s experience spans public accounting, financial services, consumer product manufacturing, construction, clean tech, and defense contracting. She has led HR, IT, Finance & Accounting, Operations, Sales & Marketing, and Contracting in her various roles. Ms. Snow has been recognized with the prestigious Director of the Year award by the Corporate Directors Forum. Ms. Snow currently serves as Chief Restructuring Officer of privately held companies where she effected successful corporate turnarounds and co-managed the restructuring in excess of $250 million in debt for her clients in the past five (5) years.
