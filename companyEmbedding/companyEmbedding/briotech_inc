THE HISTORY OF HOCL EFFICACY IS FACT,



While  
the  
100  
year  
history  
of  
Hypochlorous  
Acid  
(HOCL)  
has  
provided  
indisputable 
evidence  
of  
its  
efficacy  
in  
healing  
and  
use  
in  
disinfection,  
and  
over  
500  
peer-reviewed, 
published  
papers  
universally  
document  
significant  
beneficial  
results,  
the  
widespread 
use  
of  
HOCL  
has  
remained  
fairly  
stagnant,  
and  
the  
primary  
limiting  
factor  
to  
broad 
adoption of this important technology, historically, has been due to its lack of stability.
With   
that   
knowledge,   
and   
the   
bottom-line   
mission   
to   
fundamentally   
change   
the 
discussion  
of

PRESS RELEASE


NIH    
Scientists    
and    
collaborators    
report    
that    
Briotech    
Inc.’s    
proprietary    
HOCl 
formulation   
rapidly   
inactivates   
resistant   
infectious   
proteins,   
known   
as   
prions,   
that 
cause   
Mad   
Cow,   
Chronic   
Wasting,   
and   
Creutzfeldt–Jakob   
Disease,   
and   
are   
now 
implicated in Alzheimer’s and other chronic brain diseases
WOODINVILLE,  
Wash.  
(September  
29,  
2016)  
Briotech  
Inc.  
today  
announced  
that  
a 
study  
published  
in  
the  
current  
issue  
of  
PLOS  
Pathogens
  
  
proves  
that  
Briotech’s  
unique 
formulation  
of  
pure  
hypochlorous  
acid  
(HOCl)  
inactivates  
infectious  
proteins,  
known 
as prions, that cause chronic brain diseases in humans and animals.  
Investigators  
at  
the  
US  
National  
Institute  
of  
Allergy  
and  
Infectious  
Diseases  
(NIAID) 
Rocky  
Mountain  
Laboratories,  
made  
the  
discovery  
in  
collaboration  
with  
researchers  
at 
the   
University   
of   
Washington   
(UW)   
Bothell,   
UW   
Seattle,   
the   
University   
of   
Verona 
(Italy),  
and  
Briotech  
Inc.  
Their  
  
findings  
demonstrate  
that  
Briotech’s  
patent-pending 
solution  
(BrioHOCl
TM
)  
quickly  
and  
safely  
destroys  
prions,  
the  
most  
resistant  
infectious 
agents known to medical science. 
HOCL  
is  
made  
naturally  
in  
human  
white  
blood  
cells  
as  
a  
key  
part  
of  
the  
body’s  
internal 
defense  
system.  
It  
works  
as  
the  
first  
line  
of  
defense  
at  
wound  
sites  
to  
fight  
infection. 
Briotech’s  
proprietary  
Electro-Chemical  
Activation  
(ECA)  
technology  
enables  
large-
scale    
production    
of    
this    
powerful    
natural    
compound    
for    
use    
in    
consumer    
and 
professional healthcare settings. 
“We’ve  
been  
able  
to  
synthesize  
the  
same  
pure  
substance  
that  
the  
body  
creates  
to 
defend  
itself  
as  
a  
new  
weapon  
in  
the  
fight  
against  
infectious  
disease,  
and  
it’s  
a  
game 
changer  
for  
human  
health,”  
said  
Dan  
Terry,  
founder,  
and  
CEO  
of  
Briotech.  
“With  
broad 
adoption  
of  
BrioHOCl
TM
,  
we  
can  
help  
stop  
the  
spread  
of  
many  
infectious  
diseases, 
even  
those  
caused  
by  
the  
most  
highly  
resistant  
agents  
ever  
discovered
—
prions
—
and 
use  
the  
product  
to  
save  
lives  
and  
improve  
the  
health  
of  
entire  
communities  
around  
the 
world.   
We’re   
excited   
to   
have   
this   
research   
published   
in   
PLOS   
Pathogens
,   
and   
look 
forward  
to  
our  
continued  
collaboration  
with  
the  
NIH  
on  
the  
effects  
of  
BrioHOCl
TM
  
on 
emerging infectious pathogens that threaten global health and safety.”
DESTROYING PRIONS
Prions   
are   
abnormal,   
misfolded   
body   
proteins   
that   
go   
out   
of   
control   
and   
begin   
to 
multiply  
themselves,  
spreading  
throughout  
the  
body  
and  
invading  
the  
brain.  
  
Prions 
are  
most  
commonly  
transmitted  
orally,  
but  
can  
also  
contaminate  
medical  
and  
surgical 
instruments,  
transplanted  
tissues,  
and  
equipment  
used  
in  
food  
processing.  
A  
new,  
fast, 
convenient  
and  
safe  
method  
for  
decontamination  
of  
medical  
instruments,  
surfaces, 
and    
tissues
—
by    
simple    
immersion    
in    
an    
aqueous    
solution    
of    
Briotech’s    
pure 
BrioHOCl
TM
—
can  
overcome  
a  
critically  
important  
deficiency  
in  
infection  
control  
today. 
It  
can  
mitigate  
risks,  
and  
limit  
liabilities  
related  
to  
healthcare  
procedures  
and  
hospital 
acquired diseases.
Prion  
diseases  
are  
most  
widely  
known  
as  
the  
cause  
of  
Mad  
Cow  
Disease  
(BSE).  
Prions 
also  
cause  
Creutzfeldt-Jakob  
Disease  
(CJD)  
in  
humans,  
a  
fatal  
dementia  
with  
a  
long 
incubation  
period.  
Recently,  
research  
has  
shown  
that  
most  
other  
chronic  
degenerative 
diseases  
that  
lead  
to  
dementia,  
including  
Alzheimer’s,  
result  
from  
prions.  
Currently 
untreatable,     
and     
inevitably     
fatal,     
controversy     
swirls     
around     
their     
possible 
transmissibility  
as  
referenced  
in  
Nature
  
(
nature.com/news/the-red-hot-debate-about-
transmissible-alzheimers
)
Prions   
are   
uniquely   
resistant   
to   
the   
disinfection   
and   
sterilization   
procedures   
in 
common   
use   
in   
healthcare   
practice   
today.   
Extreme   
measures   
are   
needed.   
Current 
prion  
decontamination  
protocols  
are  
hazardous  
to  
people,  
damaging  
to  
instruments 
and    
surfaces,    
and    
therefore    
impractical    
for    
transmission    
control.    
“Briotech    
has 
developed  
an  
enabling  
technology,  
one  
that  
offers  
for  
the  
first  
time  
a  
practical  
and  
safe 
way  
of  
destroying  
infectious  
prions,  
the  
disease  
agents  
at  
the  
very  
top  
of  
the  
food 
chain  
when  
it  
comes  
to  
resistance  
to  
disinfection  
measures,”  
said  
Jeff  
Williams,  
PhD, 
BVSc,  
Chief  
Scientific  
Officer  
at  
Briotech.  
“We  
believe  
we’ve  
just  
exposed  
the  
tip  
of  
the 
iceberg  
when  
it  
comes  
to  
revealing  
the  
full  
potential  
of  
the  
pure  
HOCl  
in  
controlling 
and  
preventing  
many  
transmissible  
diseases.  
That’s  
so  
important  
today  
when  
rampant 
antibiotic   
resistance   
is   
challenging   
established   
approaches   
to   
infectious   
disease 
management  
all  
over  
the  
world.  
The  
discovery  
reported  
in  
PLOS  
Pathogens
  
has  
opened 
new  
avenues  
for  
researchers  
to  
explore  
in  
understanding  
the  
relationship  
between 
the  
HOCl  
made  
in  
the  
brain,  
its  
possible  
involvement  
in  
prion  
inactivation  
there,  
and 
the  
disease  
processes  
that  
lead  
to  
dementia.  
Understanding  
those  
processes  
is  
one  
of 
the most urgent priorities facing biomedical science at this time.” 
HOW IT WORKS
BrioHOCl
TM
   
is   
easy   
to   
handle,   
safe   
for   
both   
users   
and   
treated   
surfaces   
and   
is 
environmentally  
safe.  
Pure  
HOCl,  
  
used  
in  
the  
PLOS  
Pathogens
  
report,  
is  
reliably  
stable 
in   
its   
formulation   
and   
powerfully   
effective   
against   
a   
wide   
range   
of   
conventional 
microbial   
disease   
agents.   
The   
solution   
can   
be   
applied   
directly   
to   
skin   
and   
mucous 
membranes,  
hard  
surfaces,  
instruments,  
or  
safely  
aerosolized  
to  
decontaminate  
entire 
rooms. 
Briotech   
manufactures   
BrioHOCl
TM
   
in   
fully-automated   
production   
platforms   
inside 
20’  
shipping  
containers,  
enabling  
production  
and  
distribution  
of  
a  
consistent  
and  
pure 
form of HOCl virtually anywhere in the world.

Verona   
(Italy),   
and   
Briotech   
Inc.   
Their 
findings      
demonstrate      
that      
Briotech’s      
patent-pending 
solution  
(BrioHOCl
TM
)  
quickly  
and  
safely  
destroys  
prions,  
the 
most resistant infectious agents known to medical science. 
HOCL   
is   
made   
naturally   
in   
human   
white   
blood   
cells   
as   
a   
   
   
   






key  
part  
of  
the  
body’s  
internal  
defense  
system.  
It  
works  
as 
the   
first   
line   
of   
defense   
at   
wound   
sites   
to   
fight   
infection. 
Briotech’s   
proprietary   
Electro-Chemical   
Activation   
(ECA) 
technology  
enables  
large-scale  
production  
of  
this  
powerful 
natural   
compound   
for   
use   
in   
consumer   
and   
professional 
healthcare settings. 
“We’ve   
been   
able   
to   
synthesize   
the   
same   
pure   
substance   
   
 
that  
the  
body  
creates  
to  
defend  
itself  
as  
a  
new  
weapon  
in  
the 
fight  
against  
infectious  
disease,  
and  
it’s  
a  
game  
changer  
for 
human  
health,”  
said  
Dan  
Terry,  
founder,  
and  
CEO  
of  
Briotech. 
“With  
broad  
adoption  
of  
BrioHOCl
TM
,  
we  
can  
help  
stop  
the 
spread  
of  
many  
infectious  
diseases,  
even  
those  
caused  
by  
the 
most   
highly   
resistant   
agents   
ever   
discovered
—
prions
—
and 
use  
the  
product  
to  
save  
lives  
and  
improve  
the  
health  
of  
entire 
communities   
around   
the   
world.   
We’re   
excited   
to   
have   
this 
research  
published  
in  
PLOS  
Pathogens
,  
and  
look  
forward  
to 
our  
continued  
collaboration  
with  
the  
NIH  
on  
the  
effects  
of 
BrioHOCl
TM
  
on  
emerging  
infectious  
pathogens  
that  
threaten 
global health and safety.”
DESTROYING PRIONS
Prions   
are   
abnormal,   
misfolded   
body   
proteins   
that   
go   
out   
   
   
   

of    
control    
and    
begin    
to    
multiply    
themselves,    
spreading 
throughout  
the  
body  
and  
invading  
the  
brain.  
  
Prions  
are  
most 
commonly    
transmitted    
orally,    
but    
can    
also    
contaminate 
medical  
and  
surgical  
instruments,  
transplanted  
tissues,  
and 
equipment  
used  
in  
food  
processing.  
  
  
A  
new,  
fast,  
convenient 
and      
safe      
method      
for      
decontamination      
of      
medical 
instruments,  
surfaces,  
and  
tissues
—
by  
simple  
immersion  
in 
an   
aqueous   
solution   
of   
Briotech’s   
pure   
BrioHOCl
TM
—
can 
overcome    
a    
critically    
important    
deficiency    
in    
infection 
control  
today.  
It  
can  
mitigate  
risks,  
and  
limit  
liabilities  
related 
to healthcare procedures and hospital acquired diseases.
Prion  
diseases  
are  
most  
widely  
known  
as  
the  
cause  
of  
Mad 
Cow   
Disease   
(BSE).   
Prions   
also   
cause   
Creutzfeldt-Jakob 
Disease   
(CJD)   
in   
humans,   
a   
fatal   
dementia   
with   
a   
long 
incubation  
period.  
Recently,  
research  
has  
shown  
that  
most 
other  
chronic  
degenerative  
diseases  
that  
lead  
to  
dementia, 
including      
Alzheimer’s,      
result      
from      
prions.      
Currently 
untreatable,  
and  
inevitably  
fatal,  
controversy  
swirls  
around 
their    
possible    
transmissibility    
as    
referenced    
in    
Nature

Prions    
are    
uniquely    
resistant    
to    
the    
disinfection    
and 
sterilization    
procedures    
in    
common    
use    
in    
healthcare 
practice  
today.  
Extreme  
measures  
are  
needed.  
Current  
prion 
decontamination     
protocols     
are     
hazardous     
to     
people, 
damaging    
to    
instruments    
and    
surfaces,    
and    
therefore 
impractical  
for  
transmission  
control.  
“Briotech  
has  
developed 
an  
enabling  
technology,  
one  
that  
offers  
for  
the  
first  
time  
a 
practical   
and   
safe   
way   
of   
destroying   
infectious   
prions,   
the 
disease   
agents   
at   
the   
very   
top   
of   
the   
food   
chain   
when   
it 
comes    
to    
resistance    
to    
disinfection    
measures,”    
said    
Jeff 
Williams,   
PhD,   
BVSc,   
Chief   
Scientific   
Officer   
at   
Briotech.   
 
“We  
believe  
we’ve  
just  
exposed  
the  
tip  
of  
the  
iceberg  
when  
  
 
it  
comes  
to  
revealing  
the  
full  
potential  
of  
the  
pure  
HOCl  
in 
controlling    
and    
preventing    
many    
transmissible    
diseases. 
That’s     
so     
important     
today     
when     
rampant     
antibiotic 
resistance      
is      
challenging      
established      
approaches      
to 
infectious    
disease    
management    
all    
over    
the    
world.    
The 
discovery    
reported    
in    
PLOS    
Pathogens
    
has    
opened    
new 
avenues   
for   
researchers   
to   
explore   
in   
understanding   
the 
relationship    
between    
the    
HOCl    
made    
in    
the    
brain,    
its 
possible   
involvement   
in   
prion   
inactivation   
there,   
and   
the 
disease   
processes   
that   
lead   
to   
dementia.   
Understanding 
those  
processes  
is  
one  
of  
the  
most  
urgent  
priorities  
facing 
biomedical science at this time.” 
HOW IT WORKS
BrioHOCl
TM
  
is  
easy  
to  
handle,  
safe  
for  
both  
users  
and  
treated 
surfaces  
and  
is  
environmentally  
safe.  
Pure  
HOCl,  
  
used  
in  
the 
PLOS   
Pathogens
   
report,   
is   
reliably   
stable   
in   
its   
formulation 
and  
powerfully  
effective  
against  
a

BioTech Inc






























































						Bio Tech, Inc was established in 1988 and has since become the industry leader in microbial treatment programs to solve a wide range of problems in the oilfield and community.
					

						Bio Tech's microbes offer many different solutions to a variety of oil and gas problems. Find out more information about the services offered here.
					

						Bio Tech's microbes' metabolic activity creates byproducts which reduce BODs, CODs, and TSS in wastewater. This results in reduced sludge, odor, algae, and solids.
					

						Our professional staff at Bio Tech is always prepared to answer your questions and concerns about all of the services and products that we offer.
					

						Serving the oil industry for over 25 years.
					






The superior properties and environmental advantages that our microbes provide, in conjunction with our team of professionals, which include microbiologists, chemists, petroleum engineers, lab personnel, technical analytical personnel, and top notch safety personnel have allowed us to provide outstanding service, competitive pricing, and a commitment to our customers that has made us the vanguard of the industry for over 20 years.  
As a result of our success, Bio Tech now covers the continental United States and Canada, creating innovative disciplines for our treatment program at home and abroad.  Bio Tech has the R&D, assets, personnel, and equipment to research and develop innovative new solutions previously untried in the industry, and to ramp up wherever new solutions are needed and business requirements dictate.

BIOREMEDIATION


The microorganisms that are utilized in Bio Tech's paraffin control products are chosen for their ability to use hydrocarbons, specifically alkanes, as their sole carbon source for growth.  Metabolizing these hydrocarbons, (C-16 through C-60+) results in the microbial �cracking� of long-chain molecules into short-chain compounds.  
Metabolic products produced by the microorganisms, such as ketones, alcohols, organic acids, and aldehydes, function similarly to oilfield chemicals used as wax dispersants and pour point depressants.
The microbial "cracking" in conjunction with the secretion of these metabolic products result in reduced viscosity, increased API gravity, reduced cloud point, and reduced pour point.


The facultative anaerobic microbes used to treat asphaltenes are selected by Bio Tech for their acute biosurfactant-producing properties.  These biosurfactants control select asphaltenes, enhance flow properties of asphaltic oils, and prevent paraffin deposition.  The microbes break apart organic deposits in perfs, pumps, and tubing.  
We also offer a natural solvent used in conjunction with our microbial blends that enhances the process of asphaltene elimination.  This organic dispersant removes and bioremediates hydrocarbons by decreasing the surface tension, thus forming microscopic, spherical droplets, which are quickly bioremediated by the bacteria due to their increased surface area.  Digestion begins upon application and continues after the product is washed from surfaces.


Bio Tech's microbes can demulsify both oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions.  The activity is related to the bacterial cell acting as a wetting bridge between droplets in the continuous phase.  The various products of bacterial metabolism, such as biosurfactants, organic acids, and alcohols also contribute to the demulsification process.  


Bio Tech's marine-based, facultative anaerobic microbes are very efficient at preventing scale formation.  Our microbes produce various substances that mimic many of the properties of scale inhibitors.  Organic acids produced by the microbes act as chelating agents for divalent cations such as calcium, iron, magnesium, and barium.  The microbes also produce extra cellular substances, such as polysaccharides, polyphosphates, lipopolysaccharides, phospholipids, glycolipids and proteins that have chelating, anti-precipitation, filming, and biosurfactant activities.  These substances bind cations, restricting their capacity to form mineral deposits, and also coat surfaces to prevent nucleation sites for potential scale growth. 


The marine-based, facultative anaerobic microbes utilized in Bio Tech's corrosion control products protect the formation face, as well as downhole and surface equipment from corrosion.  This is achieved through the process of sequestering, filming, and removing solids that cause under-deposit corrosion.  
Byproducts produced by these microorganisms, such as organic acids and ketones, are polarizing agents that inhibit the corrosion process.  These filming agents act as passivating agents to control corrosion of metal surfaces.   By coating (passivating) surfaces, the interaction between corrosive compounds, like carbonic acids and sulfides, is mitigated and the corrosive process is reduced.  This is accomplished by neutralizing the cathodic portion of the metal, breaking the �circuit� of the corrosion cell.


Bio Tech's proprietary microbial cultures in oilfield applications create a decrease in the number and activity of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) and acid producing bacteria (APB).  Through the process of biocompetitive exclusion, Bio Tech's microbes compete with SRB/APB for nutrients in the aqueous environment, thus "starving out" these harmful bacteria.
Our microbes out-compete the SRB/APB for nutrients in the aqueous environment (ie. iron and small molecule fatty acids) overwhelming them and reducing their populations. 
Microbially Induced Corrosion (MIC), is corrosion caused or promoted by microorganisms known as chemoautotrophs. Chemoautotrophs use inorganic compounds such as sulfate to survive to derive their energy.  Bio Tech products are chemoheterotrophs, which use organic compounds to survive.  Bio Tech's microbes, do not respire or metabolize sulphates, therefore we do not share them as an energy source.


Our microbes dramatically reduce the nutrient load of the water, outcompeting other microbes and the algae for the existing food sources.


Bio Tech uses a wide range water clarifying microbial blend containing a proprietary combination of natural, facultative anaerobic species selected for their heavy biosurfactants/byproducts production.
Byproducts such as alcohols, ketones, organic acids, and biosurfactants inhibit a wide range of water borne scale (such as calcium carbonate and sulfate scales, as well as iron sulfide) through their metabolic processes (chelation and sequestering). 


										Bio Tech's microbes are ideal for achieving tertiary recovery. 

Microbes degrade skin damage, increasing fluid entry (injectivity) into the reservoir by keeping ions in suspension
Reservoir rock acts as a "bio-reactor" to address compounds released from formations
Microbial activity lowers injection pressures and increases injection rates
Microbial activity and bio surfactants lower the interfacial tension between the water and oil interface, releasing residual oil

										
										Mobility ratio is improved, wettability driven towards strongly water wet, residual oil is imbibed into pore channels, resulting in enhanced ultimate oil recovery (MEOR)
									

Bio Tech offers the industrial community an environmentally safe and cost effective method for the clean-up of contaminated and/or hazardous wastes.  Our naturally occurring microbes are formulated for the broad spectrum degradation of a variety of compounds, such as simple aromatics, to petroleum related spills.
Our microbes have proven very effective in a variety of in-situ applications.


Bio Tech successfully treats refineries at underground water and hydrocarbon recovery tanks, frac tanks, ponds, process water systems, centrifuge systems, and soil remediation.

										Our program is proving successful in the treatment of large refineries in the control of:


BODs
CODs
Severe algae bloom
Heavy tank bottoms
Oil/water separation
Sludge and solids contamination
Ammonia
Bioremediation









Applications:

Meat processing plants

Research, technology and genomics are coming together to create a platform that allows researchers to decipher the cause of disease as never before. Each advance opens new doors, new cures, new treatments.
And yet, it’s not enough.
"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A Little More Normal

















A Little More Normal

“My entire world sort of clicked off. I didn't hear anything. I didn't see anything. And the only thing that I could think of was: I'm going to be dead in six months.”
This is James, looking back at 1988, the year the Dow closed above 2100, the Hubble Space Telescope was turned on, and James was diagnosed with HIV. “I'm a survivor of domestic violence, child molestation, depression,” he says with some pride. Even so, James knew he was about to enter the toughest fight of his life.
 After all, while HIV/AIDS awareness was still relatively new in 1988, James was seeing growing evidence of something much bigger. “First, there would be the fever and then there was the immense weight loss along with the Kaposi’s sarcoma lesions that would appear on the body,” James says. “A person would die and sometimes it would happen over a week.”
 James also explained that, since doctors had just begun researching HIV, there were almost no treatment options available. “The medication at the time was fairly nonexistent,” he recalls. Of the side effects, he says “the medication that they had at the time was even worse than the disease itself.”
 Thanks to years of investment and hard work by America’s biopharmaceutical companies, and other health care stakeholders, things have changed dramatically – and patients likes James, who can look back 29 years in near-disbelief, are proof.
 Brian, a researcher developing HIV/AIDS medications for nearly 20 years, is astounded by how far treatment has come. “The progress is actually quite miraculous,” he says. “In the early days, the goal was just keeping patients alive as long as possible.  Resistance was rampant and the regimens were not tolerable for many patients, but the alternative was death.  Frankly, both options were horrible.  Fast forward 30 years and now we have several one-pill, once-a-day treatment options for patients and their physicians to choose from.”  
 “They can live a normal life – a healthy, successful life.”
 Today, the outlook has never been more promising with more than 50 medicines and vaccines in development to treat, prevent, or help with the disease impact of HIV/AIDS.
 As Brian explains, treatment is no longer simply about survival, but enabling individuals to regain the quality of life they once had. “It is extremely motivating when we hear that a physician has a patient who is benefiting, that the new [medicines] we've brought forward have allowed the patient to regain weight, reverse the progression of their disease and essentially have a new life ahead of them.”
James understands the sentiment personally – and recognizes the network that helped him back. “My family, my doctors who were trying to make sure that I got the right medications to keep me going,” he says, “the programs that helped me find housing, sent me back to school, and helped me to better myself.” 
  “I have a great doctor. Most of doctors that I've had have been very good and this last one has been just fantastic.  We have gotten me to a point now where my numbers are just fantastic.”
 James’s experience motivated him to help others. He began volunteering at San Francisco City Hall by taking calls, helping around the office, and any job in between. This volunteer work led to HIV community activism – and a run for office. While he may not have won his election, James continued to give back to others, providing the same kind of support he is so thankful to have received. 
 James recently lost his partner to AIDS and his brother to cancer. Still, he knew he had to keep moving forward. 
 “The thing that gives me hope is just being able to wake up every day,” he says. “I will get back up.”
 Brian knows there’s still a long way to go. “There are people who are alive today because of the work that we do,” he acknowledges. “The work is often very quiet, very slow moving, very frustrating. But over time it has a major impact on thousands of people.”
And Brian sees even greater hope ahead.
“I don't take no for an answer,” he says. “The power of imagination and innovation is incredible and I see it every day in the eyes of my colleagues.”  “Science is real and the key to solving problems. We just need to find the right people to bring together, collaborate, and find a solution.”  
James is grateful for Brian’s – and many other researchers’ – tenacity. “I'm not sure how to explain it any better,” he says, “than it just makes me feel a little more normal.”

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

America’s biopharmaceutical companies are driving the future of medicine through bold advances in genomics, personalized medicine and immunotherapy. The new era of genomics provides better understanding of the genes that can cause certain diseases and equips researchers with the tools they need to tailor treatments like never before. Personalized medicines are at the center of this revolution, offering patients individualized therapies unique to each patient. Immunotherapy is transforming cancer care in new ways by harnessing the patient’s immune system to eliminate the disease or slow its growth. Together, these advancements are helping patients live longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

Personalized Medicine
Personalized medicine — sometimes referred to as precision or individualized medicine —is an emerging field of medicine that uses diagnostic tools to identify specific biological markers, often genetic, to help assess which medical treatments and procedures will be best for each patient.

World's best overall value for natural products!


                        Since 1996, iHerb has made great efforts to enhance your online shopping experience.  Initially, our
                        company promoted the benefits of St. John's Wort; hence the name: iHerb.  We carry one of the
                        largest selections of high-quality natural products at the best overall value.  Consider iHerb your own
                        California-based natural products store!
                    










Top 10 reasons to make iHerb your number one choice!




1. Shop directly and save!

            iHerb.com is one of the world's largest online stores for natural products.
            We have been in business since 1996 and have two distribution centers, based
            in California and Kentucky.
        

            Browse our site and you'll find over 1,200 brands and 35,000 brand name products that you may also find at health food stores and natural
            pharmacies -- with one important difference: Our prices are typically 30 - 40% less. Also, don't forget to check our  Specials page for
            additional discounts on some best-selling products.
        


2. Free or discounted shipping

            Every iHerb order is eligible to receive discounted or free shipping! In general, the more products you add to your cart, the greater the likelihood that you will receive free shipping. In some cases you’ll even find that ordering one product alone may result in free shipping. We encourage you to experiment with different product combinations in order to find the best value, and share your cart with others! iHerb is the world's leader in bringing the best overall value in natural products to its customers.
        


3. Honest customer product reviews

            Unlike retailers that display third-party reviews, all of our reviews are written by iHerb customers. In order to write a review, you must
            have ordered the product from iHerb first. This means you receive honest and candid reviews, thereby helping you make a smarter buying decision.
        


4. Assurance of freshness with expiration dates

            Because we have one of the highest product turnover rates in the industry, iHerb is able to offer you the FRESHEST products possible!
            Our inventory turnover rate averages to 8.1 times per year; among the highest turnover rates, if not the highest, in our industry. This means that iHerb products are on the shelf an average of only 45 days!
        

            Plus, most products we carry have expiration or best-by dates, which can be accessed on the product page. It's like holding the real bottle or package in your hand, as you would in a typical "brick and mortar" store.
        


5. Air-conditioned, super clean warehouses

            iHerb’s distribution centers  are entirely climate-controlled, which protects the products from such conditions as humidity, heat and cold. This level of quality control is employed by iHerb to ensure product effectiveness for the customer.
            In addition, our distribution centers are industry certified by NSF International, earning Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) certification.
        


6. Solid personal privacy commitment

            Personal privacy is critically important to us. Since 1996, iHerb has never sold, leased or shared any customer information with third parties. Your personal information remains entirely confidential.
        


7. Enhanced 256-bit encryption with tokenization

            Simply put, we only store the last 4 digits and the expiration date of your credit card, so you can identify what card you are using.
        


8. 24 hour/7 day customer service

            One of the ways iHerb can offer such low prices is by automating the whole ordering process. While our customer service agents don't
            actually take orders, they do offer live  customer support from our California facility, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Pacific Time), Monday - Friday.
            We are also reachable 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, by chat and email to answer questions and resolve issues with your order. Of course,
            nobody's perfect. We may get quite busy at times and we ask for a little patience. We'll do our best to take care of things promptly, efficiently
            and courteously -- this is what our customers deserve!
        


9. Save even more by helping others save!

            As an iHerb customer, share your favorite iHerb products or categories, or even a shopping cart containing multiple products with others via simple Rewards links, and you will save even more!



10. A greener way to shop

            When you shop with us, you're part of a global solution. iHerb uses 100% post-consumer recycled paper for 90% of all shipping boxes. Our bubble wrap is 40% recyclable, and we recycle virtually all packing materials received 
            from manufacturers. All in the interest of a healthier, more sustainable planet!  Read more.
