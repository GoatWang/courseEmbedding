Principles for Responsible Investment

Principles for Responsible Investment


Mariner Investment Group, LLC became a signatory to the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) in August 2013. As a Firm, we realize the importance of socially conscious investing to our investors as well as our stakeholders. We believe the only effective way to incorporate such beliefs is to make them integral to our investment process whenever practicable.
Our approach is one of inclusion. We view Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) information and related risks to be additive to our investment process. Our implementation and integration does not replace fundamental or technical analysis. Rather, ESG analysis may be performed in conjunction with traditional evaluation, as we believe ESG risks should be considered in the decision making process.
The United Nations-supported PRI initiative is an international network of investors working together in an effort to put the six Principles for Responsible Investment into practice.  PRI signatories endeavor to:

Incorporate ESG issues into investment analysis and decision-making process
Be active owners and incorporate ESG issues into our ownership policies and practices
Seek appropriate disclosures on ESG issues by the entities in which we invest
Promote acceptance and implementation of the Principles within the investment industry
Work together to enhance our effectiveness in implementing the Principles
Report our activities and progress towards implementing the Principles

These Principles represent the goal of understanding the implications of sustainability for investors and supporting signatories to incorporate these issues into their investment decision making and ownership practices. The Principles are voluntary and aspirational.
Mariner believes ESG information and analysis are important for many reasons including to identify potential risks within our investments. We are committed to implementing ESG factors within our investment process, and have dedicated considerable resources in an effort to ensure investment practices are in line with our stated goal of embracing the UN PRI Principles and including ESG information as part of our investment considerations. By utilizing MSCI ESG Analytics to analyze certain investments on an ongoing basis, we have been able to assess potential risks in regards to ESG factors and add a layer of information to our robust research capabilities. Additionally, we are constantly searching for ways to enhance our ESG framework, be it through additional resources or internal processes. We are committed to this implementation, and expect understanding the implications ESG risks can have on an investment portfolio to be the norm in the near future.

Mariner's Galton Team Appoints Head of Servicing Oversight

		  Former Chase Mortgage executive adds critical servicing expertise to residential mortgage credit team
		

Nov 01, 2011, 08:29 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Mariner Investment Group, LLC 











 
















































 

 




















 


NEW YORK, Nov. 1, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Mariner Investment Group, LLC's residential mortgage credit investment team Galton Capital Management recently announced the appointment of Tim Lynch as Head of Servicing Oversight for that unit. Mr. Lynch will augment the firm's expertise in mortgage investing as it anticipates a new investment product offering. Mr. Lynch will oversee and manage all mortgage servicing activities related to this new product including servicer evaluation, selection and monitoring across all of that investment team's activities.  
Mr. Lynch joins the Galton investment team with 25 years of mortgage industry experience, with a particular expertise in mortgage servicing. He held various senior servicing management roles at two of the largest U.S. servicers - Chase Manhattan Mortgage and Washington Mutual. Most recently, Mr. Lynch worked for Chase Home Finance as a Default Risk Portfolio Manager and later as Head of Liquidation Strategy in Chase's Default Strategy department. 
"Tim's hiring is a natural extension of our team's mortgage securities focus and augments our expertise in trading residential mortgages," said Matt Whalen, a portfolio manager and co-head of the Galton investment team. "His experience, particularly his long career at Chase Manhattan Mortgage, provides us with a thorough understanding of servicing operations and the rapidly shifting regulatory environment that will help our valuation, risk assessment and management of whole loans and residential mortgage-backed securities, on both the long and short side."
Mr. Lynch rejoins several colleagues from Chase Manhattan Mortgage, including Mr. Whalen, bringing critical servicing expertise to a seasoned mortgage credit trading team whose experience spans origination, servicing, structuring, legal review, trading and hedging of both residential whole loans and RMBS. 
"Tim's hands-on experience managing default strategies for the third largest U.S. servicer, specifically during a time of unprecedented market stress and complexity, will bring a unique perspective to our investment process," said Kevin J. Finnerty, a portfolio manager and co-head of the Galton investment team. "We believe his grasp of the servicing industry's behavior will provide us with an informational and competitive advantage in evaluating opportunities in the whole loan and RMBS markets and in maximizing returns on our mortgage-related investments." 
The firm is planning a new investment product focusing primarily on acquiring pools of seasoned whole loans, as well as investing in legacy non-agency RMBS, single name RMBS CDS, and mortgage credit indices. It will be the team's third longer duration investment product offering.
The Galton investment team joined Mariner in December 2007 and is led by Kevin J. Finnerty, Matt Whalen and Paul Park. As of June 1, 2011, the team advised more than $1.3 billion in committed capital on behalf of Mariner employing long- and short-term duration investment strategies primarily with the objective of investing in residential mortgage opportunities. The team is currently comprised of 16 members.
About Mariner Investment Group, LLC 
Mariner Investment Group, LLC is an SEC registered investment adviser, founded in 1992 by William J. Michaelcheck. With approximately $12 billion in assets under management in conjunction with its Associated Advisers(1), Mariner manages multiple proprietary hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, and other alternative investments.  Mariner has 178 employees located in Harrison, New York City, Boston, Rowayton, London, Seoul, and Tokyo(2). Mariner's global clients include insurance companies, public and corporate plan sponsors, endowments, foundations, family offices, and institutional money managers.
(1) As of September 1, 2011, Mariner’s total AUM was approximately $4.9 billion (“Mariner AUM”). In addition, Mariner is associated with certain investment advisers (e.g., pursuant to an ongoing agreement in which Mariner provides certain substantive support services to those firms in exchange for a percentage share of that adviser’s revenues) who are separately registered with the SEC (the “Associated Advisers”) and have collective AUM of approximately $7.5 billion (the “Associated Advisers’ AUM”). In total, Mariner’s AUM in conjunction with the Associated Advisers’ AUM is approximately $11.9 billion. Please note that in certain limited instances, Mariner serves as the investment manager to client accounts (e.g., custom “fund of one” investor vehicles), but allocates capital from that client account to Associated Advisers (e.g., invests in a hedge fund advised by an Associated Adviser) (the “Allocated Assets”). Accordingly these Allocated Assets (currently $510.6 million) are included in both Mariner’s AUM and its Associated Adviser’s AUM. AUM figures are estimated and unaudited.
(2) Offices in London and Tokyo are Mariner affiliated offices.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.

Maritime / Offshore Information

				We at Arnold & Itkin have seen the level of devastation that offshore
				 accidents can cause. From the explosion of
				oil rigs to maritime employers who place workers in dangerous conditions,
				 we have seen and handled it all.
			







Offshore Injuries
							Learn More





In 2013, the CDC released a study looking into the frequency of fatal offshore
	 injuries (2003-2010). At the conclusion, they noted that someone who is
	 working in the offshore oil & gas industry is 7 times more likely
	 to die than any other worker. As officially the most dangerous industry
	 in the country, it is no surprise that maritime workers find themselves
	 suffering from devastating and even life-altering injuries all too often.

	You as an injured worker have rights
	 and ways to seek just compensation.

We can help you take the necessary steps to fight for the compensation you need.


Offshore InjuriesOffshore FatalitiesCase Evaluation








Seaman Injury
							Learn More





If you qualify as a "seaman," there are specific laws that deal
	 with how you can recover compensation. For example, maritime law permits
	 injured seaman to recover compensation to cover lost wages, living expenses,
	 and medical care. In some cases, the seaman can file a case for further
	 compensation.

	So how does the court determine
	 who is and who is not a seaman?

First, the individual must be working on a vessel. Second, they must contribute
	 to that vessel's function and/or the accomplishment of its mission.
	 Third, they must be "connected" to the vessel.

	 passing of this act, commonly referred to as the Jones Act, helped provide
	 formalized protection for seamen. The most well-known sections deal with
	 the protection for injured seamen. For example, seamen can take legal
	 action for unseaworthiness.

	Under the Jones Act, a seaman
	 can file a claim for damages.

This law has gone a long way in helping give seamen paths to recovery in
	 the wake of a serious accident. It, however, is not simple; it is important
	 to have a knowledgeable attorney who can help you navigate it.

Harbor Workers
							Learn More





Harbor workers are not "seamen"; however, they are still heavily
	 involved in the maritime industry. These workers can be involved in many
	 different maritime functions, including construction, conversion, or dry
	 docking. Still, because they do not meet seaman requirements, they do
	 not benefit from the same laws.

	Instead, harbor workers receive
	 protection from the LHWCA.

The LHWCA operates similarly to workers' compensation; for example,
	 it does not matter who was at fault for the accident—compensation
	 can be recovered either way. Under the LHWCA, a harbor worker can recover
	 just compensation if they were working in a ship or boat yard located
	 on navigable waters.

Types of Accidents

Any accident that occurs to someone who is aboard a vessel in open waters
	 is referred to as an "offshore accident." This, however, is
	 where similarities end as the types of accidents that can occur are deeply
	 varied. Accidents may be tied into the type of vessel the worker is aboard
	 or related to the type of work they do.

	No matter how you were injured, you
	 deserve to have a compassionate lawyer.

At Arnold & Itkin, we have years of experience and have successfully
	 recovered billions of dollars on behalf of our clients. To learn more

Maritime Piracy
							Learn More





Pirates are not something limited to big screen movies. In fact, they are
	 a very real and present danger to people in the offshore industry, with
	 hundreds of vessels coming under pirate attack since 2007.

	Maritime piracy is on the rise with
	 250+ attacks happening in 2013.

Statistics such as this clearly demonstrate the very real threat that pirates
	 pose to maritime workers. If you were injured in a pirate attack or if
	 you lost a loved one, we encourage you to reach out and contact our firm.
	 We understand the risks maritime workers face, and we are committed to
	 helping them recover.

Oil Spill Claims
							Learn More





If you or someone you love has been affected by an oil spill, such as the
	 one that occurred after the Deepwater Horizon tragedy, you should not
	 hesitate to get the help you need from skilled maritime lawyers.

	Workers, residents, and businesses
	 may be able to file a claim for damages.

Not only can an oil spill cause significant damage on an individual’s
	 health, but it can also disrupt a business. For this reason, individuals
	 affected by an oil spill may be able to file a claim for medical benefits,
	 property damage, and more. To discuss your current situation, we encourage
	 you to contact our firm today.

Maritime Law
							Learn More





Laws that govern offshore activities are commonly referred to as maritime
	 or admiralty law. There are many different branches of this law that look
	 specifically into different functions, situations, and more.

	General maritime law was created to
	 provide adequate protection for seamen.

Under this law, injured seaman benefit from "maintenance and cure."
	 This is a doctrine that permits injured seamen to recover compensation
	 to cover living expenses, lost wages, and medical care. The maritime employer
	 is also required to "cure" a seaman by providing room and board
	 and medical care. Other laws and acts include the Jones Act, the LHWCA,
	 and the DOHSA—all of which can be used to help injured workers.

Longshoreman Rights
							Learn More





Not all maritime workers work in open water. In fact, a common maritime
	 job involves longshoremen—individuals who are employed in the port
	 and are largely responsible for the loading and unloading of cargo. As
	 they are not considered traditional "seamen," there are laws
	 that deal specifically with these individuals.

	The most well-known is the Longshore
	 and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.

The LHWCA provides protection from employment-injury and occupational-disease
	 and is similar to workers' compensation laws as it does not matter
	 who was at fault for the accident; regardless, longshoremen and their
	 families can recover financial compensation to cover everything from medical
	 payments to rehab.


Longshoreman RightsHarbor WorkersFree Case Evaluation








Types of Injuries
							Learn More





No two accidents are the same. Neither are the injuries. In some cases,
	 a maritime accident could lead to something minor like a contusion, shallow
	 laceration, or a bump. This, however, is not always the case.

	All too often the injuries sustained
	 can be tragic, life-altering, or fatal.

For example, offshore workers may suffer injuries to the head, neck, or
	 back. Not all injuries are physical either, as many victims of horrific
	 maritime accidents may walk away suffering from PTSD. Regardless of the
	 type of injury you sustained, our firm can help you in the fight for fair
	 compensation.

Oil Rig Explosions

One of the most devastating types of accidents that can occur is the explosion
	 of an oil rig. You see it in the headlines all of the time--an oil rig
	 exploding and causing life-threatening injuries to those aboard. At our
	 firm, we are intimately knowledgeable about these cases and are well-prepared
	 to help our clients.

	We helped more than 1/3 of the crew
	 hurt in the Deepwater Horizon explosion.

We saw first-hand the devastating impact that these accidents can have,
	 and the way that the maritime workers suffer in the aftermath. These accidents
	 are often fatal and, sadly, can usually be avoided with the proper care
	 and caution. At our firm, we are committed to pursuing justice on behalf
	 of the injured.

Maritime / Offshore Information

				We at Arnold & Itkin have seen the level of devastation that offshore
				 accidents can cause. From the explosion of
				oil rigs to maritime employers who place workers in dangerous conditions,
				 we have seen and handled it all.
			







Offshore Injuries
							Learn More





In 2013, the CDC released a study looking into the frequency of fatal offshore
	 injuries (2003-2010). At the conclusion, they noted that someone who is
	 working in the offshore oil & gas industry is 7 times more likely
	 to die than any other worker. As officially the most dangerous industry
	 in the country, it is no surprise that maritime workers find themselves
	 suffering from devastating and even life-altering injuries all too often.

	You as an injured worker have rights
	 and ways to seek just compensation.

We can help you take the necessary steps to fight for the compensation you need.


Offshore InjuriesOffshore FatalitiesCase Evaluation








Seaman Injury
							Learn More





If you qualify as a "seaman," there are specific laws that deal
	 with how you can recover compensation. For example, maritime law permits
	 injured seaman to recover compensation to cover lost wages, living expenses,
	 and medical care. In some cases, the seaman can file a case for further
	 compensation.

	So how does the court determine
	 who is and who is not a seaman?

First, the individual must be working on a vessel. Second, they must contribute
	 to that vessel's function and/or the accomplishment of its mission.
	 Third, they must be "connected" to the vessel.
