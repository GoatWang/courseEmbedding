(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Introduction  The following is management's discussion of the financial results, liquidity and other key items related to our performance and should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the term the "Company," "Spectrum," "we," "our," or "us" are used to refer to Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries and SB/RH Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries, collectively.  Business Overview  We are a diversified global branded consumer products company. The Company manufactures, markets and/or distributes its products in approximately 160 countries in the North America ("NA"), Europe, Middle East & Africa ("EMEA"), Latin America ("LATAM") and Asia-Pacific ("APAC") regions through a variety of trade channels, including retailers, wholesalers and distributors, original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), construction companies and hearing aid professionals. We enjoy strong name recognition of our various brands and patented technologies. Our diversified global branded consumer products have positions in several product categories and types. We manage the businesses in five vertically integrated, product-focused segments: (i) Global Batteries & Appliances ("GBA"), (ii) Global Pet Supplies ("PET"), (iii) Home and Garden ("H&G"), (iv) Hardware & Home Improvement ("HHI") and (v) Global Auto Care ("GAC"). Global and geographic strategic initiatives and financial objectives are determined at the corporate level. Each segment is responsible for implementing defined strategic initiatives and achieving certain financial objectives and has a general manager responsible for sales and marketing initiatives and the financial results for all product lines within that segment. See Note 16, "Segment Information" of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for more information pertaining to segments. The following table summarizes the respective product types, brands, and regions for each of the segments:  Segment Products Brands Regions GBA Consumer batteries: Alkaline, zinc Consumer batteries: Rayovac� NA carbon, and NiMH rechargeable , VARTA�.

Table of Contents  Refinancing Activity  See Note 9, "Debt" in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere within this Quarterly Report, for additional detail regarding debt. The following recent financing activity has a significant impact on the comparability of financial results on the condensed consolidated financial statements.  On October 6, 2016, the Company entered into the first amendment to the credit agreement under its Term Loans, reducing the interest rate margins applicable to the USD Term Loan to adjusted LIBOR subject to a 0.75% floor plus margin of 2.50% per annum, or base rate with a 1.75% floor plus margin of 1.50% per annum. On March 6, 2017, the Company entered into a second amendment to the Credit Agreement expanding the overall capacity of the Revolver Facility to $700 million, reducing the interest rate margin to either adjusted LIBOR plus margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.25%, or base rate plus margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.25%, reducing the commitment fee to 35bps, and extending the maturity to March 2022.  On September 20, 2016, we issued ?425 million aggregate principal amount of 4.00% unsecured notes due 2026 (the "4.00% Notes"). The proceeds from the 4.00% Notes and draws on the Revolver were used to repay our outstanding 6.375% unsecured notes due 2020 (the "6.375% Notes") and pay fees and expenses in connection with the refinancing. The Company repurchased $390.3 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.375% Notes through a cash tender offer on September 20, 2016, with the remaining outstanding aggregate principal amount of $129.7 million subsequently redeemed by the Company during the three month period ended January 1, 2017.  Restructuring Activity  We continually seek to improve our operational efficiency, match our manufacturing capacity and product costs to market demand and better utilize our manufacturing resources. We have undertaken various initiatives to reduce manufacturing and operating costs, which may have a significant impact on the comparability of financial results on the condensed consolidated financial statements. The most significant of these initiatives are the GAC Business Rationalization Initiative, which began in the three month period ended July 3, 2016 and anticipated to be incurred through September 30, 2017; and the HHI Distribution Center Consolidation, which began in the three month period ended April 2, 2017 and is anticipated to be incurred through December 31, 2019. See Note 4, "Restructuring and Related Charges" in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere within this Quarterly report for additional detail.  Table of Contents  Non-GAAP Measurements  Our consolidated and segment results contain non-GAAP metrics such as organic net sales, and adjusted EBITDA ("Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization"). While we believe organic net sales and adjusted EBITDA are useful supplemental information, such adjusted results are not intended to replace our financial results in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States ("GAAP") and should be read in conjunction with those GAAP results.  Organic Net Sales. We define organic net sales as net sales excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and/or impact from acquisitions (when applicable). We believe this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from our activities without the effect of changes in currency exchange rate and/or acquisitions. We use organic net sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and segment performance. Organic growth is calculated by comparing organic net sales to net sales in the prior year. The effect of changes in currency exchange rates is determined by translating the period's net sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior comparative period. Net sales are attributed to the geographic regions based on the country of destination. We exclude net sales from acquired businesses in the current year for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. The following is a reconciliation of reported net sales to organic net sales for the three and six month periods ended April 2, 2017 compared to net sales for the three and six month periods ended April 3, 2016, respectively:   April 2, 2017 Three Month Period Ended Effect of (in millions, except Changes in Organic Net Sales %) Net Sales Currency Net Sales April 3, 2016 Variance Consumer batteries $ 185.2 $ 2.0 $ 187.2 $ 178.2 $ 9.0 5.1% Small appliances 123.6 3.5 127.1 138.3 (11.2) (8.1%) Personal care 104.7 2.0 106.7 108.4 (1.7) (1.6%) Global Batteries & Appliances 413.5 7.5 421.0 424.9 (3.9) (0.9%) Hardware & Home Improvement 313.7 (1.3) 312.4 301.7 10.7 3.5% Global Pet Supplies 191.8 3.4 195.2 208.5 (13.3) (6.4%) Home and Garden 131.9 - 131.9 155.0 (23.1) (14.9%) Global Auto Care 119.0 0.1 119.1 119.5 (0.4) (0.3%) Total $ 1,169.9 $ 9.7 $ 1,179.6 $ 1,209.6 (30.0) (2.5%) April 2, 2017 Six Month Period Ended Effect of (in millions, except Changes in Organic Net Sales %) Net Sales Currency Net Sales April 3, 2016 Variance Consumer batteries $ 445.7 $ 6.5 $ 452.2 $ 430.8 $ 21.4 5.0% Small appliances 310.0 10.9 320.9 328.2 (7.3) (2.2%) Personal care 267.3 5.7 273.0 277.2 (4.2) (1.5%) Global Batteries & Appliances 1,023.0 23.1 1,046.1 1,036.2 9.9 1.0% Hardware & Home Improvement 602.5 (1.1) 601.4 584.3 17.1 2.9% Global Pet Supplies 386.0 6.2 392.2 411.9 (19.7) (4.8%) Home and Garden 181.7 - 181.7 202.7 (21.0) (10.4%) Global Auto Care 188.5 0.2 188.7 193.3 (4.6) (2.4%) Total $ 2,381.7 $ 28.4 $ 2,410.1 $ 2,428.4 (18.3) (0.8%)  Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a metric used by management and we believe this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects ongoing operating performance and trends of our segments, excluding certain non-cash based expenses and/or non-recurring items during each of the comparable periods and facilitates comparisons between peer companies since interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization can differ greatly between organizations as a result of differing capital structures and tax strategies. Adjusted EBITDA is also used for determining the Company's debt covenant. See Note 9, "Debt" in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere within this Quarterly Report, for additional detail. EBITDA is calculated by excluding the Company's income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation expense and amortization expense (from intangible assets) from net income. Adjusted EBITDA further excludes: (1) stock based compensation expense as it is a non-cash based compensation cost, see Note 13 "Share Based Compensation" in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere within this Quarterly Report for further details; (2) acquisition and integration charges that consist of transaction costs from acquisition transactions during the period or subsequent integration related project costs directly associated with the acquired business, see Note 3 "Acquisition and Integration Charges" in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere within this Quarterly Report for further details; (3) restructuring and related charges, which consist of project costs associated with restructuring initiatives across the segments, see  Table of Contents  Note 4 "Restructuring and Related Charges" in the Notes to the Condensed  May 02, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction SB/RH Holdings, LLC., a Delaware corporation ("SB/RH" or the "Company"), is a global branded consumer products company. SB/RH Holdings, LLC, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. ("SB Holdings"). SB Holdings' common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") under the symbol "SPB." Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms the "Company," "Spectrum," "we," "our" or "us" are used to refer to SB /RH and its subsidiaries.  Business Overview  Results of Operations  Table of Contents  In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q we refer to the three month period ended March 30, 2014 as the "Fiscal 2014 Quarter," the six month period ended March 30, 2014 as the "Fiscal 2014 Six Months," the three month period ended March 31, 2013 as the "Fiscal 2013 Quarter," and the six month period ended March 31, 2013 as the "Fiscal 2013 Six Months."  Net Sales. Net sales for the Fiscal 2014 Quarter increased $34 million to $1,022 million from $988 million in the Fiscal 2013 Quarter, a 3% increase. The following table details the principal components of the change in net sales from the Fiscal 2013 Quarter to the Fiscal 2014 Quarter (in millions):   Net Sales Fiscal 2013 Quarter Net Sales $ 988 Increase in consumer batteries 14 Increase in home and garden control products 13 Increase in hardware and home improvement products 10 Increase in electric shaving and grooming products 2 Increase in electronic personal care products 2 Increase in small appliances 1 Decrease in pet supplies (2 ) Foreign currency impact, net (6 ) Fiscal 2014 Quarter Net Sales $ 1,022  Net sales for the Fiscal 2014 Six Months increased $264 million to $2,122 million from $1,858 million in the Fiscal 2013 Six Months, a 14% increase. The following table details the principal components of the change in net sales from the Fiscal 2013 Six Months to the Fiscal 2014 Six Months (in millions):   Net Sales Fiscal 2013 Six Months Net Sales $ 1,858 Increase in hardware and home improvement products 255 Increase in home and garden control products 15 Increase in electric personal care products 7 Increase in consumer batteries 6 Decrease in pet supplies (12 ) Foreign currency impact, net (7 ) Fiscal 2014 Six Months Net Sales $ 2,122  Consolidated net sales by product line for the Fiscal 2014 Quarter, the Fiscal 2013 Quarter, the Fiscal 2014 Six Months and the Fiscal 2013 Six Months are as follows (in millions):   Fiscal Quarter Fiscal Six Months 2014 2013 2014 2013 Product line net sales Consumer batteries $ 211 $ 200 $ 476 $ 471 Hardware and home improvement products 267 257 545 290 Small appliances 153 155 370 375 Pet supplies 159 160 288 300 Home and garden control products 115 102 148 133 Electric personal care products 62 61 149 143 Electric shaving and grooming products 55 53 146 146 Total net sales to external customers $ 1,022 $ 988 $ 2,122 $ 1,858  Table of Contents  Global consumer battery sales increased $11 million, or 6%, during the Fiscal 2014 Quarter versus the Fiscal 2013 Quarter. Excluding negative foreign exchange impacts of $3 million, global consumer battery sales increased $14 million, or 7%. The strong growth in global consumer battery sales on a constant currency basis was driven by increased alkaline sales in North America, continued customer gains, regional expansion and promotions in Europe and successful new flashlight product launches throughout Latin America. Global consumer battery sales increased $5 million, or 1%, during the Fiscal 2014 Six Months compared to the Fiscal 2013 Six Months. Excluding the impact of negative foreign exchange of $1 million, global consumer battery sales increased $6 million. The constant currency increase in global consumer battery sales was attributable to the strong Fiscal 2014 Quarter sales discussed above, the non-recurrence of approximately $10 million of flashlight sales in North America related to storm activity in the first quarter of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013 ("Fiscal 2013").  Table of Contents  During the Fiscal 2014 Quarter, electric shaving and grooming product sales increased $2 million, or 3%, due to increases of $1 million in both European and Latin American sales driven by expansion into new channels. Electric shaving and grooming product sales were flat in the Fiscal 2014 Six Months compared to the Fiscal 2013 Six Months, as gains of $5 million and $1 million in European and Latin American sales attributable to the factors discussed above for the Fiscal 2014 Quarter, were offset by a $6 million decline in North American sales resulting from the non-recurrence of promotions from the first quarter of Fiscal 2013 and customer inventory management.  Segment Results. As discussed above, we manage our business in four reportable segments: (i) Global Batteries & Appliances; (ii) Global Pet Supplies;  Table of Contents  Below are reconciliations of GAAP Net income (loss), as adjusted, to Adjusted Earnings Before Interest and Taxes ("EBIT") and to Adjusted EBITDA for each segment and for Consolidated SB/RH for the Fiscal 2014 Quarter, the Fiscal 2014 Six Months, the Fiscal 2013 Quarter and the Fiscal 2013 Six Months:  May 07, 2014  (c) 1995-2014 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.
