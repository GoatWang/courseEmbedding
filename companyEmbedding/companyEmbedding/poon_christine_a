Christine Poon 




September 12, 2008


This morning, news came out that Christine Poon, Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors and Worldwide Chairman of the Pharmaceuticals Group, will retire on March 1, 2009.I've known Chris for many years. We often run into each other while commuting on the New Jersey Transit service from New Brunswick. On the train, we’ve talked about all manner of things -- from work, to the state of the media, to our families. So I when I heard the news, I wanted to learn more. Chris informed the BOD earlier this week about her plans, and, as is standard practice under SEC guidelines when there are changes to the senior leadership of a public company, a press release was issued today to announce this change. The release - as well as a letter to employees - talked of Chris’ accomplishments in shaping the company and explained that although succession plans for who will assume Chris’ responsibilities for the pharmaceuticals group have not yet been announced, they will be in a timely way. Chris shared her thoughts about her time at Johnson & Johnson and what she plans to do now in a note to employees. She said: Dear Friends at Johnson & Johnson,With Bill Weldon’s understanding and support, I wanted to communicate directly with you about my decision to retire from Johnson & Johnson effective March 1, 2009. Over the next six months, I will work closely with Bill, the Executive Committee and the pharmaceutical leadership team to successfully close 2008, complete plans for 2009 and provide assistance for an orderly transition.It has been my great good fortune to have worked at Johnson & Johnson during a period of fundamental change in the health care industry. Together with Bill and our management group, I have had the chance to be part of setting the stage for what will be one of the most exciting chapters in the Corporation’s long history. In pharmaceuticals, I believe our late-stage development pipeline is stronger than it has ever been; our recently-introduced products are already transforming medical practice to advance the care of patients with cancer, pain, schizophrenia and HIV; our early development pipeline is promising; and our pharmaceutical leadership team and depth of talent is best in the industry. All that has been accomplished is due to the dedicated efforts of people throughout our wonderful organization.Nevertheless, at this time in my life, I find myself drawn by the irresistible forces of family and, still, a deep desire to take on new challenges and find opportunities to advance society and health through my continuing involvement with science, technology, innovation and business. So I leave with mixed emotions, but with the satisfaction of knowing that, together, we have made a positive difference both in terms of lives saved and better patient outcomes, as well as having helped position Johnson & Johnson for many opportunities in the future.The field of human health and well-being is a significant calling for people who want to make a difference. The rewards of our profession are hard-earned, but generational in impact. I sincerely appreciate all of the support and encouragement I have received from so many of you through these years. I will always be grateful to have had the opportunity to have served with you and I wish you the very best for the future.Sincerely,Chris PoonBTW -- As a colleague - and occasional NJ Transit travel buddy - I wish Chris all the best in the years to come. I know you are around for the next few months, but I’ll miss catching up with you on the train!

About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions

About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.

Rate

End of layer.

 




APR layer

close  


Annual percentage rate (APR)
The annual cost of a loan to a borrower. Like an interest rate, the APR is expressed as a percentage of the loan amount. Unlike an interest rate, however, it includes other charges or fees to reflect the total cost of the loan. The Federal Truth in Lending Act requires that every consumer loan agreement disclose the APR. Since all lenders must follow the same rules to ensure the accuracy of the APR, borrowers can use the APR as a good basis for comparing certain costs of loans.
End of layer.

 




Points layer

close  


Discount points
Typically, it's an amount usually paid at closing to the lender in conjunction with a mortgage loan in order to lower or "buy down" the interest rate. One discount point equals one percentage point of the loan amount. For example, two points on a $100,000 mortgage would cost $2,000. Negative points reflect the amount that will be credited to you and reduce the amount of closing costs you will pay. Also called mortgage points or points.

Christine A. Poon Elected to Regeneron Board of Directors


TARRYTOWN, N.Y., Nov. 15, 2010 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: REGN) today announced that it has elected Christine A. Poon to fill a new seat on its expanded Board of Directors.  Ms. Poon currently serves as dean of Ohio State University's Fisher College of Business.  She was formerly Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of Johnson & Johnson and Worldwide Chairman of the Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceuticals Group.
"Chris brings an incredibly important commercial perspective and deep strategic and operational knowledge of the pharmaceutical industry to our Board," said P. Roy Vagelos, M.D., Chairman of Regeneron Board of Directors.  "With our pipeline of therapeutic candidates, including several in late-stage clinical trials, we are certain to benefit from Chris' significant experience within the pharmaceutical industry."
"Throughout my career I have enjoyed the thrill of translating basic research ideas into products and services that could make a real difference to global health and wellness," said Chris Poon.  "I am excited to be joining the Regeneron Board to help them achieve their mission of discovering, developing, and commercializing medicines for serious medical conditions."
"Now is an exciting time in Regeneron history as we await the results of several large Phase 3 programs," said Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D. "Chris' vision and leadership helped shape one of the pre-eminent pharmaceutical companies, Johnson & Johnson, and we look forward to her bringing her expertise to our Board."
Ms. Poon became dean of the Fisher College of Business in April 2009.  Prior to joining Ohio State, Ms. Poon had a distinguished career in the pharmaceutical industry.  In her 10 years at Johnson & Johnson, Ms. Poon's responsibilities included managing the pharmaceutical, consumer pharmaceutical, and nutritional businesses, in addition to overseeing the pharmaceutical research pipeline.  Prior to joining Johnson & Johnson, Ms. Poon spent 15 years at Bristol-Myers Squibb, where she held senior leadership positions including president of international medicines and president of medical devices. 
Ms. Poon also is on the Board of Directors of Prudential Financial, Inc. and the Supervisory Board of Royal Philips Electronics of Netherlands.  She was named Business Leader of the Future by CNBC/Wall Street Journal in 2005 and consistently has been listed among Forbes' 100 Most Powerful Women in Business.

Forward Looking Statement
This news release includes forward-looking statements about Regeneron and its products, development programs, finances, and business, all of which involve a number of risks and uncertainties.  These include, among others, risks and timing associated with preclinical and clinical development of Regeneron's drug candidates, determinations by regulatory and administrative governmental authorities which may delay or restrict Regeneron's ability to continue to develop or commercialize its product and drug candidates, competing drugs that are superior to Regeneron's product and drug candidates, uncertainty of market acceptance of Regeneron's product and drug candidates, unanticipated expenses, the availability and cost of capital, the costs of developing, producing, and selling products, the potential for any license or collaboration agreement, including Regeneron's agreements with 
Astellas, the sanofi-aventis Group and Bayer HealthCare, to be canceled or terminated without any product success, and risks associated with third party intellectual property.  A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron's filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2010.  Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, unless required by law.
