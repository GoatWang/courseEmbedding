What are analysts saying about Sage Therapeutics stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Sage Therapeutics stock: 
1. Needham & Company LLC analysts commented, "We hosted a call with expert Dr. Peter Kaplan to review the super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) space and expectations for Sage Therapeutics’ drug IV brexanolone, which is currently being evaluated in the ongoing pivotal Phase 3 STATUS trial (results expected 3Q17). Dr. Kaplan has been practicing at Johns Hopkins for 30 years and his academic experience has been mostly clinical in nature. He is currently based at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center and is consulted throughout the hospital for input regarding EEGs and for optimal management of status epilepticus. Below we highlight our key takeaways from the call." (6/13/2017)
2. BMO Capital Markets analysts commented, "We spoke with two leading psychiatrists who agreed that these data, while early, look great; they were particularly impressed with the magnitude of effect, early onset, strong remission rate, and overall safety for SAGE-217 in MDD. This profile is considered the 'holy grail' in treating depression. The physicians were also very optimistic regarding the prospects for SAGE-217 in a placebo-controlled trial for MDD given the large effect size in the open-label (one said 75-80% chance of success)' We are now including risk-adjusted sales for SAGE-217 in MDD of $25mn in 2021 ramping up to $325mn in 2027. We partially offset that with some increased expenses; the net result was that our EPS changed by $(0.51)-4.04 in 2017-27, and our target goes to $82 from $68." (2/22/2017)
3. Chardan Capital analysts commented, "Yesterday, Sage Therapeutics announced encouraging top-line phase II results from its open label clinical trial of orally-administered SAGE-217 for major depressive disorder (MDD). Our discussions yesterday with industry participants in the depression space suggested a decidedly positive view of the SAGE-217 data. We now note that the SAGE-217 result follows what to us, in our 12 July 2016 research, was "potentially clear, positive" phase II data for IV SAGE-547 in severe postpartum depression (PPD). Although our 20 July 2016 questions on SAGE-547 remain unanswered, we are reassured by the granting of Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for SAGE-547 by the FDA and PRIME Designation by EMA, which both likely independently considered the issues we raised. Our initial 24 May 2016 bearish view on Sage was based largely on our expectations of phase III data for SAGE-547 in super-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE), which were originally due to read out in 2H16. The timing of the data has since moved to 1H17, exposing any SAGE-547 SRSE bear thesis to the upside potential surrounding SAGE-217 in MDD, and more limited potential of SAGE-547 in PPD. Indeed, we now see upside risk elsewhere in Sage and thereby upgrade from Sell to Neutral, raising our PT from $18 to $60." (2/14/2017)
4. Cowen and Company analysts commented, "Today SAGE announced positive top-line results from its Ph2 OL trial of SAGE-217 in." (2/13/2017)
5. Canaccord Genuity analysts commented, "We are encouraged by NDRM’s progress on its multiple development programs and continue to view the company’s approach to treating Parkinson’s disease as potentially paradigm-shifting. NDRM recently had an end of Ph2 meeting with the FDA to discuss ND0612 and has been allowed to move forward with PK equivalency in the US as opposed to doing a Ph3 efficacy trial. Additionally, NDRM announced positive top-line data from a pilot PK trial of ND0701 last week." (12/6/2016)
