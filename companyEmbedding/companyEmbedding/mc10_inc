Scroll through some of the publications MC10 has been featured in.











It's the next level of sensing and accuracy," says Dr. Leslie Saxon, Executive Director of the USC Center for Body Computing. “We’re basically taking this new technology  and creating an unprecedented understanding and engagement for people around their health.





The heart-shaped patch is a wearable adhesive containing photosensitive dyes that change color when exposed to UV rays ... It was designed in partnership with MC10, a health tech firm based in Cambridge, Mass., that specializes in flexible electronics.





MC10 is dedicated to bringing stretchable electronics to market. The company worked with L’Oréal on My UV Patch and has developed another device, the BioStamp Research Connect, which measures body motion, muscle activity, and heart rate. MC10 began selling the BioStamp to researchers and companies earlier this year. “It’s essentially a body-worn computer,” says Roozbeh Ghaffari, MC10’s cofounder and chief technology officer.

OUR STORY
Our Mission
We are driven by a mission to improve human health through digital healthcare solutions.







 


















Our Company
In 2008, John Rogers – a founder and scientific visionary of MC10 – set out to redefine the boundaries between humans and electronics. The revolutionary stretchable electronics that he and his team developed serve today as the technological groundwork for MC10’s products – a new generation of research and medical solutions that empower all of us to better understand our health. With Rogers’ technological developments as our guidepost, MC10 now employs an extraordinary multi-disciplinary team united around a common goal of using technology to improve human health.







 


















Our Technology
MC10 uses cutting edge technology to create the most intelligent, flexible platform for biometric healthcare analytics. Our hardware and software systems are uniquely designed to minimize burden and maximize health insights.
Traditional electronic devices are rigid, bulky and fundamentally mismatched to the properties of the human body. MC10 products are thin and flexible, and built to stretch, bend and twist seamlessly with our bodies and the world around us.
MC10’s software platform consists of a complete end-to-end system with mobile interfaces, cloud storage and analytical tools. Lean, agile software development allows us to create robust systems to support the high volume of data gathered by the BioStamp® and WiSP™ platforms. Using the most powerful tools in big data analytics and machine learning, MC10’s software translates the body’s data into a language understandable to humans.
MC10’s technology empowers all of us to better understand our bodies and work towards improving human health.
 




















Collaborations














L’Oréal
MC10 has partnered with L’Oréal to create My UV Patch, the first-ever stretchable skin sensor designed to monitor UV exposure and help consumers educate themselves about UV-induced sun damage and protection. The stretchable, peel-and-stick wearable unites L’Oréal’s extensive scientific research and skin expertise with MC10’s strong technological capabilities in physiological sensing and pattern recognition algorithms to measure skin changes over time.









UCB
In 2014, MC10 and Belgium-based UCB initiated the development of a patient-focused disease management solution using MC10’s BioStamp® platform. The collaboration is focused on the integration of MC10’s novel, conformal sensing system with UCB’s pharmaceutical products to make a positive difference in the lives of people living with severe neurological disorders.









University of Rochester
MC10 has partnered with the University of Rochester to unite the company’s powerful technological capabilities in physiological sensing and pattern recognition algorithms with the university’s clinical expertise and commitment to big data analytics. Together, we are working to develop solutions for today’s most pressing healthcare challenges.

The BioStampMD™ system promises to revolutionize our ability to assess real-world health outcomes. The uniquely wearable sensors conform to the human body for maximum patient comfort. Using a combination of objective data collected from these novel sensors and patient-reported subjective data, the BioStampMD system offers a new way to quantify treatment efficacy. Payers, organizations, and providers can work with MC10 to build a rich data repository that will ultimately drive the right care for the right patient at the right cost.

Ultra-thin, Tattoo-like Wearables Enabled by New Technology 
      Partnership




MC10 and PCH team up to make next generation of wearables






April 12, 2016 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



LEXINGTON, Mass. & SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--MC10, Inc., the healthcare technology company specializing in 
      stretchable body-worn computing systems, and PCH, which designs custom 
      product solutions for startups and Fortune 500 companies, have entered 
      into an exclusive partnership to commercialize MC10’s Wearable 
      Interactive Stamp Platform (WiSP™). The partnership will allow brands to 
      develop a variety of consumer applications for the platform, which is a 
      skin-worn, ultra-thin, stretchable and disposable stamp.
    


      When paired with a smartphone, tablet, or near field communication (NFC) 
      reader, the WiSP platform enables a variety of consumer applications, 
      such as cashless payments, hotel room access, event registration, 
      interactive experiences at amusement parks, sporting and music events 
      and VIP experiences. The WiSP platform can also be used in clinical 
      environments to transmit important patient information and streamline 
      procedure flow.
    

      “We are excited to partner with PCH to expand the reach of MC10’s 
      body-worn electronics globally, within and beyond our core healthcare 
      market. PCH’s experience working with leading consumer brands, and their 
      ability to commercialize the technology, will accelerate development of 
      new applications within a variety of industries for skin-worn 
      wearables,” commented Scott Pomerantz, President and Chief Executive 
      Officer of MC10.
    

      PCH will work with third-party brands to customize the technology and 
      develop new consumer applications. The smart stamp was first 
      commercialized in conjunction with L’Oréal 
      as the world’s first stretchable electronic designed to measure 
      individual UV exposure. L’Oréal will retain exclusivity for applications 
      of this technology in the beauty domain.
    

      PCH Founder and CEO Liam Casey said, “Our partnership with MC10 opens 
      the door for other brands to develop consumer applications using this 
      unique wearable platform. The stamp is highly customizable allowing 
      brands to create personalized and engaging experiences that reinforce 
      customer loyalty.”
    

      The stamp leverages NFC technology to enable a variety of interactions 
      between brand and wearer. By combining cloud analytics with the WiSP 
      platform, brands can deepen their understanding of consumer behavior. To 
      maintain the security of the stored information, the breathable, 
      waterproof stamp is designed to tear and become unreadable upon removal.

Scroll through some of the publications MC10 has been featured in.











It's the next level of sensing and accuracy," says Dr. Leslie Saxon, Executive Director of the USC Center for Body Computing. “We’re basically taking this new technology  and creating an unprecedented understanding and engagement for people around their health.





The heart-shaped patch is a wearable adhesive containing photosensitive dyes that change color when exposed to UV rays ... It was designed in partnership with MC10, a health tech firm based in Cambridge, Mass., that specializes in flexible electronics.





MC10 is dedicated to bringing stretchable electronics to market. The company worked with L’Oréal on My UV Patch and has developed another device, the BioStamp Research Connect, which measures body motion, muscle activity, and heart rate. MC10 began selling the BioStamp to researchers and companies earlier this year. “It’s essentially a body-worn computer,” says Roozbeh Ghaffari, MC10’s cofounder and chief technology officer.
