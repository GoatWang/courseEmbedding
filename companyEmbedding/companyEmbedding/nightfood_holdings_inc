We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares of the common
stock offered by the selling stockholders.  We are registering 2,794,500 of our
25,108,560 currently outstanding shares for resale to provide the holders
thereof with freely tradable securities, but the registration of such shares
does not necessarily mean that any of such shares will be offered or sold by the
holders thereof.


The nutritional/snack food business is highly competitive and includes such
participants as large companies like Nabisco, Keebler, Kellogg’s and Quaker Oats
and specialized products as Cliff Bar and Luna Bar and many smaller companies.
Many of these competitors have well established names and products.  Management
is not aware of any competitor offering snack/nutrition bars that promote
restful sleep.  We will initially compete based upon the unique nature of our
product.  However, other companies, including those with greater name
recognition than us and greater resources may seek to introduce products that
directly compete with our products.  Management believes that if a competitor
sought to develop a competing product, it could do so.


Company Description
NightFood Holdings, Inc. is a Nevada corporation organized on October 16, 2013 
to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of NightFood, Inc., a 
New York corporation (the “Subsidiary”) from its sole shareholder, Sean Folkson.
All of our operations are conducted by the subsidiary.  We are


 in the business 
of developing a functional food line of snacks that are suitable for evening 
consumption and which may promote better sleep.  A large number of Americans 
snack in the evening or at night and management believes that our products are 
unique in the functional food industry and that there is a substantial market 
for our products.  We have developed a “cookies and cream” flavored 
snack/nutrition bar and have conducted limited production runs to test our 
product’s acceptance.  We have other potential evening appropriate snacks that 
may be developed in the next year.

Our offices are located at 85 Parkview Road, Elmsford, New York 10523 and our 
telephone number is (888) 888-6444. We maintain a web site at www.nightfood.com.

	NOTES
	TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	 









	1.






	Description
	of Business





	NightFood
	Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Nevada Corporation organized October 16, 2013 to acquire all of the issued
	and outstanding shares of NightFood, Inc., a New York Corporation from its sole shareholder, Sean Folkson. All of its operations
	are conducted by the subsidiary, NightFood, Inc. The Company’s business model is to manufacture and distribute snack
	products specifically formulated for nighttime snacking to help consumers satisfy nighttime cravings in a better, healthier,
	more sleep friendly way.







	 




	 




	 






	 




	 




	●




	The
	Company’s fiscal year end is June 30.






	 




	 




	 




	 






	 




	 




	●




	The
	Company currently maintains its corporate address in Tarrytown, New York.






	 









	2.






	Summary
	of Significant Accounting Policies





	●




	Management
	is responsible for the fair presentation of the Company’s financial statements, prepared in accordance with U.S. generally
	accepted accounting principles (GAAP).






	 




	 




	 




	 






	 





	Interim
	Financial Statements





	 





	These
	unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine (9) months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016,
	respectively, reflect all adjustments including normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are
	necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in
	accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.




	 




	These
	interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated
	financial statements and notes thereto for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2016, respectively, which are included in
	the Company’s June 30, 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
	on September 28, 2016. The Company assumes that the users of the interim financial information herein have read, or have
	access to, the audited consolidated financial statements for the preceding period, and that the adequacy of additional
	disclosure needed for a fair presentation may be determined in that context. The results of operations for the nine (9)
	months ended March 31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year ending June 30, 2017.







	 




	 




	 




	 






	 





	Use
	of Estimates





	●




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
	estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
	liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
	period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used in the determination of depreciation and amortization,
	the valuation for non-cash issuances of common stock, and the website, income taxes and contingencies, among others.






	 




	 




	 




	 






	 





	Cash
	and Cash



	Equivalents





	●




	The
	Company classifies as cash and cash equivalents amounts on deposit in the banks and cash temporarily in various instruments
	with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.






	 




	 




	 




	 






	 





	Fair
	Value of Financial Instruments





	●




	Statement
	of financial accounting standard FASB Topic 820, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, requires that the
	Company disclose estimated fair values of financial instruments. The carrying amounts reported in the statements of financial
	position for assets and liabilities qualifying as financial instruments are a reasonable estimate of fair value.

	Inventories





	●




	Inventories
	consisting of packaged food items and supplies are stated at the lower of cost (FIFO) or market, including provisions for
	spoilage commensurate with known or estimated exposures which are recorded as a charge to cost of sales during the period
	spoilage is incurred. The Company has no minimum purchase commitments with its vendors.






	 




	 




	 




	 






	 





	Advertising
	Costs





	●




	Advertising
	costs are expensed when incurred and are included in advertising and promotional expense in the accompanying statements of
	operations. Although not traditionally thought of by many as “advertising costs”, the Company includes expenses
	related to graphic design work, package design, website design, domain names, and product samples in the category of “advertising
	costs”. The Company incurred advertising costs of $8,002 and $84,238 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016,
	respectively.






	 




	 




	 




	 






	 





	Income
	Taxes





	●




	The
	Company has not generated any taxable income, and, therefore, no provision for income taxes has been provided.






	 




	 




	 




	 






	 




	 




	●




	Deferred
	income taxes are reported for timing differences between items of income or expense reported in the financial statements and
	those reported for income tax purposes in accordance with FASB Topic 740, "Accounting for Income Taxes", which requires
	the use of the asset/liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes and tax benefits are recognized
	for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
	and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for tax loss and credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
	are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences
	are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company provides for deferred taxes for the estimated future tax effects attributable
	to temporary differences and carry-forwards when realization is more likely than not.






	 




	 




	 




	 






	 




	 




	●




	A
	valuation allowance has been recorded to fully offset the deferred tax asset even though the Company believes it is more likely
	than not that the assets will be utilized.






	 




	 




	 




	 






	 




	 




	●




	The
	Company’s effective tax rate differs from the statutory rates associated with taxing jurisdictions because of permanent
	and temporary timing differences as well as a valuation allowance.






	 




	 




	 




	 






	 





	Revenue
	Recognition





	●




	The
	Company generates its revenue by selling its nighttime snack products wholesale and direct to consumer.






	 




	 




	 




	 






	 




	 




	●




	All
	sources of revenue is recorded pursuant to FASB Topic 605 Revenue Recognition, when persuasive evidence of arrangement exists,
	delivery of services has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.






	 




	 




	 




	 






	 




	 




	●




	The
	Company offers sales incentives through various programs, consisting primarily of advertising related credits. The Company
	records advertising related credits with customers as a reduction to revenue as no identifiable benefit is received in exchange
	for credits claimed by the customer.






	 




	 




	 




	 






	 





	Concentration
	of



	Credit Risk





	●




	Financial
	instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash deposits at
	financial institutions. At various times during the year, the Company may exceed the federally insured limits. To mitigate
	this risk, the Company places its cash deposits only with high credit quality institutions. Management believes the risk of
	loss is minimal. At March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2016, the Company did not have any uninsured cash deposits.

	Beneficial Conversion Feature






	●







	For conventional convertible
	debt where the rate of conversion is below market value, the Company records any “beneficial conversion feature” (“BCF”)
	intrinsic value as additional paid in capital and related debt discount.


	 


	When the Company records a BCF,
	the relative fair value of the BCF is recorded as a debt discount against the face amount of the respective debt instrument. The
	discount is amortized over the life of the debt. If a conversion of the underlying debt occurs, a proportionate share of the unamortized
	amounts is immediately expensed.





	 


	 


	 


	 




	 




	Debt Issue Costs





	●




	The
	Company may pay debt issue costs in connection with raising funds through the issuance of debt whether convertible or not or with
	other consideration. These costs are recorded as debt discounts and are amortized over the life of the debt to the statement of
	operations as amortization of debt discount.





	 


	 


	 


	 




	 




	Original Issue Discount





	●




	If
	debt is issued with an original issue discount, the original issue discount is recorded to debt discount, reducing the face amount
	of the note and is amortized over the life of the debt to the statement of operations as amortization of debt discount. If a conversion
	of the underlying debt occurs, a proportionate share of the unamortized amounts is immediately expensed.





	 


	 


	 


	 




	 




	Valuation of Derivative Instruments





	●




	ASC 815 “Derivatives and Hedging” requires that embedded derivative instruments be bifurcated and assessed, along with free-standing derivative instruments such as warrants, on their issuance date and measured at their fair value for accounting purposes. In determining the appropriate fair value, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing formula. Upon conversion of a note where the embedded conversion option has been bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative liability, the Company records the shares at fair value, relieves all related notes, derivatives and debt discounts and recognizes a net gain or loss on debt extinguishment.






	 






	 





	Customer
	Concentration





	●




	During
	the nine months ended March 31, 2017, the company had one customer which accounted for approximately 87% of revenues.






	 




	 




	 




	 






	 





	Receivables
	Concentration





	●




	As
	of March 31, 2017, the company had accounts receivable totaling $4,338, with approximately 91% of that from one customer.  That
	entire balance remains outstanding as of the time of this filing.






	 




	 




	 




	 






	 





	Income
	Per Share





	●




	Net
	income per share data for both the three and nine month periods ending March 31, 2017 and 2016 are based on net income available
	to common shareholders divided by the weighted average of the number of common shares outstanding. As of March 31, 2017, there
	are no outstanding common stock equivalents.






	 




	 




	 




	 






	 





	Impairment
	of



	Long-lived Assets





	●




	The
	Company accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of FASB Topic 360, Accounting for the Impairment
	of Long-Lived Assets. This statement requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for
	impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
	Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net
	cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized
	is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed
	of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Fair values are determined based on
	quoted market value, discounted cash flows or internal and external appraisals, as applicable.






	 




	 




	 




	 






	 





	Recent
	Accounting Pronouncements





	●




	All
	new accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective or adopted have been deemed not to be relevant to us, hence are
	not expected to have any impact once adopted.







	 







	3.






	Going
	Concern





	●




	The
	Company's financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate the realization
	of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. Because the business is new and has limited operating
	history and relatively few sales, no certainty of continuation can be stated.






	 






	 




	 




	●




	Management
	is taking steps to raise additional funds to address its operating and financial cash requirements to continue operations
	in the next twelve months. Management has devoted a significant amount of time in the raising of capital from additional debt
	and equity financing. However, the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon raising additional
	funds through debt and equity financing and generating revenue. There are no assurances the Company will receive the necessary
	funding or generate revenue necessary to fund operations.

	Accounts
	receivable





	●




	The
	Company’s accounts receivable arise primarily from the sale of the Company’s snack products. On a periodic basis,
	the Company evaluates each customer account and based on the days outstanding of the receivable, history of past write-offs,
	collections, and current credit conditions, writes off accounts it considers uncollectible. With most of our retail and distribution
	partners, invoices will typically be due in 30 or 45 days. The Company does not accrue interest on past due accounts and the
	Company does not require collateral. Accounts become past due on an account-by-account basis. Determination that an account
	is uncollectible is made after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted. The Company has also provided certain
	sales allowances of $0 and $22,681 as of March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2016, respectively.

	MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS





	 





	FORWARD
	LOOKING STATEMENT INFORMATION





	 




	Certain
	statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may
	cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements
	expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate
	strictly to historical or current facts, and use words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,”
	“expect,” “forecast,” “may,” “should,” “plan,” “project,”
	“will” and other words of similar meaning. The forward-looking statements included herein are based on current expectations
	that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Our plans and objectives are based, in part, on assumptions involving judgments
	with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions, technological developments related to
	business support services and outsourced business processes, and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible
	to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control.




	 




	Although
	we believe that our assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate
	and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q will
	prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein particularly
	in view of the current state of our operations, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a statement by us
	or any other person that our objectives and plans will be achieved. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
	from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the factors set forth under
	the headings “Business” and “Risk Factors” within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
	June 30, 2016, as well as the other information set forth herein.




	 





	OVERVIEW





	 




	We
	are a snack development, marketing and distribution company relying on our unique products, unique product positioning, and our
	marketing expertise to develop and market nutritional/snack foods that are appropriate for evening snacking. Our first product
	is the NightFood nutrition bar, currently available in two flavors (Cookies n’ Dreams, and Midnight Chocolate Crunch).




	 





	DEVELOPMENT
	PLANS





	 




	Longer-term,
	assuming that we have established sufficient traction with our initial product, the NightFood nutrition bar, the company intends
	to evaluate opportunities to introduce other nighttime specific snack products in the snack formats already popular with consumers
	such as cookies, chips, and ice cream.




	 




	We
	believe the nutritional profile of any popular snack food can be evaluated and formulated for what we call “sleep-friendliness”,
	and therefore optimized as a better nighttime snack option.




	 




	The
	Company is also evaluating opportunities to acquire other companies in related spaces. In November 2016, the Company executed
	and delivered a Plan of Reorganization Including Option to Acquire (the “Plan”) by and among the Company, Hook Group,
	LLC (“Hook”) and Suffield Foods. LLC (“Suffield”). The Plan contemplates the Registrant acquiring an equity
	interest in and potentially merging Hook and its subsidiary Suffield with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 
	This transaction has not closed as of the date of this filing.




	 





	INFLATION





	 




	Inflation
	can be expected to have an impact on our operating costs. A prolonged period of inflation could cause a general economic downturn
	and negatively impact our results. However, the effect of inflation has been minimal over the past three years.




	 





	SEASONALITY





	 




	We
	do not believe that our business will be seasonal to any material degree

	.

	RESULTS
	OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2017 AND MARCH 31, 2016.





	 





	For the three months ended March
	31, 2017 and March 31, 2016 we had revenues of $13,098 and ($1,781) respectively and incurred a net loss of $263,795 and $241,127
	respectively. These losses were largely attributable to consulting fees and expenses related to being a public company.


	 


	For the nine months ended March
	31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, we had revenues of $23,605 and $19,374 respectively and incurred a net loss of $422,334 and $526,318
	respectively. These losses were largely attributable to consulting fees and expenses related to being a public company.



	 





	Inventory






	 





	As
	of March 31, 2017, we had approximately $103,561 worth of product and packaging in inventory, compared to $121,706 worth of product
	in inventory as of June 30, 2016.




	 





	Operating
	Expenses






	 








	Operating expenses increased by
	$39,246 for the nine month period ended March 31, 2017, from $232,035 for the three month period ended March 31, 2016. The increase
	was primarily due to the increase in expenses related to investor relations and other expenses of being a public company.


	 


	Operating expenses decreased by
	$102,775 for the nine month period ended March 31, 2017, from $537,764 for the three month period ended March 31, 2016. The decrease
	was primarily due to the decrease in advertising expenses related to packaging design and production, as well as decreased broker
	and consulting fees, and a decrease in other operating expenses related to direct to consumer sales of our product.



	 





	Customers





	 




	For
	the three and nine month periods ending March 31, 2017, the majority of revenues resulted from wholesale sales of NightFood to
	distributors and retailers, as well as direct to consumer sales.




	 





	LIQUIDITY
	AND CAPITAL RESOURCES






	 





	As
	of March 31, 2017, we had cash on hand of $72,536, and inventory value of $103,561.



	 








	 



	3



	 







	 





	 




	The
	Company has limited available cash resources and we do not believe our cash on hand will be adequate to satisfy our ongoing working
	capital needs. The Company is continuing to raise capital through private placement of our common stock to finance the Company’s
	operations, of which it can give no assurance of success. However, we believe that our current capitalization structure, combined
	with the continued expansion in distribution, will enable us to achieve successful financings to continue our growth. Because
	the business is new and has limited operating history and relatively few sales, no certainty of continuation can be stated. Management
	is taking steps to raise additional funds to address its operating and financial cash requirements to continue operations in the
	next twelve months. Management has devoted a significant amount of time in the raising of capital from additional debt and equity
	financing. However, the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon raising additional funds through
	debt and equity financing and generating revenue. There are no assurances the Company will receive the necessary funding or generate
	revenue necessary to fund operations.




	 




	Even
	if the Company is successful in raising additional funds, the Company cannot give any assurance that it will, in the future, be
	able to achieve a level of profitability from the sale of its products to sustain its operations. These conditions raise substantial
	doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any
	adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on recoverability and reclassification of assets or the amounts and classification
	of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.




	 



	Since our inception, we have sustained
	operating losses. During the nine months ended March 31, 2017, we incurred a net loss of $422,334 compared to $526,318 for the
	nine months ended March 31, 2016.


	 


	During the nine months ended March
	31, 2017, net cash used in operating activities was $180,602 compared to $315,788 for the nine months ended March 31, 2016.


	 


	During the nine months ended March
	31, 2017, net cash aggregating $247,656 was provided by financing activities.


	 


	From our inception in January 2010
	through March 31, 2017, we have generated an accumulated deficit of approximately $2,888,138, compared to $2,465,804 from inception
	through June 30, 2016. Assuming we raise additional funds and continue operations, we expect to incur additional operating losses
	during the remainder of calendar 2017 and possibly thereafter. We plan to continue to pay or satisfy existing obligation and commitments
	and finance our operations, as we have in the past, primarily through the sale of our securities and other forms of external financing
	until such time that we are able to generate sufficient funds from the sale of our products to finance our operations, of which
	we can give no assurance.



	 




	On
	November 25, 2016, the company entered into a material definitive agreement. On that date, the company executed and delivered
	a Plan of Reorganization Including Option to Acquire (the “Plan”) by and among the Registrant, Hook Group, LLC (“Hook”)
	and Suffield Foods. LLC (“Suffield”). The Plan contemplates the Registrant acquiring an equity interest in and potentially
	merging Hook and its subsidiary Suffield with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Registrant. As of the date of this filing,
	the agreement remains in effect.




	 





	Critical
	Accounting Policies and Estimates






	 





	Our
	discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated
	financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation
	of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
	amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis,
	we evaluate past judgments and our estimates, including those related to allowance for doubtful, allowance for inventory write-downs
	and write offs, deferred income taxes, provision for contractual obligations and our ability to continue as a going concern. We
	base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances,
	the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not apparent
	from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.




	 





	Note 2 to the consolidated financial
	statements, presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, describe the significant accounting
	estimates and policies used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. There were no significant changes in our
	critical accounting estimates during the nine months ended March 31, 2017.

	ITEM
	4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES





	 





	Evaluation
	of Disclosure Controls and Procedures






	 





	Disclosure
	controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information
	required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
	within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Disclosure and control procedures are also designed to ensure that such
	information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer,
	to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.




	 




	We
	carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer
	and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as
	of March 31, 2017. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that there are inherent
	limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error
	and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures
	can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their desired control objectives. Additionally, in evaluating and implementing
	possible controls and procedures, management is required to apply its reasonable judgment. Based on the evaluation described above,
	our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not
	effective as of the end of the period covered by this report because we did not document our Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404 internal
	controls and procedures.




	 




	As
	funds become available to us, we expect to implement additional measures to improve disclosure controls and procedures such as
	implementing and documenting our internal controls procedures.




	 





	Changes
	in internal controls over financial reporting






	 





	There
	was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report, which
	has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.




	 





	Limitations
	on the Effectiveness of Controls






	 





	A
	control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control
	system’s objectives will be met. The Company’s management, including its Principal Executive Officer and its Principal
	Financial Officer, do not expect that the Company’s disclosure controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud.
	Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls
	must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
	can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur
	because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of
	two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain
	assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its
	stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
	or deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a
	cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

	NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
	STATEMENTS



	 








	1.






	Description of Business





	NightFood Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Nevada Corporation organized October 16, 2013 to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of NightFood, Inc., a New York Corporation from its sole shareholder, Sean Folkson. All of its operations are conducted by the subsidiary, NightFood, Inc. The Company’s business model is to manufacture and distribute snack products specifically formulated for nighttime snacking to help consumers satisfy nighttime cravings in a better, healthier, more sleep friendly way.






	 


	 


	 




	 


	 



	●




	The Company’s fiscal year end is June 30.





	 


	 


	 


	 




	 


	 



	●




	The Company currently maintains its corporate address in Tarrytown, New York.





	 










	2.







	Summary
	of Significant Accounting Policies






	●




	Management
	is responsible for the fair presentation of the Company’s financial statements, prepared in accordance with U.S. generally
	accepted accounting principles (GAAP).





	 


	 


	 


	 





	 





	Interim
	Financial Statements





	 





	These
	unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the six (6) months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015,
	respectively, reflect all adjustments including normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are
	necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in
	accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.




	 




	These
	interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated
	financial statements and notes thereto for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which are included in
	the Company’s June 30, 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
	on September 28, 2016. The Company assumes that the users of the interim financial information herein have read, or have
	access to, the audited consolidated financial statements for the preceding period, and that the adequacy of additional
	disclosure needed for a fair presentation may be determined in that context. The results of operations for the six (6)
	months ended December 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year ending June 30, 2017.







	 




	 




	 




	 






	 





	Use
	of Estimates





	●




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
	estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
	liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
	period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used in the determination of depreciation and amortization,
	the valuation for non-cash issuances of common stock, and the website, income taxes and contingencies, among others.






	 




	 




	 




	 






	 





	Cash
	and Cash



	Equivalents





	●




	The
	Company classifies as cash and cash equivalents amounts on deposit in the banks and cash temporarily in various instruments
	with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.






	 




	 




	 




	 






	 





	Fair
	Value of Financial Instruments





	●




	Statement
	of financial accounting standard FASB Topic 820, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, requires that the
	Company disclose estimated fair values of financial instruments. The carrying amounts reported in the statements of financial
	position for assets and liabilities qualifying as financial instruments are a reasonable estimate of fair value.






	 








	 


	F-

	4



	 







	 






	 






	 




	Inventories





	●




	Inventories consisting of packaged food items and supplies are stated at the lower of cost (FIFO) or market, including provisions for spoilage commensurate with known or estimated exposures which are recorded as a charge to cost of sales during the period spoilage is incurred. The Company has no minimum purchase commitments with its vendors.





	 


	 


	 


	 




	 




	Advertising Costs





	●




	Advertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in advertising and promotional expense in the accompanying statements of operations. Although not traditionally thought of by many as “advertising costs”, the Company includes expenses related to graphic design work, package design, website design, domain names, and product samples in the category of “advertising costs”. The Company incurred advertising costs of $1,058 and $77,279 for the six months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.





	 


	 


	 


	 




	 




	Income Taxes





	●




	The Company has not generated any taxable income, and, therefore, no provision for income taxes has been provided.





	 


	 


	 


	 




	 


	 



	●




	Deferred income taxes are reported for timing differences between items of income or expense reported in the financial statements and those reported for income tax purposes in accordance with FASB Topic 740, "Accounting for Income Taxes", which requires the use of the asset/liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes and tax benefits are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for tax loss and credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company provides for deferred taxes for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry-forwards when realization is more likely than not.





	 


	 


	 


	 




	 


	 



	●




	A valuation allowance has been recorded to fully offset the deferred tax asset even though the Company believes it is more likely than not that the assets will be utilized.





	 


	 


	 


	 




	 


	 



	●




	The Company’s effective tax rate differs from the statutory rates associated with taxing jurisdictions because of permanent and temporary timing differences as well as a valuation allowance.





	 


	 


	 


	 




	 




	Revenue Recognition





	●




	The Company generates its revenue by selling its nighttime snack products wholesale and direct to consumer.





	 


	 


	 


	 




	 


	 



	●




	All sources of revenue is recorded pursuant to FASB Topic 605 Revenue Recognition, when persuasive evidence of arrangement exists, delivery of services has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.





	 


	 


	 


	 




	 


	 



	●




	The Company offers sales incentives through various programs, consisting primarily of advertising related credits. The Company records advertising related credits with customers as a reduction to revenue as no identifiable benefit is received in exchange for credits claimed by the customer.





	 


	 


	 


	 




	 




	Concentration of





	Credit Risk





	●




	Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash deposits at financial institutions. At various times during the year, the Company may exceed the federally insured limits. To mitigate this risk, the Company places its cash deposits only with high credit quality institutions. Management believes the risk of loss is minimal. At December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016 the Company did not have any uninsured cash deposits.






	 








	 


	F-

	5



	 







	 




	 






	 




	Customer Concentration





	●




	During the six months ended December 31, 2016, two customers, accounted for approximately 90% of revenues.





	 


	 


	 


	 




	 




	Receivables Concentration





	●




	As of December 31, 2016, the company had accounts receivable totaling $11,035, with approximately 90% of that from two customers.  Approximately 80% of that has been collected as of the time of this filing.





	 


	 


	 


	 




	 




	Income Per Share





	●




	Net
	income per share data for both the three and six month periods ending December 31, 2016 and 2015 are based on net income
	available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average of the number of common shares outstanding. As of December
	31, 2016, there are no outstanding common stock equivalents.





	 


	 


	 


	 




	 




	Impairment of





	Long-lived Assets





	●




	The Company accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of FASB Topic 360, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. This statement requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Fair values are determined based on quoted market value, discounted cash flows or internal and external appraisals, as applicable.





	 


	 


	 


	 




	 




	Recent Accounting Pronouncements





	●




	All new accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective or adopted have been deemed not to be relevant to us, hence are not expected to have any impact once adopted.








	 






	3.






	Going Concern





	●




	The Company's financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. Because the business is new and has limited operating history and relatively few sales, no certainty of continuation can be stated.





	 




	 


	 



	●




	Management is taking steps to raise additional funds to address its operating and financial cash requirements to continue operations in the next twelve months. Management has devoted a significant amount of time in the raising of capital from additional debt and equity financing. However, the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon raising additional funds through debt and equity financing and generating revenue. There are no assurances the Company will receive the necessary funding or generate revenue necessary to fund operations.





	 






	4.






	Accounts receivable





	●




	The Company’s accounts receivable arise primarily from the sale of the Company’s snack products. On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates each customer account and based on the days outstanding of the receivable, history of past write-offs, collections, and current credit conditions, writes off accounts it considers uncollectible. With most of our retail and distribution partners, invoices will typically be due in 30 or 45 days. The Company does not accrue interest on past due accounts and the Company does not require collateral. Accounts become past due on an account-by-account basis. Determination that an account is uncollectible is made after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted. The Company has also provided certain sales allowances of $0 and $22,363 as of December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively.

	Although
	we believe that our assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate
	and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q will

	OVERVIEW





	 




	We
	are a snack development, marketing and distribution company relying on our unique products, unique product positioning, and our
	marketing expertise to develop and market nutritional/snack foods that are appropriate for evening snacking. Our first product
	is the NightFood nutrition bar, currently available in two flavors (Cookies n’ Dreams, and Midnight Chocolate Crunch).




	 





	DEVELOPMENT
	PLANS





	 





	Longer-term, assuming that we have established
	sufficient traction with our initial product, the NightFood nutrition bar, the company intends to evaluate opportunities to introduce
	other nighttime specific snack products in the snack formats already popular with consumers such as cookies, chips, and ice cream.


	 


	We believe the nutritional profile of
	any popular snack food can be evaluated and formulated for what we call “sleep-friendliness”, and therefore optimized
	as a better nighttime snack option.


	 



	The Company
	is also evaluating opportunities to acquire other companies in related spaces. In November 2016, the Company executed and delivered
	a Plan of Reorganization Including Option to Acquire (the “Plan”) by and among the Company, Hook Group, LLC (“Hook”)
	and Suffield Foods. LLC (“Suffield”). The Plan contemplates the Registrant acquiring an equity interest in and potentially
	merging Hook and its subsidiary Suffield with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

	 

	This
	transaction has not closed as of the date of this filing.






	 





	INFLATION





	 




	Inflation
	can be expected to have an impact on our operating costs. A prolonged period of inflation could cause a general economic downturn
	and negatively impact our results. However, the effect of inflation has been minimal over the past three years.




	 





	SEASONALITY





	 




	We
	do not believe that our business will be seasonal to any material degree

	.

	RESULTS
	OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND DECEMBER 31, 2015.





	 




	For
	the three months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 we had revenues of $8,043 and ($338) respectively and incurred
	a net loss of $84,372 and $148,747 respectively. These losses were largely attributable to consulting fees and expenses related
	to being a public company.




	 




	For
	the six months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had revenues of $10,507 and $21,155 respectively and incurred
	a net loss of $158,538 and $285,193 respectively. These losses were largely attributable to consulting fees and expenses related
	to being a public company.




	 





	Revenue






	 





	Our
	net revenues for the three month period ended December 31, 2016 were $8,043 net of sales allowances and sales discounts compared
	to ($338) for the three month period ended December 31, 2015.




	 




	Our
	net revenues for the six month period ended December 31, 2016 were $10,507 net of sales allowances and sales discounts compared
	to $21,155 for the six month period ended December 31, 2015.




	 





	Inventory






	 





	As
	of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $110,095 worth of product and packaging in inventory, compared to $121,706 worth of
	product in inventory as of June 30, 2016.




	 





	Operating
	Expenses






	 





	Operating
	expenses decreased by $55,727 for the three month period ended December 31, 2016, from $148,105 for the three month period ended
	December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in paid advertising and other operating expenses related to
	direct to consumer sales of our product.




	 




	Operating
	expenses decreased by $142,024 for the six month period ended December 31, 2016, from $305,731 for the six month period
	ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in paid advertising and other operating expenses
	related to direct to consumer sales of our product.




	 





	Customers





	 




	For
	the three and six month period ending December 31, 2016, the majority of revenues resulted from wholesale sales of NightFood to
	distributors and retailers, as well as direct to consumer sales.




	 





	LIQUIDITY
	AND CAPITAL RESOURCES






	 





	As
	of December 31, 2016, we had cash on hand of $5,396, and inventory value of $110,095.




	 







	 



	4



	 







	 





	 




	The
	Company has limited available cash resources and we do not believe our cash on hand will be adequate to satisfy our ongoing working
	capital needs. The Company is continuing to raise capital through private placement of our common stock to finance the Company’s
	operations, of which it can give no assurance of success. However, we believe that our current capitalization structure, combined
	with the continued expansion in distribution, will enable us to achieve successful financings to continue our growth. Because
	the business is new and has limited operating history and relatively few sales, no certainty of continuation can be stated. Management
	is taking steps to raise additional funds to address its operating and financial cash requirements to continue operations in the
	next twelve months. Management has devoted a significant amount of time in the raising of capital from additional debt and equity
	financing. However, the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon raising additional funds through
	debt and equity financing and generating revenue. There are no assurances the Company will receive the necessary funding or generate
	revenue necessary to fund operations.




	 




	Even
	if the Company is successful in raising additional funds, the Company cannot give any assurance that it will, in the future, be
	able to achieve a level of profitability from the sale of its products to sustain its operations. These conditions raise substantial
	doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any
	adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on recoverability and reclassification of assets or the amounts and classification
	of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.




	 




	Since
	our inception, we have sustained operating losses. During the six months ended December 31, 2016, we incurred a net loss of $158,538
	compared to $285,193 for the six months ended December 31, 2015.




	 




	During
	the six months ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in operating activities was $29,633 compared to $220,684 for the six months
	ended December 31, 2015.




	 




	During
	the six months ended December 31, 2016, net cash aggregating $29,548 was provided by financing activities.




	 




	From
	our inception in January 2010 through December 31, 2016, we have generated an accumulated deficit of approximately $2,624,342.
	Assuming we raise additional funds and continue operations, we expect to incur additional operating losses during the remainder
	of fiscal 2017 and possibly thereafter. We plan to continue to pay or satisfy existing obligation and commitments and finance
	our operations, as we have in the past, primarily through the sale of our securities and other forms of external financing until
	such time that we are able to generate sufficient funds from the sale of our products to finance our operations, of which we can
	give no assurance.




	 




	On
	November 25, 2016, the company entered into a material definitive agreement. On that date, the company executed and delivered
	a Plan of Reorganization Including Option to Acquire (the “Plan”) by and among the Registrant, Hook Group, LLC (“Hook”)
	and Suffield Foods. LLC (“Suffield”). The Plan contemplates the Registrant acquiring an equity interest in and potentially
	merging Hook and its subsidiary Suffield with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Registrant. As of the date of this filing,
	the agreement remains in effect, and the parties continue to work towards a closing.




	 





	Critical
	Accounting Policies and Estimates






	 





	Our
	discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated
	financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation
	of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
	amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis,
	we evaluate past judgments and our estimates, including those related to allowance for doubtful, allowance for inventory write-downs
	and write offs, deferred income taxes, provision for contractual obligations and our ability to continue as a going concern. We
	base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances,
	the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not apparent
	from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.




	 




	Note
	2 to the consolidated financial statements, presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016,
	describe the significant accounting estimates and policies used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. There
	were no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates during the three months ended December 31, 2016.

	Evaluation
	of Disclosure Controls and Procedures






	 





	Disclosure
	controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information
	required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
	within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Disclosure and control procedures are also designed to ensure that such
	information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer,
	to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.




	 




	We
	carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer
	and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as
	of December 31, 2016. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that there are
	inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human
	error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and
	procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their desired control objectives. Additionally, in evaluating and
	implementing possible controls and procedures, management is required to apply its reasonable judgment. Based on the evaluation
	described above, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
	were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report because we did not document our Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section
	404 internal controls and procedures.




	 




	As
	funds become available to us, we expect to implement additional measures to improve disclosure controls and procedures such as
	implementing and documenting our internal controls procedures.




	 





	Changes
	in internal controls over financial reporting






	 





	There
	was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report, which
	has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.




	 





	Limitations
	on the Effectiveness of Controls






	 





	A
	control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control
	system’s objectives will be met. The Company’s management, including its Principal Executive Officer and its Principal
	Financial Officer, do not expect that the Company’s disclosure controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud.
	Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls
	must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
	can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur
	because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of
	two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain
	assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its
	stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
	or deterioration in the degree of compliance with associated policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a
	cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

	CERTIFICATION OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER



	AS ADOPTED PURSUANT TO SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002



	 


	I, Sean Folkson, certify that:


	 


	1.       I
	have reviewed this Form 10-Q of NightFood Holdings, Inc.;


	 


	2.       Based
	on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
	to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to
	the period covered by this report;


	 


	3.       Based
	on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material
	respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods present in
	this report;


	 


	4.       The
	registrant’s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures
	(as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange
	Act Rules 13-a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:


	 


	(a)       Designed
	such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,
	to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by
	others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;


	 


	(b)       Designed
	such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our
	supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
	statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals;


	 


	(c)       Evaluated
	the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about
	the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation;
	and


	 


	(d)       Disclosed
	in this report any change in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant’s
	most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant’s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected,
	or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting; and


	 


	5.       The
	registrant’s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over
	financial reporting, to the registrant’s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant’s board of directors (or
	persons performing the equivalent functions):


	 


	(a)       All
	significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
	are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information;
	and


	 


	(b)       Any
	fraud, whether or not material, that involved management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant’s
	internal control over financial reporting.
