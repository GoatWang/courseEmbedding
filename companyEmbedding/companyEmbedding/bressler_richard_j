Richard J Bressler's Experience
Title: 
               Company: Cpysc Kickers
Job Details
               CPYSC is a non-profit, member-run organization promoting soccer in the Campbelltown and Palmyra region of Central Pennsylvania. The mission of CPYSC is to promote athletic excellence, good sportsmanship, fair play, individual effort and teamwork among the children of Campbelltown, Palmyra, and the surrounding areas. The club attempts to promote these values utilizing both recreational and competitive soccer programs. CPYSC is a recognized member of the Eastern Pennsylvania Youth Soccer Association (EPYSA). Through its affiliation with EPYSA, CPYSC is governed by the United States Youth Soccer Association (USYSA) and the Federal International Football Association (FIFA). CPYSC was establised in the 1980â€™s and has grown to a club that serves over 400 young soccer players from the surrounding community. We offer soccer programs to children of all abilities between the ages of 3-18. Our Kickers program is geared toward introducing children between the ages of 3-7 to the great game of soccer. Kickers emphasizes basic soccer skills, fundamentals, and sportsmanship in a fun, non-competitive, and educational atmosphere. Our travel program is focused on the young athlete between the ages of 7-18 who wants to participate in a more serious and intense soccer program. CPYSC offers both fall and spring seasons for both the Kickers and Travel programs. CPYSC strives to keep registration fees low for all of its participant families. The club holds a travel soccer tournament each year called the CPYSC Soccer Blast to subsidize a considerable portion of the costs necessary to sustain club activities and league participation. CPYSC is a volunteer based organization that relies on the involvement of parents in order to succeed. Prior soccer knowledge is not a requirement to participate as a parent volunteer. We have many parents involved with the club that have had their soccer knowledge grow right along with their children. There are also many positions available off the field that need volunteers in order for the club to continue to grow and be successful! To help all you need to do is indicate your interest while registering your child online.
