We are offering 15,000,000 units at an offering price of $10.00 per unit. We
estimate that the net proceeds of this offering together with the funds we will
receive from the sale of the private placement units will be used as set forth
in the following table.

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their 
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business 
    combination.                                                                

(2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the     
    proceeds of a loan from M III LLC of up to $250,000 that we may draw down as
    described in this prospectus. This loan will be repaid upon completion of   
    this offering out of the $600,000 of offering proceeds that has been        
    allocated for the payment of offering expenses other than underwriting      
    commissions. In the event that offering expenses are less than set forth in 
    this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital  
    expenses.                                                                   

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 4.0%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. If the underwriters’ over-allotment 
    option is exercised, 6.0% of the gross proceeds from the over-allotment will
    be deposited in the trust account as deferred underwriting commissions. Upon
    completion of our initial business combination, up to $6,000,000, which     
    constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions (or up to $7,350,000 if  
    the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid  
    to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account, and the       
    remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a      
    portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our  
    initial business combination occurs or for general corporate purposes,      
    including payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in      
    connection with our initial business combination, to fund the purchases of
    other companies or for working capital. The underwriters will not be 
    entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and
    commissions.              

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business         
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry       
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In    
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a      
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We  
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than    
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which      
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific  
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust    
    account to pay our taxes. Based on the current interest rate environment, we
    would expect approximately $30,000 per year to be available to us from      
    interest earned on the funds held in the trust account over 24 months       
    following the closing of this offering; however, we can provide no          
    assurances regarding this amount. This estimate assumes an interest rate of 
    0.02% per annum based upon current yields of securities in which the trust  
    account may be invested.                                                    

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our     
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for  
    financing.                                                                  

The rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market provide that at least 90% of the gross
proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement units, $150,000,000 (or $172,500,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full), including up to $6,000,000 (or up
to $7,350,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full)
of deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a trust account with
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and will be
invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or
less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under
the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be
approximately $30,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.02% per year. We
will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the
trust account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes or working
capital expenses, until the earlier of (i) the completion of our initial
business combination or (ii) the redemption of 100% of our public shares if we
are unable to complete a business combination within 24 months from the closing
of this offering (subject to the requirements of law). Based on current interest
rates, we do not expect that interest earned on the trust account will be
sufficient to pay taxes or a substantial portion of working capital expenses.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt
securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for
payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination, we may
apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the
post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

M III LLC has loaned or agreed to loan us up to $250,000 to be used for a
portion of the expenses of this offering. This loan is non-interest bearing,
unsecured and is due at the earlier of July 31, 2016 or the closing of this
offering. This loan will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the
$600,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of offering
expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,000,000 of
such loans will be convertible into warrants of the post-business combination
entity at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants. No written agreements
exist with respect to such loans.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either
prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.
However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets upon consummation of our initial business combination to be less
than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules)
and the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing
condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too
many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot
satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock
that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described herein or (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our business combination within 24 months following the closing of this
offering, subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any
limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the
terms of the proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a
public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account.

Our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us (and
Cantor Fitzgerald has agreed as part of its unit purchase agreement), pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares, private placement shares and (except for Cantor Fitzgerald)
public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business
combination. In addition, our initial stockholders and Cantor Fitzgerald have
agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account
with respect to their founder shares and private placement shares if we fail to
complete our business combination within the prescribed time frame. However, if
our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquire public
shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we
fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time
frame.


In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business
combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a
business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies,
private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses
seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and
have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations
directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess
greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to
acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial
resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the
acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in
connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may
reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and
our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent,
may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these 
factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating
an initial business combination.


Company Description
We are a Delaware blank check corporation formed for the purpose of effecting a
merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase,
reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses,
which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial


 business
combination. We have not identified any business combination target and we have
not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions,
directly or indirectly, with any business combination target.

We intend to focus our efforts on seeking and consummating an initial business
combination with a company that has an enterprise value of between $350 million
and $750 million, although a target entity with a smaller or larger enterprise
value may be considered. While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any
business industry or sector and in any geographic region, we expect to focus on
businesses based in North America that engage primarily in the financial
services, healthcare services and industrials sectors because we believe that
this best combines the expertise and experience of our combined team with
sectors that offer attractive investment opportunities.

It is our philosophy that capital has become increasingly commoditized and that
successful investment results will come not from having capital alone, but
rather from having the ability to accurately assess businesses with complex
strategic, management and operational issues and the added expertise to deal
with these issues in increasingly competitive and changing environments. We
believe this to be particularly true during times of economic uncertainty,
dislocations in capital markets and other conditions that create a challenge for
businesses, and opportunities for investors with the right management team. In
recognition of this, we have assembled a team of executives, directors and other
advisors who blend traditional investment and acquisition expertise, management
and operational expertise, and deep experience in financial, strategic and
operational restructurings. We are confident that this team is capable of
creating value in businesses that we acquire.

We believe that the broad experience and expertise of our combined team will
enable us to explore a wide range of potential acquisition targets. We intend to
target companies with strong business fundamentals and those which are in need
of operational improvement and can thereby benefit from our human and financial
capital. The members of our combined team have proven experience and track
records in identifying, acquiring and improving businesses that have strong
underlying fundamentals, but are undervalued due to company-specific issues,
industry dislocation, limited access to capital, or other exogenous factors that
are fundamentally temporary in nature. Our combined team has played meaningful
roles in contrarian investment situations with businesses requiring significant
changes in strategy, enhancement of management or operational improvement, using
our expertise in those areas to improve the businesses and drive ongoing growth.

We believe that the experience, capabilities and track record of our combined
team will make us an attractive partner for potential target businesses, enhance
our ability to complete a successful business combination and, thereafter,
improve the performance of the business in order to create value for investors.
