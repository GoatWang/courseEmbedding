	The information contained
	in this prospectus is not complete and may be changed. A registration statement relating to these securities has been filed with

	PROSPECTUS




	Subject to Completion, Dated ________






	Â 




	A La Carte Charts Corporation




	780,000 shares of Common Stock
	offered by selling shareholders at $2.50 per share





	Â 


	This prospectus relates to the
	offer and sale of 780,000 shares of common stock (the âSharesâ) of A La Carte Charts Corporation (âALCCâ
	or the âCompanyâ), $0.0001 par value per share, offered by the holders thereof (the âSelling Shareholder Sharesâ),
	who are deemed to be statutory underwriters.


	Â 


	The selling shareholders will
	offer their shares at a fixed price of $2.50 per share for the duration of the offering.


	Â 


	The maximum number of Shares that
	can be sold pursuant to the terms of this offering by the selling shareholders is (in aggregate) 780,000 Shares. Funds received
	by the selling shareholders will be immediately available to such selling shareholders for use by them. The Company will not receive
	any proceeds from the sale of the Selling Shareholder Shares.


	Â 


	The offering will terminate twenty-four
	(24) months from the date that the registration statement relating to the Shares is declared effective, unless earlier fully subscribed
	or terminated by the Company. The Company intends to maintain the current status and accuracy of this prospectus and to allow selling
	shareholders to offer and sell the Shares for a period of up to two (2) years, unless earlier completely sold, pursuant to Rule
	415 of the General Rules and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. All costs incurred in the registration of the
	Shares are being borne by the Company.


	Â 


	Prior to this offering, there has
	been no public market for the Companyâs common stock. No assurances can be given that a public market will develop following
	completion of this offering or that, if a market does develop, it will be sustained. The offering price for the Shares has been
	arbitrarily determined by the Company and does not necessarily bear any direct relationship to the assets, operations, book or
	other established criteria of value of the Company. The Shares will become tradable on the effective date of the registration statement
	of which this prospectus is a part.


	Â 


	Neither the Company nor any selling
	shareholders has any current arrangements nor entered into any agreements with any underwriters, broker-dealers or selling agents
	for the sale of the Shares. If the Company or selling shareholders can locate and enter into any such arrangement(s), the Shares
	will be sold through such licensed underwriter(s), broker-dealer(s) and/or selling agent(s).


	Â 



	NEITHER THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
	COMMISSION NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED OF THESE SECURITIES OR PASSED UPON THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY
	OF THIS PROSPECTUS. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.




	Â 




	The Company is an âemerging
	growth company,â as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act.




	Â 




	These securities involve a high
	degree of risk. See âRISK FACTORSâ contained in this prospectus beginning on page 4.

	investor should read the following summary together with the more detailed information regarding the Company and the common stock
	being sold in this offering, including âRisk Factorsâ and the financial statements and related notes, included elsewhere

	The Company



	Â 



	History



	Â 


	A La Carte Charts Corporation
	(the âCompanyâ or âALCCâ), is a United States-based startup web and mobile application company designed
	to deliver informative products to the common investor in todayâs global markets. The Company intends to offer investors
	and traders a sophisticated, trustworthy, and individualized way to get actionable daily information for the burgeoning self-directed
	market. Over the past few years, David Meyers, the Companyâs founder and CEO, has developed a unique collection of daily
	information sources that provide systematic and common sense insights for making trades on virtually any market. Mr. Meyers has
	become renowned as a go-to investment expert, having appeared on CNBC and TheStreet.com, offering investment guidance to the public.
	The Company intends to apply its founderâs acumen and insight and offer the same to the public through development of a
	mobile application and web service, (the âCommon Man Investor Platformâ), which the Company intends to launch upon
	completion of development. Following development of the software and completion of web build, the Company shall offer a series
	of digital products for the everyday, âCommon Manâ investor.


	Â 


	The Company was incorporated in
	the State of Delaware in April 2016, and was formerly known as Ruby Island Acquisition Corporation. In May 2016, Ruby Island Acquisition
	Corporation filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10 by which it became a public reporting
	company.


	Â 


	In December 2016, the Company
	implemented a change of control by redeeming shares of existing shareholders, issuing shares to new shareholders, electing new
	officers and directors and accepting the resignations of its then existing officers and directors. In connection with the change
	of control, the shareholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the change of the Companyâs
	name from Ruby Island Acquisition Corporation to A La Carte Charts Corporation.



	Â 





	Business



	Â 


	The main product of the Company
	will be its daily âcharts,â delivered via web and mobile applications (the A La Carte âAppsâ), to be compatible
	with Android, iPhone and other smart devices on the market. The Companyâs Apps will each revolve around a specific trading
	strategy or market trend, such as the Head and Shoulders App, Bullish Wedge App, Commodities in Contango App, and Ascending Triangles
	App, among others. Through nuts-and-bolts data on market trends and sound real-world advice, the Company intends to enable its
	subscribers to find practical information they can use in their trading and investing.


	Â 





	As
	of the date of this Prospectus, an affiliate of the Company, A La Carte Charts LLC, an Arizona Limited Liability Company (âLa
	Carte LLCâ) of which the Companyâs founder, David Meyers, is sole member and 100% owner, has invested $150,000 in
	development of its proprietary software and mobile Apps.

	In January and June 2017, pursuant to a two-phase development
	proposal (the âSoftware Contractsâ) that have been attached altogether as an Exhibit to this Registration Statement,
	La Carte LLC has engaged Vuria LLC (âVuriaâ), an eSolutions provider, to provide state of the art mobile application
	development and functionality (the âApps Developmentâ). The Apps Development includes integrated solutions for iPhone
	and Android mobile device platforms, including optimal graphic design, user-friendly digital architecture and programming. Upon
	completion of the Apps Development, The Company anticipates that its affiliate will assign all rights, including intellectual
	property and otherwise, of and relating to the Apps Development.

	Â 



	Pursuant to the Software Contracts,
	La Carte LLC invested $80,000 in May 2017 and an additional $70,000 in June 2017 for further upgrades to optimize and enhance
	functionality and design of the Apps. The Companyâs affiliate anticipates completion of the upgrades, pursuant to the Software
	Contract, by year-end 2017.




	Â 


	Upon completion of the Apps Development,
	the Company intends to secure assignment from La Carte LLC to all rights, including intellectual property and otherwise, of and
	relating to the Apps Development.


	Â 


	In addition, as of the date of this
	Prospectus, the Companyâs founder has personally invested $20,000 (twenty thousand dollars) to obtain optimal servers, data
	and 2100 square feet of office space. Amazon Web Services provides server utilities to be utilized by the Apps Development. On
	these servers, data is collected from Barcharts, LLC, which provides the requisite market data necessary for functionality of the
	Apps.


	Â 


	Statistics from the Boston Consulting
	Group demonstrate $34 trillion in assets under management in North America alone. The active (retail) segment of the market in
	the U.S. is approximately $2.8 trillion annually, including $1.8 trillion from non-professional retail traders. Many investors,
	especially the under-50 group, are continually choosing non-traditional and technologically advanced investing methods as alternative
	to the traditional advisor/broker route. A La Carte Charts, with its new Apps, will help to bridge the gap between savvy affluent
	investor and the everyday investor who is seeking to improve his or her knowledge base and build long-term strategies to increase
	dividends.


	Â 


	The goal of A La Carte Charts is
	to help millions of investors find success, while growing into a well-known investment-data platform and fund portfolio. To fully
	launch operations, the Company is seeking an investment of $5,000,000, which shall be utilized for further modifications and enhancement
	of the Apps Development, for marketing and advertising expenses, for ongoing costs to maintain server, data and office lease, and
	for executive salaries and compensation and to hire staff, as needed. In the alternative, if the Company is unable to achieve its
	investment goals, the Company will launch its product as-is and the Companyâs Founder and CEO David Meyers will make ongoing,
	no-interest loans to the Company to sustain operations until profitability or subsequent investment.


	Â 


	The Company aims to be a one-stop
	shop for all active investors seeking optimum investment information and insights. For example, the Companyâs mobile app.
	already provides full analytical charts of the most popular charts in the investment market, including inverse head and shoulders,
	head and shoulders, double bottom, cup and handle, bear flags, etc. In addition, the Company shall track and link to the most pertinent
	fundamental articles from the web and provide easy, relevant access for investors. The Company also intends to offer informative
	pages that educate investors as to dividend dates and rates of all major stocks, the contango/roll yield of all major ETFâs
	and ETNâs, and app participants will have the opportunity to rate each stock chart that we provide. The ratings of the charts
	by users will then rank the stock from strongest chart to weakest for investors to use and help them gather information.


	Â 



	Risks and Uncertainties facing
	the Company



	Â 


	As a development stage company,
	the Company has no operating history and has continuously experienced losses since its inception. The Companyâs independent
	auditors have issued a report questioning the Companyâs ability to continue as a going concern. That is, the Company needs
	to create a source of revenue or locate additional financing in order to continue its developmental plans. As a development stage
	company, management of the Company has no prior experience in building and selling projects similar to that planned by the Company
	and in marketing and distributing such projects on a broad scale.


	Â 


	One of the biggest challenges facing
	the Company is the ability to raise adequate capital to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations,
	which it had not been able to accomplish to the date of the report, and /or obtain additional financing from its stockholders and/or
	other third parties.


	Â 




	The Company has to date conducted limited
	operations. If the Company were unable to develop strong and reliable sources of funding for continued operations, it is unlikely
	that the Company could develop its operations to return revenue sufficient to further develop its business plan. Moreover, the
	above assumes that the Companyâs efforts are met with customer satisfaction in the marketplace and exhibit steady adoption
	of its solutions amongst the potential base of customers, neither of which are currently known or guaranteed.


	Â 


	Due to these and other factors, the Companyâs need
	for additional capital, the Companyâs independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt of the Companyâs
	ability to continue as a going concern.

	Trading Market



	Â 


	Currently, there is no trading market
	for the securities of the Company. The Company intends to initially apply for admission to quotation of its securities on the OTC
	Bulletin Board as soon as possible which may be while this offering is still in process. There can be no assurance that the Company
	will qualify for quotation of its securities on the OTC Bulletin Board.


	Â 





	The Offering



	Â 


	The maximum number of Shares
	that can be sold pursuant to the terms of this offering is 780,000. The offering will terminate twenty-four (24) months from the
	date of this prospectus unless earlier terminated by the Company.


	Â 




	This prospectus relates to the offer
	and sale of 780,000 shares (âSharesâ) of common stock of the Company by the holders thereof (the âSelling Shareholder
	Sharesâ), who are deemed to be statutory underwriters.




	Â

	RISK FACTORS



	Â 


	A purchase of any Shares is an investment
	in the Companyâs common stock and involves a high degree of risk. Investors should consider carefully the following information
	about these risks, together with the other information contained in the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part,
	before the purchase of any Shares. If any of the following risks actually occur, the business, financial condition or results of
	operations of the Company would likely suffer, the market price of the common stock would likely decline, and investors could lose
	all or a portion of their investment. The Company has listed the following risk factors which it believes to be that material to
	an investment decision in this offering.


	Â 



	The Company has no independent
	operating history and as such an investor cannot assess its profitability or performance but must rely on the experience of its
	president and other officers.



	Â 


	The Company is a development stage
	company and has no operating history and it is therefore not possible for an investor to assess prior performance or determine
	whether it will likely meet its projected business plan. Such lack of experience may result in the Company experiencing difficulty
	in adequately designing or building any project, thereby causing the project to function improperly or provide inadequate utility
	for which it is intended. If the Companyâs projects cannot be completed or consistently function improperly or perform below
	expectations, the Company will likely be unable to market and sell many of its projects or products. An investor will be required
	to make an investment decision based solely on the managementâs history and its projected operations in light of the risks,
	expenses and uncertainties that may be encountered by engaging in the building and managing of ecological theme parks and producing
	organically grown food.


	Â 



	The Companyâs independent
	auditors have issued a report questioning the Companyâs ability to continue as a going concern.



	Â 


	The report of the Companyâs
	independent auditors contained in the Companyâs financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes a paragraph
	that explains that the Company has experienced recurring losses and has an accumulated deficit during the development stage of
	$13,160. These matters raise substantial doubt regarding the Companyâs ability to continue as a going concern without the
	influx of capital through the sale of its securities or through development of its operations.



	Â 




	The Company has an accumulated
	deficit of $75,569 as of March 31, 2017.



	Â 


	As of March 31, 2017, the Company
	has an accumulated deficit of $75,569. This deficit may impact on the Company in various ways including, but not limited to, making
	it more difficult to borrow money, sell stock or to maintain a good market price.


	Â 



	The offering price of the Shares
	has been arbitrarily determined and such price should not be used by an investor as an indicator of the fair market value of the
	Shares.



	Â 


	Currently there is no public market
	for the Companyâs common stock. The offering price for the Shares has been arbitrarily determined and does not necessarily
	bear any direct relationship to the assets, operations, book or other established criteria of value of the Company. Thus an investor
	should be aware that the offering price does not reflect the fair market price of the Shares.



	Â 





	Reliance on Management



	Â 


	Management will participate in all
	decisions with respect to the management of the Company, including (without limitation) determining business strategy, operations,
	and development. In the event of the dissolution, death, retirement or other incapacity of the Management, the business and operations
	of the Company may be adversely affected.


	Â 



	The Companyâs CEO controls
	a majority of the outstanding stock.



	Â 


	The CEO of the Company currently
	beneficially owns more than a majority of the Companyâs outstanding common stock. As such, he controls most matters requiring
	approval by stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration
	of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control, which in turn could have a material adverse
	effect on the market price of the Companyâs common stock or prevent stockholders from realizing a premium over the market
	price for their Shares. Mr. David Meyers will retain substantial control over matters requiring approval, such as (without limitation)
	the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may also have the
	effect of delaying or preventing a change in control.


	Â 





	RisksÂ Associated withÂ the
	Companyâs Reliance on its AffiliatedÂ Partyâs IntellectualÂ Property Rights and Contracts



	Â 


	The success of the Company isÂ reliant
	to a large extent on successfully securing rights,Â via assignment, license,Â or by other contractual arrangementÂ or
	transaction,Â to certain software development contracts and intellectual property rights associated therewith, currentlyÂ held
	or under control of affiliated entities of the Company.Â For instance, as of the date of this prospectus,

	A
	La Carte Charts LLC, an Arizona Limited Liability Company (âLa Carte LLCâ) of which the Companyâs founder, David
	Meyers, is sole member and 100% owner, has invested $150,000 in development of its proprietary software and mobile Apps.

	In
	January and June 2017, pursuant to a two-phase development proposal that has been attached as an Exhibit to this Registration
	Statement, La Carte LLC has engaged Vuria LLC (âVuriaâ), an eSolutions provider, to provide state of the art mobile
	application development and functionality (the âApps Developmentâ). The Apps Development includes integrated solutions
	for iPhone and Android mobile device platforms, including optimal graphic design, user-friendly digital architecture and programming.
	The Companyâs ability to generate operating capitalÂ and revenueÂ is reliant to a large extent on its ability to
	exploit theÂ Apps Development,Â however the Company to date does not have rightÂ orÂ title to the software and
	associated App.Â  While the Company is confident it will be ableÂ in the near futureÂ to secure rights from La Carte
	LLCÂ necessaryÂ to exploit theÂ Apps Development,Â La Carte LLC is under no legal obligation to go forward with
	assignmen of its interest in the Apps Development or otherwise,Â orÂ La Carte LLC may go forward with the Apps Development
	using other entities affiliated with Mr. Meyers.Â  In the event that the Company is unable to secureÂ rightsÂ to the
	Apps Development, via assignment or otherwise,Â the CompanyâsÂ business, financial condition and operating resultsÂ may
	beÂ materially adversely affected.

	The Company will have to compete with an already established
	and ever-evolving market.



	Â 


	Within this massive market, on a
	broad scale, the Company competes with a host of investment websites and traditional brokerages/advisors that have blogs, newsletters,
	websites, apps, and segments on TV shows. Although the Company believes there doesnât yet exist an exact competitor to itâs
	a La Carte Charts product, there are similar apps already in the marketplace.


	Â 


	In addition to brokerage firms,
	the biggest competition is from sites like www.TheStreet.com, Yahoo Finance, Stocktwits, and others that offer subscription services.
	Also, with the rapidly growing size of the retail investor market, new competitors are likely to enter the market. Robinhood, for
	example, is a new crowd-sourced investor application that uses a âsocial investingâ algorithm to provide watch lists
	for popular stocks, along with financial articles, trends, and a personalized stock-trading feed.


	Â 


	The Company will compete for advertising
	and subscription revenue with the aforementioned competitors, and some of ALCCâs current or potential competitors may have
	greater resources or better competitive positions in certain areas than the Company will, which may allow them to respond more
	effectively than us to new technologies and changes in market conditions. We compete for advertising and circulation revenue with
	both traditional and new content providers. This competition has intensified as a result of the continued development of new digital
	media technologies and new media providers offering online news and other content, and new competitors could quickly emerge. Some
	of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources or better competitive positions in certain areas than we do,
	which may allow them to respond more effectively than us to new technologies and changes in market conditions.


	Â 


	Our ability to compete effectively depends on many factors
	both within and beyond our control, including among others:


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	our ability to continue to deliver high-quality investment analysis & information and content that is interesting and relevant to our audience;





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	our ability to develop, maintain and monetize our digital and other products;





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	the quantity and activity of our users and our ability to maintain ongoing active users;





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	the popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our products;





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	the engagement of our potential subscribers with our products;





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	our ability to attract, contract, retain, and motivate talented management, software developers, professionals and other employees and executives;





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	our ability to manage and grow our operations in a cost-effective manner; and





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	our reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors.





	Â 



	Our success depends on our ability
	to respond and adapt to changes in technology and consumer behavior.



	Â 


	Technology in the online trading
	industry continues to evolve rapidly. Advances in technology have led to an increasing number of methods for the delivery and consumption
	of news and other content. These developments are driving changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over how
	they invest.


	Â 


	Changes in technology and consumer
	behavior pose a number of challenges that could adversely affect our revenues and competitive position. For example, among others:


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	we may be unable to develop products for mobile devices or other digital platforms that consumers find engaging, that work with a variety of operating systems and networks and that achieve a high level of market acceptance;





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	there may be changes in user sentiment about the quality or usefulness of our existing products or concerns related to privacy, security or other factors;





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	failure to successfully manage changes in search engine optimization and social media traffic to increase our digital presence and visibility may reduce our traffic levels;





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	we may be unable to maintain or update our technology infrastructure in a way that meets market and consumer demands;





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	the distribution of our content on delivery platforms of third parties may lead to limitations on monetization of our products, the loss of control over distribution of our content and loss of a direct relationship with our audience; and





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	we may experience challenges in creating display advertising on mobile devices that does not disrupt the user experience.





	Â 






	Â

	Â 








	Table of Contents

	Â 




	Â 


	Responding to these changes may
	require significant investment. We may be limited in our ability to invest funds and resources in digital products, services or
	opportunities, and we may incur expense in building, maintaining and evolving our technology infrastructure. Unless we are able
	to use new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors and develop in a timely
	manner compelling new products and services that engage users across platforms, our business, financial condition and prospects
	may be adversely affected.


	Â 



	The inability of the Company
	to retain and grow our user base could adversely affect our results of operations and business.



	Â 


	Revenue from advertising derived
	from our various consumer-facing and investor-facing products makes up a majority of our total revenue. Advertising revenue is
	sensitive to discretionary spending of advertisers in the markets we serve, as well as economic conditions. To the extent poor
	economic conditions lead advertising consumers to reduce spending on marketing activities, or if our user base does not grow at
	a rate sufficient to attract or retain demand from advertising consumers, our results of operations will be adversely affected.


	Â 



	Failure to execute cost-control
	measures successfully could adversely affect our profitability.



	Â 


	The Company intends to deploy a
	strategy that will reduce operating costs by maintaining minimal staff and overhead and contracting out software development and
	other necessary functions. However, if we do not achieve expected savings or our operating costs increase as a result of investments
	in strategic initiatives, our total operating costs would be greater than anticipated. In addition, if we do not manage cost-reduction
	efforts properly, such efforts may affect the quality of our products and therefore our ability to generate future revenues. Whatâs
	more, significant portions of our expenses are fixed costs that will neither increase nor decrease proportionately with revenues.
	If we are not able to implement further cost-control efforts or reduce our fixed costs sufficiently in response to a decline in
	our revenues, our results of operations will be adversely affected.


	Â 



	Security breaches and other network
	and information systems disruptions could affect our ability to conduct our business effectively.



	Â 


	Our online systems shall store and
	process confidential subscriber, employee and other sensitive personal data, and therefore maintaining our network security is
	of critical importance. We shall use third-party technology and systems for a variety of operations, including encryption and authentication
	technology, employee email, domain name registration, content delivery to customers, back-office support and other functions. Our
	systems, and those of third parties upon which our business relies, may be vulnerable to interruption or damage that can result
	from natural disasters, fires, power outages, acts of terrorism or other similar events, or from deliberate attacks such as computer
	hacking, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious
	social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing. Such an event could result in a disruption
	of our services or improper disclosure of personal data or confidential information, which could harm our reputation, require us
	to expend resources to remedy such a security breach or defend against further attacks, divert managementâs attention and
	resources or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased operating costs or loss of revenue.


	Â 



	Legislative and regulatory developments,
	including with respect to privacy, could adversely affect our business.



	Â 


	Our business is subject to government
	regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and our Apps, which we intend to make available worldwide, may be subject
	to laws regulating the Internet even in jurisdictions where we do not do business. We may incur increased costs necessary to comply
	with existing and newly adopted laws and regulations or penalties for any failure to comply.


	Â 


	Revenues from our digital products
	could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, in particular by existing or future laws and regulations relating to online
	privacy and the collection and use of consumer data in digital media. In addition, any failure, or perceived failure, by us to
	comply with our posted privacy policies or with any data-related requirements could result in claims against us by governmental
	entities or others, or could require us to change our practices, which could adversely affect our business.

	If the Company fails to successfully
	execute its growth strategies, it may not be able to attract sufficient subscription or purchase of its products to obtain significant
	market share.



	Â 


	The success of the Companyâs business
	depends primarily on subscription and/or purchase of our products from digitally savvy investors and traders who seek out actionable
	daily information for the burgeoning self-directed market. Therefore, the Companyâs ability to deliver an easy-to-use, resourceful,
	and engaging product is critical to the success and growth of the Company. This in turn will depend on several factors, including
	ALCCâs ability to successfully execute its growth strategies to develop new products and enhance existing products to respond
	to developments in the industry and investor and trader demands. While the Companyâs founder Mr. Meyers is a renowned âCommon
	Manâsâ investment advisor, having been a proprietary investor since 2006 and having run an online newsletter publication
	for the âcommon manâ since 2012, plus having made several appearances on radio and CNBC for his stock picks and market
	insights, there is still no assurance that this experience will translate to the Companyâs brand or that the Company will
	be able to maintain or increase demand based on its founderâs prior successes and acclaim. If the Company fails to successfully
	execute its growth strategies, it may not be able to sufficiently attract subscriptions and ALCC may have to significantly decrease
	prices, and revenues, profitability and business prospects may be materially and adversely affected.


	Â 



	No assurance of commercial feasibility.



	Â 


	Even if the Companyâs plans
	and projects are successfully initiated, there can be no assurance that such plans and projects will have any commercial success
	or advantage. Also, there is no assurance that the Companyâs products will perform as intended in the marketplace.


	Â 



	Investors in the offering may experience immediate
	dilution of the value of their shares.



	Â 


	Purchasers of the Shares may experience
	immediate dilution in the value of their Shares. Dilution represents the difference between the price per share paid by investors
	($2.50) and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of the Offering. Net tangible book value per share
	is the net tangible assets of the Company (total assets less total liabilities less intangible assets), divided by the number of
	shares of common stock outstanding. Thus if at some other time, shares had been sold by the Company at a price less than the $2.50
	paid by purchasers of the Shares or had been issued by the Company for services or as other non-cash consideration, then the value
	of such investor Shares immediately after purchase would be less than the $2.50 purchase price.


	Â 



	There has been no prior public
	market for the Companyâs common stock and the lack of such a market may make resale of the Shares difficult.



	Â 


	No prior public market has existed
	for the Companyâs securities and the Company cannot assure any purchaser that a market will develop subsequent to this offering.
	The Company intends to apply for quotation of its common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board. However, the Company does not know if
	it will be successful in such application, how long such application will take, or, if successful, that a market for the common
	stock will ever develop or continue on that or any other trading market. If for any reason a trading market for the Shares does
	not develop, investors may have difficulty selling their common stock should they desire to do so.


	Â 



	The Companyâs election
	not to opt out of JOBS Act extended accounting transition period may not make its financial statements easily comparable to other
	companies.



	Â 


	Pursuant to the JOBS Act of 2012,
	as an emerging growth company the Company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period for any new or revised accounting
	standards that may be issued by the PCAOB or the SEC. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period
	which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the
	Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the standard for the private company. This may make comparison of the Companyâs
	financial statements with any other public company which is not either an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company
	which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible as possible different or revised standards
	may be used.


	Â 



	The Companyâs stock may
	be considered a penny stock and any investment in the Companyâs stock will be considered a high-risk investment and subject
	to restrictions on marketability.



	Â 


	If the Shares commence trading,
	the trading price of the Companyâs common stock may be below $5.00 per Share. If the price of the common stock is below such
	level, trading in its common stock would be subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange
	Act of 1934, as amended. These rules require additional disclosure by broker-dealers in connection with any trades generally involving
	any non-NASDAQ equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per Share, subject to certain exceptions. Such rules
	require the delivery, before any penny stock transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks
	associated therewith, and impose various sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than
	established customers and accredited investors (generally institutions). For these types of transactions, the broker-dealer must
	determine the suitability of the penny stock for the purchaser and receive the purchaserâs written consent to the transactions
	before sale. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting
	transactions in the Companyâs common stock which could impact the liquidity of the Companyâs common stock.


	Â 



	Little Experience in Being a Public Company



	Â 


	The Company is an early-stage company
	and as such has little experience in managing a public company. Such lack of experience may result in the Company experiencing
	difficulty in adequately operating and growing its business. Further, the Company may be hampered by lack of experience in addressing
	the issues and considerations which are common to growing companies. If the Companyâs operating or management abilities consistently
	perform below expectations, the Companyâs business is unlikely to thrive.

	Â 


	The Company is an early-stage company
	with no developed finance and accounting organization and the rigorous demands of being a public company require a structured and
	developed finance and accounting group. As a reporting company, the Company is already subject to the reporting requirements of
	the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. However, the requirements of these laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
	entail significant accounting, legal and financial compliance costs which may be prohibitive to the Company as it develops its
	business plan, services and scope. These costs have made, and will continue to make, some activities more difficult, time consuming
	or costly and may place significant strain on its personnel, systems and resources.


	Â 


	The Securities Exchange Act requires,
	among other things, that companies maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.
	In order to maintain the requisite disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, significant
	resources and management oversight are required. As a result, managementâs attention may be diverted from other business
	concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on the development of the Companyâs business, financial condition and
	results of operations.


	Â 


	These rules and regulations may
	also make it difficult and expensive for the Company to obtain director and officer liability insurance. If the Company is unable
	to obtain adequate director and officer insurance, its ability to recruit and retain qualified officers and directors, especially
	those directors who may be deemed independent, will be significantly curtailed.


	Â 



	The Board of Directors could
	use the issuance or designation of preferred stock to impede or discourage an acquisition of the Company that may otherwise be
	beneficial to some shareholders.



	Â 


	The Company is authorized to issue
	up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock, or the issuance of rights to purchase such
	shares, could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal. For instance, the issuance of a series of preferred stock
	might impede a business combination by including class voting rights that would enable the holder to block such a transaction,
	or facilitate a business combination by including voting rights that would provide a required percentage vote of the stockholders.
	In addition, under certain circumstances, the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the holders
	of the common stock. Although the Companyâs board of directors is required to make any determination to issue such preferred
	stock based on its judgment as to the best interests of the stockholders of the Company, the board of directors could act in a
	manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some, or a majority, of the stockholders might believe
	to be in their best interests or in which stockholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then market price of such
	stock. The board of directors does not intend to seek stockholder approval prior to any issuance of currently authorized stock,
	unless otherwise required by law or otherwise.


	Â 



	The Company may not be able to
	obtain additional funds to finance its operations on terms acceptable or at all, and if ALCC does raise funds, the value of investment
	in the Company may be negatively impacted.



	Â 


	The Companyâs business operations
	may require expenditures that exceed its available capital resources. Although the Company currently does not expect that it will
	incur substantial debt to finance its future growth, to the extent that its funding requirements exceeds its financial resources,
	ALCC will be required to seek additional financing or to defer planned expenditures. There is no assurance that the Company can
	obtain additional funds on terms acceptable or at all.


	Â 


	In addition, if the Company raises
	additional funds by equity financing, investorsâ equity interest in the Company may be diluted. If ALCC raises additional
	funds by incurring debt obligations, it may be subject to various covenants under the relevant debt instruments that may, among
	other things, restrict its ability to pay dividends. Servicing such debt obligations could also be burdensome to its operations.
	If the Company fails to service the debt obligations or is unable to comply with the covenants, it could be in default under the
	debt obligations and its liquidity and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.


	Â 


	The Registrant currently does not
	hold any intellectual property protection, and has not applied for any patents. The Registrant may decide in the future to pursue
	further efforts to protect its intellectual property, trade secrets and proprietary methods and processes.


	Â 



	Litigation Risk




	Â 



	The Company does not have any business
	liability, disruption or litigation insurance, and any business disruption or litigation the Company experiences might result in
	it incurring substantial costs and diversion of resources.


	Â 



	Broad Indemnification Provided to Management



	Â 


	The governing documents of the Company
	limit the liability of, and provide indemnification for, the Management and the respective directors, officers, employees and agents
	of the Company and the Management. The indemnification provided is to the full extent permitted under applicable Delaware law.
	Those provisions may limit certain rights of the shareholders against such parties, and moreover, an indemnification by the Company
	of the Management or any indemnified individual may result in substantial out-of-pocket costs and expenses payable by the Company.
	If the Company is forced to provide indemnification for any of these indemnified parties, it is possible that the assets of the
	Company could become depleted or the Company may otherwise suffer a material adverse financial consequence as a result of its indemnity
	obligations. As of the date of this Memorandum, to the knowledge of the Company, there is no pending litigation or proceeding that
	exists involving a director, officer, employee or agent of the Management or the Company where indemnification will be required
	or permitted.

	Limited Transferability of Shares



	Â 


	There is no public market for the
	Shares. While the Company intends to develop a public market in the future, there can be no assurance if or when such a market
	would be expected to develop in the future. Even if a potential buyer could be found, the transferability of these Shares is also
	restricted by the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Rule 144 promulgated thereunder. Unless an exemption
	is available, these Shares may not be sold or transferred without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.


	Â 


	Investors must be capable of bearing
	the economic risks of this investment with the understanding that these Shares may not be liquidated by resale or redemption and
	should expect to hold their Shares as a long-term investment (especially if no public trading market develops).


	Â 



	Speculative Nature of Investment



	Â 


	Investment in these Shares is speculative
	and, by investing, each investor assumes the risk of losing the entire investment. The Company has limited operations as of the
	date of this Private Placement Memorandum and will be solely dependent upon the Company and the Companyâs portfolio of assets,
	both of which are subject to the risks described herein. Accordingly, only investors who are able to bear the loss of their entire
	investment and who otherwise meet the investor suitability standards should consider purchasing these Shares.


	Â 


	Each prospective investor who invests
	in the Company must understand that investment in the Shares is speculative. By investing, potential investors understand that
	they may lose their entire investment in investing with the Company.


	Â 



	No Expectation to Pay Dividends



	Â 


	The Company
	has not paid any dividends with respect to its outstanding Shares and cannot predict when, or if, dividends will be paid. The Company
	does not currently anticipate paying any dividends on the Shares until a product is successfully commercialized and liquidity is
	realized. There is no guarantee the Company will ever receive any profit from its operations so as to be able to declare and pay
	dividends. There can be no assurance with respect to the amount and timing of any dividends other than to the shareholders, or
	that they will ever be made. Future dividends will be determined by the Management of the Company in light of prevailing financial
	conditions, earnings, if any, as well as other relevant factors.


	Â 



	Unforeseen Changes



	Â 


	While the Company has enumerated
	certain material risk factors herein, it is impossible to know all risks which may arise in the future. In particular, shareholders
	may be negatively affected by changes in any of the following: (i) laws, rules and regulations; (ii) regional, national and/or
	global economic factors; (iii) the capacity, circumstances and relationships of partners of the Company or the Management; or (iv)
	general changes in financial or capital markets.


	Â 


	The Company continuously encounters
	changes in its operating environment, and the Company may have fewer resources than many of its competitors to continue to adjust
	to those changes. The operating environment of the Company is undergoing rapid changes, with frequent introductions of laws, regulations,
	competitors, market approaches, and economic impacts. Future success will depend, in part, upon the ability of the Company to adapt
	to those changes and providing products and services that will satisfy the demands of their respective businesses and projects.
	Many of the competitors have substantially greater resources to adapt to those changes. The Company may not effectively react to
	all of the changes in its operating environment or be successful in adapting its products and approach.

	FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS



	Â 


	This prospectus contains, in addition
	to historical information, certain information, assumptions and discussions that may constitute forward-looking statements. Such
	statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially than those projected
	or anticipated. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Although the Company
	believes its assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company cannot assure an investor that the
	forward-looking statements set out in this prospectus will prove to be accurate.


	Â 


	Such âforward-looking statementsâ
	can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as âbelievesâ, âexpectsâ, âmayâ,
	âshouldâ or âanticipatesâ, or the negative thereof, or other variations thereon or comparable terminology,
	or by discussion of strategy. No assurance can be given that the future results covered by the forward-looking statements will
	be achieved. The following matters constitute cautionary statements identifying important factors with respect to such forward-looking
	statements, including certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to vary materially from the future results
	covered in such forward-looking statements.


	Â 


	An investor should not rely on forward-looking
	statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be
	achieved or occur. The Company is not under a duty to update any of these forward-looking statements after the date of this prospectus
	or to conform these statements to actual results or revised expectations.


	Â 





	DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE



	Â 


	There is no public market for the
	Companyâs common stock and the $2.50 price at which the Shares are being offered has been arbitrarily determined by the Company.


	Â 


	The Shares offered by the selling
	shareholders may be offered and sold, from time to time, by the selling shareholders described in this prospectus under the heading
	âSelling Shareholdersâ at a fixed offering price of $2.50 per share, for the duration of the offering. Only after
	closing of the offering and until such time as the Shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board may the Shares be offered at prevailing
	market or privately negotiated prices. The selling shareholders may sell the Shares by any means described in this prospectus
	under âPlan of Distribution.â



	Â 







	DIVIDEND POLICY



	Â 


	The Company does not anticipate
	that it will declare dividends in the foreseeable future but rather intends to use any future earnings for the development of its
	business.



	Â 







	SELLING SHAREHOLDER SALES



	Â 


	This prospectus relates to the
	sale of 780,000 outstanding shares of the Companyâs common stock by the holders of those shares. The selling shareholders
	will offer their shares at a fixed offering price of $2.50 per share for the duration of the offering. Only after closing of the
	offering and until such time as the Shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board may the Shares be offered at prevailing market
	or privately negotiated prices including (without limitation) in one or more transactions that may take place by ordinary brokerâs
	transactions, privately-negotiated transactions or through sales to one or more dealers for resale or at prevailing market if
	a market should develop.


	Â 


	Usual and customary or specifically
	negotiated brokerage fees or commissions may be paid by the selling shareholders in connection with sales of the common stock.
	The selling shareholders may from time to time offer their shares through underwriters, brokers-dealers, agents or other intermediaries.
	The distribution of the common stock by the selling shareholders may be effected in one or more transactions that may take place
	through customary brokerage channels, in privately negotiated sales; by a combination of these methods; or by other means. The
	Company will not receive any portion or percentage of any of the proceeds from the sale of the Shares.



	Â 







	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION



	Â 



	General



	Â

	underwriter, broker-dealer or selling agent for the sale of the Shares. The Company has no arrangements nor has it entered into
	any agreement with any underwriters, broker-dealers or selling agents for the sale of the Shares.

	Selling Shareholders



	Â 


	The selling shareholders will
	offer their shares at a fixed offering price of $2.50 per share, for the duration of the offering. Only after closing of the offering
	and until such time as the Shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board may the Shares be offered at prevailing market or privately
	negotiated prices including (without limitation) in one or more transactions that may take place by ordinary brokerâs transactions,
	privately-negotiated transactions or through sales to one or more dealers for resale or at prevailing market if a market should
	develop.


	Â 


	The distribution of the Selling
	Shareholder Shares may be effected in one or more transactions that may take place through customary brokerage channels, in privately-negotiated
	sales, by a combination of these methods or by other means. The selling shareholders may from time to time offer their shares
	through underwriters, brokers-dealers, agents or other intermediaries. Usual and customary or specifically negotiated brokerage
	fees or commissions may be paid by the selling shareholders in connection with sales of the Shares. The Company will not receive
	any portion or percentage of any of the proceeds from the sale of the Shares. Of the 780,000 Shares included in the registration
	statement, of which this prospectus is a part, none are held by any officers, affiliates or directors.


	Â 



	Resale of the Securities under
	State Securities Laws



	Â 


	The National Securities Market Improvement
	Act of 1996 (âNSMIAâ) limits the authority of states to impose restrictions upon resale of securities made pursuant
	to Sections 4(1) and 4(3) of the Securities Act of companies which file reports under Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange
	Act. Resale of the Shares in the secondary market will be made pursuant to Section 4(1) of the Securities Act (sales other than
	by an issuer, underwriter or broker).



	Â 







	DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES



	Â 


	The Company is authorized to issue
	100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001, of which 6,799,600 shares are outstanding as of the date of the registration
	statement, of which this prospectus is a part. The Company is also authorized to issue 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par
	value $0.0001, of which no shares were outstanding as of the date of the registration statement, of which this prospectus is a
	part.


	Â 


	The following statements relating
	to the capital stock set forth the material terms of the securities of the Company. Reference is also made to the more detailed
	provisions of the certificate of incorporation and the by-laws, copies of which are filed as exhibits to this registration statement.


	Â 



	Common Stock



	Â 




	The Company is registering up to 780,000
	shares of common stock by the holders thereof at a price of $2.50 per share.




	Â 


	Holders of shares of common stock
	are entitled to one vote for each share on all matters to be voted on by the stockholders. Holders of common stock do not have
	cumulative voting rights.


	Â 


	Subject to preferences that may
	be applicable to any outstanding shares of preferred stock, the holders of common stock are entitled to share ratably in dividends,
	if any, as may be declared from time to time by the board of directors in its discretion from funds legally available therefor.


	Â 


	Holders of common stock have no
	preemptive rights to purchase the Companyâs common stock. There are no conversion or redemption rights or sinking fund provisions
	with respect to the common stock. The Company may issue additional shares of common stock which could dilute its current shareholderâs
	share value.


	Â 



	Preferred Stock



	Â 


	Shares of preferred stock may be
	issued from time to time in one or more series as may be determined by the board of directors. The voting powers and preferences,
	the relative rights of each series, and the qualifications, limitations, and restrictions on such preferred stock shall be established
	by the board of directors, except that no holder of preferred stock shall have preemptive rights.


	Â 



	Admission to Quotation on the
	OTC Bulletin Board



	Â 


	If and when the Company meets the
	qualifications, it intends to apply for quotation of its securities on the OTC Bulletin Board. There is no assurance that the Company
	will ever meet such qualifications. The OTC Bulletin Board differs from national and regional stock exchanges in that it (1) is
	not situated in a single location but operates through communication of bids, offers and confirmations between broker-dealers and
	(2) securities admitted to quotation are offered by one or more broker-dealers rather than the âspecialistâ common
	to stock exchanges. To qualify for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board, an equity security must have one registered broker-dealer,
	known as the market maker, willing to list bid or sale quotations and to sponsor the company listing.

	Penny Stock Regulation



	Â 


	Penny stocks generally are equity
	securities with a price of less than $5.00 per share other than securities registered on national securities exchanges or listed
	on the Nasdaq Stock Market, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities
	are provided by the exchange or system. The penny stock rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who
	sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess
	of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouse). For transactions covered by these rules,
	the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities and have received the purchaserâs
	written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. Additionally, for any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt,
	the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny
	stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative
	and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information on the
	limited market in penny stocks. Because of these penny stock rules, broker-dealers may be restricted in their ability to sell the
	Companyâs common stock. The foregoing required penny stock restrictions will not apply to the Companyâs common stock
	if such stock reaches and maintains a market price of $5.00 per share or greater.

	Dividends



	Â 


	The Company has not paid any dividends
	to date. The Company intends to employ all available funds for the growth and development of its business, and accordingly, does
	not intend to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future.

	THE BUSINESS



	Â 



	Background



	Â 


	The Company has only recently commenced
	operations as a development-stage company, and it has limited operating history and is expected to experience losses in the near
	term. The Companyâs independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt about the Companyâs ability
	to continue as a going concern.

	The main product of the Company
	will be its daily âCharts,â delivered via web and mobile applications (âAppsâ), to be compatible with Android,
	iPhone and other smart devices on the market. The Companyâs Apps will each revolve around a specific trading strategy or
	market trend, such as the Head and Shoulders App, Bullish Wedge App, Commodities in Contango App, and Ascending Triangles App,
	among others. Through nuts-and-bolts data on market trends and sound real-world advice, the Company intends to enable its subscribers
	to find practical information they can use in their trading and investing.


	Â 


	The Charts will be offered to the
	Companyâs users at no cost. The Company intends to generate revenue through sale of in-app advertising space. The Company
	anticipates significant demand for advertising space through its Apps based on the utility of its product and projected desirability
	of advertisers to reach the target demographic of the Companyâs user base. The Companyâs users will consist of individuals,
	often men ages 35-50 years old, that have at least $100,000 in annual salary and whom actively manage their own money. The Company
	aims to reach 2.5 million users during its first year of operation (âUser Milestoneâ). Upon reaching or exceeding its
	User Milestone, the Company thereafter anticipates converting users into advertising revenue at a rate of approximately $1.56 per
	user, based on comparison to lowest valuation social media platforms in comparable market space, such as Twitter, Inc., which as
	of the date of this prospectus converts users into advertising revenue at the rate of $1.56 per user. Although Twitterâs
	user base is substantial, the Company anticipates drawing similar conversion rates due to its similarity in utility to Twitter
	but distinguished target user base.


	Â 


	Even if the Company does not reach
	its User Milestone by end of first year of operation, and even if advertising revenue is converted at less than $1.00 per user,
	the Company still anticipates significant advertising revenue returns as user activity and downloads increase with increase in
	brand exposure. It is noted however that there can be no guarantee that the Company will ever exceed nor even reach its User Milestone.


	Â 





	An
	affiliate of the Company, A La Carte Charts LLC, an Arizona Limited Liability Company (âLa Carte LLCâ) of which the
	Companyâs founder, David Meyers, is sole member and 100% owner, has invested $150,000 in development of its proprietary
	software and mobile Apps.

	In January and June 2017, pursuant to a two-phase development proposal that has been attached
	altogether as an Exhibit to this Registration Statement, La Carte LLC has engaged Vuria LLC (âVuriaâ), an eSolutions
	provider, to provide state of the art mobile application development and functionality (the âApps Developmentâ). The
	Apps Development includes integrated solutions for iPhone and Android mobile device platforms, including optimal graphic design,
	user-friendly digital architecture and programming. Upon completion of the Apps Development, The Company anticipates that its
	affiliate will assign all rights, including intellectual property and otherwise, of and relating to the Apps Development.




	Â 


	Statistics from the Boston Consulting
	Group show that there are $34 trillion in assets under management in North America alone. The active (retail) segment of the market
	in the U.S. is approximately $2.8 trillion annually, including $1.8 trillion from non-professional retail traders. Many investors,
	especially the under-50 group, are continually choosing non-traditional and technologically advanced investing methods as alternative
	to the traditional advisor/broker route. A La Carte Charts, with its new apps, will help to bridge the gap between savvy affluent
	investor and the everyday investor who is seeking to improve his or her knowledge base and build long-term strategies to increase
	dividends. Business and productivity apps generated around $36 billion in 2014, part of the overall $86 billion market for apps.


	Â 


	The goal of A La Carte Charts is
	to help millions of investors find success, while growing into a well-known investment-data platform and fund portfolio. To fully
	launch operations, the Company is seeking an investment of $5,000,000, which shall be utilized for further modifications and enhancement
	of the Apps Development, for marketing and advertising expenses, for ongoing costs to maintain server, data and office lease, and
	for executive salaries and compensation and to hire staff, as needed. In the alternative, if the Company is unable to achieve its
	investment goals, the Company will launch its product as-is and the Companyâs Founder and CEO David Meyers will make ongoing,
	no-interest loans to the Company to sustain operations until profitability or subsequent investment.

	The Company primary objectives are highlighted by the
	following:

	The Market




	Â 



	With the advent of advanced algorithmic
	trading, the online trading industry, including self-directed, or active, investors, is a rapidly expanding market segment. Financial
	consultancy firm Celent estimates that the active investor market comprises more than 40% of the United States investor market.
	Growth in the market has been heavily attributed to the increased access to online information and online trading tools. Celentâs
	self-directed market study finds that:


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	Online firms continue to enhance trading functionalities, improve execution speed and further develop tools to create more robust trading platforms and attract all types of customer segments.





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	The most important additions will include access to additional products, more sophisticated trading tools, enhanced education materials, more social features, improved mobile access and improved navigation and design.





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	Firms are turning to social networking community tools and educational tools to enhance investor knowledge.





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	Market volatility has led to greater demand by retail investors for a more diverse set of products, including options, futures and foreign exchange.






	Â 



	Yet, easy-to-understand, real-world
	information for the âeverymanâ is still difficult to find. A La Carte Charts and its products, are the result of founder
	David Meyersâ personal journey from everyday investor to investment guru who has appeared on CNBC as a retail investor expert.
	Along the way, he developed investing strategies that take a look at a variety of markets in order to determine the best course
	of action that day â presented through practical, common sense, and actionable investment data from which self-directed investors
	can prosper.


	Â 



	Products and Services



	Â 


	A La Carte Charts is a multifaceted
	holding company that will offer both consumer-facing and investor-facing products. The Companyâs initial plan is to offer
	its products without fee as the Companyâs goal is to attract users and convert user activity into advertising revenue. A
	La Carte Charts will target a wide range of investors to gain users, from beginning traders and self-directed investors to highly
	experienced day traders and savvy investors. The Company intends to capitalize on a commonality among all investor-types: the common
	desire to seek out and find new investment opportunities, information, and flexibility. A La Carte Charts present a mobile- and
	social-oriented platform through its websites and mobile apps, offering investors not only varied, accessible ways to find information
	but also by offering highly personalized and customizable investing experience.


	Â 


	The main consumer-facing products
	will consist of a series of mobile applications that boil investing down to its most simple elements. The Company will focus its
	offering to 12 chart-types that, in opinion of the Company based on research and expertise of its founder, represent the most sought-after
	charts by its target consumers. The Companyâs proprietary Apps will utilize these charts to create a streamlined, user-friendly
	information source that pushes daily lists and investment information to subscribers. For example, the Head and Shoulders app shall
	deliver daily reports on the âHead-and-Shouldersâ pattern based on monthly NASDAQ trends. The chart shall then alert
	investors when a securityâs price is set to fall from its peak (the head) or rise from the bottom (shoulders) of a price
	pattern. It is a non-biased, objective way of giving investors the information they need to make informed decisions.

	A La Carte Chartâs apps will
	use off-the-shelf information from the NASDAQ and other markets, coupled with historically based investment data. Although the
	Company intends to offer its products at no cost to the user, by attracting large user base the Company intends to reach profitability
	through conversion of its users into advertising revenue.


	Â 


	A La Carte Charts may also in the
	future sell investment training videos and other relevant educational materials as well as an ever-growing list of products through
	ALaCarteCharts.com, and as in-app purchases through the apps themselves.

	Market Analysis




	Â 



	The investment landscape globally
	is composed of varying classes, from traditional publicly traded stocks to newer leveraged assets and diversified capital-based
	hedge funds. The asset management industry reached a record high for the second year in a row in 2013. The value of professionally
	managed assets reached a record $68.7 trillion globally in 2013, with industry profits reaching $93 billion, according to the most
	recently available report from the Boston Consulting Group. Total Assets under Management (AuM) grew 13% over 2012, and have grown
	from $54.7 trillion in 2007. The global market by region is shown below in trillions of dollars.


	Â 


	The Boston Consulting Group projected
	that asset management will continue to rank among the most profitable industries. Operating margins, or profits as a percentage
	of net revenues, grew from 37 percent in 2012 to 39 percent, approaching the pre-crisis high of 41 percent, as costs grew less
	quickly than revenues.â North America is by far the largest market globally, and AuM grew 20% in 2013.


	Â 


	Within this market the active (retail)
	trader segment in the U.S. is approximately $2.8 trillion, including $1.8 trillion from non-professional retail traders holding
	personal trading accounts, according to research from Aite Group. Nearly 25% of U.S. adults with access to the Internet are retail
	online traders, according to Aite Group, with an additional 6% being professional traders. This totals a self-directed U.S. trading
	population of more than 54 million adults. The average volume of daily trading for the past several years is outlined below by
	source.

	Mobile Application Market




	Â 



	The market for mobile apps in 2014
	was estimated at around $86 billion, with projections estimating the market will nearly double within the next couple years. A
	report from market analyst Vision Mobile estimates that, of the market, $36 billion was spent on business and productivity apps
	in 2014. Business and productivity apps will reach an estimated $58 billion by the end of 2016.


	Â 


	There are numerous trends in the
	market factoring into growth of the business and productivity app market, including:


	Â 




	Â 



	â





	Consumerisation of IT

	: Decisions made by users, not CIOs. Increased use of Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) concept in teams and departments have encouraged use of Apps which are more specific to their individual needs.





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â





	Diversification of IT

	: Use of mobility devices for official work apart from checking e-mail has seen a surge in terms of business and productivity apps.





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â





	Bring-your-own-devices:

	Although use of BYOD culture is giving headaches to IT security and infrastructure teams across the organization, it is becoming quite a trend across its user base. Use of their own devices plus flexibility of working anywhere anytime is making it a favorite with decision makers also.





	Â 


	The market for business and productivity
	apps is primarily purchased outside of app stores, as many corporations are still buying apps through the traditional method of
	buying software. As shown below, less than 10% of business and productivity apps are sold in app stores (around $1 billion), and
	this will reach $6 billion by 2016.


	Â 



	Market Segmentation




	Â 



	The Companyâs Development Apps
	are intended to cater to a wide range of individuals, ranging from amateurs to advanced traders. The Companyâs target consumers
	can be located virtually anywhere in the world, although for first year of operation the Company will target only those customers
	located within the United States. Irrespective of demographic, each target user shares the common need to achieve real-world, actionable
	data and advice to address todayâs markets.


	Â 


	The average self-directed retail investor
	profile is expanding, according to Celent in its January 2015 publication âThe State of Online Brokerage Platforms.â
	(the âCelent Reportâ). The Celent Report further indicated that the average active trader in the U.S. is male and in
	his mid-40s, but that there are an increasing number of individuals aged over 45 years old opening active trader accounts. Additionally,
	major brokerage firms were noted by the report to having seen an increase in the number of females and millennials opening self-directed
	trading accounts. According to the report, active traders value mobility, and an ability to configure the trading screen, set up
	preferences, and view videos, technical indicators, analyst reports, and an ability to conduct research on a mobile device.


	Â 


	Additionally, Aite Group reported
	in a 2015 article âOnline trading penetration in the United Statesâ (the Aite Group Reportâ), that U.S. brokers
	expect to see the contribution of mobile trading to rise as a result of a new generation of traders adopting mobile technology
	for everyday activities and specialized endeavors such as online trading. The Aite Group also reported that the under-35 demographic
	shall represent an important component of the market due to the large size of the Millennial generations and their ever-growing
	income base.


	Â 


	Another 2015 report, from Cisco on
	the technical savvy of investors (the âCisco Reportâ), demonstrated that most wealthy individual investors in the U.S.
	are baby boomers and âsilvers.â However, while making up just 28% of investors, the under-50 set is the most comfortable
	with using technology for their investing purposes. The Cisco Report further noted of study of wealth investors that: investors
	ages 18 to 34 are not surprisingly the most avid technology users, since they have grown up with both the Internet and rapid advances
	in consumer technology devices. The report further noted however, that investors in the next age group, 35 to 49, have very similar
	characteristics. As such, the Company intends to target both age groups in roll out of its platform and associated Apps.

	Operating Plan




	Â 



	Over the next twelve months from
	the date of this Registration Statement, the Company intends to reach several milestones that will enable it to grow and expand
	at an anticipated rapid rate. Provided the Company is able to locate necessary financing and provided the Apps Development is completed
	at or prior to the target date of completion pursuant to the Software Contract discussed herein and attached as an exhibit to this
	Registration Statement, the Company then intends to roll out operational phase of its development and attract users at large scale.
	Upon roll out of optimal development and deployment of the Companyâs nuanced marketing strategy, the Company hopes in turn
	to attain 2.5m users over the first year of operation. As users and user activity increases the Company will reach out to advertising
	partners for additional revenue streams. The Company will subsequently expand investment in marketing to increase exposure of its
	brand. The Company will also update and enhance its Development Apps in response to feedback from its users.


	Â 





	Competition




	Â 



	Within this massive market, on a
	broad scale, the Company competes with a host of investment websites and traditional brokerages/advisors that have blogs, newsletters,
	websites, apps, and segments on TV shows. So while the Company has found no exact competition to itâs a La Carte Charts product,
	there are similar apps out there. While most brokerage companies offer âstock screeners,â they are very difficult to
	setup for your average investor and one needs to be in front of a computer to do so. The Companyâs apps offer the list at
	the usersâ fingertips without need of technical know-how.


	Â 


	Other than brokerages, the biggest
	competition is from sites like www.TheStreet.com, Yahoo Finance, Stocktwits, and others that offer subscription services. They
	are not direct competition, though, and should be considered parallel businesses. They offer stock picks based on subjective analysis
	and commentary. A La Carte Charts applications simply deliver a list of stocks that match the chart that the purchaser selects.
	In fact, all of the aforementioned sites are great places to advertise.


	Â 


	With the rapidly growing size of
	the retail investor market, however, new competitors will continually enter the market. Robinhood, for example, is a new crowd-sourced
	investor app that uses a âsocial investingâ algorithm to provide watch lists for popular stocks, along with financial
	articles, trends, and a personalized stock-trading feed.


	Â 


	The Company and its Chart apps will exist to supplement
	and enhance the market for the everyday investor.

	Marketing Strategy



	Â 


	A La Carte Charts will be positioned
	in the market as a class-leading app-based investor education portal. Users will benefit from the wide range of daily investment
	information and education tools that are built into the software. A well-rounded approach to marketing will promote A La Carte
	Charts apps to a wide customer base. As illustrated in Section 4.1 above, there is a large and growing population of web-savvy
	active investors who are seeking the best advice/information they can find. Marketing the platform to these investors will include
	a combination of traditional marketing, internet marketing, and social media, helping to brand the Company as the premier âeveryman
	investorâ-oriented app for promoting independent thinking based on common sense data and metrics.


	Â 


	Mr. Meyers has worked for the past
	few years to gain a strong following of consumers, which has helped to foster word-of-mouth and social media viral exposure that
	reaches new customers. With the launch of its new platform and apps, A La Carte Charts will also use the following tactics to attract
	new customers:


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	Press Releases, Blogs, Podcasts, etc.





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	Email Marketing





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	Event Sponsorship (trade shows, seminars, etc.)





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	Free Promotional Media





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	Facebook âLikeâ and CPI âCost Per Installâ Campaigns





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	Mobile ads on TheStreet.com, Yahoo Finance, Stocktwits, etc.





	Â 


	These initiatives will help to launch
	the new slate of products and services, and the Company will then continually promote its website and apps through the following:


	Â 



	Key-Word Search Optimization
	and Social Media:

	Whenever anyone uses a popular search engine to search for topics such as âstock tipsâ or âinvestor
	advice,â etc., in Google, Yahoo!, Lycos, Excite, or Bing, from, an organic ink to the Companyâs website will ideally
	appear.


	Â 


	The Company will drive traffic through
	blogs placed on its website and accessed through multiple links. Blogging gives a business the ability to inform and market without
	the formality of being âpublished,â and it also supplements marketing efforts by increasing visibility and readership
	of the firmâs capabilities. ALaCarteCharts.com and its ancillary sites will contain a number of periodic blogs designed to
	inform readers of current articles and issues. Potentially, Twitter account updates will also be placed onto the navigation bar
	of the main blog page to highlight relevant financial soundbites.


	Â 


	The use of a corporate Facebook
	page also promotes the âconnectingâ and âsharingâ of information, pictures, and direct media, etc., to
	todayâs Internet-savvy investors and traders. It allows for the creation of free company pages, which not only provide free
	advertising but make it easy for current customers to refer A La Carte Charts to others in their network of friends. LinkedIn will
	also be useful as an online virtual networking and professional marketplace. It allows for connectivity to trade associations,
	easily promotes managementâs resumes and A La Carte Chartsâ products, and creates an untold network of connections
	to potential customers. LinkedIn also allows for the creation of instant advertising through their DirectAds area, putting the
	Company in a virtual Yellow Pages for others to connect to.


	Â 


	Further Internet-based marketing
	methods include:


	Â 




	Â 



	â





	PPC/CPM

	: A La Carte Charts will employ an effective method for launching a pay-per-click (PPC) and CPM (cost-per-thousand impressions) campaign that advertises its innovative online investment advice and apps along the sidebars of search engines and on relevant websites with text and banner ads. Though this will be kept to a minimum, depending on demonstrated ROI. As noted above, a âcost per installâ campaign may be used as well.





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â





	E-mail marketing

	: A La Carte Charts has an extensive list of leads through its current website and from Mr. Meyersâ growing TV and social media presence. This list is continually growing and will be used for targeting interested parties with an opted-in email list that promotes new app updates, new online tools and features, and other A La Carte Charts products.





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â





	Mobile app development

	: A La Carte Charts will simultaneously develop and launch its mobile apps, which will be available for download on the Apple App Store initially, and then the Android Marketplace. This will extend the reach and functionality of the platform.





	Â 


	Additionally, the Company will employ
	the following methods:


	Â 



	Press Releases:

	Press releases
	will be created, and the Company will enact a publicity blitz to further target news sources where affluent professionals and everyday
	investors find their marketing news, as well as targeting publications such as those listed above and others that reach a large
	and influence base of consumers. Wired, TechCrunch, and other places early adopters find their tech news will be targeted as well,
	as will other relevant tech and business magazines and websites. This is a free way to drive awareness of A La Carte Charts and
	its innovative platform.


	Â 



	Traditional Advertising

	:
	This will also occur, when needed, in publications like those above and others, likely only after A La Carte Charts has been established
	in the market and is attempting to enhance market share.

	Video

	: The A La Carte Charts
	platform and services will be presented through dynamic multimedia communications vehicles. Videos, in particular, are often the
	most effective methods of communicating how a product or service works. The Company has already created marketing videos that appear
	on its website, and they can also be deployed to YouTube, Google Video, and other sites.



	Â 




	Referral Incentives:

	The
	Company will also offer an âAffiliate Referral Programâ enabling the establishment of a link to its website on external
	sites. The Company will pay a referral fee for all opportunities/clients referred to their website.

	Executed Promotional Contracts




	Â 



	On December 28, 2016 the Company
	entered into a contract with then current NFL professional athlete Richard Sherman (âMr. Shermanâ) whereby, in return
	for a total of 339,800 shares representing 5% (Five Percent) of the Companyâs total shares issued and outstanding as of the
	date the contract was executed, Mr. Sherman has given the Company license and authority to use Mr. Shermanâs name and likeness
	in association with the promotional use of the Companyâs business activities and marketing of its products.


	Â 


	On that same date December 28, 2016
	the Company also entered into a contract with a Branton Lamont Sherman whereby, also in return for a total of 339,800 shares representing
	5% (Five Percent) of the Companyâs total shares issued and outstanding as of the date the contract was executed, Mr. Sherman
	has given the Company license and authority to use Branton Lamont Shermanâs name and likeness in association with the promotional
	use of the Companyâs business activities and marketing of its products.


	Â 


	The Company intends to utilize the contracts to expand
	the marketing reach and exposure of its products and services.

	THE COMPANY




	Â 




	Change of Control




	Â 







	The Company was incorporated in the
	State of Delaware in April 2016 and was formerly known as Ruby Island Acquisition Corporation. In December 2016, the Company implemented
	a change of control by issuing shares to new shareholders, redeeming shares of existing shareholders, electing new officers and
	directors and accepting the resignations of its then existing officers and directors. In connection with the change of control,
	the shareholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the change of the Companyâs name from Ruby
	Island Acquisition Corporation to Diverse Development Group, Inc. in November 2016.



	Â 




	Relationship with Tiber Creek
	Corporation



	Â 




	In October 2016, the Company entered
	into an engagement agreement with Tiber Creek Corporation, a Delaware corporation (âTiber Creekâ), by which Tiber
	Creek provides assistance to the Company in effecting transactions for the Company to combine with a public reporting company,
	including, among other items: transferring control of such reporting company to the Company; causing the preparation and filing
	of forms, including a registration statement, with the Securities and Exchange Commission; assist in listing its securities on
	a trading exchange; and assist in establishing and maintaining relationships with market makers and broker-dealers.




	Â 




	The Companyâs then-current shareholders,
	James Cassidy and James McKillop, retained an aggregate total of 200,000 shares (100,000 of these shares are restricted from transfer
	for a period of one (1) year following the effective date of this registration statement).




	Â 


	In general, Tiber Creek holds interests
	in inactive Delaware corporations which may be used by issuers (such as the Company) to reincorporate their business in the State
	of Delaware and capitalize the issuer at a level and in a manner (i.e. the number of authorized shares and rights and preferences
	of shareholders) that is appropriate for a public company. Otherwise, these corporations are inactive, and Tiber Creek does not
	conduct any business in such corporations.


	Â 




	James Cassidy and James McKillop serve
	as interim officers and directors of these corporations (such as Ruby Island Acquisition Corporation) until such time as the changes
	of control in such corporations are effectuated.




	Â 



	Intellectual Property



	Â 


	At present, the Company does not possess
	any intellectual property protection. The Company may decide in the future to pursue efforts to protect its intellectual property,
	trade secrets and proprietary methods and processes.


	Â 



	Research and Development



	Â 


	The Company has conducted limited
	market research and has initiated development of its web and mobile applications, as discussed throughout this Registration Statement.
	The Company intends to conduct further research and development through development of its business plan.


	Â 



	Employees



	Â 


	Currently, the Company has no employees
	other than its officer who has agreed to assist the Company without pay until the Company is more stable and has recurring cash
	flow from operations.


	Â 



	Property



	Â 


	The Company does not currently own
	any real property. The Company is a party to a lease agreement for occupancy of office space located at 42211 N. 41st Drive, A105,
	Phoenix, AZ 85086.


	Â 



	Subsidiaries



	Â 


	The Company has no subsidiaries.


	Â 



	Jumpstart Our Business Startups
	Act




	Â 



	In April 2012, the Jumpstart Our
	Business Startups Act (âJOBS Actâ) was enacted into law. The JOBS Act provides, among other things:


	Â 


	Exemptions for emerging growth companies
	from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years and provides a new form of financing to small
	companies;


	Â 


	Amendments to certain provisions
	of the federal securities laws to simplify the sale of securities and increase the threshold number of record holders required
	to trigger the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;


	Â 






	Â 



	21



	Â 








	Table of Contents

	Â 




	Â 


	Relaxation of the general solicitation
	and general advertising prohibition for Rule 506 offerings;


	Â 


	Adoption of a new exemption for
	public offerings of securities in amounts not exceeding $50 million; and


	Â 


	Exemption from registration by a
	non-reporting company of offers and sales of securities of up to $1,000,000 that comply with rules to be adopted by the SEC pursuant
	to Section 4(6) of the Securities Act and exemption of such sales from state law registration, documentation or offering requirements.


	Â 


	In general, under the JOBS Act a
	company is an emerging growth company if its initial public offering (âIPOâ) of common equity securities was effected
	after December 8, 2011 and the company had less than $1 billion of total annual gross revenues during its last completed fiscal
	year. A company will no longer qualify as an emerging growth company after the earliest of


	Â 


	(i) the completion of the fiscal
	year in which the company has total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more,


	(ii) the completion of the fiscal
	year of the fifth anniversary of the companyâs IPO;


	(iii) the companyâs issuance
	of more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt in the prior three-year period, or


	(iv) the company becoming a âlarger
	accelerated filerâ as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.



	Â 



	The JOBS Act provides additional
	new guidelines and exemptions for non-reporting companies and for non-public offerings. Those exemptions that impact the Company
	are discussed below.



	Â 




	Financial Disclosure.

	The
	financial disclosure in a registration statement filed by an emerging growth company pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 will
	differ from registration statements filed by other companies as follows:


	Â 


	(i) audited financial statements
	required for only two fiscal years;


	(ii) selected financial data required
	for only the fiscal years that were audited;


	(iii) executive compensation only
	needs to be presented in the limited format now required for smaller reporting companies.


	(A smaller reporting company is
	one with a public float of less than $75 million as of the last day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter)


	Â 


	However, the requirements for financial
	disclosure provided by Regulation S-K promulgated by the Rules and Regulations of the SEC already provide certain of these exemptions
	for smaller reporting companies. The Company is a smaller reporting company. Currently a smaller reporting company is not required
	to file as part of its registration statement selected financial data and only needs audited financial statements for its two most
	current fiscal years and no tabular disclosure of contractual obligations.


	Â 


	The JOBS Act also exempts the Companyâs
	independent registered public accounting firm from complying with any rules adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight
	Board (âPCAOBâ) after the date of the JOBS Actâs enactment, except as otherwise required by SEC rule.


	Â 


	The JOBS Act also exempts an emerging
	growth company from any requirement adopted by the PCAOB for mandatory rotation of the Companyâs accounting firm or for a
	supplemental auditor report about the audit.


	Â 



	Internal Control Attestation.

	The JOBS Act also provides an exemption from the requirement of the Companyâs independent registered public accounting
	firm to file a report on the Companyâs internal control over financial reporting, although management of the Company is still
	required to file its report on the adequacy of the Companyâs internal control over financial reporting.


	Â 


	Section 102(a) of the JOBS Act exempts
	emerging growth companies from the requirements in Â§14A(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for companies with a class
	of securities registered under the 1934 Act to hold shareholder votes for executive compensation and golden parachutes.



	Â 




	Other Items of the JOBS Act.

	The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can communicate with potential investors that are qualified institutional
	buyers or institutions that are accredited to determine interest in a contemplated offering either prior to or after the date of
	filing the respective registration statement. The Act also permits research reports by a broker or dealer about an emerging growth
	company regardless if such report provides sufficient information for an investment decision. In addition the JOBS Act precludes
	the SEC and FINRA from adopting certain restrictive rules or regulations regarding brokers, dealers and potential investors, communications
	with management and distribution of a research reports on the emerging growth company IPO.


	Â 


	Section 106 of the JOBS Act permits
	emerging growth companies to submit 1933 Act registration statements on a confidential basis provided that the registration statement
	and all amendments are publicly filed at least 21 days before the issuer conducts any road show. This is intended to allow the
	emerging growth company to explore the IPO option without disclosing to the market the fact that it is seeking to go public or
	disclosing the information contained in its registration statement until the company is ready to conduct a roadshow.


	Â 



	Election to Opt Out of Transition
	Period.

	Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised
	financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a 1933 Act registration statement declared
	effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial
	accounting standard.


	Â 


	The JOBS Act provides a company
	can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies
	but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of the transition period.

	Reports to Security Holders



	Â 


	In May 2016, the Company (as Ruby
	Island Acquisition Corporation) filed a Form 10-12G general registration of securities pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act
	of 1934 and is a reporting company pursuant such Act and files with the Securities and Exchange Commission quarterly and annual
	reports and management shareholding information. The Company intends to deliver a copy of its annual report to its security holders,
	and will voluntarily send a copy of the annual report, including audited financial statements, to any registered shareholder who
	requests the same.


	Â 


	The Companyâs documents filed
	with the Securities and Exchange Commission may be inspected at the Commissionâs principal office in Washington, D.C. Copies
	of all or any part of the registration statement may be obtained from the Public Reference Section of the Securities and Exchange
	Commission, 100 F Street N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Call the Commission at 1-800-SEC-0330 for further information on the operation
	of the public reference rooms. The Securities and Exchange Commission also maintains a web site at http://www.sec.gov that contains
	reports, proxy statements and information regarding registrants that file electronically with the Commission. All of the Companyâs
	filings may be located under the CIK number 0001672900.


	Â 



	PLAN OF OPERATION




	Â 




	Business Plan




	Â 



	The Company is an early-stage web
	and mobile application company designed to deliver informative products to the common investor in todayâs global markets.
	The Company intends to offer both consumer-facing and investor-facing products. The Company intends to initially offer 12 chart
	applications that will be available for free via Android Google Play Store and iTunes. As popularity of the Companyâs products
	increases and user base grows, the Company then intends to convert its users into advertising revenue. The Company anticipates
	converting users into advertising revenue at a rate of approximately $1.56 per user, based on comparison to lowest valuation social
	media platforms in comparable market space.


	Â 


	In the future, the Company plans
	to raise capital to support its plan of operations. The Company would raise capital and use the proceeds of its offering to hire
	sales and marketing professionals, to retain professionals and hire other key personnel, for purposes of working capital operations,
	executive compensation, and to conduct further market research and for further development of mobile applications and product catalogue.


	Â 



	Potential Revenue



	Â 


	The Company expects to earn potential
	revenue through conversion of its users into digital advertising revenue, at return of a projected $1.56 per user. The Company
	prospects for new users on an ongoing basis and will also seek additional revenue streams as its products gain in popularity, creating
	subsequent demand for fee and subscription based add-on products.



	Â 







	MANAGEMENTâS DISCUSSION
	AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION




	AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS




	Â 



	The Company is a development stage company
	and was incorporated in the State of Delaware in April 2016. As of the periods from inception, through the date of this prospectus,
	the Company did not generate any revenue and incurred minimal expenses and operating losses, as part of its development stage activities.
	The Company has experienced a net loss and accumulated deficit of $75,569, and has accrued $81,600 in total liabilities as of March
	31, 2017.


	Â 


	The Company anticipates that it
	would need substantial working capital over the next 12 months to continue as a going concern and to expand its operations to distribute,
	sell and market products and solutions.


	Â 


	The Companyâs independent
	auditors have expressed substantial doubt as to the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. Unless the Company is
	able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and/or obtain additional financing, there is a substantial doubt as to the
	ability of the company to continue as a going concern.


	Â 



	Overview



	Â 


	The Company is a United States-based
	startup web and mobile application company designed to deliver informative products to the common investor in todayâs global
	markets. The Company intends to offer investors and traders a sophisticated, trustworthy, and individualized way to get actionable
	daily information for the burgeoning self-directed market. Over the past few years, founder David Meyers has developed a unique
	collection of daily information sources that provide systematic and common sense insights for making trades on virtually any market.
	He has become an investment guru to the everyday investor as a go-to expert on CNBC and TheStreet.com, among others. Common Man
	Investor is the resulting platform that is being launched to further this reach and provide a series of digital products for the
	everyday, âCommon Manâ investor.


	Â 


	The Company had a cash balance of $3,254 and $1,468 as
	of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively and as of March 31, 2017 has earned no revenues nor realized any profits.


	Â 


	The Company intends to make an equity
	offering of its common stock for the acquisition and operation expenses. If it cannot raise the required cash, the Company will
	issue additional shares of common stock in lieu of cash.

	Potential Revenue



	Â 


	The main consumer-facing products
	will consist of a series of mobile applications that boil investing down to its most simple elements. The Company will focus its
	offering to 12 chart-types that, in opinion of the Company based on research and expertise of its founder, represent the most sought-after
	charts by its target consumers. The Companyâs proprietary Apps will utilize these charts to create a streamlined, user-friendly
	information source that pushes daily lists and investment advice to subscribers. For example, the Head and Shoulders app shall
	deliver daily reports on the âHead-and-Shouldersâ pattern based on monthly NASDAQ trends. The chart shall then alert
	investors when a securityâs price is set to fall from its peak (the head) or rise from the bottom (shoulders) of a price
	pattern. It is a non-biased, objective way of giving investors the information they need to make informed decisions.


	Â 


	A La Carte Chartâs apps will
	use off-the-shelf information from the NASDAQ and other markets, coupled with historically based investment data. The 12 chart
	apps will be available for free via Android Google Play Store and iTunes. As popularity of the Companyâs products increases
	and user base grows, the Company then intends to convert its users into advertising revenue. The Company anticipates converting
	users into advertising revenue at a rate of approximately $1.56 per user, based on comparison to lowest valuation social media
	platforms in comparable market space.



	Â 




	Alternative Financial Planning



	Â 


	If the Company is not able to generate
	increased revenues and profits and/or successfully raise monies as needed through a private placement or other securities offering
	(including, but not limited to, a primary public offering of securities), the Companyâs founder and President David Meyers
	will loan financing to the Company, as needed, to continue operations until the Company achieves profitability. If the Company
	is unable to generate revenues and profits and/or successfully raise additional funds as needed, the Companyâs ability to
	expand its business plan or strategy over the following two years will be jeopardized.


	Â 



	Equipment Financing



	Â 


	The Company has no existing equipment
	financing arrangements.

	The financial statements of the
	Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of
	these financial statements requires making estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
	and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates are based on historical experience and
	on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of
	making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
	may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.


	Â 



	Development Stage and Capital
	Resources



	Â 


	Since its inception, the Company
	has devoted substantially all of its efforts to business planning. Accordingly, the Company is considered to be in the development
	stage. The Company has not generated revenues from its operations, and there is no assurance of future revenues.


	Â 


	There is no assurance that the Companyâs
	activities will result in any operations or that any operations, if begun, will generate revenues. The Company will need additional
	capital, but there is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain such capital on terms satisfactory to the Company. Accordingly,
	given the Companyâs limited cash and cash equivalents on hand, the Company will be unable to implement its business plans
	and proposed operations unless it obtains additional financing or otherwise is able to generate revenues and profits. The Company
	may raise additional capital through sales of debt or equity, obtain loan financing or develop and consummate other alternative
	financial plans.

	Discussion of the Three Months
	Ending March 31, 2017



	Â 


	The Company did not generate revenues
	during the three months ended March 31, 2017.


	Â 


	The Company posted operating expenses
	of $62,409 during the three months ended March 31, 2017.


	Â 


	Operating loss and net loss for the
	Company were each, respectively, $62,409 and $62,409, for the three months period ended March 31, 2017.


	Â 


	The Company does not anticipate
	that it will generate revenue sufficient to cover its planned operating expenses in the foreseeable future, and the Company must
	obtain additional financing in order to develop and implement its business plan and proposed operations. If the Company is not
	successful in generating sufficient revenues and/or obtaining additional funding to develop its business plan and proposed operations,
	this could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations liquidity and financial condition.


	Â 



	Discussion of the Period from
	April 4, 2016 (inception) through December 31, 2016



	Â 


	The Company
	is in the development phase and as of December 31, 2016. The Company had not generated revenues and had no income or cash flows
	from operations since inception. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had sustained net loss of $13,160 and a working capital deficit
	of $4,132.


	Â 


	The Companyâs
	independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt about the Companyâs ability to continue as a going concern
	and is dependent upon financial support from its stockholders and its ability to obtain necessary equity financing to continue
	operations.


	Â 


	Management will
	pay all expenses incurred by the Company. There is no expectation of repayment for such current expenses.


	Â 


	The sole officer
	and director of the Company is also the majority shareholder of the Company holding 5,000,000 shares of the aggregate 6,799,600
	or 74%.


	Â 


	The Company
	was incorporated on April 4, 2016 under the laws of the State of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including,
	but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions. In May, 2016, the Company registered its common stock on a Form 10 registration
	statement filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 12(g) thereof. The Company files with the Securities and
	Exchange Commission periodic and current reports under Rule 13(a) of the Exchange Act, as a public reporting company.


	Â 


	Pursuant to
	the change in control, the Companyâs primary objective is to provide create its daily âcharts,â delivered through
	12 state-of-the-art apps. Each App will revolve around a specific trading strategy or market trend, such as the Head and Shoulders
	App, Bullish Wedge App, Commodities in Contango App, and Ascending Triangles App, among others. Through nuts-and-bolts data on
	market trends and sound real-world advice, subscribers find practical information they can use in their trading and investing.


	Â 


	2016 Year-End Analysis


	Â 


	The Company
	has received no income, has had no operations nor expenses, other than Delaware state fees and accounting fees as required for
	incorporation and for the preparation of the Companyâs financial statements.

	Â 


	As of March 31, 2017, there was no
	accrued compensation that was due to the Companyâs employees or officers. Upon successful completion by the Company of a
	primary public offering in the future (or the completion of other financing or funding), however, the Company may compensate officers
	and employees as is discussed below in âAnticipated Officer and Director Remuneration.â


	Â 


	Each of the officers has received
	certain shares of common stock in the Company in connection with the change of control of the Company. Accordingly, the Company
	has not recorded any compensation expense in respect of any shares issued to the officers as such shares do not represent compensation
	that was paid to any officer.


	Â 


	There are no current plans to pay
	or distribute any cash or non-cash bonus compensation to officers of the Company, until such time as the Company is profitable,
	experiences positive cash flow or obtains additional financing. However, the Board of Directors may allocate salaries and benefits
	to the officers in its sole discretion. No officer is subject to a compensation plan or arrangement that results from his or her
	resignation, retirement, or any other termination of employment with the Company or from a change in control of the company or
	a change in his or her responsibilities following a change in control. The members of the Board of Directors may receive, if the
	Board so decides, a fixed fee and reimbursement of expenses, for attendance at each regular or special meeting of the Board, although
	no such program has been adopted to date. The Company currently has no retirement, pension, or profit-sharing plan covering its
	officers and directors; however, the Company plans to implement certain such benefits after sufficient funds are realized or raised
	by the Company (see âAnticipated Officer and Director Remunerationâ below.)



	Â 




	Employment Agreements




	Â 



	The Company has not entered into
	employment agreements with any of its employees.


	Â 



	Anticipated Officer and Director
	Remuneration



	Â 


	The Company pays no compensation
	to its officers or directors at present. The Company intends to pay regular, competitive annual salaries to all its officers and
	directors and will pay an annual stipend to its directors when, and if, it completes a primary public offering for the sale of
	securities and/or the Company reaches greater profitability, experiences larger and more sustained positive cash flow and/or obtains
	additional funding. At such time, the Company anticipates offering additional cash and non-cash compensation to officers and directors.
	In addition, the Company anticipates that its officers and directors will be provided with additional fringe benefits and perquisites
	at subsidizes rates, or at the sole expense of the Company, as may be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Company in its
	sole discretion. In addition, the Company may plan to offer retirement benefits at a later time in its sole discretion.

	SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE



	Â 


	As of the
	date of this prospectus, there are 6,799,600 shares of common stock outstanding of which 5,000,000 shares are owned by officers
	and directors of the Company. There will be a total of 6,799,600 shares outstanding if the maximum number of Shares offered herein
	is sold, of which 5,000,000 would be owned by officers and directors of the Company.


	Â 


	The shares of
	common stock held by current shareholders are considered ârestricted securitiesâ subject to the limitations of Rule
	144 under the Securities Act. In general, securities may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 after being fully-paid and held for more
	than 12 months. While affiliates of the Company are subject to certain limits in the amount of restricted securities they can sell
	under Rule 144, there are no such limitations on sales by persons who are not affiliates of the Company. In the event non-affiliated
	holders elect to sell such shares in the public market, there is likely to be a negative effect on the market price of the Companyâs
	securities.


	Â 


	However, at present, due to the
	Companyâs previous status as a shell company, shareholders cannot currently rely upon Rule 144 for resales of the Companyâs
	securities (pursuant to Rule 144(i)).


	Â 


	Rule 144 establishes specific criteria
	for determining whether a person is not engaged in a distribution of securities. Among other things, Rule 144 creates a safe harbor
	whereby a person satisfying the applicable conditions of the Rule 144 safe harbor is deemed not to be engaged in a distribution
	of the securities and therefore not an underwriter of the securities. If a purchaser of securities is unable to rely upon Rule
	144 to sell securities (due to Rule 144(i)), then the securities must be registered or another exemption from registration must
	be found in order for the distribution of securities to be made. In the event that the securities are not registered or another
	exemption is not found, a purchaser of securities cannot sell or transfer the shares of common stock in the Company since the Company
	does not meet the requirements of Rule 144(i)(2).


	Â 


	Pursuant to Rule 144(i), reliance
	upon Rule 144 is typically available for the resale of restricted or unrestricted securities that were initially issued by a reporting
	or non-reporting shell company (or an issuer that has been at any time previously a reporting or non-reporting shell company) only
	if the following conditions are met:


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	The issuer of the securities that was formerly a reporting or non-reporting shell company has ceased to be a shell company;





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	The issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	The issuer of the securities has filed all reports and material required to be filed under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than Form 8-K reports; and





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	At least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed current Form 10 type information with the Commission reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company.






	Â 







	LEGAL MATTERS



	Â 


	Cassidy & Associates, Beverly
	Hills, California (âCassidy & Associatesâ), has given its opinion as attorneys-at-law regarding the validity of
	the issuance of the Shares offered by the Company. A member of the law firm of Cassidy & Associates is an officer and director
	of Tiber Creek Corporation.


	Â 



	Interest of Counsel




	Â 



	Cassidy & Associates has given
	an opinion upon the validity of the securities being registered and upon other legal matters in connection with the registration
	or offering of such securities. James Cassidy, a partner of Cassidy & Associates, was a director and officer of Ruby Island
	Acquisition Corporation prior to its change of control and is a selling shareholder herein.

	DISCLOSURE OF COMMISSION POSITION
	ON INDEMNIFICATION




	FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES



	Â 


	The Companyâs certificate
	of incorporation includes an indemnification provision that provides that the Company shall indemnify directors against monetary
	damages to the Company or any of its shareholders or others by reason of a breach of the directorâs fiduciary duty or otherwise,
	except under certain limited circumstances.


	Â 


	The certificate of incorporation
	does not specifically indemnify the officers or directors or controlling persons against liability under the Securities Act. However,
	the indemnification provided in the certificate of incorporation is broad and should be considered to be of a broad scope and wide
	extent.


	Â 


	The Securities and Exchange Commissionâs
	position on indemnification of officers, directors and control persons under the Securities Act by the Company is as follows:


	Â 



	INSOFAR AS INDEMNIFICATION FOR
	LIABILITIES ARISING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 MAY BE PERMITTED TO DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND CONTROLLING PERSONS OF THE SMALL
	BUSINESS ISSUER PURSUANT TO THE RULES OF THE COMMISSION, OR OTHERWISE, THE SMALL BUSINESS ISSUER HAS BEEN ADVISED THAT IN THE OPINION
	OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION SUCH INDEMNIFICATION IS AGAINST PUBLIC POLICY AS EXPRESSED IN THE ACT AND IS, THEREFORE,
	UNENFORCEABLE.

	REPORT
	OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM








	Â 



	To
	the Board of Directors and Stockholders




	A
	La Carte Charts Corporation




	Â 



	We have audited the balance sheet
	of A La Carte Charts Corporation (formerly known as Ruby Island Acquisition Corporation, the âCompanyâ) as of December
	31, 2016, and the related statements of operations, stockholdersâ equity (deficit), and cash flows from April 4, 2016 (Inception
	Date) to December 31, 2016. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companyâs management. Our responsibility
	is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.



	Â 




	We
	conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
	require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
	misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
	reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures
	that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companyâs
	internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test
	basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
	significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
	our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.




	Â 



	In our opinion, the financial
	statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31,
	2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows from April 4, 2016 (Inception Date) to December 31, 2016, in conformity
	with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.



	Â 




	The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
	1 to the financial statements, the Company has experienced liquidity issues, including a working capital deficit. The Company
	has not generated sufficient cash flow to repay its current and future obligations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about
	the Companyâs ability to continue as a going concern. Further information and managementâs plans in regard to this uncertainty
	are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
	uncertainty.

	Notes

	Â 





	NOTE
	1 â NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND GOING CONCERN





	Â 




	As
	used herein and except as otherwise noted, the term âCompanyâ, âit(s)â, âourâ, âusâ,
	âweâ and âA La Carteâ shall mean A La Carte Charts Corporation, a Delaware corporation.Â 




	Â 




	A
	La Carte Charts Corporation, formerly known as Ruby Island Acquisition Corporation, incorporated on April 4, 2016 under the laws
	of the state of Delaware, A La Carte Charts Corporation (the âCompanyâ or âALCCâ), a United States-based startup
	web and mobile application company designed to deliver informative products to the common investor in todayâs global markets and
	offer investors and traders a sophisticated, trustworthy, and individualized way to get actionable daily information for the burgeoning
	self-directed market. In May 2016, the Company filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form
	10 by which it became a public reporting company. The main products of the Company are its daily âcharts,â delivered
	through 12 state-of-the-art apps. Apps will each revolve around a specific trading strategy or market trend, such as the Head
	and Shoulders App, Bullish Wedge App, Commodities in Contango App, and Ascending Triangles App, among others. Through nuts-and-bolts
	data on market trends and sound real-world advice, subscribers find practical information they can use in their trading and investing.




	Â 




	On
	December 13, 2016, the Company implemented a change of control by redeeming shares of existing shareholders, issuing shares to
	new shareholders, electing new officers and directors and accepting the resignations of its then existing officers and directors.
	In connection with the change of control, the shareholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the
	change of the Companyâs name from Ruby Island Acquisition Corporation to A La Carte Charts Corporation.




	Â 






	Going
	Concern






	The
	Companyâs financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America
	applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal
	course of business. The Company has not yet generated any revenue and has sustained operating losses since April 4, 2016 (Inception
	Date) to date and allow it to continue as a going concern. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon
	the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary financing to continue operations,
	and the attainment of profitable operations. The Company incurred a net loss of $13,160 from Inception Date to the year ended
	December 31, 2016, used net cash in operating activities of $52, has a working capital deficit of $4,132, and has an accumulated
	deficit of $13,160 as of December 31, 2016. These factors, among others raise a substantial doubt regarding the Companyâs
	ability to continue as a going concern. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.
	The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the recoverability and classification of recorded
	asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

	NOTE
	2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





	Â 




	The
	following summary of significant accounting policies of the Company is presented to assist in the understanding of the Companyâs
	financial statements. The financial statements and notes are the representation of the Companyâs management who is responsible
	for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United
	States of America (âGAAPâ) in all material respects, and have been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying
	financial statements. Â 




	Â 






	Use
	of Estimates






	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	(U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
	disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
	expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the valuation of accounts
	and factored receivables, valuation of long-lived assets, accrued liabilities, note payable and deferred income tax asset valuation
	allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors
	that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
	carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources.
	The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Companyâs estimates. To the extent
	there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.




	Â 






	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents






	The
	Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents.
	The Company had a cash balance of $1,468 as of December 31, 2016.




	Â 






	Concentration
	of Risk






	Financial
	instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places
	its cash with high quality banking institutions. The Company does not have the cash balances in excess of the Federal Deposit
	Insurance Corporation limit at December 31, 2016.





	Â 







	Income
	Taxes






	The
	Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, â

	Income Taxesâ

	.
	The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences
	of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax
	credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. The Company
	records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.

	Â 




	The
	Company follows the provisions of ASC 740-10, â

	Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions

	.â When tax returns
	are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while
	others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately
	sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements
	in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position
	will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are
	not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured
	as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable
	taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described
	above should be reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets along with
	any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.Â 




	Â 






	Earnings
	(Loss) Per Common Share






	The
	Company computes net earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, â

	Earnings per Shareâ

	. ASC 260 requires
	presentation of both basic and diluted net earnings per share (âEPSâ) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS
	is computed by dividing earnings (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares
	outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during
	the period using the treasury stock method and convertible note and preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing
	diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the
	exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. At
	December 31, 2016, there were no convertible notes, options or warrants available for conversion that if exercised, may dilute
	future earnings per share.




	Â 






	Fair
	value of Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements






	ASC
	820,Â â

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosuresâ,

	requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs
	and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the
	level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrumentâs categorization
	within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC
	820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:





	Â 






	Level
	1





	Level
	1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

	December
	31, 2016






	Â 






	Level
	2





	Level
	2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability
	such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in
	markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant
	inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. If the asset or liability
	has a specified (contractual) term, the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.




	Â 





	Level
	3





	Level
	3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to
	the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.




	Â 




	The
	Companyâs financial instruments consist principally of cash, accrued liabilities and payable to related party. Pursuant
	to ASC 820,Â â

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosuresâ

	Â and ASC 825,Â â

	Financial Instrumentsâ

	,
	the fair value of our cash equivalents is determined based on âLevel 1â inputs, which consist of quoted prices in
	active markets for identical assets. The Company believes that the recorded values of all the other financial instruments approximate
	their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations.




	Â 






	Recent
	Accounting Pronouncements






	In
	November 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-18, â

	Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted
	Cashâ (âASU 2016-18â)

	. The new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice by adding or clarifying
	guidance on classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 is effective
	for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this update should
	be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-18 noting
	it will only impact the Company to the extent it has restricted cash in the future.




	Â 




	In
	August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, â

	Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
	and Cash Payments

	â (âASU 2016-15â). ASU 2016-15 will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and
	cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning
	after December 15, 2017. The new standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply,
	in which case it would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently
	in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-15 on its financial statements.

	In
	June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (âASUâ) 2016-13, â

	Financial Instruments - Credit Losses

	(Topic 326).â The new standard amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and
	available-for-sale debt securities. This ASU is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December
	15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine
	the impact it may have on its financial statements.



	Â 



	In
	2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, â

	Income Taxesâ

	(Topic 740):

	Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred
	Taxes

	, which requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet.
	Current US GAAP requires an entity to separate deferred tax assets and liabilities into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified
	balance sheet. For public entities, ASU 2015-17 is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after
	December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. For all other entities, ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual
	reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018,
	and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively, with early application permitted for financial statements that have
	not been previously issued. The Company has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this standard on the Companyâs
	financial position and results of operations.



	Â 



	In
	August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, â

	Presentation of Financial StatementsâGoing Concern

	(Subtopic
	205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entityâs Ability to Continue as a Going Concernâ. This standard is intended
	to define managementâs responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organizationâs ability
	to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. Under U.S. GAAP, financial statements are prepared
	under the presumption that the reporting organization will continue to operate as a going concern, except in limited circumstances.
	Financial reporting under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern
	basis of accounting is critical to financial reporting because it establishes the fundamental basis for measuring and classifying
	assets and liabilities. Currently, U.S. GAAP lacks guidance about managementâs responsibility to evaluate whether there
	is substantial doubt about the organizationâs ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures.
	This ASU provides guidance to an organizationâs management, with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce
	diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement
	footnotes. The amendments are effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods
	beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial
	statements have not previously been issued. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard.

	litigation and other matters. The Company expenses these costs as the related services are received.




	Â 




	If
	a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonable estimated, the Company recognizes an expense for the estimated
	loss. If the Company has the potential to recover a portion of the estimated loss from a third party, the Company makes a separate
	assessment of recoverability and reduces the estimated loss if recovery is also deemed probable.

	NOTE
	6 â STOCKHOLDERSâ EQUITY






	Â 





	The
	Companyâs capitalization at December 31, 2016 was 100,000,000 authorized common shares with a par value of $0.0001 per share,

	On December 28, 2016, the Company entered
	into a contract with two professional athletes and issued to each of them, 339,800 shares of common stock representing 5% (five
	percent) of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock, in exchange for granting the Company license to use their
	name and likeness in association with the promotional use of the Companyâs business activities and marketing of its products.
	The Company has issued to these two athletes a total of 679,600 shares of common stock at $6,796, or $0.01 per share on the date

	December
	31, 2016





	Â 




	At
	December 31, 2016, the Company had net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $13,160 resulting in deferred tax assets
	recorded of $5,230, which begin to expire in 2034. The Company has recorded a 100% valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets
	due to the uncertainty of its realization. The net change in the valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2016 was
	an increase of $5,230.




	Â 




	In
	the normal course of business, the Companyâs income tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities.
	Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessment by these taxing authorities. Accordingly, the Company believes
	that it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefits of tax positions it has taken in its tax returns or for the
	amount of any tax benefit that exceeds the cumulative probability threshold in accordance with FASB ASC 740-10-15. Differences
	between the estimated and actual amounts determined upon ultimate resolution, individually or in the aggregate, are not expected
	to have a material adverse effect on the companyâs financial position. The Company believes its tax positions are all highly
	certain of being upheld upon examination. As such, the Company has not recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits. As
	of December 31, 2016, tax year 2016 remains open for IRS audit. The Company has received no notice of audit from the Internal
	Revenue Service for any of the open tax years.

	Management
	has evaluated subsequent events through April 17, 2017, the date the financial statements were available to be issued, noting
	no items that would impact the accounting for events or transactions in the current period or require additional disclosure.

	Notes

	(Unaudited)





	Â 





	NOTE
	1 â NATURE OF OPERATIONS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND GOING CONCERN





	Â 




	As
	used herein and except as otherwise noted, the term âCompanyâ, âit(s)â, âourâ, âusâ,
	âweâ, âALCCâ and âA La Carteâ shall mean A La Carte Charts Corporation, a Delaware corporation.




	Â 




	A
	La Carte Charts Corporation, formerly known as Ruby Island Acquisition Corporation, was incorporated on April 4, 2016 under the
	laws of the state of Delaware. A La Carte Charts, a United States-based startup web and mobile application company was designed
	to deliver informative products to the common investor in todayâs global markets and offer investors and traders a sophisticated,
	trustworthy, and individualized way to get actionable daily information for the burgeoning self-directed market. In May 2016,
	the Company filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10 by which it became a public
	reporting company. The main products of the Company are its daily âcharts,â delivered through 12 state-of-the-art
	apps. Apps will each revolve around a specific trading strategy or market trend, such as the Head and Shoulders App, Bullish Wedge
	App, Commodities in Contango App, and Ascending Triangles App, among others. Through nuts-and-bolts data on market trends and
	sound real-world advice, subscribers find practical information they can use in their trading and investing.




	Â 




	On
	December 13, 2016, the Company implemented a change of control by redeeming shares of existing shareholders, issuing shares to
	new shareholders, electing new officers and directors and accepting the resignations of its then existing officers and directors.
	In connection with the change of control, the shareholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the
	change of the Companyâs name from Ruby Island Acquisition Corporation to A La Carte Charts Corporation.




	Â 






	Basis
	of Presentation






	The
	accompanying interim condensed financial statements are unaudited, but in the opinion of management of the Company, contain all
	adjustments, which include normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position at March 31, 2017,
	and the results of operations and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The balance sheet as of December 31, 2016
	is derived from the Companyâs audited financial statements.




	Â 




	Certain
	information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally
	accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
	Commission, although management of the Company believes that the disclosures contained in these interim condensed financial
	statements are adequate to make the information presented therein not misleading. For further information, refer to the financial
	statements and the notes thereto contained in the Companyâs 2016 Annual Report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
	on Form 10-K on April 17, 2017.




	Â 






	Going
	Concern





	The Companyâs financial statements
	are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which
	contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not
	yet generated any revenue and has sustained operating losses since April 4, 2016 (Inception Date) to date and allow it to continue
	as a going concern. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from
	its shareholders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary financing to continue operations, and the attainment of profitable
	operations. The Company incurred a net loss of $62,409 from January 1, 2017 to March 31, 2017, used net cash in operating activities
	of $69,426, has a working capital deficit of $78,346, and has an accumulated deficit of $75,569 as of March 31, 2017. These factors,
	among others raise a substantial doubt regarding the Companyâs ability to continue as a going concern. If the Company is
	unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include
	any adjustments to reflect the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that
	might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.






	Â 






	NOTE
	2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





	Â 




	The
	following summary of significant accounting policies of the Company is presented to assist in the understanding of the Companyâs
	financial statements. The financial statements and notes are the representation of the Companyâs management who is responsible
	for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United
	States of America (âGAAPâ) in all material respects, and have been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying
	financial statements.




	Â 






	Use
	of Estimates






	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	(U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
	disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
	expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the valuation of accounts
	and factored receivables, valuation of long-lived assets, accrued liabilities, note payable and deferred income tax asset valuation
	allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors
	that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
	carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources.
	The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Companyâs estimates. To the extent
	there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.

	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents






	The
	Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents.
	The Company had a cash balance of $3,254 and $1,468 as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.




	Â 






	Concentration
	of Risk






	Financial
	instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places
	its cash with high quality banking institutions. The Company does not have the cash balances in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance
	Corporation limit at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.





	Â 







	Income
	Taxes






	The
	Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, â

	Income Taxesâ

	.
	The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences
	of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax
	credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. The Company
	records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.




	Â 



	The Company follows the provisions of
	ASC 740-10, â

	Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions

	.â When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain
	that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty
	about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the
	guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based
	on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination,
	including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other
	positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit
	that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the
	benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability
	for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying condensed balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that
	would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.





	Â 






	Earnings
	(Loss) Per Common Share






	The
	Company computes net earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, â

	Earnings per Shareâ

	. ASC 260 requires
	presentation of both basic and diluted net earnings per share (âEPSâ) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS
	is computed by dividing earnings (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares
	outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during
	the period using the treasury stock method and convertible note and preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing
	diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the
	exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. At
	March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, there were no convertible notes, options or warrants available for conversion that if exercised,
	may dilute future earnings per share.




	Â 






	Fair
	value of Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements






	ASC
	820,Â â

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosuresâ,

	requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs
	and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the
	level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrumentâs categorization
	within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC
	820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:





	Â 






	Level
	1





	Level
	1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

	Level
	2





	Level
	2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability
	such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in
	markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant
	inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. If the asset or liability
	has a specified (contractual) term, the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.




	Â 





	Level
	3





	Level
	3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to
	the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.




	Â 




	The
	Companyâs financial instruments consist principally of cash, prepaid deposits, accrued liabilities and payable to related
	party. Pursuant to ASC 820,Â â

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

	âÂ and ASC 825,Â â

	Financial
	Instruments

	â, the fair value of our cash equivalents is determined based on âLevel 1â inputs, which consist
	of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The Company believes that the recorded values of all the other financial
	instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations.

	Recent
	Accounting Pronouncements






	In
	November 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-18, â

	Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted
	Cashâ (âASU 2016-18â)

	. The new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice by adding or clarifying
	guidance on classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 is effective
	for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this update should
	be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-18 noting
	it will only impact the Company to the extent it has restricted cash in the future.




	Â 




	In
	August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, â

	Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
	and Cash Payments

	â (âASU 2016-15â). ASU 2016-15 will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and
	cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning
	after December 15, 2017. The new standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply,
	in which case it would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently
	in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-15 on its financial statements.




	Â 




	In
	June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (âASUâ) 2016-13, â

	Financial Instruments - Credit Losses

	(Topic 326).â The new standard amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and
	available-for-sale debt securities. This ASU is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December
	15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine
	the impact it may have on its financial statements.




	Â 




	In
	2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, â

	Income Taxesâ

	(Topic 740):

	Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred
	Taxes

	, which requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet.
	Current US GAAP requires an entity to separate deferred tax assets and liabilities into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified
	balance sheet. For public entities, ASU 2015-17 is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after
	December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. For all other entities, ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual
	reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018,
	and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively, with early application permitted for financial statements that have
	not been previously issued. The Company has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this standard on the Companyâs
	financial position and results of operations.

	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
	2014-15, â

	Presentation of Financial StatementsâGoing Concern

	(Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties
	about an Entityâs Ability to Continue as a Going Concernâ. This standard is intended to define managementâs responsibility
	to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organizationâs ability to continue as a going concern and to provide
	related footnote disclosures. Under U.S. GAAP, financial statements are prepared under the presumption that the reporting organization
	will continue to operate as a going concern, except in limited circumstances. Financial reporting under this presumption is commonly
	referred to as the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis of accounting is critical to financial reporting
	because it establishes the fundamental basis for measuring and classifying assets and liabilities. Currently, U.S. GAAP lacks guidance
	about managementâs responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the organizationâs ability to
	continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. This ASU provides guidance to an organizationâs management,
	with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly
	provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes. The amendments are effective for annual periods ending after
	December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted
	for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued. Management believes
	that the impact of this ASU to the Companyâs financial statements would be insignificant.

	loss. If the Company has the potential to recover a portion of the estimated loss from a third party, the Company makes a separate
	assessment of recoverability and reduces the estimated loss if recovery is also deemed probable.

	Item
	14. Indemnification of Directors and Officers





	Â 




	The
	Companyâs Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws and other contracts provide for indemnification of its officers, directors,
	agents, fiduciaries and employees. These provisions allow the Company to pay for the expenses of these persons in connection with
	legal proceedings brought because of the personâs position with the Company, if the person is not ultimately adjudged liable
	to the Company for misconduct in the action. Generally, no indemnification may be made where the person has been determined to
	have intentionally, fraudulently or knowingly violated the law.




	Â 




	The
	Company does not believe that such indemnification affects the capacity of such person acting as officer, director or control
	person of the Company.





	Â

	Â 



	Pursuant
	to Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933 (as amended and updated from time to time)




	Â 




	The
	undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:




	Â 




	(1)
	To file, during any period in which it offers or sales securities, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement;




	Â 




	i.
	To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;




	Â 




	ii.
	To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events which, individually or together, represent a fundamental change in the information
	in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the
	total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) any deviation from the low or high end of
	the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)
	if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price
	set forth in the âCalculation of Registration Feeâ table in the effective registration statement; and

	II-

	Â 








	Table of Contents

	Â 









	Â 




	iii.
	To include any additional material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration
	statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement.




	Â 




	(2)
	That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post effective amendment shall
	be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of the securities at
	that time to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.




	Â 




	(3)
	To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment, any of the securities that remain unsold at the termination
	of the offering.




	Â 




	(4)
	That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of
	securities:




	Â 




	Each
	prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to this offering, other than registration
	statements relying on Rule 403B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included
	in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in
	a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed
	incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to
	a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration
	statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date
	of first use.




	Â 




	(5)
	That for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of
	securities:




	Â 




	The
	undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration
	statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or
	sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser
	and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser.:




	Â 




	i.
	Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to this offering required to be filed pursuant
	to Rule 424;




	Â 




	ii.
	Any free writing prospectus relating to this offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred
	to by the undersigned registrant;




	Â 




	iii.
	The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned
	registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and




	Â 




	iv.
	Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.




	Â 




	Undertaking
	Request for acceleration of effective date or filing of registration statement becoming effective upon filing.




	Â 




	The
	undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:




	Â 




	Insofar
	as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons
	of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the
	Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.
	In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred
	or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding)
	is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant
	will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate
	jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed
	by the final adjudication of such issue.

	(2) any person who serves
	or served at the Corporationâs request as a director, officer, agent, employee, partner or trustee of another corporation or of
	a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise.



	Â 




	B.
	Extent--

	Derivative Suits

	.

	In case of a suit by
	or in the right of the Corporation against a person named in Paragraph (A) by reason of his holding a position named in Paragraph
	(A), the Corporation shall indemnify him, if he satisfies the standard in Paragraph (C), for expenses (including attorneyâs
	fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense

	-

	or settlement of the suit.





	Â 




	C.

	Standard--Derivative Suits

	. In case of a suit by or in the right of the Corporation,
	a person named in Paragraph (A) shall be indemnified only if:




	Â 




	(1)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â he
	is successful on the merits or otherwise, or




	Â 




	(2)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â he
	acted in good faith in the transaction which is the subject of the suit, and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not
	opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation. However, he shall not be indemnified in respect of any claim, issue or matter
	as to which he has been adjudged liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his duty to the Corporation unless
	(and only to the extent that) the court in which the suit was brought shall determine, upon application, that despite the adjudication
	but in view of all the circumstances, he is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as the court shall deem
	proper.




	Â 




	D.

	Extent--Nonderivative Suits

	. In case of a suit, action or proceeding (whether civil,
	criminal, administrative or investigative), other than a suit by or in the right of the Corporation against a person named in
	Paragraph (A) by reason of his holding a position named in Paragraph (A), the Corporation shall indemnify him, if he satisfies
	the standard in Paragraph (E), for amounts actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement

	Â 




	(1)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â expenses

	and




	(4)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â fines.




	Â 




	E.
	Standard--Nonderivative Suits.

	In case of a nonderivative suit, a person named in Paragraph
	(A) shall be indemnified only if:





	Â 




	(1)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â he
	is successful on the merits or otherwise, or




	Â 




	(2)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â he
	acted in good faith in the transaction which is the subject of the nonderivative suit, and in a manner he reasonably believed
	to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation and , with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, he
	had no reason to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of a nonderivative suit by judgement, order, settlement, conviction,
	or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person failed to satisfy
	this Paragraph (E) (2).

	giving of notice may be required by law. Notice of a special meeting shall also state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting
	is called and shall indicate that it is being issued by, or at the direction of, the person or persons calling the meeting. If,
	at any meeting, action is proposed to be taken that would, if taken, entitle stockholders to receive payment for their stock,
	the notice of such meeting shall include a statement of that purpose and to that effect. If mailed, notice shall be deemed to
	be delivered when deposited in the United States mail or with any private express mail service, postage or delivery fee prepaid,

	date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon which the resolution
	fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors, the record

	meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporationâs registered office shall be by hand or by certified or
	registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the
	Board of Directors is required by law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in
	writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking
	such prior action.

	allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of
	stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not
	precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty
	days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall

	be received and be taken in charge. All questions touching on the qualification of voters and the validity of proxies and the
	acceptance or rejection of votes, shall be decided by one or more inspectors. Such inspectors shall be appointed by the Board
	of Directors before or at the meeting, or, if no such appointment shall have been made, then by the presiding officer at the meeting.
	If for any reason any of the inspectors previously appointed shall fail to attend or refuse or be unable to serve, inspectors
	in place of any so failing to attend or refusing or unable to serve shall be appointed in like manner.

	Section
	1.6. Quorum.

	person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum of the stockholders for all purposes, unless the representation of a larger number
	shall be required by law, and, in that case, the representation of the number so required shall constitute a quorum.





	Â 





	If
	the holders of the amount of stock necessary to constitute a quorum shall fail to attend in person or by proxy at the time and
	place fixed in accordance with these By-Laws for an annual or special meeting, a majority in interest of the stockholders present
	in person or by proxy may adjourn, from time to time, without notice other than by announcement at the meeting, until holders
	of the amount of stock requisite to constitute a quorum shall attend. At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be
	present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.

	provided, however, that the Board of Directors or executive committee may appoint any stockholder to act as chairman of any meeting
	in the absence of the chairman of the Board. The secretary of the Corporation shall act as secretary at all meetings of the stockholders,
	but in the absence of the secretary at any meeting of the stockholders, the presiding officer may appoint any person to act as

	1.8. Stockholder Proposals.

	No proposal by a stockholder shall be presented for vote at a special or annual meeting of stockholders
	unless such stockholder shall, not later than the close of business on the fifth day following the date on which notice of the
	meeting is first given to stockholders, provide the Board of Directors or the secretary of the Corporation with written notice
	of intention to present a proposal for action at the forthcoming meeting of stockholders, which notice shall include the name
	and address of such stockholder, the number of voting securities that he holds of record and that he holds beneficially, the text
	of the proposal to be presented to the meeting and a statement in support of the proposal.





	Â 





	Any
	stockholder who was a stockholder of record on the applicable record date may make any other proposal at an annual meeting or
	special meeting of stockholders and the same may be discussed and considered, but unless stated in writing and filed with the
	Board of Directors or the secretary prior to the date set forth herein above, such proposal shall be laid over for action at an
	adjourned, special, or annual meeting of the stockholders taking place sixty days or more thereafter. This provision shall not
	prevent the consideration and approval or disapproval at the annual meeting of reports of officers, directors, and committees,
	but in connection with such reports, no new business proposed by a stockholder,

	qua

	stockholder, shall be acted upon at
	such annual meeting unless stated and filed as herein provided.




	Â 




	Notwithstanding
	any other provision of these By-Laws, the Corporation shall be under no obligation to include any stockholder proposal in its
	proxy statement materials or otherwise present any such proposal to stockholders at a special or annual meeting of stockholders
	if the Board of Directors reasonably believes the proponents thereof have not complied with Sections 13 or 14 of the Securities
	Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder; nor shall the Corporation be required to include any
	stockholder proposal not required to be included in its proxy materials to stockholders in accordance with any such section, rule
	or regulation.




	Â 





	Section
	1.9. Proxies.

	At all meetings of stockholders, a stockholder entitled to vote may vote either in person or by proxy executed
	in writing by the stockholder or by his duly authorized attorney-in-fact. Such proxy shall be filed with the secretary before
	or at the time of the meeting. No proxy shall be valid after eleven months from the date of its execution, unless otherwise provided
	in the proxy.

	Â 






	Section
	1.13. Voting of Stock of Certain Holders.

	Shares of capital stock of the Corporation standing in the name of another corporation,
	domestic or foreign, may be voted by such officer, agent, or proxy as the by-laws of such corporation may prescribe, or in the
	absence of such provision, as the board of directors of such corporation may determine

	Shares
	of capital stock of the Corporation standing in the name of a deceased person, a minor ward or an incompetent person may be voted
	by his administrator, executor, court-appointed guardian or conservator, either in person or by proxy, without a transfer of such

	of capital stock of the Corporation standing in the name of a receiver may be voted, either in person or by proxy, by such receiver,

	if authority to do so is contained in any appropriate order of the court by which such receiver was appointed.




	Â 




	A
	stockholder whose stock is pledged shall be entitled to vote such stock, either in person or by proxy, until the stock has been
	transferred into the name of the pledgee, and thereafter the pledgee shall be entitled to vote, either in person or by proxy,
	the stock so transferred.




	Â 




	Shares
	of its own capital stock belonging to this Corporation shall not be voted, directly or indirectly, at any meeting and shall not
	be counted in determining the total number of outstanding stock at any given time, but shares of its own stock held by it in a
	fiduciary capacity may be voted and shall be counted in determining the total number of outstanding stock at any given time.

	these By-Laws, all of the powers of the Corporation shall be vested in the Board.




	Â 





	Section
	2.2. Number of Directors.

	The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board shall be not fewer than one nor more
	than five. Within the limits above specified, the number of directors shall be determined by the Board of Directors pursuant to

	meeting at which such removal occurs provided that the holders of not less than a majority of the outstanding capital stock of
	the Corporation (assessed upon the basis of votes and not on the basis of number of shares) entitled to vote for the election
	of directors, voting together as a single class, shall vote for each replacement director. All directors elected to fill vacancies

	Understandings
	of Davld Meyers AS a Reporting Company.






	Â 




	6.1.

	securities in the Reporting Company acquired or to be acquired by Tiber Creek or its affiliates under this agreement and (ii)

	or

	8.




	Actions
	and Understandings folwwing the Business Combination.






	Â 




	8.1.
	David Meyers understands the obligations and responsibilities that will arise in regard to its becoming a reporting
	company and the trading of its securities in the public market. David Meyers understands that in order to achieve the
	greatest market interest in its securities it, its officers and its directors, all or some, will be required to continuously
	interact with the financial community. This interaction will include, without limitation, timely filing of reports under the
	Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including audited financial statements; annual reports to shareholders and shareholder
	meetings; issuing periodic press releases; and mee6ngs and discussions with existing and prospective brokers, market makers,
	investment bankers and institutions.




	Â 




	8.2.
	David Meyers understands that the completion of the Transactions will not, in itself, result in capital investment in the
	Reporting Company. The public status of the Reporting Company and its introduction to market makers and others in the
	financial community may result in investment interest. However, investment interest will depend upon the success of the
	Reporting Company, market conditions and other factors over which neither Tiber Creek nor its affiliates have any
	control.




	Â 




	8.3.
	David Meyers understands that the ultimate judgement of the financial community of the investment merits of the Reporting
	Company will depend upon the Reporting Companyâs ability to successfully carry out its business plans and operations,
	to operate at a profit and similar business considerations. David Meyers represents in good faith that it currently has no
	reason to believe that it will not be able to complete the Transactions and to achieve its business objectives.




	Â 




	8.4.
	David Meyers understands that the first trading in the Reporting Companyâs securities may be limited, and that to
	increase the amount, depth and market price of its securities will require both time and effort by the Reporting Company to
	develop relations with market makers and to create strong and stable trading of the Reporting Companyâs
	securities.




	Â 






	9.




	Compliance
	with Securities Law.






	Â 




	Under
	the securities laws:




	Â 




	9.1.
	The Reporting Company and its affiliates will need to furnish all information and documents concerning it and its affiliates
	required for the preparation and filing of the Registration Statement by the Reporting Company which information must be
	complete and accurate and not contain any material misstatement or omit any material information.




	Â 




	9.2.
	The Reporting Company must at all times observe and comply with Federal and state securities laws, rules and regulations incident
	to the issuance and trading of its securities and must take all steps reasonably required within its control to prohibit any persons,
	whether or not affiliated with the Reporting Company, from engaging in any transactions in contravention of such laws, rules and
	regulations.

	Â 




	Â 




	9.3.Â Â 
	David Meyers and its affiliates must not at any time knowingly engage in any activity which would constitute a prohibited market
	manipulation of the securities of the Reporting Company and will need to take all steps reasonably required within its control
	to prohibit any officer, director, other affiliate, agent or employee from engaging in such conduct.




	Â 




	9.4.
	The Reporting Company should not issue any securities to any person for the promotion or maintenance of a trading market in the
	Reporting Companyâs securities without first receiving an opinion of qualified counsel that such issuance will be in accord with
	securities laws, rules and regulations and should not, directly or indirectly, receive from such persons any capital by loan,
	investment or otherwise resulting from the sale or pledge of such securities.

	NOTICES.

	completion of this offering or that, if a market does develop, it will be sustained. The offering price for the Shares has been
	arbitrarily determined by the Company and does not necessarily bear any direct relationship to the assets, operations, book or
	other established criteria of value of the Company. The Shares will become tradable on the effective date of the registration statement
	of which this prospectus is a part.


	Â 


	Neither the Company nor any selling
	shareholders has any current arrangements nor entered into any agreements with any underwriters, broker-dealers or selling agents

	PROSPECTUS SUMMARY



	Â 



	This summary highlights some
	information from this prospectus, and it may not contain all the information important to making an investment decision. A potential
	investor should read the following summary together with the more detailed information regarding the Company and the common stock
	being sold in this offering, including âRisk Factorsâ and the financial statements and related notes, included elsewhere
	in this prospectus.



	Â 



	The Company



	Â 



	History



	Â 


	A La Carte Charts, Inc. (the âCompanyâ
	or âALCCâ), is a United States-based startup web and mobile application company designed to deliver informative products
	to the common investor in todayâs global markets. The Company intends to offer investors and traders a sophisticated, trustworthy,
	and individualized way to get actionable daily information for the burgeoning self-directed market. Over the past few years, David
	Meyers, the Companyâs founder and CEO, has developed a unique collection of daily information sources that provide systematic
	and common sense insights for making trades on virtually any market. Mr. Meyers has become renowned as a go-to investment expert,
	having appeared on CNBC and TheStreet.com, offering investment guidance to the public. The Company intends to apply its founderâs
	acumen and insight and offer the same to the public through development of a mobile application and web service, (the âCommon
	Man Investor Platformâ), which the Company intends to launch upon completion of development. Following development of the
	software and completion of web build, the Company shall offer a series of digital products for the everyday, âCommon Manâ
	investor.


	Â 


	The Company was incorporated in
	the State of Delaware in April 2016, and was formerly known as Ruby Island Acquisition Corporation. In May 2016, Ruby Island Acquisition
	Corporation filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10 by which it became a public reporting
	company.


	Â 


	In December 2016, the Company implemented
	a change of control by redeeming shares of existing shareholders, issuing shares to new shareholders, electing new officers and
	directors and accepting the resignations of its then existing officers and directors. In connection with the change of control,
	the shareholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the change of the Companyâs name from Ruby
	Island Acquisition Corporation to A La Carte Charts, Inc.



	Â 





	Business



	Â 


	The main product of the Company
	will be its daily âcharts,â delivered via web and mobile applications (the A La Carte âAppsâ), to be compatible
	with Android, iPhone and other smart devices on the market. The Companyâs Apps will each revolve around a specific trading
	strategy or market trend, such as the Head and Shoulders App, Bullish Wedge App, Commodities in Contango App, and Ascending Triangles
	App, among others. Through nuts-and-bolts data on market trends and sound real-world advice, the Company intends to enable its
	subscribers to find practical information they can use in their trading and investing.


	Â 


	To date, the Company, through its
	founder and its affiliated entity, A La Carte Charts, LLC, an Arizona Limited Liability Company (âLa Carte LLCâ) of
	which the Companyâs founder, David Meyers, is sole member and 100% owner, has invested $74,000 (Seventy-four Thousand Dollars)
	in development of its proprietary software and mobile Apps.


	Â 


	In January 2017, pursuant to a development
	proposal (the âSoftware Contractâ) that has been attached as an Exhibit to this Registration Statement, La Carte LLC
	has contracted Vuria LLC (âVuriaâ), an eSolutions provider, to provide state of the art mobile application development
	and functionality (the âApps Developmentâ). The Apps Development includes integrated solutions for iPhone and Android
	mobile device platforms, including optimal graphic design, user-friendly digital architecture and programming. The Apps Development
	is near completion and the Company anticipates launch of beta testing of the product no later than by May 2017.



	Â 








	Â

	Â 








	Table of Contents

	Â 




	Â 



	Pursuant to the Software Contract,
	La Carte LLC shall invest an additional $80,000 in May 2017 for further upgrades to optimize and enhance functionality and design
	of the Apps. The Company anticipates completion of the upgrades, pursuant to the Software Contract, in July 2017.


	Â 


	Upon completion of the Apps Development,
	the Company intends to secure assignment from La Carte LLC to all rights, including intellectual property and otherwise, of and
	relating to the Apps Development.


	Â 


	In addition, as of the date of this
	Prospectus, the Companyâs founder has personally invested $20,000 (twenty thousand dollars) to obtain optimal servers, data
	and 2100 square feet of office space. Amazon Web Services provides server utilities to be utilized by the Apps Development. On
	these servers, data is collected from Barcharts, LLC, which provides the requisite market data necessary for functionality of the
	Apps.


	Â 


	Statistics from the Boston Consulting
	Group demonstrate $34 trillion in assets under management in North America alone. The active (retail) segment of the market in
	the U.S. is approximately $2.8 trillion annually, including $1.8 trillion from non-professional retail traders. Many investors,
	especially the under-50 group, are continually choosing non-traditional and technologically advanced investing methods as alternative
	to the traditional advisor/broker route. A La Carte Charts, with its new Apps, will help to bridge the gap between savvy affluent
	investor and the everyday investor who is seeking to improve his or her knowledge base and build long-term strategies to increase
	dividends.


	Â 


	The goal of A La Carte Charts is
	to help millions of investors find success, while growing into a well-known investment-data platform and fund portfolio. To fully
	launch operations, the Company is seeking an investment of $5,000,000, which shall be utilized for further modifications and enhancement
	of the Apps Development, for marketing and advertising expenses, for ongoing costs to maintain server, data and office lease, and
	for executive salaries and compensation and to hire staff, as needed. In the alternative, if the Company is unable to achieve its
	investment goals, the Company will launch its product as-is and the Companyâs Founder and CEO David Meyers will make ongoing,
	no-interest loans to the Company to sustain operations until profitability or subsequent investment.


	Â 


	The Company aims to be a one-stop
	shop for all active investors seeking optimum investment information and insights. For example, the Companyâs mobile app.
	already provides full analytical charts of the most popular charts in the investment market, including inverse head and shoulders,
	head and shoulders, double bottom, cup and handle, bear flags, etc. In addition, the Company shall track and link to the most pertinent
	fundamental articles from the web and provide easy, relevant access for investors. The Company also intends to offer informative
	pages that educate investors as to dividend dates and rates of all major stocks, the contango/roll yield of all major ETFâs
	and ETNâs, and app participants will have the opportunity to rate each stock chart that we provide. The ratings of the charts
	by users will then rank the stock from strongest chart to weakest for investors to use and help them gather information.


	Â 



	Risks and Uncertainties facing
	the Company



	Â 


	As a development stage company,
	the Company has no operating history and has continuously experienced losses since its inception. The Companyâs independent
	auditors have issued a report questioning the Companyâs ability to continue as a going concern. That is, the Company needs
	to create a source of revenue or locate additional financing in order to continue its developmental plans. As a development stage
	company, management of the Company has no prior experience in building and selling projects similar to that planned by the Company
	and in marketing and distributing such projects on a broad scale.


	Â 


	One of the biggest challenges facing
	the Company is the ability to raise adequate capital to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations,
	which it had not been able to accomplish to the date of the report, and /or obtain additional financing from its stockholders and/or
	other third parties.


	Â 


	Due to financial constraints, the
	Company has to date conducted limited operations. If the Company were unable to develop strong and reliable sources of funding
	for staffing and leasing, it is unlikely that the Company could develop its operations to return revenue sufficient to further
	develop its business plan. Moreover, the above assumes that the Companyâs efforts are met with customer satisfaction in the
	marketplace and exhibit steady adoption of its solutions amongst the potential base of customers, neither of which are currently
	known or guaranteed.

	Trading Market



	Â 


	Currently, there is no trading market
	for the securities of the Company. The Company intends to initially apply for admission to quotation of its securities on the OTC
	Bulletin Board as soon as possible which may be while this offering is still in process. There can be no assurance that the Company
	will qualify for quotation of its securities on the OTC Bulletin Board.


	Â

	Â

	RISK FACTORS



	Â 


	A purchase of any Shares is an investment
	in the Companyâs common stock and involves a high degree of risk. Investors should consider carefully the following information
	about these risks, together with the other information contained in the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part,
	before the purchase of any Shares. If any of the following risks actually occur, the business, financial condition or results of
	operations of the Company would likely suffer, the market price of the common stock would likely decline, and investors could lose
	all or a portion of their investment. The Company has listed the following risk factors which it believes to be that material to
	an investment decision in this offering.


	Â 



	The Company has no independent
	operating history and as such an investor cannot assess its profitability or performance but must rely on the experience of its
	president and other officers.



	Â 


	The Company is a development stage
	company and has no operating history and it is therefore not possible for an investor to assess prior performance or determine
	whether it will likely meet its projected business plan. Such lack of experience may result in the Company experiencing difficulty
	in adequately designing or building any project, thereby causing the project to function improperly or provide inadequate utility
	for which it is intended. If the Companyâs projects cannot be completed or consistently function improperly or perform below
	expectations, the Company will likely be unable to market and sell many of its projects or products. An investor will be required
	to make an investment decision based solely on the managementâs history and its projected operations in light of the risks,
	expenses and uncertainties that may be encountered by engaging in the building and managing of ecological theme parks and producing
	organically grown food.


	Â 



	The Companyâs independent
	auditors have issued a report questioning the Companyâs ability to continue as a going concern.



	Â 


	The report of the Companyâs
	independent auditors contained in the Companyâs financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes a paragraph
	that explains that the Company has experienced recurring losses and has an accumulated deficit during the development stage of
	$13,160. These matters raise substantial doubt regarding the Companyâs ability to continue as a going concern without the
	influx of capital through the sale of its securities or through development of its operations.



	Â 




	The Company has an accumulated
	deficit of $75,569 as of March 31, 2017.



	Â 


	As of March 31, 2017, the Company
	has an accumulated deficit of $75,569. This deficit may impact on the Company in various ways including, but not limited to, making
	it more difficult to borrow money, sell stock or to maintain a good market price.


	Â 



	The offering price of the Shares
	has been arbitrarily determined and such price should not be used by an investor as an indicator of the fair market value of the
	Shares.



	Â 


	Currently there is no public market
	for the Companyâs common stock. The offering price for the Shares has been arbitrarily determined and does not necessarily
	bear any direct relationship to the assets, operations, book or other established criteria of value of the Company. Thus an investor
	should be aware that the offering price does not reflect the fair market price of the Shares.



	Â 





	Reliance on Management



	Â 


	Management will participate in all
	decisions with respect to the management of the Company, including (without limitation) determining business strategy, operations,
	and development. In the event of the dissolution, death, retirement or other incapacity of the Management, the business and operations
	of the Company may be adversely affected.


	Â 



	The Companyâs CEO controls
	a majority of the outstanding stock.



	Â 


	The CEO of the Company currently
	beneficially owns more than a majority of the Companyâs outstanding common stock. As such, he controls most matters requiring
	approval by stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration
	of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control, which in turn could have a material adverse
	effect on the market price of the Companyâs common stock or prevent stockholders from realizing a premium over the market
	price for their Shares. Mr. David Meyers will retain substantial control over matters requiring approval, such as (without limitation)
	the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may also have the
	effect of delaying or preventing a change in control.


	Â 



	The Company will have to compete with an already established
	and ever-evolving market.



	Â 


	Within this massive market, on a
	broad scale, the Company competes with a host of investment websites and traditional brokerages/advisors that have blogs, newsletters,
	websites, apps, and segments on TV shows. Although the Company believes there doesnât yet exist an exact competitor to itâs
	a La Carte Charts product, there are similar apps already in the marketplace.


	Â 


	In addition to brokerage firms,
	the biggest competition is from sites like www.TheStreet.com, Yahoo Finance, Stocktwits, and others that offer subscription services.
	Also, with the rapidly growing size of the retail investor market, new competitors are likely to enter the market. Robinhood, for
	example, is a new crowd-sourced investor application that uses a âsocial investingâ algorithm to provide watch lists
	for popular stocks, along with financial articles, trends, and a personalized stock-trading feed.

	The Company will compete for advertising
	and subscription revenue with the aforementioned competitors, and some of ALCCâs current or potential competitors may have
	greater resources or better competitive positions in certain areas than the Company will, which may allow them to respond more
	effectively than us to new technologies and changes in market conditions. We compete for advertising and circulation revenue with
	both traditional and new content providers. This competition has intensified as a result of the continued development of new digital
	media technologies and new media providers offering online news and other content, and new competitors could quickly emerge. Some
	of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources or better competitive positions in certain areas than we do,
	which may allow them to respond more effectively than us to new technologies and changes in market conditions.


	Â 


	Our ability to compete effectively depends on many factors
	both within and beyond our control, including among others:


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	our ability to continue to deliver high-quality investment analysis & information and content that is interesting and relevant to our audience;





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	our ability to develop, maintain and monetize our digital and other products;





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	the quantity and activity of our users and our ability to maintain ongoing active users;





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	the popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our products;





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	the engagement of our potential subscribers with our products;





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	our ability to attract, contract, retain, and motivate talented management, software developers, professionals and other employees and executives;





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	our ability to manage and grow our operations in a cost-effective manner; and





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	our reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors.





	Â 



	Our success depends on our ability
	to respond and adapt to changes in technology and consumer behavior.



	Â 


	Technology in the online trading
	industry continues to evolve rapidly. Advances in technology have led to an increasing number of methods for the delivery and consumption
	of news and other content. These developments are driving changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over how
	they invest.


	Â 


	Changes in technology and consumer
	behavior pose a number of challenges that could adversely affect our revenues and competitive position. For example, among others:


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	we may be unable to develop products for mobile devices or other digital platforms that consumers find engaging, that work with a variety of operating systems and networks and that achieve a high level of market acceptance;





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	there may be changes in user sentiment about the quality or usefulness of our existing products or concerns related to privacy, security or other factors;





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	failure to successfully manage changes in search engine optimization and social media traffic to increase our digital presence and visibility may reduce our traffic levels;





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	we may be unable to maintain or update our technology infrastructure in a way that meets market and consumer demands;





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	the distribution of our content on delivery platforms of third parties may lead to limitations on monetization of our products, the loss of control over distribution of our content and loss of a direct relationship with our audience; and





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	we may experience challenges in creating display advertising on mobile devices that does not disrupt the user experience.





	Â 


	Responding to these changes may
	require significant investment. We may be limited in our ability to invest funds and resources in digital products, services or
	opportunities, and we may incur expense in building, maintaining and evolving our technology infrastructure. Unless we are able
	to use new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors and develop in a timely
	manner compelling new products and services that engage users across platforms, our business, financial condition and prospects
	may be adversely affected.

	The inability of the Company
	to retain and grow our user base could adversely affect our results of operations and business.



	Â 


	Revenue from advertising derived
	from our various consumer-facing and investor-facing products makes up a majority of our total revenue. Advertising revenue is
	sensitive to discretionary spending of advertisers in the markets we serve, as well as economic conditions. To the extent poor
	economic conditions lead advertising consumers to reduce spending on marketing activities, or if our user base does not grow at
	a rate sufficient to attract or retain demand from advertising consumers, our results of operations will be adversely affected.


	Â 



	Failure to execute cost-control
	measures successfully could adversely affect our profitability.



	Â 


	The Company intends to deploy a
	strategy that will reduce operating costs by maintaining minimal staff and overhead and contracting out software development and
	other necessary functions. However, if we do not achieve expected savings or our operating costs increase as a result of investments
	in strategic initiatives, our total operating costs would be greater than anticipated. In addition, if we do not manage cost-reduction
	efforts properly, such efforts may affect the quality of our products and therefore our ability to generate future revenues. Whatâs
	more, significant portions of our expenses are fixed costs that will neither increase nor decrease proportionately with revenues.
	If we are not able to implement further cost-control efforts or reduce our fixed costs sufficiently in response to a decline in
	our revenues, our results of operations will be adversely affected.


	Â 



	Security breaches and other network
	and information systems disruptions could affect our ability to conduct our business effectively.



	Â 


	Our online systems shall store and
	process confidential subscriber, employee and other sensitive personal data, and therefore maintaining our network security is
	of critical importance. We shall use third-party technology and systems for a variety of operations, including encryption and authentication
	technology, employee email, domain name registration, content delivery to customers, back-office support and other functions. Our
	systems, and those of third parties upon which our business relies, may be vulnerable to interruption or damage that can result
	from natural disasters, fires, power outages, acts of terrorism or other similar events, or from deliberate attacks such as computer
	hacking, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious
	social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing. Such an event could result in a disruption
	of our services or improper disclosure of personal data or confidential information, which could harm our reputation, require us
	to expend resources to remedy such a security breach or defend against further attacks, divert managementâs attention and
	resources or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased operating costs or loss of revenue.


	Â 



	Legislative and regulatory developments,
	including with respect to privacy, could adversely affect our business.



	Â 


	Our business is subject to government
	regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and our Apps, which we intend to make available worldwide, may be subject
	to laws regulating the Internet even in jurisdictions where we do not do business. We may incur increased costs necessary to comply
	with existing and newly adopted laws and regulations or penalties for any failure to comply.


	Â 


	Revenues from our digital products
	could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, in particular by existing or future laws and regulations relating to online
	privacy and the collection and use of consumer data in digital media. In addition, any failure, or perceived failure, by us to
	comply with our posted privacy policies or with any data-related requirements could result in claims against us by governmental
	entities or others, or could require us to change our practices, which could adversely affect our business.

	If the Company fails to successfully
	execute its growth strategies, it may not be able to attract sufficient subscription or purchase of its products to obtain significant
	market share.



	Â 


	The success of the Companyâs business
	depends primarily on subscription and/or purchase of our products from digitally savvy investors and traders who seek out actionable
	daily information for the burgeoning self-directed market. Therefore, the Companyâs ability to deliver an easy-to-use, resourceful,
	and engaging product is critical to the success and growth of the Company. This in turn will depend on several factors, including
	ALCCâs ability to successfully execute its growth strategies to develop new products and enhance existing products to respond
	to developments in the industry and investor and trader demands. While the Companyâs founder Mr. Meyers is a renowned âCommon
	Manâsâ investment advisor, having been a proprietary investor since 2006 and having run an online newsletter publication
	for the âcommon manâ since 2012, plus having made several appearances on radio and CNBC for his stock picks and market
	insights, there is still no assurance that this experience will translate to the Companyâs brand or that the Company will
	be able to maintain or increase demand based on its founderâs prior successes and acclaim. If the Company fails to successfully
	execute its growth strategies, it may not be able to sufficiently attract subscriptions and ALCC may have to significantly decrease
	prices, and revenues, profitability and business prospects may be materially and adversely affected.


	Â 



	No assurance of commercial feasibility.



	Â 


	Even if the Companyâs plans
	and projects are successfully initiated, there can be no assurance that such plans and projects will have any commercial success
	or advantage. Also, there is no assurance that the Companyâs products will perform as intended in the marketplace.


	Â 



	Investors in the offering may experience immediate
	dilution of the value of their shares.



	Â 


	Purchasers of the Shares may experience
	immediate dilution in the value of their Shares. Dilution represents the difference between the price per share paid by investors
	($2.50) and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of the Offering. Net tangible book value per share
	is the net tangible assets of the Company (total assets less total liabilities less intangible assets), divided by the number of
	shares of common stock outstanding. Thus if at some other time, shares had been sold by the Company at a price less than the $2.50
	paid by purchasers of the Shares or had been issued by the Company for services or as other non-cash consideration, then the value
	of such investor Shares immediately after purchase would be less than the $2.50 purchase price.


	Â 



	There has been no prior public
	market for the Companyâs common stock and the lack of such a market may make resale of the Shares difficult.



	Â 


	No prior public market has existed
	for the Companyâs securities and the Company cannot assure any purchaser that a market will develop subsequent to this offering.
	The Company intends to apply for quotation of its common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board. However, the Company does not know if
	it will be successful in such application, how long such application will take, or, if successful, that a market for the common
	stock will ever develop or continue on that or any other trading market. If for any reason a trading market for the Shares does
	not develop, investors may have difficulty selling their common stock should they desire to do so.


	Â 



	The Companyâs election
	not to opt out of JOBS Act extended accounting transition period may not make its financial statements easily comparable to other
	companies.



	Â 


	Pursuant to the JOBS Act of 2012,
	as an emerging growth company the Company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period for any new or revised accounting
	standards that may be issued by the PCAOB or the SEC. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period
	which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the
	Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the standard for the private company. This may make comparison of the Companyâs
	financial statements with any other public company which is not either an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company
	which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible as possible different or revised standards
	may be used.


	Â 



	The Companyâs stock may
	be considered a penny stock and any investment in the Companyâs stock will be considered a high-risk investment and subject
	to restrictions on marketability.



	Â 


	If the Shares commence trading,
	the trading price of the Companyâs common stock may be below $5.00 per Share. If the price of the common stock is below such
	level, trading in its common stock would be subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange
	Act of 1934, as amended. These rules require additional disclosure by broker-dealers in connection with any trades generally involving
	any non-NASDAQ equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per Share, subject to certain exceptions. Such rules
	require the delivery, before any penny stock transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks
	associated therewith, and impose various sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than
	established customers and accredited investors (generally institutions). For these types of transactions, the broker-dealer must
	determine the suitability of the penny stock for the purchaser and receive the purchaserâs written consent to the transactions
	before sale. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting
	transactions in the Companyâs common stock which could impact the liquidity of the Companyâs common stock.


	Â 



	Little Experience in Being a Public Company



	Â 


	The Company is an early-stage company
	and as such has little experience in managing a public company. Such lack of experience may result in the Company experiencing
	difficulty in adequately operating and growing its business. Further, the Company may be hampered by lack of experience in addressing
	the issues and considerations which are common to growing companies. If the Companyâs operating or management abilities consistently
	perform below expectations, the Companyâs business is unlikely to thrive.

	Table of Contents

	Â 




	Â 


	The Company is an early-stage company
	with no developed finance and accounting organization and the rigorous demands of being a public company require a structured and
	developed finance and accounting group. As a reporting company, the Company is already subject to the reporting requirements of
	the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. However, the requirements of these laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
	entail significant accounting, legal and financial compliance costs which may be prohibitive to the Company as it develops its
	business plan, services and scope. These costs have made, and will continue to make, some activities more difficult, time consuming
	or costly and may place significant strain on its personnel, systems and resources.


	Â 


	The Securities Exchange Act requires,
	among other things, that companies maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.
	In order to maintain the requisite disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, significant
	resources and management oversight are required. As a result, managementâs attention may be diverted from other business
	concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on the development of the Companyâs business, financial condition and
	results of operations.


	Â 


	These rules and regulations may
	also make it difficult and expensive for the Company to obtain director and officer liability insurance. If the Company is unable
	to obtain adequate director and officer insurance, its ability to recruit and retain qualified officers and directors, especially
	those directors who may be deemed independent, will be significantly curtailed.


	Â 



	The Board of Directors could
	use the issuance or designation of preferred stock to impede or discourage an acquisition of the Company that may otherwise be
	beneficial to some shareholders.



	Â 


	The Company is authorized to issue
	up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock, or the issuance of rights to purchase such
	shares, could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal. For instance, the issuance of a series of preferred stock
	might impede a business combination by including class voting rights that would enable the holder to block such a transaction,
	or facilitate a business combination by including voting rights that would provide a required percentage vote of the stockholders.
	In addition, under certain circumstances, the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the holders
	of the common stock. Although the Companyâs board of directors is required to make any determination to issue such preferred
	stock based on its judgment as to the best interests of the stockholders of the Company, the board of directors could act in a
	manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some, or a majority, of the stockholders might believe
	to be in their best interests or in which stockholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then market price of such
	stock. The board of directors does not intend to seek stockholder approval prior to any issuance of currently authorized stock,
	unless otherwise required by law or otherwise.


	Â 



	The Company may not be able to
	obtain additional funds to finance its operations on terms acceptable or at all, and if ALCC does raise funds, the value of investment
	in the Company may be negatively impacted.



	Â 


	The Companyâs business operations
	may require expenditures that exceed its available capital resources. Although the Company currently does not expect that it will
	incur substantial debt to finance its future growth, to the extent that its funding requirements exceeds its financial resources,
	ALCC will be required to seek additional financing or to defer planned expenditures. There is no assurance that the Company can
	obtain additional funds on terms acceptable or at all.


	Â 


	In addition, if the Company raises
	additional funds by equity financing, investorsâ equity interest in the Company may be diluted. If ALCC raises additional
	funds by incurring debt obligations, it may be subject to various covenants under the relevant debt instruments that may, among
	other things, restrict its ability to pay dividends. Servicing such debt obligations could also be burdensome to its operations.
	If the Company fails to service the debt obligations or is unable to comply with the covenants, it could be in default under the
	debt obligations and its liquidity and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.


	Â 


	The Registrant currently does not
	hold any intellectual property protection, and has not applied for any patents. The Registrant may decide in the future to pursue
	further efforts to protect its intellectual property, trade secrets and proprietary methods and processes.


	Â 



	Litigation Risk




	Â 



	The Company does not have any business
	liability, disruption or litigation insurance, and any business disruption or litigation the Company experiences might result in
	it incurring substantial costs and diversion of resources.


	Â 



	Broad Indemnification Provided to Management



	Â 


	The governing documents of the Company
	limit the liability of, and provide indemnification for, the Management and the respective directors, officers, employees and agents
	of the Company and the Management. The indemnification provided is to the full extent permitted under applicable Delaware law.
	Those provisions may limit certain rights of the shareholders against such parties, and moreover, an indemnification by the Company
	of the Management or any indemnified individual may result in substantial out-of-pocket costs and expenses payable by the Company.
	If the Company is forced to provide indemnification for any of these indemnified parties, it is possible that the assets of the
	Company could become depleted or the Company may otherwise suffer a material adverse financial consequence as a result of its indemnity
	obligations. As of the date of this Memorandum, to the knowledge of the Company, there is no pending litigation or proceeding that
	exists involving a director, officer, employee or agent of the Management or the Company where indemnification will be required
	or permitted.

	Limited Transferability of Shares



	Â 


	There is no public market for the
	Shares. While the Company intends to develop a public market in the future, there can be no assurance if or when such a market
	would be expected to develop in the future. Even if a potential buyer could be found, the transferability of these Shares is also
	restricted by the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Rule 144 promulgated thereunder. Unless an exemption
	is available, these Shares may not be sold or transferred without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.


	Â 


	Investors must be capable of bearing
	the economic risks of this investment with the understanding that these Shares may not be liquidated by resale or redemption and
	should expect to hold their Shares as a long-term investment (especially if no public trading market develops).


	Â 



	Speculative Nature of Investment



	Â 


	Investment in these Shares is speculative
	and, by investing, each investor assumes the risk of losing the entire investment. The Company has limited operations as of the
	date of this Private Placement Memorandum and will be solely dependent upon the Company and the Companyâs portfolio of assets,
	both of which are subject to the risks described herein. Accordingly, only investors who are able to bear the loss of their entire
	investment and who otherwise meet the investor suitability standards should consider purchasing these Shares.


	Â 


	Each prospective investor who invests
	in the Company must understand that investment in the Shares is speculative. By investing, potential investors understand that
	they may lose their entire investment in investing with the Company.


	Â 



	No Expectation to Pay Dividends



	Â 


	The Company
	has not paid any dividends with respect to its outstanding Shares and cannot predict when, or if, dividends will be paid. The Company
	does not currently anticipate paying any dividends on the Shares until a product is successfully commercialized and liquidity is
	realized. There is no guarantee the Company will ever receive any profit from its operations so as to be able to declare and pay
	dividends. There can be no assurance with respect to the amount and timing of any dividends other than to the shareholders, or
	that they will ever be made. Future dividends will be determined by the Management of the Company in light of prevailing financial
	conditions, earnings, if any, as well as other relevant factors.


	Â 



	Unforeseen Changes



	Â 


	While the Company has enumerated
	certain material risk factors herein, it is impossible to know all risks which may arise in the future. In particular, shareholders
	may be negatively affected by changes in any of the following: (i) laws, rules and regulations; (ii) regional, national and/or
	global economic factors; (iii) the capacity, circumstances and relationships of partners of the Company or the Management; or (iv)
	general changes in financial or capital markets.


	Â 


	The Company continuously encounters
	changes in its operating environment, and the Company may have fewer resources than many of its competitors to continue to adjust
	to those changes. The operating environment of the Company is undergoing rapid changes, with frequent introductions of laws, regulations,
	competitors, market approaches, and economic impacts. Future success will depend, in part, upon the ability of the Company to adapt
	to those changes and providing products and services that will satisfy the demands of their respective businesses and projects.
	Many of the competitors have substantially greater resources to adapt to those changes. The Company may not effectively react to
	all of the changes in its operating environment or be successful in adapting its products and approach.



	Â 




	Arbitration




	Â 



	By execution of the subscription
	agreement for purchase of the Shares, investors in this offering agree to submit to arbitration all claims arising from their investment.
	Arbitration may not afford investors all the relief they might obtain outside arbitration. Arbitration narrows procedural and other
	steps available to claimants (such as discovery, broad choice of venue and scope of appellate review) and is, in general, a more
	informal process than court action. On the other hand, arbitration is normally a less expensive process for a claimant than court
	action and normally results in a quicker final decision. However, investors may find that as a result of arbitration they are more
	restricted in the resolution of claims, if any, arising from this investment.

	DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE



	Â 


	There is no public market for the

	shareholders may be offered and sold, from time to time, by the selling shareholders described in this prospectus under the heading
	âSelling Shareholdersâ at an offering price of $2.50 per share until such time as the Shares are quoted on the OTC

	business.



	Â

	Â 



	Resale of the Securities under
	State Securities Laws



	Â 


	The National Securities Market Improvement
	Act of 1996 (âNSMIAâ) limits the authority of states to impose restrictions upon resale of securities made pursuant
	to Sections 4(1) and 4(3) of the Securities Act of companies which file reports under Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange
	Act. Resale of the Shares in the secondary market will be made pursuant to Section 4(1) of the Securities Act (sales other than
	by an issuer, underwriter or broker).



	Â 







	DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES



	Â 


	The Company is authorized to issue
	100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001, of which 6,799,600 shares are outstanding as of the date of the registration
	statement, of which this prospectus is a part. The Company is also authorized to issue 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par
	value $0.0001, of which no shares were outstanding as of the date of the registration statement, of which this prospectus is a
	part.


	Â 


	The following statements relating
	to the capital stock set forth the material terms of the securities of the Company. Reference is also made to the more detailed
	provisions of the certificate of incorporation and the by-laws, copies of which are filed as exhibits to this registration statement.


	Â 



	Common Stock



	Â 


	The Company is registering up to
	2,780,000 shares of common stock, as follows: (i) 2,000,000 shares for sale directly by the Company at the price of $2.50 per share;
	and (ii) 780,000 shares for sale to the public by the holders thereof at a price of $2.50 per share.


	Â 


	Holders of shares of common stock
	are entitled to one vote for each share on all matters to be voted on by the stockholders. Holders of common stock do not have
	cumulative voting rights.


	Â 


	Subject to preferences that may
	be applicable to any outstanding shares of preferred stock, the holders of common stock are entitled to share ratably in dividends,
	if any, as may be declared from time to time by the board of directors in its discretion from funds legally available therefor.


	Â 


	Holders of common stock have no
	preemptive rights to purchase the Companyâs common stock. There are no conversion or redemption rights or sinking fund provisions
	with respect to the common stock. The Company may issue additional shares of common stock which could dilute its current shareholderâs
	share value.


	Â 



	Preferred Stock



	Â 


	Shares of preferred stock may be
	issued from time to time in one or more series as may be determined by the board of directors. The voting powers and preferences,
	the relative rights of each series, and the qualifications, limitations, and restrictions on such preferred stock shall be established
	by the board of directors, except that no holder of preferred stock shall have preemptive rights.


	Â 



	Admission to Quotation on the
	OTC Bulletin Board



	Â 


	If and when the Company meets the
	qualifications, it intends to apply for quotation of its securities on the OTC Bulletin Board. There is no assurance that the Company
	will ever meet such qualifications. The OTC Bulletin Board differs from national and regional stock exchanges in that it (1) is
	not situated in a single location but operates through communication of bids, offers and confirmations between broker-dealers and
	(2) securities admitted to quotation are offered by one or more broker-dealers rather than the âspecialistâ common
	to stock exchanges. To qualify for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board, an equity security must have one registered broker-dealer,
	known as the market maker, willing to list bid or sale quotations and to sponsor the company listing.

	Penny Stock Regulation



	Â 


	Penny stocks generally are equity
	securities with a price of less than $5.00 per share other than securities registered on national securities exchanges or listed
	on the Nasdaq Stock Market, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities
	are provided by the exchange or system. The penny stock rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who
	sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess
	of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouse). For transactions covered by these rules,
	the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities and have received the purchaserâs
	written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. Additionally, for any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt,
	the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny
	stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative
	and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information on the
	limited market in penny stocks. Because of these penny stock rules, broker-dealers may be restricted in their ability to sell the
	Companyâs common stock. The foregoing required penny stock restrictions will not apply to the Companyâs common stock
	if such stock reaches and maintains a market price of $5.00 per share or greater.


	Â 



	Dividends



	Â 


	The Company has not paid any dividends
	to date. The Company intends to employ all available funds for the growth and development of its business, and accordingly, does
	not intend to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future.


	Â 





	THE BUSINESS



	Â 



	Background



	Â 


	The Company has only recently commenced
	operations as a development-stage company, and it has limited operating history and is expected to experience losses in the near
	term. The Companyâs independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt about the Companyâs ability
	to continue as a going concern.



	Â

	Business Model




	Â 



	The Company was created to offer
	investors and traders a sophisticated, trustworthy, and individualized way to receive actionable daily information for the burgeoning
	self-directed market. Over the past few years, David Meyers, the Companyâs founder and CEO, has developed a unique collection
	of daily information sources that provide systematic and common sense insights for making trades on virtually any market. Mr. Meyers
	has become renowned as a go-to investment expert, having appeared on CNBC and TheStreet.com, offering investment guidance to the

	of a mobile application and web service, (the âCommon Man Investor Platformâ), which the Company intends to launch

	The main product of the Company
	will be its daily âCharts,â delivered via web and mobile applications (âAppsâ), to be compatible with Android,
	iPhone and other smart devices on the market. The Companyâs Apps will each revolve around a specific trading strategy or
	market trend, such as the Head and Shoulders App, Bullish Wedge App, Commodities in Contango App, and Ascending Triangles App,
	among others. Through nuts-and-bolts data on market trends and sound real-world advice, the Company intends to enable its subscribers
	to find practical information they can use in their trading and investing.


	Â 


	The Charts will be offered to the
	Companyâs users at no cost. The Company intends to generate revenue through sale of in-app advertising space. The Company
	anticipates significant demand for advertising space through its Apps based on the utility of its product and projected desirability
	of advertisers to reach the target demographic of the Companyâs user base. The Companyâs users will consist of individuals,
	often men ages 35-50 years old, that have at least $100,000 in annual salary and whom actively manage their own money. The Company
	aims to reach 2.5 million users during its first year of operation (âUser Milestoneâ). Upon reaching or exceeding its
	User Milestone, the Company thereafter anticipates converting users into advertising revenue at a rate of approximately $1.56 per
	user, based on comparison to lowest valuation social media platforms in comparable market space, such as Twitter, Inc., which as
	of the date of this prospectus converts users into advertising revenue at the rate of $1.56 per user. Although Twitterâs
	user base is substantial, the Company anticipates drawing similar conversion rates due to its similarity in utility to Twitter
	but distinguished target user base.


	Â 


	Even if the Company does not reach
	its User Milestone by end of first year of operation, and even if advertising revenue is converted at less than $1.00 per user,
	the Company still anticipates significant advertising revenue returns as user activity and downloads increase with increase in
	brand exposure. It is noted however that there can be no guarantee that the Company will ever exceed nor even reach its User Milestone.


	Â 


	As of March 31, 2017, the Company,
	through its affiliated entity, A La Carte Charts, LLC, an Arizona Limited Liability Company (âLa Carte LLCâ) of which
	the Companyâs founder, David Meyers, is sole member and 100% owner, has invested $74,000 in development of its proprietary
	software and mobile Apps. In January 2017, pursuant to a development proposal that has been attached as an Exhibit to this Registration
	Statement, La Carte LLC has engaged Vuria LLC (âVuriaâ), an eSolutions provider, to provide state of the art mobile
	application development and functionality (the âApps Developmentâ). The Apps Development includes integrated solutions
	for iPhone and Android mobile device platforms, including optimal graphic design, user-friendly digital architecture and programming.
	The Apps Development is near completion and the Company anticipates launch of beta testing of the enhanced product no later than
	by July 2017. Upon completion of the Apps Development, The Company intends to secure from La Carte LLC assignment as to all rights,
	including intellectual property and otherwise, of and relating to the Apps Development.


	Â 


	Statistics from the Boston Consulting
	Group show that there are $34 trillion in assets under management in North America alone. The active (retail) segment of the market
	in the U.S. is approximately $2.8 trillion annually, including $1.8 trillion from non-professional retail traders. Many investors,
	especially the under-50 group, are continually choosing non-traditional and technologically advanced investing methods as alternative
	to the traditional advisor/broker route. A La Carte Charts, with its new apps, will help to bridge the gap between savvy affluent
	investor and the everyday investor who is seeking to improve his or her knowledge base and build long-term strategies to increase
	dividends. Business and productivity apps generated around $36 billion in 2014, part of the overall $86 billion market for apps.


	Â 


	The goal of A La Carte Charts is
	to help millions of investors find success, while growing into a well-known investment-data platform and fund portfolio. To fully
	launch operations, the Company is seeking an investment of $5,000,000, which shall be utilized for further modifications and enhancement
	of the Apps Development, for marketing and advertising expenses, for ongoing costs to maintain server, data and office lease, and
	for executive salaries and compensation and to hire staff, as needed. In the alternative, if the Company is unable to achieve its
	investment goals, the Company will launch its product as-is and the Companyâs Founder and CEO David Meyers will make ongoing,
	no-interest loans to the Company to sustain operations until profitability or subsequent investment.


	Â 


	The Company primary objectives are highlighted by the
	following:

	The Market




	Â 



	With the advent of advanced algorithmic
	trading, the online trading industry, including self-directed, or active, investors, is a rapidly expanding market segment. Financial
	consultancy firm Celent estimates that the active investor market comprises more than 40% of the United States investor market.
	Growth in the market has been heavily attributed to the increased access to online information and online trading tools. Celentâs
	self-directed market study finds that:


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	Online firms continue to enhance trading functionalities, improve execution speed and further develop tools to create more robust trading platforms and attract all types of customer segments.





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â

	The most important additions will include access to additional products, more sophisticated trading tools, enhanced education materials, more social features, improved mobile access and improved navigation and design.





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	Firms are turning to social networking community tools and educational tools to enhance investor knowledge.





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	Market volatility has led to greater demand by retail investors for a more diverse set of products, including options, futures and foreign exchange.






	Â 



	Yet, easy-to-understand, real-world
	information for the âeverymanâ is still difficult to find. A La Carte Charts and its products, are the result of founder
	David Meyersâ personal journey from everyday investor to investment guru who has appeared on CNBC as a retail investor expert.
	Along the way, he developed investing strategies that take a look at a variety of markets in order to determine the best course
	of action that day â presented through practical, common sense, and actionable investment data from which self-directed investors
	can prosper.


	Â 



	Products and Services



	Â 


	A La Carte Charts is a multifaceted
	holding company that will offer both consumer-facing and investor-facing products. The Companyâs initial plan is to offer
	its products without fee as the Companyâs goal is to attract users and convert user activity into advertising revenue. A
	La Carte Charts will target a wide range of investors to gain users, from beginning traders and self-directed investors to highly
	experienced day traders and savvy investors. The Company intends to capitalize on a commonality among all investor-types: the common
	desire to seek out and find new investment opportunities, information, and flexibility. A La Carte Charts present a mobile- and
	social-oriented platform through its websites and mobile apps, offering investors not only varied, accessible ways to find information
	but also by offering highly personalized and customizable investing experience.


	Â 


	The main consumer-facing products
	will consist of a series of mobile applications that boil investing down to its most simple elements. The Company will focus its
	offering to 12 chart-types that, in opinion of the Company based on research and expertise of its founder, represent the most sought-after
	charts by its target consumers. The Companyâs proprietary Apps will utilize these charts to create a streamlined, user-friendly
	information source that pushes daily lists and investment information to subscribers. For example, the Head and Shoulders app shall
	deliver daily reports on the âHead-and-Shouldersâ pattern based on monthly NASDAQ trends. The chart shall then alert
	investors when a securityâs price is set to fall from its peak (the head) or rise from the bottom (shoulders) of a price
	pattern. It is a non-biased, objective way of giving investors the information they need to make informed decisions.

	A La Carte Chartâs apps will
	use off-the-shelf information from the NASDAQ and other markets, coupled with historically based investment data. Although the
	Company intends to offer its products at no cost to the user, by attracting large user base the Company intends to reach profitability
	through conversion of its users into advertising revenue.


	Â 


	A La Carte Charts may also in the
	future sell investment training videos and other relevant educational materials as well as an ever-growing list of products through
	ALaCarteCharts.com, and as in-app purchases through the apps themselves.

	Web and Mobile Application Development




	Â 



	To date, the Company, through its
	founder and its affiliated entity, A La Carte Charts, LLC, an Arizona Limited Liability Company (âLa Carte LLCâ) of
	which the Companyâs founder, David Meyers, is sole member and 100% owner, has invested $74,000 (Seventy four thousand dollars)
	in development and an anticipated additional $80,000 more for enhancement of its proprietary software and mobile Apps. In January,
	2017, pursuant to a development proposal that has been attached as an Exhibit to this Registration Statement, La Carte LLC has
	contracted Vuria LLC (âVuriaâ), an eSolutions provider with over 15 years experience offering custom concepts and solutions
	for mobile application and development companies, to provide state of the art mobile application development and functionality
	(the âApps Developmentâ).


	Â 


	The Company, through its founder
	and affiliated entity La Carte LLC, has currently contracted Vuria to expand its web and mobile applicationsâ functionality
	and usability for the already established and growing number of users currently using the Companyâs Apps. Vuria will be adding
	functionality including: log-in capabilities, in-use comment capabilities, and market snapshot functionality using data readily
	available to the Company.



	Â 



	As of May 2017, the Company is in
	its third phase of beta testing of its products. The Beta App, that at time of release offered stock charts lists only, was downloaded
	35,000 times. The Company has since upgraded the Beta App twice to improve functionality, but the Company will not market to the
	public until all upgrades are complete. Following completion of the fully optimized App, the Company anticipates exponential growth
	in downloads and user activity, commensurate with the quality of the product and exposure generated from advertising expenditures.

	The website at ALaCarteCharts.com
	(the âLa Carte Siteâ) is already developed, albeit with limited functionality to date. The La Carte Site, along with
	other domains, will be developed to include front- and back-end features that make it easily usable for both members and management,
	as well as for potential customers to find and download the apps. The website is meant to provide users with an introduction into
	the A La Carte Charts platform and how its services can help people get a leg up in the online trading world and let amateurs and
	savvy investors alike attain real-world investment information. The site will likely accommodate direct download/subscriptions

	Market Analysis




	Â 



	The investment landscape globally
	is composed of varying classes, from traditional publicly traded stocks to newer leveraged assets and diversified capital-based
	hedge funds. The asset management industry reached a record high for the second year in a row in 2013. The value of professionally
	managed assets reached a record $68.7 trillion globally in 2013, with industry profits reaching $93 billion, according to the most
	recently available report from the Boston Consulting Group. Total Assets under Management (AuM) grew 13% over 2012, and have grown
	from $54.7 trillion in 2007. The global market by region is shown below in trillions of dollars.


	Â 


	The Boston Consulting Group projected
	that asset management will continue to rank among the most profitable industries. Operating margins, or profits as a percentage
	of net revenues, grew from 37 percent in 2012 to 39 percent, approaching the pre-crisis high of 41 percent, as costs grew less
	quickly than revenues.â North America is by far the largest market globally, and AuM grew 20% in 2013.


	Â 


	Within this market the active (retail)
	trader segment in the U.S. is approximately $2.8 trillion, including $1.8 trillion from non-professional retail traders holding
	personal trading accounts, according to research from Aite Group. Nearly 25% of U.S. adults with access to the Internet are retail
	online traders, according to Aite Group, with an additional 6% being professional traders. This totals a self-directed U.S. trading
	population of more than 54 million adults. The average volume of daily trading for the past several years is outlined below by
	source.

	Mobile Application Market




	Â 



	The market for mobile apps in 2014
	was estimated at around $86 billion, with projections estimating the market will nearly double within the next couple years. A
	report from market analyst Vision Mobile estimates that, of the market, $36 billion was spent on business and productivity apps
	in 2014. Business and productivity apps will reach an estimated $58 billion by the end of 2016.


	Â 


	There are numerous trends in the
	market factoring into growth of the business and productivity app market, including:


	Â 




	Â 



	â





	Consumerisation of IT

	: Decisions made by users, not CIOs. Increased use of Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) concept in teams and departments have encouraged use of Apps which are more specific to their individual needs.





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â





	Diversification of IT

	: Use of mobility devices for official work apart from checking e-mail has seen a surge in terms of business and productivity apps.





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â





	Bring-your-own-devices:

	Although use of BYOD culture is giving headaches to IT security and infrastructure teams across the organization, it is becoming quite a trend across its user base. Use of their own devices plus flexibility of working anywhere anytime is making it a favorite with decision makers also.





	Â 


	The market for business and productivity
	apps is primarily purchased outside of app stores, as many corporations are still buying apps through the traditional method of
	buying software. As shown below, less than 10% of business and productivity apps are sold in app stores (around $1 billion), and
	this will reach $6 billion by 2016.


	Â 



	Market Segmentation




	Â 



	The Companyâs Development Apps
	are intended to cater to a wide range of individuals, ranging from amateurs to advanced traders. The Companyâs target consumers
	can be located virtually anywhere in the world, although for first year of operation the Company will target only those customers
	located within the United States. Irrespective of demographic, each target user shares the common need to achieve real-world, actionable
	data and advice to address todayâs markets.


	Â 


	The average self-directed retail investor
	profile is expanding, according to Celent in its January 2015 publication âThe State of Online Brokerage Platforms.â
	(the âCelent Reportâ). The Celent Report further indicated that the average active trader in the U.S. is male and in
	his mid-40s, but that there are an increasing number of individuals aged over 45 years old opening active trader accounts. Additionally,
	major brokerage firms were noted by the report to having seen an increase in the number of females and millennials opening self-directed
	trading accounts. According to the report, active traders value mobility, and an ability to configure the trading screen, set up
	preferences, and view videos, technical indicators, analyst reports, and an ability to conduct research on a mobile device.


	Â 


	Additionally, Aite Group reported
	in a 2015 article âOnline trading penetration in the United Statesâ (the Aite Group Reportâ), that U.S. brokers
	expect to see the contribution of mobile trading to rise as a result of a new generation of traders adopting mobile technology
	for everyday activities and specialized endeavors such as online trading. The Aite Group also reported that the under-35 demographic
	shall represent an important component of the market due to the large size of the Millennial generations and their ever-growing
	income base.


	Â 


	Another 2015 report, from Cisco on
	the technical savvy of investors (the âCisco Reportâ), demonstrated that most wealthy individual investors in the U.S.
	are baby boomers and âsilvers.â However, while making up just 28% of investors, the under-50 set is the most comfortable
	with using technology for their investing purposes. The Cisco Report further noted of study of wealth investors that: investors
	ages 18 to 34 are not surprisingly the most avid technology users, since they have grown up with both the Internet and rapid advances
	in consumer technology devices. The report further noted however, that investors in the next age group, 35 to 49, have very similar
	characteristics. As such, the Company intends to target both age groups in roll out of its platform and associated Apps.

	Operating Plan




	Â 



	Over the next twelve months from
	the date of this Registration Statement, the Company intends to reach several milestones that will enable it to grow and expand
	at an anticipated rapid rate. Provided the Company is able to locate necessary financing and provided the Apps Development is completed
	at or prior to the target date of completion pursuant to the Software Contract discussed herein and attached as an exhibit to this
	Registration Statement, the Company then intends to roll out operational phase of its development and attract users at large scale.
	Upon roll out of optimal development and deployment of the Companyâs nuanced marketing strategy, the Company hopes in turn
	to attain 2.5m users over the first year of operation. As users and user activity increases the Company will reach out to advertising
	partners for additional revenue streams. The Company will subsequently expand investment in marketing to increase exposure of its
	brand. The Company will also update and enhance its Development Apps in response to feedback from its users.


	Â 





	Competition




	Â 



	Within this massive market, on a
	broad scale, the Company competes with a host of investment websites and traditional brokerages/advisors that have blogs, newsletters,
	websites, apps, and segments on TV shows. So while the Company has found no exact competition to itâs a La Carte Charts product,
	there are similar apps out there. While most brokerage companies offer âstock screeners,â they are very difficult to
	setup for your average investor and one needs to be in front of a computer to do so. The Companyâs apps offer the list at
	the usersâ fingertips without need of technical know-how.


	Â 


	Other than brokerages, the biggest
	competition is from sites like www.TheStreet.com, Yahoo Finance, Stocktwits, and others that offer subscription services. They
	are not direct competition, though, and should be considered parallel businesses. They offer stock picks based on subjective analysis
	and commentary. A La Carte Charts applications simply deliver a list of stocks that match the chart that the purchaser selects.
	In fact, all of the aforementioned sites are great places to advertise.


	Â 


	With the rapidly growing size of
	the retail investor market, however, new competitors will continually enter the market. Robinhood, for example, is a new crowd-sourced
	investor app that uses a âsocial investingâ algorithm to provide watch lists for popular stocks, along with financial
	articles, trends, and a personalized stock-trading feed.


	Â 


	The Company and its Chart apps will exist to supplement
	and enhance the market for the everyday investor.

	Marketing Strategy



	Â 


	A La Carte Charts will be positioned
	in the market as a class-leading app-based investor education portal. Users will benefit from the wide range of daily investment
	information and education tools that are built into the software. A well-rounded approach to marketing will promote A La Carte
	Charts apps to a wide customer base. As illustrated in Section 4.1 above, there is a large and growing population of web-savvy
	active investors who are seeking the best advice/information they can find. Marketing the platform to these investors will include
	a combination of traditional marketing, internet marketing, and social media, helping to brand the Company as the premier âeveryman
	investorâ-oriented app for promoting independent thinking based on common sense data and metrics.


	Â 


	Mr. Meyers has worked for the past
	few years to gain a strong following of consumers, which has helped to foster word-of-mouth and social media viral exposure that
	reaches new customers. With the launch of its new platform and apps, A La Carte Charts will also use the following tactics to attract
	new customers:


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	Press Releases, Blogs, Podcasts, etc.





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	Email Marketing





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	Event Sponsorship (trade shows, seminars, etc.)





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	Free Promotional Media





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	Facebook âLikeâ and CPI âCost Per Installâ Campaigns





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	Mobile ads on TheStreet.com, Yahoo Finance, Stocktwits, etc.





	Â 


	These initiatives will help to launch
	the new slate of products and services, and the Company will then continually promote its website and apps through the following:


	Â 



	Key-Word Search Optimization
	and Social Media:

	Whenever anyone uses a popular search engine to search for topics such as âstock tipsâ or âinvestor
	advice,â etc., in Google, Yahoo!, Lycos, Excite, or Bing, from, an organic ink to the Companyâs website will ideally
	appear.


	Â 


	The Company will drive traffic through
	blogs placed on its website and accessed through multiple links. Blogging gives a business the ability to inform and market without
	the formality of being âpublished,â and it also supplements marketing efforts by increasing visibility and readership
	of the firmâs capabilities. ALaCarteCharts.com and its ancillary sites will contain a number of periodic blogs designed to
	inform readers of current articles and issues. Potentially, Twitter account updates will also be placed onto the navigation bar
	of the main blog page to highlight relevant financial soundbites.


	Â 


	The use of a corporate Facebook
	page also promotes the âconnectingâ and âsharingâ of information, pictures, and direct media, etc., to
	todayâs Internet-savvy investors and traders. It allows for the creation of free company pages, which not only provide free
	advertising but make it easy for current customers to refer A La Carte Charts to others in their network of friends. LinkedIn will
	also be useful as an online virtual networking and professional marketplace. It allows for connectivity to trade associations,
	easily promotes managementâs resumes and A La Carte Chartsâ products, and creates an untold network of connections
	to potential customers. LinkedIn also allows for the creation of instant advertising through their DirectAds area, putting the
	Company in a virtual Yellow Pages for others to connect to.


	Â 


	Further Internet-based marketing
	methods include:


	Â 




	Â 



	â





	PPC/CPM

	: A La Carte Charts will employ an effective method for launching a pay-per-click (PPC) and CPM (cost-per-thousand impressions) campaign that advertises its innovative online investment advice and apps along the sidebars of search engines and on relevant websites with text and banner ads. Though this will be kept to a minimum, depending on demonstrated ROI. As noted above, a âcost per installâ campaign may be used as well.





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â





	E-mail marketing

	: A La Carte Charts has an extensive list of leads through its current website and from Mr. Meyersâ growing TV and social media presence. This list is continually growing and will be used for targeting interested parties with an opted-in email list that promotes new app updates, new online tools and features, and other A La Carte Charts products.





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â





	Mobile app development

	: A La Carte Charts will simultaneously develop and launch its mobile apps, which will be available for download on the Apple App Store initially, and then the Android Marketplace. This will extend the reach and functionality of the platform.





	Â 


	Additionally, the Company will employ
	the following methods:


	Â 



	Press Releases:

	Press releases
	will be created, and the Company will enact a publicity blitz to further target news sources where affluent professionals and everyday
	investors find their marketing news, as well as targeting publications such as those listed above and others that reach a large
	and influence base of consumers. Wired, TechCrunch, and other places early adopters find their tech news will be targeted as well,
	as will other relevant tech and business magazines and websites. This is a free way to drive awareness of A La Carte Charts and
	its innovative platform.


	Â 



	Traditional Advertising

	:
	This will also occur, when needed, in publications like those above and others, likely only after A La Carte Charts has been established
	in the market and is attempting to enhance market share.

	Video

	: The A La Carte Charts
	platform and services will be presented through dynamic multimedia communications vehicles. Videos, in particular, are often the
	most effective methods of communicating how a product or service works. The Company has already created marketing videos that appear
	on its website, and they can also be deployed to YouTube, Google Video, and other sites.



	Â 




	Referral Incentives:

	The
	Company will also offer an âAffiliate Referral Programâ enabling the establishment of a link to its website on external
	sites. The Company will pay a referral fee for all opportunities/clients referred to their website.


	Â 



	Executed Promotional Contracts




	Â 



	On December 28, 2016 the Company
	entered into a contract with then current NFL professional athlete Richard Sherman (âMr. Shermanâ) whereby, in return
	for a total of 339,800 shares representing 5% (Five Percent) of the Companyâs total shares issued and outstanding as of the
	date the contract was executed, Mr. Sherman has given the Company license and authority to use Mr. Shermanâs name and likeness
	in association with the promotional use of the Companyâs business activities and marketing of its products.


	Â 


	On that same date December 28, 2016
	the Company also entered into a contract with a Branton Lamont Sherman whereby, also in return for a total of 339,800 shares representing
	5% (Five Percent) of the Companyâs total shares issued and outstanding as of the date the contract was executed, Mr. Sherman
	has given the Company license and authority to use Branton Lamont Shermanâs name and likeness in association with the promotional
	use of the Companyâs business activities and marketing of its products.


	Â 


	The Company intends to utilize the contracts to expand
	the marketing reach and exposure of its products and services.

	THE COMPANY




	Â 




	Change of Control




	Â 







	The Company was incorporated in the
	State of Delaware in April 2016 and was formerly known as Ruby Island Acquisition Corporation. In December 2016, the Company implemented
	a change of control by issuing shares to new shareholders, redeeming shares of existing shareholders, electing new officers and
	directors and accepting the resignations of its then existing officers and directors. In connection with the change of control,
	the shareholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the change of the Companyâs name from Ruby
	Island Acquisition Corporation to Diverse Development Group, Inc. in November 2016.



	Â 




	Relationship with Tiber Creek
	Corporation



	Â 


	In October 2016, the Company entered into
	an engagement agreement with Tiber Creek Corporation, a Delaware corporation (âTiber Creekâ), whereby Tiber Creek
	would provide assistance to the Company in effecting transactions for the Company to combine with a public reporting company,
	including: transferring control of such reporting company to the Company; causing the preparation and filing of forms, including
	a registration statement, with the Securities and Exchange Commission; assist in listing its securities on a trading exchange;
	and assist in establishing and maintaining relationships with market makers and broker-dealers.


	Â 


	The Companyâs then-current shareholders,
	James Cassidy and James McKillop, were permitted to retain the aggregate total of 200,000 shares (100,000 of these shares are restricted
	from transfer for a period of one (1) year following the effective date of this registration statement).


	Â 


	In general, Tiber Creek holds interests
	in inactive Delaware corporations which may be used by issuers (such as the Company) to reincorporate their business in the State
	of Delaware and capitalize the issuer at a level and in a manner (i.e. the number of authorized shares and rights and preferences
	of shareholders) that is appropriate for a public company. Otherwise, these corporations are inactive, and Tiber Creek does not
	conduct any business in such corporations.


	Â 


	James Cassidy and James McKillop serve
	only as interim officers and directors of these corporations (such as Ruby Island Acquisition Corporation) until such time as the
	changes of control in such corporations are effectuated to the ultimate registering issuers. As the role of Tiber Creek is essentially
	limited to preparing the corporate structure and organizing the Company for becoming a public company, the roles of Mr. Cassidy
	and Mr. McKillop are generally limited to facilitating such change of control and securities registration transactions.


	Â 



	Intellectual Property



	Â 


	At present, the Company does not possess
	any intellectual property protection. The Company may decide in the future to pursue efforts to protect its intellectual property,
	trade secrets and proprietary methods and processes.


	Â 



	Research and Development



	Â 


	The Company has conducted limited
	market research and has initiated development of its web and mobile applications, as discussed throughout this Registration Statement.
	The Company intends to conduct further research and development through development of its business plan.


	Â 



	Employees



	Â 


	Currently, the Company has no employees
	other than its officer who has agreed to assist the Company without pay until the Company is more stable and has recurring cash
	flow from operations.


	Â 



	Property



	Â 


	The Company does not currently own
	any real property. The Company is a party to a lease agreement for occupancy of office space located at 42211 N. 41st Drive, A105,
	Phoenix, AZ 85086.


	Â 



	Subsidiaries



	Â 


	The Company has no subsidiaries.


	Â 



	Jumpstart Our Business Startups
	Act




	Â 



	In April 2012, the Jumpstart Our
	Business Startups Act (âJOBS Actâ) was enacted into law. The JOBS Act provides, among other things:


	Â 


	Exemptions for emerging growth companies
	from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years and provides a new form of financing to small
	companies;


	Â 


	Amendments to certain provisions
	of the federal securities laws to simplify the sale of securities and increase the threshold number of record holders required
	to trigger the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;

	Relaxation of the general solicitation
	and general advertising prohibition for Rule 506 offerings;


	Â 


	Adoption of a new exemption for
	public offerings of securities in amounts not exceeding $50 million; and


	Â 


	Exemption from registration by a
	non-reporting company of offers and sales of securities of up to $1,000,000 that comply with rules to be adopted by the SEC pursuant
	to Section 4(6) of the Securities Act and exemption of such sales from state law registration, documentation or offering requirements.


	Â 


	In general, under the JOBS Act a
	company is an emerging growth company if its initial public offering (âIPOâ) of common equity securities was effected
	after December 8, 2011 and the company had less than $1 billion of total annual gross revenues during its last completed fiscal
	year. A company will no longer qualify as an emerging growth company after the earliest of


	Â 


	(i) the completion of the fiscal
	year in which the company has total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more,


	(ii) the completion of the fiscal
	year of the fifth anniversary of the companyâs IPO;


	(iii) the companyâs issuance
	of more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt in the prior three-year period, or


	(iv) the company becoming a âlarger
	accelerated filerâ as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.



	Â 



	The JOBS Act provides additional
	new guidelines and exemptions for non-reporting companies and for non-public offerings. Those exemptions that impact the Company
	are discussed below.



	Â 




	Financial Disclosure.

	The
	financial disclosure in a registration statement filed by an emerging growth company pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 will
	differ from registration statements filed by other companies as follows:


	Â 


	(i) audited financial statements
	required for only two fiscal years;


	(ii) selected financial data required
	for only the fiscal years that were audited;


	(iii) executive compensation only
	needs to be presented in the limited format now required for smaller reporting companies.


	(A smaller reporting company is
	one with a public float of less than $75 million as of the last day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter)


	Â 


	However, the requirements for financial
	disclosure provided by Regulation S-K promulgated by the Rules and Regulations of the SEC already provide certain of these exemptions
	for smaller reporting companies. The Company is a smaller reporting company. Currently a smaller reporting company is not required
	to file as part of its registration statement selected financial data and only needs audited financial statements for its two most
	current fiscal years and no tabular disclosure of contractual obligations.


	Â 


	The JOBS Act also exempts the Companyâs
	independent registered public accounting firm from complying with any rules adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight
	Board (âPCAOBâ) after the date of the JOBS Actâs enactment, except as otherwise required by SEC rule.


	Â 


	The JOBS Act also exempts an emerging
	growth company from any requirement adopted by the PCAOB for mandatory rotation of the Companyâs accounting firm or for a
	supplemental auditor report about the audit.


	Â 



	Internal Control Attestation.

	The JOBS Act also provides an exemption from the requirement of the Companyâs independent registered public accounting
	firm to file a report on the Companyâs internal control over financial reporting, although management of the Company is still
	required to file its report on the adequacy of the Companyâs internal control over financial reporting.


	Â 


	Section 102(a) of the JOBS Act exempts
	emerging growth companies from the requirements in Â§14A(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for companies with a class
	of securities registered under the 1934 Act to hold shareholder votes for executive compensation and golden parachutes.



	Â 




	Other Items of the JOBS Act.

	The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can communicate with potential investors that are qualified institutional
	buyers or institutions that are accredited to determine interest in a contemplated offering either prior to or after the date of
	filing the respective registration statement. The Act also permits research reports by a broker or dealer about an emerging growth
	company regardless if such report provides sufficient information for an investment decision. In addition the JOBS Act precludes
	the SEC and FINRA from adopting certain restrictive rules or regulations regarding brokers, dealers and potential investors, communications
	with management and distribution of a research reports on the emerging growth company IPO.


	Â 


	Section 106 of the JOBS Act permits
	emerging growth companies to submit 1933 Act registration statements on a confidential basis provided that the registration statement
	and all amendments are publicly filed at least 21 days before the issuer conducts any road show. This is intended to allow the
	emerging growth company to explore the IPO option without disclosing to the market the fact that it is seeking to go public or
	disclosing the information contained in its registration statement until the company is ready to conduct a roadshow.


	Â 



	Election to Opt Out of Transition
	Period.

	Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised
	financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a 1933 Act registration statement declared
	effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial
	accounting standard.


	Â 


	The JOBS Act provides a company
	can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies
	but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of the transition period.

	Reports to Security Holders



	Â 


	In May 2016, the Company (as Ruby
	Island Acquisition Corporation) filed a Form 10-12G general registration of securities pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act
	of 1934 and is a reporting company pursuant such Act and files with the Securities and Exchange Commission quarterly and annual
	reports and management shareholding information. The Company intends to deliver a copy of its annual report to its security holders,
	and will voluntarily send a copy of the annual report, including audited financial statements, to any registered shareholder who
	requests the same.


	Â 


	The Companyâs documents filed
	with the Securities and Exchange Commission may be inspected at the Commissionâs principal office in Washington, D.C. Copies
	of all or any part of the registration statement may be obtained from the Public Reference Section of the Securities and Exchange
	Commission, 100 F Street N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Call the Commission at 1-800-SEC-0330 for further information on the operation
	of the public reference rooms. The Securities and Exchange Commission also maintains a web site at http://www.sec.gov that contains
	reports, proxy statements and information regarding registrants that file electronically with the Commission. All of the Companyâs
	filings may be located under the CIK number 0001672900.

	PLAN OF OPERATION




	Â 




	Business Plan




	Â 



	The Company is an early-stage web
	and mobile application company designed to deliver informative products to the common investor in todayâs global markets.
	The Company intends to offer both consumer-facing and investor-facing products. The Company intends to initially offer 12 chart
	applications that will be available for free via Android Google Play Store and iTunes. As popularity of the Companyâs products
	increases and user base grows, the Company then intends to convert its users into advertising revenue. The Company anticipates
	converting users into advertising revenue at a rate of approximately $1.56 per user, based on comparison to lowest valuation social
	media platforms in comparable market space.


	Â 


	In the future, the Company plans
	to raise capital to support its plan of operations. The Company would raise capital and use the proceeds of its offering to hire
	sales and marketing professionals, to retain professionals and hire other key personnel, for purposes of working capital operations,
	executive compensation, and to conduct further market research and for further development of mobile applications and product catalogue.


	Â 



	Potential Revenue



	Â 


	The Company expects to earn potential
	revenue through conversion of its users into digital advertising revenue, at return of a projected $1.56 per user. The Company
	prospects for new users on an ongoing basis and will also seek additional revenue streams as its products gain in popularity, creating
	subsequent demand for fee and subscription based add-on products.



	Â 







	MANAGEMENTâS DISCUSSION
	AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION




	AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS




	Â 



	The Company is a development stage company
	and was incorporated in the State of Delaware in April 2016. As of the periods from inception, through the date of this prospectus,
	the Company did not generate any revenue and incurred minimal expenses and operating losses, as part of its development stage activities.
	The Company has experienced a net loss and accumulated deficit of $75,569, and has accrued $81,600 in total liabilities as of March
	31, 2017.


	Â 


	The Company anticipates that it
	would need substantial working capital over the next 12 months to continue as a going concern and to expand its operations to distribute,
	sell and market products and solutions.


	Â 


	The Companyâs independent
	auditors have expressed substantial doubt as to the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. Unless the Company is
	able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and/or obtain additional financing, there is a substantial doubt as to the
	ability of the company to continue as a going concern.


	Â 



	Overview



	Â 


	The Company is a United States-based
	startup web and mobile application company designed to deliver informative products to the common investor in todayâs global
	markets. The Company intends to offer investors and traders a sophisticated, trustworthy, and individualized way to get actionable
	daily information for the burgeoning self-directed market. Over the past few years, founder David Meyers has developed a unique
	collection of daily information sources that provide systematic and common sense insights for making trades on virtually any market.
	He has become an investment guru to the everyday investor as a go-to expert on CNBC and TheStreet.com, among others. Common Man
	Investor is the resulting platform that is being launched to further this reach and provide a series of digital products for the
	everyday, âCommon Manâ investor.


	Â 


	The Company had a cash balance of $3,254 and $1,468 as
	of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively and as of March 31, 2017 has earned no revenues nor realized any profits.


	Â 


	The Company intends to make an equity
	offering of its common stock for the acquisition and operation expenses. If it cannot raise the required cash, the Company will
	issue additional shares of common stock in lieu of cash.

	Potential Revenue



	Â 


	The main consumer-facing products
	will consist of a series of mobile applications that boil investing down to its most simple elements. The Company will focus its
	offering to 12 chart-types that, in opinion of the Company based on research and expertise of its founder, represent the most sought-after
	charts by its target consumers. The Companyâs proprietary Apps will utilize these charts to create a streamlined, user-friendly
	information source that pushes daily lists and investment advice to subscribers. For example, the Head and Shoulders app shall
	deliver daily reports on the âHead-and-Shouldersâ pattern based on monthly NASDAQ trends. The chart shall then alert
	investors when a securityâs price is set to fall from its peak (the head) or rise from the bottom (shoulders) of a price
	pattern. It is a non-biased, objective way of giving investors the information they need to make informed decisions.


	Â 


	A La Carte Chartâs apps will
	use off-the-shelf information from the NASDAQ and other markets, coupled with historically based investment data. The 12 chart
	apps will be available for free via Android Google Play Store and iTunes. As popularity of the Companyâs products increases
	and user base grows, the Company then intends to convert its users into advertising revenue. The Company anticipates converting
	users into advertising revenue at a rate of approximately $1.56 per user, based on comparison to lowest valuation social media
	platforms in comparable market space.



	Â 




	Alternative Financial Planning



	Â 


	If the Company is not able to generate
	increased revenues and profits and/or successfully raise monies as needed through a private placement or other securities offering
	(including, but not limited to, a primary public offering of securities), the Companyâs founder and President David Meyers
	will loan financing to the Company, as needed, to continue operations until the Company achieves profitability. If the Company
	is unable to generate revenues and profits and/or successfully raise additional funds as needed, the Companyâs ability to
	expand its business plan or strategy over the following two years will be jeopardized.


	Â 



	Equipment Financing



	Â 


	The Company has no existing equipment
	financing arrangements.


	Â 



	Critical Accounting Policies



	Â 


	The financial statements of the
	Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of
	these financial statements requires making estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
	and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates are based on historical experience and
	on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of
	making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
	may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.


	Â 



	Development Stage and Capital
	Resources



	Â 


	Since its inception, the Company
	has devoted substantially all of its efforts to business planning. Accordingly, the Company is considered to be in the development
	stage. The Company has not generated revenues from its operations, and there is no assurance of future revenues.


	Â 


	There is no assurance that the Companyâs
	activities will result in any operations or that any operations, if begun, will generate revenues. The Company will need additional
	capital, but there is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain such capital on terms satisfactory to the Company. Accordingly,
	given the Companyâs limited cash and cash equivalents on hand, the Company will be unable to implement its business plans
	and proposed operations unless it obtains additional financing or otherwise is able to generate revenues and profits. The Company
	may raise additional capital through sales of debt or equity, obtain loan financing or develop and consummate other alternative
	financial plans.

	Discussion of the Three Months
	Ending March 31, 2017



	Â 


	The Company did not generate revenues
	during the three months ended March 31, 2017.


	Â 


	The Company posted operating expenses
	of $62,409 during the three months ended March 31, 2017.


	Â 


	Operating loss and net loss for the
	Company were each, respectively, $62,409 and $62,409, for the three months period ended March 31, 2017.


	Â 


	The Company does not anticipate
	that it will generate revenue sufficient to cover its planned operating expenses in the foreseeable future, and the Company must
	obtain additional financing in order to develop and implement its business plan and proposed operations. If the Company is not
	successful in generating sufficient revenues and/or obtaining additional funding to develop its business plan and proposed operations,
	this could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations liquidity and financial condition.


	Â 



	Discussion of the Period from
	April 4, 2016 (inception) through December 31, 2016



	Â 


	The Company
	is in the development phase and as of December 31, 2016. The Company had not generated revenues and had no income or cash flows
	from operations since inception. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had sustained net loss of $13,160 and a working capital deficit
	of $4,132.


	Â 


	The Companyâs
	independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt about the Companyâs ability to continue as a going concern
	and is dependent upon financial support from its stockholders and its ability to obtain necessary equity financing to continue
	operations.


	Â 


	Management will
	pay all expenses incurred by the Company. There is no expectation of repayment for such current expenses.


	Â 


	The sole officer
	and director of the Company is also the majority shareholder of the Company holding 5,000,000 shares of the aggregate 6,799,600
	or 74%.


	Â 


	The Company
	was incorporated on April 4, 2016 under the laws of the State of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including,
	but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions. In May, 2016, the Company registered its common stock on a Form 10 registration
	statement filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 12(g) thereof. The Company files with the Securities and
	Exchange Commission periodic and current reports under Rule 13(a) of the Exchange Act, as a public reporting company.


	Â 


	Pursuant to
	the change in control, the Companyâs primary objective is to provide create its daily âcharts,â delivered through
	12 state-of-the-art apps. Each App will revolve around a specific trading strategy or market trend, such as the Head and Shoulders
	App, Bullish Wedge App, Commodities in Contango App, and Ascending Triangles App, among others. Through nuts-and-bolts data on
	market trends and sound real-world advice, subscribers find practical information they can use in their trading and investing.


	Â 


	2016 Year-End Analysis


	Â 


	The Company
	has received no income, has had no operations nor expenses, other than Delaware state fees and accounting fees as required for
	incorporation and for the preparation of the Companyâs financial statements.

	Â 


	As of March 31, 2017, there was no
	accrued compensation that was due to the Companyâs employees or officers. Upon successful completion by the Company of a
	primary public offering in the future (or the completion of other financing or funding), however, the Company may compensate officers
	and employees as is discussed below in âAnticipated Officer and Director Remuneration.â


	Â 


	Each of the officers has received
	certain shares of common stock in the Company in connection with the change of control of the Company. Accordingly, the Company
	has not recorded any compensation expense in respect of any shares issued to the officers as such shares do not represent compensation
	that was paid to any officer.


	Â 


	There are no current plans to pay
	or distribute any cash or non-cash bonus compensation to officers of the Company, until such time as the Company is profitable,
	experiences positive cash flow or obtains additional financing. However, the Board of Directors may allocate salaries and benefits
	to the officers in its sole discretion. No officer is subject to a compensation plan or arrangement that results from his or her
	resignation, retirement, or any other termination of employment with the Company or from a change in control of the company or
	a change in his or her responsibilities following a change in control. The members of the Board of Directors may receive, if the
	Board so decides, a fixed fee and reimbursement of expenses, for attendance at each regular or special meeting of the Board, although
	no such program has been adopted to date. The Company currently has no retirement, pension, or profit-sharing plan covering its
	officers and directors; however, the Company plans to implement certain such benefits after sufficient funds are realized or raised
	by the Company (see âAnticipated Officer and Director Remunerationâ below.)



	Â 




	Employment Agreements




	Â 



	The Company has not entered into
	employment agreements with any of its employees.


	Â 



	Anticipated Officer and Director
	Remuneration

	The Company pays no compensation
	to its officers or directors at present. The Company intends to pay regular, competitive annual salaries to all its officers and
	directors and will pay an annual stipend to its directors when, and if, it completes a primary public offering for the sale of
	securities and/or the Company reaches greater profitability, experiences larger and more sustained positive cash flow and/or obtains
	additional funding. At such time, the Company anticipates offering additional cash and non-cash compensation to officers and directors.
	In addition, the Company anticipates that its officers and directors will be provided with additional fringe benefits and perquisites
	at subsidizes rates, or at the sole expense of the Company, as may be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Company in its
	sole discretion. In addition, the Company may plan to offer retirement benefits at a later time in its sole discretion.

	SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE



	Â 


	As of the date
	of this prospectus, there are 6,799,600 shares of common stock outstanding of which 5,000,000 shares are owned by officers and
	directors of the Company. There will be a total of 8,799,600 shares outstanding if the maximum number of Shares offered herein
	is sold, of which 5,000,000 would be owned by officers and directors of the Company.


	Â 


	The shares of
	common stock held by current shareholders are considered ârestricted securitiesâ subject to the limitations of Rule
	144 under the Securities Act. In general, securities may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 after being fully-paid and held for more
	than 12 months. While affiliates of the Company are subject to certain limits in the amount of restricted securities they can sell
	under Rule 144, there are no such limitations on sales by persons who are not affiliates of the Company. In the event non-affiliated
	holders elect to sell such shares in the public market, there is likely to be a negative effect on the market price of the Companyâs
	securities.


	Â 


	However, at present, due to the
	Companyâs previous status as a shell company, shareholders cannot currently rely upon Rule 144 for resales of the Companyâs
	securities (pursuant to Rule 144(i)).


	Â 


	Rule 144 establishes specific criteria
	for determining whether a person is not engaged in a distribution of securities. Among other things, Rule 144 creates a safe harbor
	whereby a person satisfying the applicable conditions of the Rule 144 safe harbor is deemed not to be engaged in a distribution
	of the securities and therefore not an underwriter of the securities. If a purchaser of securities is unable to rely upon Rule
	144 to sell securities (due to Rule 144(i)), then the securities must be registered or another exemption from registration must
	be found in order for the distribution of securities to be made. In the event that the securities are not registered or another
	exemption is not found, a purchaser of securities cannot sell or transfer the shares of common stock in the Company since the Company
	does not meet the requirements of Rule 144(i)(2).


	Â 


	Pursuant to Rule 144(i), reliance
	upon Rule 144 is typically available for the resale of restricted or unrestricted securities that were initially issued by a reporting
	or non-reporting shell company (or an issuer that has been at any time previously a reporting or non-reporting shell company) only
	if the following conditions are met:


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	The issuer of the securities that was formerly a reporting or non-reporting shell company has ceased to be a shell company;





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	The issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	The issuer of the securities has filed all reports and material required to be filed under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than Form 8-K reports; and





	Â 


	Â 


	Â 




	Â 



	â




	At least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed current Form 10 type information with the Commission reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company.






	Â 







	LEGAL MATTERS



	Â 


	Cassidy & Associates, Beverly
	Hills, California (âCassidy & Associatesâ), has given its opinion as attorneys-at-law regarding the validity of
	the issuance of the Shares offered by the Company. A member of the law firm of Cassidy & Associates is an officer and director
	of Tiber Creek Corporation and may be considered the beneficial owner of the 100,000 shares of common stock of the Company.


	Â 



	Interest of Counsel




	Â 



	Cassidy & Associates, counsel for
	the Company, who has given an opinion upon the validity of the securities being registered and upon other legal matters in connection
	with the registration or offering of such securities, had, or is to receive in connection with the offering, a substantial interest
	in the Company and was connected with the Company through Ruby Island Acquisition Corporation. James Cassidy, a partner of Cassidy
	& Associates, was a director and officer of Ruby Island Acquisition Corporation prior to its change of control.

	DISCLOSURE OF COMMISSION POSITION
	ON INDEMNIFICATION




	FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES



	Â 


	The Companyâs certificate
	of incorporation includes an indemnification provision that provides that the Company shall indemnify directors against monetary
	damages to the Company or any of its shareholders or others by reason of a breach of the directorâs fiduciary duty or otherwise,
	except under certain limited circumstances.


	Â 


	The certificate of incorporation
	does not specifically indemnify the officers or directors or controlling persons against liability under the Securities Act. However,
	the indemnification provided in the certificate of incorporation is broad and should be considered to be of a broad scope and wide
	extent.


	Â 


	The Securities and Exchange Commissionâs
	position on indemnification of officers, directors and control persons under the Securities Act by the Company is as follows:


	Â 



	INSOFAR AS INDEMNIFICATION FOR
	LIABILITIES ARISING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 MAY BE PERMITTED TO DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND CONTROLLING PERSONS OF THE SMALL
	BUSINESS ISSUER PURSUANT TO THE RULES OF THE COMMISSION, OR OTHERWISE, THE SMALL BUSINESS ISSUER HAS BEEN ADVISED THAT IN THE OPINION
	OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION SUCH INDEMNIFICATION IS AGAINST PUBLIC POLICY AS EXPRESSED IN THE ACT AND IS, THEREFORE,
	UNENFORCEABLE.

	REPORT
	OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM








	Â 



	To
	the Board of Directors and Stockholders




	A
	La Carte Charts Corporation




	Â 



	We have audited the balance sheet
	of A La Carte Charts Corporation (formerly known as Ruby Island Acquisition Corporation, the "Company") as of December
	31, 2016, and the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows from April 4, 2016 (Inception
	Date) to December 31, 2016. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility
	is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.



	Â 




	We
	conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
	require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
	misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
	reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures
	that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's
	internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test
	basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
	significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
	our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.




	Â 



	In our opinion, the financial
	statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31,
	2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows from April 4, 2016 (Inception Date) to December 31, 2016, in conformity
	with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.



	Â 




	The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
	1 to the financial statements, the Company has experienced liquidity issues, including a working capital deficit. The Company
	has not generated sufficient cash flow to repay its current and future obligations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about
	the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Further information and management's plans in regard to this uncertainty
	are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
	uncertainty.

	NOTE
	1 â NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND GOING CONCERN





	Â 




	As
	used herein and except as otherwise noted, the term âCompanyâ, âit(s)â, âourâ, âusâ,
	âweâ and âA La Carteâ shall mean A La Carte Charts Corporation, a Delaware corporation.Â 




	Â 




	A
	La Carte Charts Corporation, formerly known as Ruby Island Acquisition Corporation, incorporated on April 4, 2016 under the laws
	of the state of Delaware, A La Carte Charts Corporation (the "Company" or "ALCC"), a United States-based startup
	web and mobile application company designed to deliver informative products to the common investor in today's global markets and
	offer investors and traders a sophisticated, trustworthy, and individualized way to get actionable daily information for the burgeoning
	self-directed market. In May 2016, the Company filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form
	10 by which it became a public reporting company. The main products of the Company are its daily âcharts,â delivered
	through 12 state-of-the-art apps. Apps will each revolve around a specific trading strategy or market trend, such as the Head
	and Shoulders App, Bullish Wedge App, Commodities in Contango App, and Ascending Triangles App, among others. Through nuts-and-bolts
	data on market trends and sound real-world advice, subscribers find practical information they can use in their trading and investing.




	Â 




	On
	December 13, 2016, the Company implemented a change of control by redeeming shares of existing shareholders, issuing shares to
	new shareholders, electing new officers and directors and accepting the resignations of its then existing officers and directors.
	In connection with the change of control, the shareholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the
	change of the Companyâs name from Ruby Island Acquisition Corporation to A La Carte Charts Corporation.




	Â 






	Going
	Concern






	The
	Companyâs financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America
	applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal
	course of business. The Company has not yet generated any revenue and has sustained operating losses since April 4, 2016 (Inception
	Date) to date and allow it to continue as a going concern. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon
	the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary financing to continue operations,
	and the attainment of profitable operations. The Company incurred a net loss of $13,160 from Inception Date to the year ended
	December 31, 2016, used net cash in operating activities of $52, has a working capital deficit of $4,132, and has an accumulated
	deficit of $13,160 as of December 31, 2016. These factors, among others raise a substantial doubt regarding the Companyâs
	ability to continue as a going concern. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.
	The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the recoverability and classification of recorded
	asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

	Notes
	to Financial Statements






	December
	31, 2016






	Â 






	NOTE
	2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





	Â 




	The
	following summary of significant accounting policies of the Company is presented to assist in the understanding of the Companyâs
	financial statements. The financial statements and notes are the representation of the Companyâs management who is responsible
	for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United
	States of America ("GAAP") in all material respects, and have been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying
	financial statements. Â 




	Â 






	Use
	of Estimates






	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	(U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
	disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
	expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the valuation of accounts
	and factored receivables, valuation of long-lived assets, accrued liabilities, note payable and deferred income tax asset valuation
	allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors
	that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
	carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources.
	The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Companyâs estimates. To the extent
	there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.




	Â 






	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents






	The
	Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents.
	The Company had a cash balance of $1,468 as of December 31, 2016.




	Â 






	Concentration
	of Risk






	Financial
	instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places
	its cash with high quality banking institutions. The Company does not have the cash balances in excess of the Federal Deposit
	Insurance Corporation limit at December 31, 2016.





	Â 







	Income
	Taxes






	The
	Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, â

	Income Taxesâ

	.
	The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences
	of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax
	credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. The Company
	records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.

	Notes
	to Financial Statements






	December
	31, 2016





	Â 




	The
	Company follows the provisions of ASC 740-10, â

	Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions

	.â When tax returns
	are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while
	others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately
	sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements
	in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position
	will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are
	not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured
	as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable
	taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described
	above should be reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets along with
	any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.Â 




	Â 






	Earnings
	(Loss) Per Common Share






	The
	Company computes net earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, â

	Earnings per Shareâ

	. ASC 260 requires
	presentation of both basic and diluted net earnings per share (âEPSâ) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS
	is computed by dividing earnings (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares
	outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during
	the period using the treasury stock method and convertible note and preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing
	diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the
	exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. At
	December 31, 2016, there were no convertible notes, options or warrants available for conversion that if exercised, may dilute
	future earnings per share.




	Â 






	Fair
	value of Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements






	ASC
	820,Â â

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosuresâ,

	requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs
	and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the
	level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrumentâs categorization
	within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC
	820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:





	Â 






	Level
	1





	Level
	1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

	Notes
	to Financial Statements






	December
	31, 2016






	Â 






	Level
	2





	Level
	2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability
	such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in
	markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant
	inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. If the asset or liability
	has a specified (contractual) term, the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.




	Â 





	Level
	3





	Level
	3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to
	the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.




	Â 




	The
	Companyâs financial instruments consist principally of cash, accrued liabilities and payable to related party. Pursuant
	to ASC 820,Â â

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosuresâ

	Â and ASC 825,Â â

	Financial Instrumentsâ

	,
	the fair value of our cash equivalents is determined based on âLevel 1â inputs, which consist of quoted prices in
	active markets for identical assets. The Company believes that the recorded values of all the other financial instruments approximate
	their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations.




	Â 






	Recent
	Accounting Pronouncements






	In
	November 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-18, â

	Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted
	Cashâ (âASU 2016-18â)

	. The new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice by adding or clarifying
	guidance on classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 is effective
	for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this update should
	be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-18 noting
	it will only impact the Company to the extent it has restricted cash in the future.




	Â 




	In
	August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, â

	Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
	and Cash Payments

	â (âASU 2016-15â). ASU 2016-15 will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and
	cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning
	after December 15, 2017. The new standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply,
	in which case it would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently
	in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-15 on its financial statements.

	In
	June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-13, "

	Financial Instruments - Credit Losses

	(Topic 326)." The new standard amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and
	available-for-sale debt securities. This ASU is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December
	15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine
	the impact it may have on its financial statements.



	Â 



	In
	2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, â

	Income Taxesâ

	(Topic 740):

	Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred
	Taxes

	, which requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet.
	Current US GAAP requires an entity to separate deferred tax assets and liabilities into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified
	balance sheet. For public entities, ASU 2015-17 is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after
	December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. For all other entities, ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual
	reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018,
	and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively, with early application permitted for financial statements that have
	not been previously issued. The Company has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this standard on the Companyâs
	financial position and results of operations.



	Â 



	In
	August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, â

	Presentation of Financial StatementsâGoing Concern

	(Subtopic
	205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entityâs Ability to Continue as a Going Concernâ. This standard is intended
	to define managementâs responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organizationâs ability
	to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. Under U.S. GAAP, financial statements are prepared
	under the presumption that the reporting organization will continue to operate as a going concern, except in limited circumstances.
	Financial reporting under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern
	basis of accounting is critical to financial reporting because it establishes the fundamental basis for measuring and classifying
	assets and liabilities. Currently, U.S. GAAP lacks guidance about managementâs responsibility to evaluate whether there
	is substantial doubt about the organizationâs ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures.
	This ASU provides guidance to an organizationâs management, with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce
	diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement

	loss. If the Company has the potential to recover a portion of the estimated loss from a third party, the Company makes a separate
	assessment of recoverability and reduces the estimated loss if recovery is also deemed probable.

	Â 





	On
	December 19, 2016, the Company sold 920,000 shares of its common stock to the friends and family (âInvestorsâ) at
	$0.01 per share and raised $920.00. All the stock certificates issued to the Investors have been affixed with an appropriate legend
	restricting sales and transfers. Therefore, based on the foregoing, the Company has issued the shares in reliance upon the exemptions
	from registration provided by Section 4a (2) of the Securities Act of 1933.



	Â 


	On December 28, 2016, the Company entered
	into a contract with two professional athletes and issued to each of them, 339,800 shares of common stock representing 5% (five
	percent) of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock, in exchange for granting the Company license to use their
	name and likeness in association with the promotional use of the Companyâs business activities and marketing of its products.
	The Company has issued to these two athletes a total of 679,600 shares of common stock at $6,796, or $0.01 per share on the date
	of issuance.



	Â 




	As
	a result of all common stock issuances, the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock at December 31, 2016 were 6,799,600.




	Â 






	Preferred
	stock






	Â 



	The Company is authorized to issue 20,000,000
	shares of preferred stock. At December 31, 2016, the Company had no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding.

	31, 2016 are as follows:

	Â 




	Deferred
	income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of deferred taxes
	related primarily to differences between the bases of certain assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting. The deferred
	taxes represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be deductible or taxable when the assets
	and liabilities are recovered or settled.

	Notes
	to Financial Statements






	December
	31, 2016





	Â 




	At
	December 31, 2016, the Company had net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $13,160 resulting in deferred tax assets
	recorded of $5,230, which begin to expire in 2034. The Company has recorded a 100% valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets
	due to the uncertainty of its realization. The net change in the valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2016 was
	an increase of $5,230.




	Â 




	In
	the normal course of business, the Companyâs income tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities.
	Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessment by these taxing authorities. Accordingly, the Company believes
	that it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefits of tax positions it has taken in its tax returns or for the
	amount of any tax benefit that exceeds the cumulative probability threshold in accordance with FASB ASC 740-10-15. Differences
	between the estimated and actual amounts determined upon ultimate resolution, individually or in the aggregate, are not expected
	to have a material adverse effect on the companyâs financial position. The Company believes its tax positions are all highly
	certain of being upheld upon examination. As such, the Company has not recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits. As
	of December 31, 2016, tax year 2016 remains open for IRS audit. The Company has received no notice of audit from the Internal
	Revenue Service for any of the open tax years.





	Â 






	NOTE
	7 â SUBSEQUENT EVENTS





	Â 




	Management
	has evaluated subsequent events through April 17, 2017, the date the financial statements were available to be issued, noting
	no items that would impact the accounting for events or transactions in the current period or require additional disclosure.

	Notes
	to Condensed Financial Statements

	(Unaudited)





	Â 





	NOTE
	1 â NATURE OF OPERATIONS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND GOING CONCERN





	Â 




	As
	used herein and except as otherwise noted, the term âCompanyâ, âit(s)â, âourâ, âusâ,
	âweâ, âALCCâ and âA La Carteâ shall mean A La Carte Charts Corporation, a Delaware corporation.




	Â 




	A
	La Carte Charts Corporation, formerly known as Ruby Island Acquisition Corporation, was incorporated on April 4, 2016 under the
	laws of the state of Delaware. A La Carte Charts, a United States-based startup web and mobile application company was designed
	to deliver informative products to the common investor in today's global markets and offer investors and traders a sophisticated,
	trustworthy, and individualized way to get actionable daily information for the burgeoning self-directed market. In May 2016,
	the Company filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10 by which it became a public
	reporting company. The main products of the Company are its daily âcharts,â delivered through 12 state-of-the-art
	apps. Apps will each revolve around a specific trading strategy or market trend, such as the Head and Shoulders App, Bullish Wedge
	App, Commodities in Contango App, and Ascending Triangles App, among others. Through nuts-and-bolts data on market trends and
	sound real-world advice, subscribers find practical information they can use in their trading and investing.




	Â 




	On
	December 13, 2016, the Company implemented a change of control by redeeming shares of existing shareholders, issuing shares to
	new shareholders, electing new officers and directors and accepting the resignations of its then existing officers and directors.
	In connection with the change of control, the shareholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the
	change of the Companyâs name from Ruby Island Acquisition Corporation to A La Carte Charts Corporation.




	Â 






	Basis
	of Presentation






	The
	accompanying interim condensed financial statements are unaudited, but in the opinion of management of the Company, contain all
	adjustments, which include normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position at March 31, 2017,
	and the results of operations and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The balance sheet as of December 31, 2016
	is derived from the Companyâs audited financial statements.




	Â 




	Certain
	information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally
	accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
	Commission, although management of the Company believes that the disclosures contained in these interim condensed financial
	statements are adequate to make the information presented therein not misleading. For further information, refer to the financial
	statements and the notes thereto contained in the Companyâs 2016 Annual Report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
	on Form 10-K on April 17, 2017.




	Â 






	Going
	Concern





	The Companyâs financial statements
	are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which
	contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not
	yet generated any revenue and has sustained operating losses since April 4, 2016 (Inception Date) to date and allow it to continue
	as a going concern. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from
	its shareholders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary financing to continue operations, and the attainment of profitable
	operations. The Company incurred a net loss of $62,409 from January 1, 2017 to March 31, 2017, used net cash in operating activities
	of $69,426, has a working capital deficit of $78,346, and has an accumulated deficit of $75,569 as of March 31, 2017. These factors,
	among others raise a substantial doubt regarding the Companyâs ability to continue as a going concern. If the Company is
	unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include
	any adjustments to reflect the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that
	might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.






	Â 






	NOTE
	2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





	Â 




	The
	following summary of significant accounting policies of the Company is presented to assist in the understanding of the Companyâs
	financial statements. The financial statements and notes are the representation of the Companyâs management who is responsible
	for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United
	States of America ("GAAP") in all material respects, and have been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying
	financial statements.




	Â 






	Use
	of Estimates






	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	(U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
	disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
	expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the valuation of accounts
	and factored receivables, valuation of long-lived assets, accrued liabilities, note payable and deferred income tax asset valuation
	allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors
	that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
	carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources.
	The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Companyâs estimates. To the extent
	there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.

	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents






	The
	Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents.
	The Company had a cash balance of $3,254 and $1,468 as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.




	Â 






	Concentration
	of Risk






	Financial
	instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places
	its cash with high quality banking institutions. The Company does not have the cash balances in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance
	Corporation limit at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.





	Â 







	Income
	Taxes






	The
	Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, â

	Income Taxesâ

	.
	The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences
	of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax
	credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. The Company
	records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.




	Â 



	The Company follows the provisions of
	ASC 740-10, â

	Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions

	.â When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain
	that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty
	about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the
	guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based
	on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination,
	including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other
	positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit
	that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the
	benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability
	for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying condensed balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that
	would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.





	Â 






	Earnings
	(Loss) Per Common Share






	The
	Company computes net earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, â

	Earnings per Shareâ

	. ASC 260 requires
	presentation of both basic and diluted net earnings per share (âEPSâ) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS
	is computed by dividing earnings (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares
	outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during
	the period using the treasury stock method and convertible note and preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing
	diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the
	exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. At
	March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, there were no convertible notes, options or warrants available for conversion that if exercised,
	may dilute future earnings per share.




	Â 






	Fair
	value of Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements






	ASC
	820,Â â

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosuresâ,

	requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs
	and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the
	level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrumentâs categorization
	within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC
	820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:





	Â 






	Level
	1





	Level
	1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

	Â 








	Table of Contents

	Â 






	Â 






	Level
	2





	Level
	2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability
	such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in
	markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant
	inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. If the asset or liability
	has a specified (contractual) term, the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.




	Â 





	Level
	3





	Level
	3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to
	the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.




	Â 




	The
	Companyâs financial instruments consist principally of cash, prepaid deposits, accrued liabilities and payable to
	related party. Pursuant to ASC 820,Â â

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosuresâ

	Â and ASC
	825,Â â

	Financial Instrumentsâ

	, the fair value of our cash equivalents is determined based on
	âLevel 1â inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The Company believes
	that the recorded values of all the other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature
	and respective maturity dates or durations.

	Recent
	Accounting Pronouncements






	In
	November 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-18, â

	Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted
	Cashâ (âASU 2016-18â)

	. The new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice by adding or clarifying
	guidance on classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 is effective
	for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this update should
	be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-18 noting
	it will only impact the Company to the extent it has restricted cash in the future.




	Â 




	In
	August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, â

	Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
	and Cash Payments

	â (âASU 2016-15â). ASU 2016-15 will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and
	cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning
	after December 15, 2017. The new standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply,
	in which case it would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently
	in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-15 on its financial statements.




	Â 




	In
	June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-13, "

	Financial Instruments - Credit Losses

	(Topic 326)." The new standard amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and
	available-for-sale debt securities. This ASU is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December
	15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine
	the impact it may have on its financial statements.




	Â 




	In
	2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, â

	Income Taxesâ

	(Topic 740):

	Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred
	Taxes

	, which requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet.
	Current US GAAP requires an entity to separate deferred tax assets and liabilities into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified
	balance sheet. For public entities, ASU 2015-17 is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after
	December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. For all other entities, ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual
	reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018,
	and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively, with early application permitted for financial statements that have
	not been previously issued. The Company has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this standard on the Companyâs
	financial position and results of operations.

	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
	2014-15, â

	Presentation of Financial StatementsâGoing Concern

	(Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties
	about an Entityâs Ability to Continue as a Going Concernâ. This standard is intended to define managementâs responsibility
	to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organizationâs ability to continue as a going concern and to provide
	related footnote disclosures. Under U.S. GAAP, financial statements are prepared under the presumption that the reporting organization
	will continue to operate as a going concern, except in limited circumstances. Financial reporting under this presumption is commonly
	referred to as the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis of accounting is critical to financial reporting
	because it establishes the fundamental basis for measuring and classifying assets and liabilities. Currently, U.S. GAAP lacks guidance
	about managementâs responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the organizationâs ability to
	continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. This ASU provides guidance to an organizationâs management,
	with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly
	provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes. The amendments are effective for annual periods ending after
	December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted
	for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued. Management believes
	that the impact of this ASU to the Companyâs financial statements would be insignificant.

	Â 




	If
	a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonable estimated, the Company recognizes an expense for the estimated
	loss. If the Company has the potential to recover a portion of the estimated loss from a third party, the Company makes a separate
	assessment of recoverability and reduces the estimated loss if recovery is also deemed probable.

	Item
	14. Indemnification of Directors and Officers





	Â 




	The
	Companyâs Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws and other contracts provide for indemnification of its officers, directors,
	agents, fiduciaries and employees. These provisions allow the Company to pay for the expenses of these persons in connection with
	legal proceedings brought because of the personâs position with the Company, if the person is not ultimately adjudged liable
	to the Company for misconduct in the action. Generally, no indemnification may be made where the person has been determined to
	have intentionally, fraudulently or knowingly violated the law.




	Â 




	The
	Company does not believe that such indemnification affects the capacity of such person acting as officer, director or control
	person of the Company.





	Â 







	Item
	15. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities





	Â

	no general advertising or solicitation was used, and (ii) the investors purchasing securities were acquiring the same for investment
	purposes only, without a view to resale.Â 




	Â 




	No
	underwriters participated or effectuated any of the transactions specified below. Also, no underwriting discounts or commissions
	applied to any of the transactions set forth below. All potential investors were contacted personally and possessed at the time
	of their investment bona fide substantive, pre-existing business relationships with the Company and/or its officers, directors
	and affiliates. No potential investors were contacted through other means, and no general advertising or general solicitation
	was used to solicit any investors.

	17. Undertakings





	Â Pursuant
	to Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933 (as amended and updated from time to time)




	Â 




	The
	undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:




	Â 




	(1)
	To file, during any period in which it offers or sales securities, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement;




	Â 




	i.
	To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;




	Â 




	ii.
	To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events which, individually or together, represent a fundamental change in the information
	in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the
	total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) any deviation from the low or high end of
	the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)
	if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price
	set forth in the âCalculation of Registration Feeâ table in the effective registration statement; and




	Â

	II-

	Â 








	Table of Contents

	Â 









	Â 




	iii.
	To include any additional material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration
	statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement.




	Â 




	(2)
	That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post effective amendment shall
	be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of the securities at
	that time to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.




	Â 




	(3)
	To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment, any of the securities that remain unsold at the termination
	of the offering.




	Â 




	(4)
	That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of
	securities:




	Â 




	Each
	prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to this offering, other than registration
	statements relying on Rule 403B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included
	in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in
	a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed
	incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to
	a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration
	statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date
	of first use.




	Â 




	(5)
	That for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of
	securities:




	Â 




	The
	undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration
	statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or
	sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser
	and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser.:




	Â 




	i.
	Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to this offering required to be filed pursuant
	to Rule 424;




	Â 




	ii.
	Any free writing prospectus relating to this offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred
	to by the undersigned registrant;




	Â 




	iii.
	The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned
	registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and




	Â 




	iv.
	Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.




	Â 




	Undertaking
	Request for acceleration of effective date or filing of registration statement becoming effective upon filing.




	Â 




	The
	undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:




	Â 




	Insofar
	as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons
	of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the
	Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.
	In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred
	or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding)
	is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant
	will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate
	jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed
	by the final adjudication of such issue.
