Traditional funds are mutual funds that pool your money with other investors’ money. There are funds that invest in all kinds of assets – from stocks and shares to bank deposits. They cover major markets around the world. As with all investment, traditional funds can fall in value as well as rise. You may get back less than you invested.

Leading fund managers 
The global presence of Barclays gives you access to some of the best managers and funds around the world.

Compass Q2 2016 

At the beginning of this year many market participants saw the fall in equity prices as a precursor to the end of this economic cycle.  Even in the absence of a recession, many forecasted a further slide in equity prices, as markets were seen as too expensive.
