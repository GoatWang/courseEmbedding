CLEARFIELD, Utah, Aug. 3, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Vista Outdoor Inc. (NYSE:   VSTO) announced it has completed the acquisition of CamelBak Products, LLC, a leading provider of personal hydration solutions for outdoor, recreation and military use.
"CamelBak helps strengthen and expand Vista Outdoor's presence in the outdoor sports and recreation market," said Mark DeYoung, Vista Outdoor's Chairman and CEO. "Their highly recognizable and respected products are used by all manner of outdoor sports enthusiasts and complement every activity where Vista Outdoor's products are currently used. This acquisition will help our company provide an even broader portfolio of trusted brands for our consumers."
On July 27, Vista Outdoor announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire CamelBak. Under the terms of the transaction, Vista Outdoor paid $412.5 million, subject to a customary working capital adjustment, utilizing cash on hand and borrowings under its existing credit facilities. Vista Outdoor expects calendar year 2015 net sales for CamelBak of approximately $160 million. Absent transaction and transition costs, Vista Outdoor expects the acquisition to be accretive to Fiscal Year 2016 (FY16) earnings per share (EPS). Vista Outdoor will provide information relating to CamelBak's impact on FY16 financial results as part of its first quarter earnings press release and webcast on August 13.
CamelBak was founded in 1989 and is headquartered in Petaluma, California. The company employs approximately 300 people and will be integrated into the Outdoor Products segment of Vista Outdoor. CamelBak will remain headquartered in Petaluma, and CEO Sally McCoy will remain with Vista Outdoor. CamelBak was previously a subsidiary company of Compass Diversified Holdings (NYSE:   CODI).
Morgan Stanley served as transaction and financial advisor and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP served as legal advisor to Vista Outdoor in connection with the transaction.
About Vista OutdoorVista Outdoor is a leading global designer, manufacturer and marketer in the growing outdoor sports and recreation markets. The company operates in two segments, Shooting Sports and Outdoor Products, and has more than 30 well-recognized brands that provide consumers with a range of performance-driven, high-quality and innovative products in the ammunition, firearms and outdoor accessories categories.

BAT's Acquisition of Reynolds a Done Deal
Three RAI board members join BAT's board of directors.

July 25, 2017, 03:00 pm



 



WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. — Reynolds American Inc. (RAI) is now officially an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of British American Tobacco plc (BAT).
The move comes as BAT wrapped up its acquisition of the remaining 57.8 percent of RAI it did not previously own in a $49-billion deal struck between the two companies in January. 
According to BAT, the acquisition creates a stronger, global tobacco and Next Generation Products company committed to delivering sustained long-term profit growth and returns. 
BAT now has a balanced presence in high growth emerging markets and high profitability developed markets, combined with direct access to the attractive U.S. market, the company added.
"This is a transformational deal. We will take the best of the best from both businesses across all areas to create a stronger, more sustainable company. We are pleased to welcome Reynolds group employees to British American Tobacco and look forward to progressing what we are confident will be a smooth integration," said BAT's Chief Executive Nicandro Durante.

"Work has already begun to realize the projected cost synergies and we are committed to driving continued, sustainable profit growth and returns for shareholders long into the future," Durante added.
Among the immediate changes post acquisition, RAI shares are no longer trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and will be delisted from the NYSE as soon as practicable. In addition, Lionel L. Nowell, Holly Keller Koeppel and Luc Jobin join the BAT board of directors as of July 21. All three previously served on RAI's board.
Nowell was the lead independent director of RAI's board since January 2017, having served as a director since 2007. He was a member of the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. He retired as senior vice president and treasurer of PepsiCo Inc. in 2009, where he had held senior financial executive roles since 1999. 
Keller Koeppel was an independent director on the RAI's board since 2008. She was chair of the Regulatory, Sustainability and Public Policy Committee and a member of the Audit and Finance Committee. She is a senior advisor to Corsair Capital LLC, where she served as managing partner and co-head of Infrastructure from 2015 until her retirement in 2017. 
Jobin was an independent director on RAI's board since 2008. He was a member of the Audit and Finance Committee. He is president and CEO of Canadian National Railway Co., a position he has held since 2016, having served as executive vice president and chief financial officer since 2009. 
"We have been shareholders in Reynolds since 2004 and I would like to acknowledge the key role played by all directors of Reynolds in making Reynolds the success it is today," said BAT Chairman Richard Burrows.
Based in Winston-Salem, RAI is the parent company of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Co. Inc., American Snuff Co. LLC, Niconovum USA Inc., Niconovum AB and R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. 
London-based BAT is a global tobacco group with brands sold in more than 200 markets.

BAT's Acquisition of Reynolds a Done Deal
Three RAI board members join BAT's board of directors.

July 25, 2017, 03:00 pm



 



WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. — Reynolds American Inc. (RAI) is now officially an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of British American Tobacco plc (BAT).
The move comes as BAT wrapped up its acquisition of the remaining 57.8 percent of RAI it did not previously own in a $49-billion deal struck between the two companies in January. 
According to BAT, the acquisition creates a stronger, global tobacco and Next Generation Products company committed to delivering sustained long-term profit growth and returns. 
BAT now has a balanced presence in high growth emerging markets and high profitability developed markets, combined with direct access to the attractive U.S. market, the company added.
"This is a transformational deal. We will take the best of the best from both businesses across all areas to create a stronger, more sustainable company. We are pleased to welcome Reynolds group employees to British American Tobacco and look forward to progressing what we are confident will be a smooth integration," said BAT's Chief Executive Nicandro Durante.

"Work has already begun to realize the projected cost synergies and we are committed to driving continued, sustainable profit growth and returns for shareholders long into the future," Durante added.
Among the immediate changes post acquisition, RAI shares are no longer trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and will be delisted from the NYSE as soon as practicable. In addition, Lionel L. Nowell, Holly Keller Koeppel and Luc Jobin join the BAT board of directors as of July 21. All three previously served on RAI's board.
Nowell was the lead independent director of RAI's board since January 2017, having served as a director since 2007. He was a member of the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. He retired as senior vice president and treasurer of PepsiCo Inc. in 2009, where he had held senior financial executive roles since 1999. 
Keller Koeppel was an independent director on the RAI's board since 2008. She was chair of the Regulatory, Sustainability and Public Policy Committee and a member of the Audit and Finance Committee. She is a senior advisor to Corsair Capital LLC, where she served as managing partner and co-head of Infrastructure from 2015 until her retirement in 2017. 
Jobin was an independent director on RAI's board since 2008. He was a member of the Audit and Finance Committee. He is president and CEO of Canadian National Railway Co., a position he has held since 2016, having served as executive vice president and chief financial officer since 2009. 
"We have been shareholders in Reynolds since 2004 and I would like to acknowledge the key role played by all directors of Reynolds in making Reynolds the success it is today," said BAT Chairman Richard Burrows.
Based in Winston-Salem, RAI is the parent company of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Co. Inc., American Snuff Co. LLC, Niconovum USA Inc., Niconovum AB and R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co. 
London-based BAT is a global tobacco group with brands sold in more than 200 markets.

Assets of Home Care Industries Aquired 

La Crosse, VA, May 24, 2013 – An affiliate of ZHF (USA), Inc. (“ZHF”) has acquired substantially all of the U.S.-based assets of Home Care Industries, Inc. ZHF is an Ohio-based, floor care and filtration industry supplier. Home Care Industries, Inc. has ceased its operations. Effective with the asset acquisition, ZHF has renamed the company Home Care Products LLC (“Home Care”). Included in the acquisition were the La Crosse, Virginia (160,000 sq. ft.) and Oxford, North Carolina (135,000 sq. ft.) facilities. Home Care intends to remain in both locations.

HomeCare will resume and rebuild operations to again occupy the industry’s leadership position. It manufactures and sells replacement floor care accessories, such as disposable vacuum cleaner bags, HEPA filters, belts, air freshening and odor absorption products, and cleaning solutions. Home Care will supply original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and will market and distribute its customer-branded and private label products in all other channels.

Home Care will be able to take advantage of the largest North American manufacturing platform as well as ZHF’s Asian and other global supply relationships. According to co-owner and industry veteran Mark Howard, “We will be able to offer our customers the best price-value combinations, the highest quality, and the most consistent supply availability. This acquisition and the opportunity it creates will likely never be duplicated in the industry and our partners will derive tremendous long-term benefit from it.” Home Care has already begun rehiring many key, previously-employed staff members, who are intimately familiar with its products, manufacturing, and customers.

Terms of the sale were not disclosed.

About HomeCare

Originally founded in 1959, Home Care Industries, Inc. had been the premier supplier of replacement floor care accessories and filtration products, used in a wide variety of vacuum cleaners and other floor cleaning devices. It was previously headquartered in Clifton, New Jersey. In 2011, it relocated most of its manufacturing operations as well as management to La Crosse, Virginia, near its other facility in Oxford, North Carolina.
