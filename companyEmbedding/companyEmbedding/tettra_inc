TETRA Innovation Group (TIG)















Since 1981, TETRA Technologies, Inc. has served the global oil and gas industry with dedication, focus, and integrity. Since our inception, TETRA has had one goal…to deliver the best quality products and services based on innovative technologies, and best practices. We began in 1981 as a pioneer in the burgeoning completion fluids industry. Armed with new technology and a passion to succeed, our founders proved that focusing on customer needs positions us as a leader and supplier of choice in this market. 

To secure a guaranteed resource for our customers, we chose to make a substantial investment in the first clear brine fluid manufacturing facility dedicated to the oil and gas industry. Oil and gas operators cannot afford to take chances when drilling in the ultradeep basins around the world. They cannot risk damaging their payzone with an off-the-shelf clear brine fluid. TETRA offers customized, cost-effective, formation-specific fluids. Since we manufacture the completion fluids we sell, our customers have supply assurance to have what they need, when they need it, no matter the volume. 
TETRA’s Fourchon CBF facility is one of the largest on the Gulf Coast, providing quick turnaround and advanced fluid management service. Our many facilities serve, not only deepwater operators, but onshore and inland waterway customers as well. Speed and efficiency are coupled with the technology to blend our fluids to the condition found in any well. By controlling and monitoring the chemistry of our products, from manufacturing to placement in the wellbore, TETRA’s unique ability to produce fluids specially for our customer’s well conditions, sets us apart for all others in the industry. Since our customers need productive, trouble-free completions, our trained fluid engineers are able to design the optimum program for a successful displacement to provide a clean wellbore. 
Our customers also want innovative, cost-effective, frac water management solutions, including treatment, transfer, and storage. To meet that need, we manage the entire lifecycle of the frac water, keeping it reusable, utilizing technology, equipment, and best practices that respect the environment. With the largest fleet of onshore flow back well testing equipment in the USA and an extensive international fleet, TETRA has amassed a complete inventory of well testing technology and equipment that optimizes production through improving reservoir performance. 
The Compression Division provides its products and services to a broad base of natural gas and oil exploration and production, midstream, pipeline transmission, and storage companies, operating throughout many of the onshore producing regions of the United States. Our strategy is to compete on the basis of superior services at a competitive price and to deliver significant increases in the value that results from the use of its services, its superior customer service, its highly trained field personnel, and the quality of the compressor packages it uses to provide services.
When wells run dry, TETRA provides the highest quality in construction, diving, cutting, plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning solutions and has been doing so since 1994.

 As manufacturers and fishkeepers ourselves, we take great pride in making quality products. We also enjoy making the hobby fun, educational, and easier for our fellow fishkeepers. That's why we've assembled the best information to help ensure you're successful, and your fish are healthy and happy. 
 Responsible Fishkeeping 
 Please keep in mind the starter aquariums we offer are not suitable for keeping saltwater fish. Saltwater aquariums require more advanced types of filtration, an understanding of saltwater chemistry, and special feeding and care regimens. 
 To learn more about all aspects of fishkeeping, we recommend joining us on Facebook, signing up for TetraCare and, when you have a question, calling our Customer Service at 800-526-0650.

The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
