Investment Philosophy
Opus Investment Management's investment
    philosophy is embodied in three principles:

Yield wins over time. Continued
        investment in higher-yielding bonds has historically provided investors
        with attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
Inefficiencies in fixed income markets present return opportunities.
      Periodic lapses in information flows, a lack of standardized
        option pricing and the rapid development
        of new and increasingly complex structured
        products cause inefficiencies in fixed income
        markets. 
A fundamental, research-driven
        approach allows us to identify under- and over-valued
        sectors and securities. Fundamental research is
        the key to capturing market inefficiencies. 

The Opus Investment Management Investment Strategy
      Group, comprised of our entire team of portfolio managers and research analysts, combines economic and
      fundamental financial analysis to determine on-going
      investment strategy.

Third consecutive year Opus receives Top Guns Award from PSN Informa
How can the addition of a new asset class increase the return while reducing overall risk of your portfolio? What benefits might you realize if you widen your potential universe of investments while remaining within regulatory guidelines? How will changes in your underwriting results affect the level of investment risk you are willing to take? Let us show you.
Asking such questions is where knowledge becomes power – in the open exchange of vital information and the creative application of new ideas. That's where Opus has the answers. At Opus Investment Management, an 
      SEC-registered investment advisor, we strive to realize the power of knowledge in everything we do – from searching for every extra basis point, to empowering our clients to become strong advocates for their portfolios, and to creating investment solutions customized to fit specific operating constraints.
In the following pages, we invite you to learn more about how we apply knowledge–of investments and of insurance–to open a world
      of new possibilities.
