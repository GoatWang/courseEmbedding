What is the Angel Course?

	The 
	Future Investor Angel Course is the most comprehensive set of video lessons and interviews to teach:


- Non-accredited future investors how to think and prepare to make angel investments.
- Accredited investors hard-learned strategies to start angel investing using AngelList.


An accredited investor is a person with an individual income of $200,000 or joint income of $300,000 (both for the past two years); or a person with an individual or joint net worth of more than $1 million. 


	In the past few years, regulation has allowed accredited investors to invest into online investment platforms like 
	AngelList. Whether you have $100,000 or $10,000, this course will take you into the mind of a modern investor who's built experience up in private investing.


	With the huge success of startups like Uber, Snapchat & Airbnb, many are  jumping in to invest their money here in hopes of the next BIG return. 
	Angel investing requires education, just like any type of investing.


	Angel investing is not easy. The top angel investors have spent several years and tens of thousands of dollars building their network. They've also experienced countless failed investments. To take advantage of these investments, we need to be smart and understand our risk and learn together.

What's Included in Angel Course:

	- 10 Modules of video lectures, interviews and assignments on building a diversified portfolio, investing in syndicates & funds, valuation, pro-rata strategy and more.


	- Interviews with leading investors & entrepreneurs


My Journey Creating Angel Course:

	I considered charging $399 for Angel Course, I've decided (for now at least) to make it completely free. Here's why I'm making this dramatic move to make Angel Course available to anyone:


Touchy-feely reason: After teaching a few in person workshops, I realized there so many new investors who've never before gotten access to this information, and are making costly mistakes because of it. Given I do have day job of managing a family portfolio, making the course open gives me the chance to make an impact on more people outside of my day-to-day responsibilities.


Investment reason: A lot of what I've learned is based on the connections I've developed while building my experience investing. Because of this, I've been seduced by idea that by sharing my knowledge will carry a thousand times over to me. That might come in the form of a new business relationship, investment idea or even company you might eventually point me to that fits my personal approach.


	This online class will be ONGOING, with new topics, readings and interviews with successful investors and entrepreneurs to reflect the nature of the space. I'm looking forward to seeing you inside and hearing from you!

FSIC IV

1
                      The public offering price of FSIC IV’s shares of Class T common stock is subject to an upfront sales load of up to 4.25%. Shares of FSIC IV’s Class T common stock are also subject to an annual distribution fee of 1.00% of the estimated value of the shares as determined in accordance with applicable FINRA rules. The public offering price is subject to change. FSIC IV’s total expenses as a percentage of average net assets attributable to common stock was 7.74% for the period from January 6, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016. Expenses and fees are described more fully in FSIC IV’s prospectus. Please consult the prospectus and read it carefully.
                  

2
                      The annualized distribution rate shown is expressed as a percentage equal to the projected annualized distribution amount per share of Class T common stock (which is calculated by annualizing the regular weekly cash distribution per share of Class T common stock as of the date indicated, without compounding), divided by the public offering price per share of Class T common stock as of the date indicated. The annualized distribution rate and amount shown are net of the 1.00% annual distribution fee and may be rounded. The payment of future distributions on FSIC IV’s shares of Class T common stock is subject to the discretion of FSIC IV’s board of directors and applicable legal restrictions and, therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such future distributions. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, 30% of FSIC IV’s distributions were funded through net investment income (prior to expense reimbursement) and 70% of FSIC IV’s distributions were funded through short-term capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, on a tax basis. The determination of the tax attributes of FSIC IV’s distributions is made annually at the end of FSIC IV’s fiscal year and a determination made on an interim basis may not be representative of the actual tax attributes of FSIC IV’s distributions for a full year. The actual tax characteristics of distributions to stockholders are reported to stockholders annually of Form 1099-DIV.
                  


FSGCO–T2

1
                      FSGCO–T2’s common shares are subject to an upfront sales load of up to 4.00% of FSGCO–T2’s public offering price per common share, offering costs of up to 1.00% of the aggregate proceeds raised in FSGCO–T2’s continuous public offering, after payment of the upfront sales load, and an annual distribution fee of 1.33% of the net asset value (NAV) of the common shares. Additionally, FSGCO–T2’s common shares will be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge if they are tendered within a certain period of time. See FSGCO–T2’s prospectus for additional information regarding applicable fees and expenses, including additional annual expenses to which FSGCO–T2 is subject.
                  

2
                      The annualized distribution rate shown is expressed as a percentage equal to the projected annualized distribution amount per share (which is calculated by annualizing the regular weekly cash distribution per share as of the date indicated, without compounding), divided by FSGCO–T2's public offering price per share as of the date indicated. The annualized distribution rate shown may be rounded. The payment of future distributions on FSGCO–T2's common shares is subject to the discretion of FSGCO–T2's board of trustees and applicable legal restrictions and, therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such future distributions.
                  


FSEP

1
                        The annualized distribution rate shown is expressed as a percentage equal to the projected annualized distribution amount per share (which is calculated by annualizing the monthly cash distribution per share as of the date indicated, without compounding), divided by net asset value (NAV) per share as of the date indicated. The annualized distribution rate shown may be rounded. The payment of future distributions on FSEP’s common shares is subject to the discretion of FSEP’s board of trustees and applicable legal restrictions and, therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such future distributions. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, approximately 75% of FSEP's distributions were funded through net investment income, 2% distributions on account of investments in portfolio companies and 23% on expense reimbursement from sponsor. The determination of the tax attributes of FSEP’s distributions is made annually at the end of FSEP’s fiscal year, and a determination made on an interim basis may not be representative of the actual tax attributes of FSEP’s distributions for a full year. The actual tax characteristics of distributions to shareholders are reported to shareholders annually on Form 1099-DIV. FSEP's total expenses as a percentage of average net assets attributable to common shares was 4.88% for the year ended December 31, 2016.

About the Reserve








About the Reserve


























“The mission of the Navy Reserve is to provide strategic depth and deliver operational capabilities to the Navy and Marine Corps team and Joint forces, in times of peace or war.”
Navy Reserve Mission Statement













Home
About the Navy
About the Reserve




America’s Navy Reserve is an essential element of the Total Force that is America’s Navy. Wherever the important work of the Navy is being conducted in the world today, Navy Reservists are there – seamlessly supporting, actively contributing and effectively leading lives of service and lives of their own.





One Navy. One Mission.
Whether working in the U.S. or abroad, ashore, at sea or in the air, Reservists are prepared, accessible, versatile and willing to go wherever they are needed.
Each Reservist is expected to uphold the core values of honor, courage and commitment. Together with Active Duty servicemembers, they help make up one of the most capable forces the world has ever seen.
Over the past century, the Reserve has evolved into a vital asset, a respected partner and a true Force Multiplier. As a part-time servicemember, you will not only stand in to answer the call of duty, but your service will amplify the Navy’s core capabilities, which include forward presence, deterrence, sea control, power projection, maritime security, humanitarian assistance and disaster response.
A Go-To Force
The ongoing mission of the Navy Reserve is to have the right people and develop them with the right training. It's also to provide Reservists with the resources and support they need to serve effectively and successfully. In an increasingly complex world, this mission evolves to meet ever-changing initiatives.
As individuals and as units, Reservists continue to be more and more critical in the big picture. Serving side by side with Active Duty counterparts in direct support of the Fleet. Making the most of proven and potential abilities. Leading lives of pride, purpose and heroism on a mission that serves a greater cause.
Now and in the future, the Navy Reserve envisions itself to be a go-to force. A resource for roles that cover the full spectrum of Navy needs. It also strives to be an employer of choice. A fulfilling option for servicemembers from all backgrounds. Those with prior military experience and those without.



What is the Total Force of America's Navy?
It’s the more than 320,000 Sailors serving full-time on Active Duty
It’s the more than 60,000 Sailors serving part-time as Reservists in the Selected Reserve
It’s the more than 200,000 civilians working in the Department of the Navy (DON) and supporting Navy efforts (but under no military service obligation)
