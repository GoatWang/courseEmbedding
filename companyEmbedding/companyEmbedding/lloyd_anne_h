Martin Marietta Announces Chief Financial Officer Transition






Business Wire




Jun 22, 2017 2:00 PM EDT













 


















































  Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM) announced today that Anne H. Lloyd will retire as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the company, effective mid-August, 2017. Ms. Lloyd will remain with the company through September to ensure a smooth transition.  The Board of Directors has identified James A. J. Nickolas as Ms. Lloyd's successor, effective in mid-August. He will serve as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and will report to C. Howard (Ward) Nye, Chairman, President and CEO. Mr. Nickolas most recently led the Corporate Development group at Caterpillar Inc., and previously served as Group Chief Financial Officer of the Resources Industries segment and the Global Mining division of Caterpillar.  Mr. Nye stated, "For the last twelve years, Anne has played an integral role in helping Martin Marietta deliver exceptional returns to our shareholders as we executed our strategic plan. She has been instrumental in managing the company's balance sheet in a manner that allowed us to sensibly and successfully pursue value-enhancing organic and external growth opportunities. We deeply appreciate Anne's innumerable contributions to the company, including the key role she has played in positioning Martin Marietta for continued growth and value creation. On behalf of the Board of Directors, management team and all employees, I wish her all the best and thank her for her commitment to working closely with Jim to achieve a seamless transition."  Ms. Lloyd, 56, joined Martin Marietta in 1998 as Vice President and Controller. She was named Chief Accounting Officer in 1999 and was promoted to CFO in 2005. She was named Executive Vice President in 2009. As CFO, she has led the financial areas of Martin Marietta, including financial reporting, accounting, internal audit, investor relations, tax and treasury.  Mr. Nye continued, "We are excited about Jim joining Martin Marietta. He brings valuable expertise to the already strong senior leadership team, including deep knowledge of financial management, mining and materials, and M&A execution and integration. We look forward to working closely with him to leverage his energy and talents to further enhance our performance and extend our track-record of superior shareholder value creation."
