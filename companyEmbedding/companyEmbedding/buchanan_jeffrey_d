Buchanan's 12






                                                    A classic for more than 130 years, Buchanan’s DeLuxe is a 12-year old scotch whisky that has one of the world’s most iconic and awarded luxury Scotch whisky brands. 
                                                











Buchanan's Master






                                                    Winner of double gold medal in the 2014 World Spirits Competition in San Francisco, Buchanan’s Master is a blend of malts, at least one from every region in Scotland, hand-picked by our Master Blender: Keith Law.

Jeffrey D Buchanan's Experience
Title: Board Member
               Company: Jdrf
Job Details
               JDRF has adopted a new school program that educates kids on diabetes, a healthy lifestyle and the importance of philanthropy while raising money for JDRF and their own school. This program is completely run by JDRF staff and volunteers and takes minimal coordination by school staff. Plus, the department of your choice receives a 10% bonus from all money raised. Kids Walk to Cure Diabetes Overview:JDRF Volunteers teach your PE classes for a full day, with music and art classes welcome to join. JDRF teaches about diabetes and how students can collect donations to help find a cure. JDRF passes out packets to each child, which includes diabetes facts, fundraising tools and a prize sheet. Students take two weeks to collect donations. Two weeks after the first JDRF session, the school will host a Kids Walk to Cure Diabetes on campus. JDRF volunteers run the event and the teachers never have to collect, count or keep track of the money. JDRF does all the work! Prizes will be delivered with student's name labeled on them to make it easy to distribute. Students earn prizes depending on the amount of money they collect. The school's PE department receives 10% of the money raised. "As a teacher, I appreciate that the JDRF Kid's Walk Program brings accurate and appropriate information to students about Type 1 diabetes. Giving kids the chance to learn about a condition that some of their class/schoolmates live with every day helps increase understanding and awareness. Students have lots of fun participating in the walk and can earn prizes with small levels of contributions - and the return of 10% of the school's total funds raised is a great way to enhance PE or health-related programs. Everyone benefits from the JDRF Kid's Walk Program."- Beth Douthitt, Teacher at Washington Elementary School. "Since we have 3 Liberty students with type 1 diabetes, I thought JDRF's Kids Walk program would be a great culminating activity. Our kids had so much fun and learned about diabetes and what kids their age that live with diabetes goes through on a daily basis. Liberty Elementary won a Phoenix Coyotes assembly for being the school that raised the most money in the Phoenix area, raising more than $11,200.- Linda Van Sande, School Nurse for Liberty Elementary in the Paradise Valley School District. If you are interested in receiving more information or how to get your child's school involved, please contact Ashley Benedetto at (602) 224-1822 or by email at phoenixevents@jdrf.org.
