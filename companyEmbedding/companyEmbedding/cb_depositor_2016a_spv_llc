Independent Accountants� Report
on Applying Agreed-Upon Procedures
�
�
Ladies and Gentlemen:
�
We have performed the procedures described
below, which were agreed to by CommonBond, Inc. (the �Company�) and Barclays Capital Inc. (the �Other Specified
Party� and, together with the Company, the �Specified Parties�), related to their evaluation of certain information
with respect to a portfolio of student loans in connection with the proposed offering of CommonBond Student Loan Trust 2016-A,
Private Credit Student Loan-Backed Notes (the �Transaction�).
�
This agreed-upon procedures engagement was
conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The sufficiency
of these procedures is solely the responsibility of the Specified Parties of this report. Consequently, we make no representations
regarding the sufficiency of the procedures described below either for the purpose for which this report has been requested or
for any other purpose.
�
Agreed-Upon Procedures 
�
On March 22, 2016, representatives
the Company provided us with a computer-generated student loan data file and related record layout containing, as represented to
us by the Company, data as of March 16, 2016, with respect to 2,398 student loans (the �Initial Statistical Loan File�).
Further, on March 27, 2016 representatives of the Company provided us with a supplemental student loan data file containing �borrower
name� and �amount of last payment� information for each of the 2,398 student loans set forth on the Initial Statistical
Loan File (the �Supplemental Loan File�).
�
Representatives of the Company instructed
us to append the Initial Statistical Loan File with the information set forth on the Supplemental Loan File. The Initial Statistical
Loan File, as adjusted, is herein referred to as the �Statistical Loan File.�
�
At your instruction, we randomly selected
100 student loans (the �Sample Loans�) from the Statistical Loan File and performed certain comparisons and recomputations
for each of the Sample Loans relating to the student loan characteristics (the �Characteristics�) set forth on the
Statistical Loan File and indicated below.

We compared Characteristics 2. and

or Approval Disclosure Statement (collectively, the �Originating Documents�) and to an electronic loan file, prepared,
created, and delivered by the Company to us on March 31, 2016, from the Company�s servicing system as of March 16, 2016 (the
�Servicer System File�); Characteristics 4. through 14. to the Servicer System File; Characteristics 15. through 17.
to the �Credit Report;� Characteristic 18. to a borrower�s pay stub, borrower�s W-2 or other related correspondence
(collectively, the �Income Verification Documentation�) and Characteristics 19. through 21. to the Degree Verified
Certificate, or other related correspondence (collectively, the �Degree Verification Form�).
�
At your instruction, for purposes
of our comparisons:
�

�with respect to our comparison of Characteristic 2., a loan type of (i) �refinance�
as set forth on the Statistical Loan File is noted to be in agreement with �consolidation� as set forth on the Originating
Documents and (ii) �in-school� as set forth on the Statistical Loan File is noted to be in agreement with �private
education� as set forth on the Originating Documents. Further, a loan type of (i) �refinance� as set forth on
the Statistical Loan File is noted to be in agreement with �CBGRL� or �CBHBRD� as set forth on the Servicer
System File and (ii) �in-school� as set forth on the Statistical Loan File is noted to be in agreement with �CBMBA�
and as set forth on the Servicer System File.
�

�with respect to our comparison of Characteristic 5., for those Sample Loans
indicated to be �in-school� as set forth on the Statistical Loan File, we were instructed to multiply the original
loan balance as set forth on the Servicer System File by 102% and compare such recomputed amount. Such comparisons were found to
be in agreement;
�

�with respect to our comparison of Characteristic 17., if a borrower and co-borrower
credit score were observed on the Credit Report, we compared the higher score; and
�

�with respect to our comparison of Characteristic 18., differences of 2.5%
or less of the borrower income amount indicated on the Statistical Loan File are noted to be in agreement;
�
The student loan documents (including
the Servicer System File) described above and any other related documents used in support of the Characteristics were provided
to us by representatives of the Company and are collectively referred to hereinafter as the �Loan Documents.� We were
not requested to perform, and we did not perform, any procedures with respect to the preparation or verification of any of the
information set forth on the Loan Documents and we make no representations concerning the accuracy or completeness of any of the
information contained therein. In certain instances, procedures were performed using data imaged facsimiles or photocopies of the
Loan Documents. In addition, we make no representations as to whether the Loan Documents are comprehensive or valid instruments
or reflect the current prevailing terms with respect to the corresponding Sample Loans.
