Products of Poverty Lyrics



[Verse 1]
It's a start of a new year
And as always, things are exactly the same
I'm watching my closest get so far from me
And I've never felt so alone

I said all I could say
Not a single thing has changed
I left them here to doubt me
They laugh, and then they leave
I've realized now I'll never become anything

[Chorus]
Another long night of being strung out and alone
Another night of hearing things and having messed up dreams
Another day of rejection
The people I love seem to be giving up on me

[Verse 2]
So, yes, it's true
I'm snorting lines off of the same books that I read
And I dream of living in late night kitchen conversations
So now you know, I try to soak up inspiration any way I can
And if it's so hard to believe what I say
Then I should stop speaking

[Chorus]
Another long night of being strung out and alone
Another night of hearing things and having messed up dreams
Another day of rejection
The people I love seem to be giving up on me

[Post-Chorus]
Products of poverty

[Bridge]
Just learn to love yourself
Just forget the rest for now
And learn to love yourself
Just forget the rest for now
And learn to love yourself

[Chorus]
Another long night of being strung out and alone
Another night of hearing things and having messed up dreams
Another day of rejection
The people I love seem to be giving up on me

[Chorus: Craig Owens]
Another long night of being strung out and alone
Another night of hearing things and having messed up dreams
Another day of rejection
The people I love seem to be giving up on me

B. CRAIG OWENS TO JOIN JCPENNEY BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Accomplished Consumer Industries Executive Brings Deep Financial and Operational Experience to Board
PLANO, Texas (Oct. 8, 2014) – J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP) today announced that B. Craig Owens, a highly accomplished and respected executive in the consumer food and beverage industry, has been elected to its Board of Directors. Mr. Owens recently retired from his post as chief financial officer and chief administrative officer of Campbell Soup Company, where he led its finance, supply chain and information technology organizations.

"During his 33 year career in the consumer products industry, Craig has distinguished himself as a trusted leader and strategic advisor.  He brings significant financial expertise and a deep understanding of operations and strategic planning to our Board,” said Thomas Engibous, JCPenney’s chairman. “We are delighted to welcome him and look forward to his contributions.”

Mr. Owens added, "I am honored to join the JCPenney Board of Directors.  The Company’s brand, unique mix of goods and services, and exceptional customer service set it apart from its department store peers. It is an exemplary corporate citizen, with a strong commitment to its customers, associates, stockholders and the communities in which it operates. I am enthusiastic to be involved in the next phase of JCPenney's growth and success."

Prior to joining Campbell Soup Company, Mr. Owens, 60, was executive vice president and CFO of the Delhaize Group, a food retailer headquartered in Belgium with operations in the U.S., Europe and Asia and $28 billion in annual revenues. Earlier in his career, he held leadership and senior financial positions with The Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola bottlers.

Mr. Owens has a B.A. degree in politics from Washington and Lee University and an M.B.A. from The Wharton School of Business of the University of Pennsylvania. He also earned an M.A. degree from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.

Music career[edit]
Chiodos[edit]
Main article: Chiodos
In 2001, Owens joined Bradley Bell, Pat McManaman, Jason Hale, Matt Goddard and Derrick Frost to form a band in Davison, Michigan.[1][2] Originally named "Chiodos Bros." in tribute to special effects trio The Chiodo Brothers, the band recorded its first demo in June 2002.[2] Following several years of national touring and independent recording, they were signed by Equal Vision Records in 2004 and, under the name Chiodos, released their first full-length album, All's Well That Ends Well in 2005. They continued thereafter, recording and touring.
Even after his separation from his first band, Owens continued to have an interest in working with them and, after being asked by his management about what project he most wanted to pursue, he made overtures about a possible return to Chiodos.[1] On April 26, 2012, Owens announced his return to Chiodos.[3] Subsequently, on April 27, the remaining members of D.R.U.G.S. revealed their intention to disband.[4] Chiodos' first live appearance after their reunion took place on August 9, 2012 in a sold-out performance at Flint Local 432 in Michigan.[1] As of that date, the members had tentative plans for a new album, on which they have been working separately but not yet begun to coordinate.
On November 1, 2016 in an interview with Billboard, vocalist Craig Owens stated in regards to Chiodos that, "It's done, it just couldn't stay afloat. There were just kind of, not necessarily bad vibes, but we came to the realization that we can't do it full-time. I think it just stopped becoming a passion for most of us so we said, 'Alright, let's stop." Thus bringing an end to Chiodos' fifteen-year career. Owens is now performing under the stage moniker badXchannels and is touring in support of his new solo album "WHYDFML" (what have you done for me lately).[5]
The Sound of Animals Fighting[edit]
Main article: The Sound of Animals Fighting
Owens featured as vocalist in the supergroup, The Sound of Animals Fighting. Owens featured on the album Lover, the Lord Has Left Us... released in 2006. The group consisted of project members of Circa Survive, Finch, Rx Bandits, Days Away under the alias of The Skunk, each member of the group wore an animal mask to hide their personas to influence the groups creativeness, Owens is identified in the group as the Ram. Owens appeared in the groups live line up We Must Become the Change We Want to See in 2006 along with 11 other members.
Cinematic Sunrise[edit]
Main article: Cinematic Sunrise
During this work with Chiodos, Owens and Bell formed the side project Cinematic Sunrise as a place to perform music that didn't fit Chiodos' style.[6] When the band signed with Equal Vision, in March 2008, its line-up had included Owens, Bell, Bryan Beeler, Marcus Vankirk and Dave Shapiro.[7] Cinematic Sunrise released an EP later that Spring, A Coloring Storybook and Long Playing Record.
Isles & Glaciers[edit]
Main article: Isles & Glaciers
In September 2008, Owens revealed to fans on his journal that in addition to several guest vocalist appearances, he was working on another side project with Jonny Craig of Emarosa/Dance Gavin Dance, Vic Fuentes of Pierce the Veil and Nick Martin of Cinematic Sunrise.[8] When the Isles & Glaciers supergroup was officially announced in December, it also included Owens' bandmate Matt Goddard, Fuentes' brother and bandmate Mike Fuentes and Brian Southall from the band TREOS.[9]
The supergroup premiered their first songs during a radio interview on January 18, 2009.[10] The band's EP, The Hearts of Lonely People, was released on March 9, 2010.[11]
Asked in March 2012 if Isles & Glaciers would consider further collaboration, Owens indicated that the possibility had been discussed among various members of the group but not established; "we've tossed the idea around to see if we could put it back together, but that was just to see if we could do anything...there's no set plans right now."[12]
Destroy Rebuild Until God Shows[edit]
Main article: Destroy Rebuild Until God Shows
On September 15, 2009, Owens released a solo EP, "Με την αγάπη (With Love)", through Equal Vision Records.[13] Nine days later, on September 24, 2009, Chiodos announced that they had parted ways with Craig Owens, announcing that the decision to "let Craig Owens go as the singer of Chiodos...was a necessary one", but refusing to disclose details "[o]ut of respect for all of the hard work that we have put in together for all of these years".[14] For the next several months, Owens maintained a low profile, taking personal time and writing songs.[15]
In June 2010, at the time he discussed his upcoming project with Alternative Press, he had written or co-written 30 songs for a not-yet-completed supergroup signed to Decaydance featuring Nick Martin of Cinematic Sunrise and Aaron Stern of Matchbook Romance.[15] On August 17, Owens announced via Twitter that the new band would be named D.R.U.G.S. (Destroy Rebuild Until God Shows).[16] On February 21, 2011, with the completed band lineup including Matt Good of From First to Last and Adam Russell of Story of the Year and production by John Feldmann, D.R.U.G.S. released their eponymous debut.[17] The album reached No. 29 on Billboard 200 and higher on some of Billboard's specialized lists, including hitting No. 6 on Top Rock Albums, No. 5 on Modern Rock/Alternative Albums and No. 1 on Hard Rock Albums.[17] D.R.U.G.S. coheadlined the 2011 Alternative Press Tour.[3]
Bea5t[edit]
In February 2016, Craig released a short grindcore EP entitled Empathy Is A Gift under the moniker of Bea5t, downloadable from his bandcamp page.[18] In April 2016, Craig will be joining with Marina City to tour the midwest for Marina City's new EP "Lost Doesn't Mean Alone"[19]
badXchannels[edit]
After the end of Chiodos Craig began releasing music under the moniker badXchannels.[20] An ep was released at the end of 2016 with two more standalone songs released in early 2017. These songs were later grouped into an EP known as 'Transmissions', freely available to subscribers of the mailing list. [21] [22]

Music career[edit]
Chiodos[edit]
Main article: Chiodos
In 2001, Owens joined Bradley Bell, Pat McManaman, Jason Hale, Matt Goddard and Derrick Frost to form a band in Davison, Michigan.[1][2] Originally named "Chiodos Bros." in tribute to special effects trio The Chiodo Brothers, the band recorded its first demo in June 2002.[2] Following several years of national touring and independent recording, they were signed by Equal Vision Records in 2004 and, under the name Chiodos, released their first full-length album, All's Well That Ends Well in 2005. They continued thereafter, recording and touring.
Even after his separation from his first band, Owens continued to have an interest in working with them and, after being asked by his management about what project he most wanted to pursue, he made overtures about a possible return to Chiodos.[1] On April 26, 2012, Owens announced his return to Chiodos.[3] Subsequently, on April 27, the remaining members of D.R.U.G.S. revealed their intention to disband.[4] Chiodos' first live appearance after their reunion took place on August 9, 2012 in a sold-out performance at Flint Local 432 in Michigan.[1] As of that date, the members had tentative plans for a new album, on which they have been working separately but not yet begun to coordinate.
On November 1, 2016 in an interview with Billboard, vocalist Craig Owens stated in regards to Chiodos that, "It's done, it just couldn't stay afloat. There were just kind of, not necessarily bad vibes, but we came to the realization that we can't do it full-time. I think it just stopped becoming a passion for most of us so we said, 'Alright, let's stop." Thus bringing an end to Chiodos' fifteen-year career. Owens is now performing under the stage moniker badXchannels and is touring in support of his new solo album "WHYDFML" (what have you done for me lately).[5]
The Sound of Animals Fighting[edit]
Main article: The Sound of Animals Fighting
Owens featured as vocalist in the supergroup, The Sound of Animals Fighting. Owens featured on the album Lover, the Lord Has Left Us... released in 2006. The group consisted of project members of Circa Survive, Finch, Rx Bandits, Days Away under the alias of The Skunk, each member of the group wore an animal mask to hide their personas to influence the groups creativeness, Owens is identified in the group as the Ram. Owens appeared in the groups live line up We Must Become the Change We Want to See in 2006 along with 11 other members.
Cinematic Sunrise[edit]
Main article: Cinematic Sunrise
During this work with Chiodos, Owens and Bell formed the side project Cinematic Sunrise as a place to perform music that didn't fit Chiodos' style.[6] When the band signed with Equal Vision, in March 2008, its line-up had included Owens, Bell, Bryan Beeler, Marcus Vankirk and Dave Shapiro.[7] Cinematic Sunrise released an EP later that Spring, A Coloring Storybook and Long Playing Record.
Isles & Glaciers[edit]
Main article: Isles & Glaciers
In September 2008, Owens revealed to fans on his journal that in addition to several guest vocalist appearances, he was working on another side project with Jonny Craig of Emarosa/Dance Gavin Dance, Vic Fuentes of Pierce the Veil and Nick Martin of Cinematic Sunrise.[8] When the Isles & Glaciers supergroup was officially announced in December, it also included Owens' bandmate Matt Goddard, Fuentes' brother and bandmate Mike Fuentes and Brian Southall from the band TREOS.[9]
The supergroup premiered their first songs during a radio interview on January 18, 2009.[10] The band's EP, The Hearts of Lonely People, was released on March 9, 2010.[11]
Asked in March 2012 if Isles & Glaciers would consider further collaboration, Owens indicated that the possibility had been discussed among various members of the group but not established; "we've tossed the idea around to see if we could put it back together, but that was just to see if we could do anything...there's no set plans right now."[12]
Destroy Rebuild Until God Shows[edit]
Main article: Destroy Rebuild Until God Shows
On September 15, 2009, Owens released a solo EP, "Με την αγάπη (With Love)", through Equal Vision Records.[13] Nine days later, on September 24, 2009, Chiodos announced that they had parted ways with Craig Owens, announcing that the decision to "let Craig Owens go as the singer of Chiodos...was a necessary one", but refusing to disclose details "[o]ut of respect for all of the hard work that we have put in together for all of these years".[14] For the next several months, Owens maintained a low profile, taking personal time and writing songs.[15]
In June 2010, at the time he discussed his upcoming project with Alternative Press, he had written or co-written 30 songs for a not-yet-completed supergroup signed to Decaydance featuring Nick Martin of Cinematic Sunrise and Aaron Stern of Matchbook Romance.[15] On August 17, Owens announced via Twitter that the new band would be named D.R.U.G.S. (Destroy Rebuild Until God Shows).[16] On February 21, 2011, with the completed band lineup including Matt Good of From First to Last and Adam Russell of Story of the Year and production by John Feldmann, D.R.U.G.S. released their eponymous debut.[17] The album reached No. 29 on Billboard 200 and higher on some of Billboard's specialized lists, including hitting No. 6 on Top Rock Albums, No. 5 on Modern Rock/Alternative Albums and No. 1 on Hard Rock Albums.[17] D.R.U.G.S. coheadlined the 2011 Alternative Press Tour.[3]
Bea5t[edit]
In February 2016, Craig released a short grindcore EP entitled Empathy Is A Gift under the moniker of Bea5t, downloadable from his bandcamp page.[18] In April 2016, Craig will be joining with Marina City to tour the midwest for Marina City's new EP "Lost Doesn't Mean Alone"[19]
badXchannels[edit]
After the end of Chiodos Craig began releasing music under the moniker badXchannels.[20] An ep was released at the end of 2016 with two more standalone songs released in early 2017. These songs were later grouped into an EP known as 'Transmissions', freely available to subscribers of the mailing list. [21] [22]
