Firm History



In 2013 Sigma Investment Counselors celebrated its 40th year in business.
Charles Ricker, CFA ®, founded the firm in November, 1973.
He was respected in the community for his training, expertise and strict fundamental approach to investment management. In fact, this focus on rigorous analytics persists to this day.
Sigma’s investment professionals foster and promote a collegial atmosphere and have a deep and abiding respect for the insights and opinions of their peers, both past and present at the firm.
Chuck Ricker was succeeded at the helm by Robert Bilkie, CFA ®, who joined the firm in 1984 and has served as Sigma’s CEO since 1987. The stock market crash of 1987 was his baptism into the business as an owner. Fortunately, the investment posture in client portfolios at that time allowed for the financial damage of a sharp, short-lived crash to be largely mitigated.  Subsequently, the long period of equity strength in the 1990’s enabled the firm to grow its client base and assets under management from $30 million then to over $700 million today. Importantly, the corresponding improvement in revenues enabled the assembly of a sound team of investment and administrative professionals whose impressive backgrounds and achievements are profiled in the “Our Team” segment of the website.
A growing client base also provided the firm with the means to invest in the development and implementation of industry leading tools and technology platforms. Importantly, these platforms allow for a streamlined delivery of thoughtful investment and planning solutions to every Sigma client on an individualized level.
Sigma remains independently owned more than 40 years after Chuck Ricker opened its doors for business, with the goal of “thoughtful investing” sitting at the forefront of our efforts on behalf of our clients.

Who We Serve: Women



Investment and Financial Planning for Women
Sigma has a unique focus on planning for women; several of our investment advisors are women and share many of your life experiences.  We are professionals, wives, mothers, divorcees, and caregivers of aging parents. 
The investment and financial planning goals for men and women are essentially the same – financial stability, wealth accumulation, and retirement security.  The assumptions we use in the planning process are different for a variety of reasons including the fact that women typically live longer than men.  
Statistics show that the income and personal wealth of women continues to rise.  Yet, we have found that many women have never met their current financial advisors, or are not participating in the conversations and the planning process. Sigma’s strong representation of women serving women and our commitment to the unique issues that women face is one of the things that set us apart from other firms.
No matter what stage of the planning process you are in, we are committed to empowering you through service, education, and thoughtful advice. 
Whether you are an executive, a homemaker, or a retiree, we will create an individualized financial plan to help you reach your financial goals. We are especially attentive to our clients during transitional periods such as divorce or the death of a spouse.  
Sigma has a special focus on women and investing. The investment counselors at our locations in Michigan, Ohio, and Florida are well versed in helping women make savvy financial decisions.
We can help clients specifically address the following issues:
“I’m recently widowed and wasn’t involved with our investments. Where should I start?”
“I’m going through a divorce. What can I do to make sure my retirement is secure?”
“My life expectancy is longer than that of my spouse. I’m interested in working with someone who understands my unique financial situation.”
Contact Sigma Investment Counselors today to partner with an investment advisor uniquely qualified to address the financial concerns of women.

Our Process



Choose A Step
Choose A Step

Gathering Information
Developing The Plan
Portfolio Construction
Plan Execution
Ongoing Review and Communication




1. Gathering Information
We begin by listening to our clients.  We take the time to thoroughly understand our clients’ financial background, investment objectives, income needs, growth needs, risk tolerance, and time horizon. 

Next Step





2. Developing The Plan
Every client has a customized Investment Policy Statement (IPS).  This IPS details how the portfolio should be managed, given the client’s unique investment objectives and constraints.  The IPS details how the portfolio should be allocated among various asset classes, while also outlining the other key pieces of a client’s financial plan.  This can include tax and estate planning issues, college funding, long-term care, life and disability insurance details and charitable giving, to name a few.  The IPS is updated at least once a year or more often if client circumstances change materially. 

Next Step
Prev Step





3. Portfolio Construction 
Each portfolio is allocated to satisfy specific investment objectives and constraints.  Client portfolios often have a targeted weight for cash, equity and fixed income investments.  These allocations are continually monitored and portfolios are dynamically rebalanced when significant deviations occur.
 
Equity investments consist of exchange traded funds (ETFs), and when appropriate, individual common stocks.  Fixed income investments commonly consist of a diversified ladder of individual bonds.  However, fixed income ETFs are used when cost effective diversification cannot be obtained using individual bonds.

Next Step
Prev Step





4. Plan Execution
Plan execution includes portfolio management, but can also consist of various other aspects of a client’s financial life.  This can include retirement plan funding for small business owners, making sure that various types of insurance policies (life, disability, long-term care) are adequate and appropriate, or making sure that an estate plan is in place to facilitate efficient generational wealth transfer.  While we don’t file tax returns, sell insurance or compose legal documents, Sigma is willing to work side-by-side with our clients’ other trusted advisors.

Next Step
Prev Step





5. Ongoing Review and Communication 
Every client at Sigma works directly with their portfolio manager.  Clients can expect frequent communication with their portfolio manager via emails, phone calls or in face-to-face meetings.   Each client receives a quarterly package which includes a comprehensive report on their portfolio. Clients also have access to all of their account information via our secure website.   For those who desire more insight into our investment thought process, Sigma’s investment committee publishes a blog and a monthly newsletter.

Sigma Investment Counselors, Inc. »
Sigma uses both a top-down and bottom-up investment process for stock selection and equity portfolio risk management. Using a macro forecast of both long-term and short-term changes in the economy, the firm determines sector exposures relative to the S&P 500 index. They attempt to include most industries within each sector where fundamentals are attractive. Their equity selection process primarily focuses on large-cap stocks. However, smaller capitalization stocks are used when fundamental and valuation characteristics are attractive.For fixed-income, Sigma selects investment grade, predominantly rated 'A' or better. Core fixed-income holdings are U.S. Treasury securities, corporate debt, preferred stock, high yield bonds, general obligation bonds and revenue bonds. The firm generally avoids 'hybrid' or derivative based securities unless specifically directed by the client.Sigma uses a laddered maturity for the overall construction of fixed-income portfolios. Duration targets are based on account objectives and economic and interest rate prospects.
