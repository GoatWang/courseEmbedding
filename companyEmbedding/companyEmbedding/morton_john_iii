Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Florida:













Does Morton, John B Iii carry a valid contracting license?



If you pay someone to construct a building or a structure, make structural alterations to load bearing walls, or perform services such as plumbing or air conditioning work, that person must have a state contractor's license.











How important is contractor licensing in Florida?



The Florida Construction Industry License Board maintains high standards for contractor licensing. Prior to receiving their license, Florida contractors are required to prove four years of relevant work experience or education; pass a board examination and prove financial solvency.











Your liability risk when hiring Morton, John B Iii



In Florida, licensed contractors with employees are required to carry workers' compensation insurance and attest they have obtained public liability and property damage insurance in the amounts determined by the Board.











Financial recourse when hiring Morton, John B Iii



Florida maintains a recovery fund, called the Florida Homeowners' Construction Recovery Fund, which is available to a natural person who has suffered monetary damages by the financial mismanagement or misconduct of a contractor, and who has exhausted all other sources of payment. The Board makes the determination of eligibility for an award. Florida contractors are not required to carry an active bond.











What else should I know before hiring Morton, John B Iii



As of 2007, the Florida DBPR began requiring license applicants to submit their fingerprints, which are used to run a criminal background check with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. In addition, they are required to provide a credit report during the license application process to demonstrate financial stability. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Florida Construction Industry License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Wars of the Roses: Archbishop John Morton (c.1420-1500)

Medieval Woodcut of a Bishop from "Gode Cookery"

JOHN MORTON, Archbishop of Canterbury, cardinal and statesman, belonged to a family which had migrated from Nottinghamshire into Dorset, and was born either at Bere Regis or Milborne St Andrew. Educated at the neighbouring Benedictine abbey of Cerne and at Balliol College, Oxford, he graduated in law, and followed that profession in the ecclesiastical courts in London, where he attracted the notice of Archbishop Bourchier. He is said to have been "at once admitted to the privy council" (Dict. Nat. Biog.); but probably this is a mistake for the ordinary council, of which Morton might well have been made a member when he was appointed Master in Chancery and Chancellor of the duchy of Cornwall. 

He received a good deal of ecclesiastical preferment from the Lancastrian party, was present, if he did not fight on the losing side, at the battle of Towton in 1461, and was subsequently attainted by the victorious Yorkists. He lived with the exiled court of Margaret of Anjou at Bar until 1470, and took an active part in the diplomacy which led to the coalition of Warwick and Clarence with the Lancastrians and Louis XI, and indirectly to Edward IV's expulsion from the throne. Morton landed with Warwick at Dartmouth on the 13th of September 1470, but the battle of Tewkesbury finally shattered the Lancastrian hopes, and Morton made his peace with Edward IV, probably through the mediation of Archbishop Bourchier.

In March 1473 Morton was made Master of the Rolls, and Edward found employment for his diplomatic talents; he was sent on a mission to Hungary in 1474, and was one of the negotiators of the Treaty of Pecquigny in 1475. In 1479, after receiving a number of minor ecclesiastical promotions, he was elected Bishop of Ely. He was one of the executors of Edward IV's will in 1483, and the story of the future Richard III, while preparing Morton's arrest, joking with him about the strawberries the bishop grew in his garden at Holborn is well known and apparently authentic [see More's description]. Oxford University in vain petitioned for Morton's release, and after some weeks in the Tower he was entrusted to the Duke of Buckingham's charge at Brecknock. Here Morton encouraged Buckingham's designs against Richard, and put him into communication with the queen dowager, Elizabeth Woodville, and with Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond. He escaped from Brecknock Castle to Flanders, avoided Buckingham's fate, and devoted his energies during the next two years to creating a party in England and abroad in the interests of the Earl of Richmond.

When Richmond secured the crown as Henry VII, Morton became his principal adviser. He succeeded Bourchier as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1486 and Alcock as Lord Chancellor in 1487; and he was responsible for much of the diplomatic, if not also of the financial, work of the reign, though the ingenious method of extortion popularly known as "Morton's fork" seems really to have been the invention of Richard Fox, who succeeded to a large part of Morton's influence. Morton no doubt impressed Lancastrian traditions upon Henry VII, but he cannot be credited with any great originality as a statesman, and Henry's policy was as much Yorkist as Lancastrian. The fact that parliament continued to meet fairly often so long as Morton lived, and was only summoned once by Henry VII after the Archbishop's death, may have some significance; but more probably it was simply due to the circumstance that Morton's death synchronized with Henry's achievement of a security in which he thought he could almost dispense with parliamentary support and supplies. 

As an ecclesiastic Morton followed orthodox Lancastrian lines: in 1489 he obtained a papal bull enabling him to visit and reform the monasteries, and he proceeded with some vigour against the abuses in the abbey of St Albans. In 1493 he was created a cardinal, and in 1495 was elected Chancellor of the university of Oxford. He encouraged learning to the extent of admitting Sir Thomas More into his household, and writing a Latin history of Richard III, which More translated into English. He constructed "Morton's Dyke" across the fens from Wisbech to Peterborough, repaired the episcopal palace at Hatfield and the school of canon law and St Mary's Church at Oxford. He died at Knole on the 12th of October 1500, and was buried in the crypt of Canterbury Cathedral.

Life[edit]
Born in Dorset,[2] he was probably educated at Balliol College, Oxford. After graduating with a BCL in 1448, he practised law in ecclesiastical courts, including the Court of Archesbeing appointed rector of Shellingford (Berkshire) in 1453. He was made prebendary of Sarum in 1458, rector of St. Dunstan's (in the West), archdeacon of Norwich circa 1460. He became a government lawyer the Lancastrian party and drafted the Bill of Attainder against Richard, Duke of York in 1459. He was cap[tured after the Battle of Towton and attainted, but escaped into exile, joining Queen Margaret in France, where he was Keeper of the Privy Deal to Henry VI in the Lancastrian government in exile and graduated in theology from the University of Louvain in 1469.
He returned to England, but following the failure of the Readeption and the murder of Henry VI, he made his peace with Edward IV. He received a royal pardon in July 1471, and became a Master of Chancery that Michaelmas, and Master of the Rolls in the following March. Further church appointments followed, as archdeacon of Winchester and Dean of the Court of Arches in 1474, canon of Wells from 1475 to 1478, archdeacon of Berkshire in 1476 and archdeacon of Norfolk in 1477.[3][4] He was appointed Master of the Rolls from 1472 to 1479.
In February 1477, he was sent by the Yorkist King Edward IV, together with Sir John Donne, as ambassador to the French court. After serving a short spell in 1478 as Archdeacon of Leicester he was appointed Bishop of Ely by King Edward on 8 August 1478 and he was consecrated on 31 January 1479.[5] Morton was an important foe of the Yorkist regime of King Richard III and spent some time in captivity in Brecknock castle. After the dynastic change to the Tudors in 1485, King Henry VII made him Archbishop of Canterbury on 6 October 1486,[6] and appointed him Lord Chancellor of England in 1487.[7] In 1493 he was appointed Cardinal priest of the church of St. Anastasia in Rome by Pope Alexander VI. He built the "Old Palace" of Hatfield House where Queen Elizabeth I spent much of her girlhood.
As Lord Chancellor, Morton was tasked with restoring the royal estate, depleted by Edward IV. By the end of Henry VII's reign, the king's frugality, and Morton's tax policy, carried out by Edmund Dudley and Richard Empson, had replenished the treasury. Morton gave a statement, later known as 'Morton's Fork', that no one was to be exempted from taxes: "If the subject is seen to live frugally, tell him because he is clearly a money saver of great ability, he can afford to give generously to the King. If, however, the subject lives a life of great extravagance, tell him he, too, can afford to give largely, the proof of his opulence being evident in his expenditure."
Morton died at Knole House, Kent, on 15 September 1500.[6] His monument was placed in the south-east part of Canterbury Cathedral's crypt, with an effigy and an arch decorated with angels, cardinal's caps, and tun barrels inscribed with MOR (a pun on his name, Mor-ton).[8] However, this monument is a cenotaph since his actual body was buried in the crypt's central chapel of the Virgin Mary, according to his wishes.
Morton, More, and the history of Richard III[edit]
Morton was a mentor of the young Sir Thomas More. More served as a page in Morton's house, acted in revels at Morton's court at Knole House, the archiepiscopal palace, and later mentioned him in his work Utopia. Although most scholars credit More with authoring the History of King Richard III, they debate the issue of the original authorship. Morton is believed by many to be the originator of the account that More rewrote. Modern-day enthusiasts of King Richard III thereby accuse Morton of inventing the account whereby Richard murdered Edward V and his brother Richard, Duke of York and committed other crimes attributed to him.
Armorials[edit]
James Bentham wrote in 1771 concerning the arms of Bishop Morton:[9][10]

"The Arms given him in Anglia Sacra, p. 673, are not sufficiently explicit; they should be thus blasoned: Quarterly gules and ermine on the 1st and 4th a goat's head erased argent. And this agrees with his arms carved various times on the noble Tower of Wisbeche Church, and as they were formerly in a window of Linton Church in Cambridgeshire, as I have it in a manuscript of church notes taken above a century ago. However these accord not with those for our bishop in his own cathedral twice, viz. in the east window of the north aisle of the presbytery, and in another window of the same aisle, where they are still remaining, and are thus blasoned: Quarterly gules and ermine, on the 1st and 4th three goat's heads erased argent, attired or.

In popular culture[edit]
In the 1972 BBC television series The Shadow of the Tower, which focused on the reign of Henry VII, Morton was played by Denis Carey.[11] In the Netflix/Canal series "Borgia," Morton appears in one scene in season 2, episode 4, and is portrayed by David Gant.

Life[edit]
Born in Dorset,[2] he was probably educated at Balliol College, Oxford. After graduating with a BCL in 1448, he practised law in ecclesiastical courts, including the Court of Archesbeing appointed rector of Shellingford (Berkshire) in 1453. He was made prebendary of Sarum in 1458, rector of St. Dunstan's (in the West), archdeacon of Norwich circa 1460. He became a government lawyer the Lancastrian party and drafted the Bill of Attainder against Richard, Duke of York in 1459. He was cap[tured after the Battle of Towton and attainted, but escaped into exile, joining Queen Margaret in France, where he was Keeper of the Privy Deal to Henry VI in the Lancastrian government in exile and graduated in theology from the University of Louvain in 1469.
He returned to England, but following the failure of the Readeption and the murder of Henry VI, he made his peace with Edward IV. He received a royal pardon in July 1471, and became a Master of Chancery that Michaelmas, and Master of the Rolls in the following March. Further church appointments followed, as archdeacon of Winchester and Dean of the Court of Arches in 1474, canon of Wells from 1475 to 1478, archdeacon of Berkshire in 1476 and archdeacon of Norfolk in 1477.[3][4] He was appointed Master of the Rolls from 1472 to 1479.
In February 1477, he was sent by the Yorkist King Edward IV, together with Sir John Donne, as ambassador to the French court. After serving a short spell in 1478 as Archdeacon of Leicester he was appointed Bishop of Ely by King Edward on 8 August 1478 and he was consecrated on 31 January 1479.[5] Morton was an important foe of the Yorkist regime of King Richard III and spent some time in captivity in Brecknock castle. After the dynastic change to the Tudors in 1485, King Henry VII made him Archbishop of Canterbury on 6 October 1486,[6] and appointed him Lord Chancellor of England in 1487.[7] In 1493 he was appointed Cardinal priest of the church of St. Anastasia in Rome by Pope Alexander VI. He built the "Old Palace" of Hatfield House where Queen Elizabeth I spent much of her girlhood.
As Lord Chancellor, Morton was tasked with restoring the royal estate, depleted by Edward IV. By the end of Henry VII's reign, the king's frugality, and Morton's tax policy, carried out by Edmund Dudley and Richard Empson, had replenished the treasury. Morton gave a statement, later known as 'Morton's Fork', that no one was to be exempted from taxes: "If the subject is seen to live frugally, tell him because he is clearly a money saver of great ability, he can afford to give generously to the King. If, however, the subject lives a life of great extravagance, tell him he, too, can afford to give largely, the proof of his opulence being evident in his expenditure."
Morton died at Knole House, Kent, on 15 September 1500.[6] His monument was placed in the south-east part of Canterbury Cathedral's crypt, with an effigy and an arch decorated with angels, cardinal's caps, and tun barrels inscribed with MOR (a pun on his name, Mor-ton).[8] However, this monument is a cenotaph since his actual body was buried in the crypt's central chapel of the Virgin Mary, according to his wishes.
Morton, More, and the history of Richard III[edit]
Morton was a mentor of the young Sir Thomas More. More served as a page in Morton's house, acted in revels at Morton's court at Knole House, the archiepiscopal palace, and later mentioned him in his work Utopia. Although most scholars credit More with authoring the History of King Richard III, they debate the issue of the original authorship. Morton is believed by many to be the originator of the account that More rewrote. Modern-day enthusiasts of King Richard III thereby accuse Morton of inventing the account whereby Richard murdered Edward V and his brother Richard, Duke of York and committed other crimes attributed to him.
Armorials[edit]
James Bentham wrote in 1771 concerning the arms of Bishop Morton:[9][10]

"The Arms given him in Anglia Sacra, p. 673, are not sufficiently explicit; they should be thus blasoned: Quarterly gules and ermine on the 1st and 4th a goat's head erased argent. And this agrees with his arms carved various times on the noble Tower of Wisbeche Church, and as they were formerly in a window of Linton Church in Cambridgeshire, as I have it in a manuscript of church notes taken above a century ago. However these accord not with those for our bishop in his own cathedral twice, viz. in the east window of the north aisle of the presbytery, and in another window of the same aisle, where they are still remaining, and are thus blasoned: Quarterly gules and ermine, on the 1st and 4th three goat's heads erased argent, attired or.

In popular culture[edit]
In the 1972 BBC television series The Shadow of the Tower, which focused on the reign of Henry VII, Morton was played by Denis Carey.[11] In the Netflix/Canal series "Borgia," Morton appears in one scene in season 2, episode 4, and is portrayed by David Gant.

He returned to England, but following the failure of the Readeption and the murder of Henry VI, he made his peace with Edward IV. He received a royal pardon in July 1471, and became a Master of Chancery that Michaelmas, and Master of the Rolls in the following March. Further church appointments followed, as archdeacon of Winchester and Dean of the Court of Arches in 1474, canon of Wells from 1475 to 1478, archdeacon of Berkshire in 1476 and archdeacon of Norfolk in 1477.[3][4] He was appointed Master of the Rolls from 1472 to 1479.
In February 1477, he was sent by the Yorkist King Edward IV, together with Sir John Donne, as ambassador to the French court. After serving a short spell in 1478 as Archdeacon of Leicester he was appointed Bishop of Ely by King Edward on 8 August 1478 and he was consecrated on 31 January 1479.[5] Morton was an important foe of the Yorkist regime of King Richard III and spent some time in captivity in Brecknock castle. After the dynastic change to the Tudors in 1485, King Henry VII made him Archbishop of Canterbury on 6 October 1486,[6] and appointed him Lord Chancellor of England in 1487.[7] In 1493 he was appointed Cardinal priest of the church of St. Anastasia in Rome by Pope Alexander VI. He built the "Old Palace" of Hatfield House where Queen Elizabeth I spent much of her girlhood.
As Lord Chancellor, Morton was tasked with restoring the royal estate, depleted by Edward IV. By the end of Henry VII's reign, the king's frugality, and Morton's tax policy, carried out by Edmund Dudley and Richard Empson, had replenished the treasury. Morton gave a statement, later known as 'Morton's Fork', that no one was to be exempted from taxes: "If the subject is seen to live frugally, tell him because he is clearly a money saver of great ability, he can afford to give generously to the King. If, however, the subject lives a life of great extravagance, tell him he, too, can afford to give largely, the proof of his opulence being evident in his expenditure."
Morton died at Knole House, Kent, on 15 September 1500.[6] His monument was placed in the south-east part of Canterbury Cathedral's crypt, with an effigy and an arch decorated with angels, cardinal's caps, and tun barrels inscribed with MOR (a pun on his name, Mor-ton).[8] However, this monument is a cenotaph since his actual body was buried in the crypt's central chapel of the Virgin Mary, according to his wishes.
Morton, More, and the history of Richard III[edit]
Morton was a mentor of the young Sir Thomas More. More served as a page in Morton's house, acted in revels at Morton's court at Knole House, the archiepiscopal palace, and later mentioned him in his work Utopia. Although most scholars credit More with authoring the History of King Richard III, they debate the issue of the original authorship. Morton is believed by many to be the originator of the account that More rewrote. Modern-day enthusiasts of King Richard III thereby accuse Morton of inventing the account whereby Richard murdered Edward V and his brother Richard, Duke of York and committed other crimes attributed to him.
Armorials[edit]
James Bentham wrote in 1771 concerning the arms of Bishop Morton:[9][10]

"The Arms given him in Anglia Sacra, p. 673, are not sufficiently explicit; they should be thus blasoned: Quarterly gules and ermine on the 1st and 4th a goat's head erased argent. And this agrees with his arms carved various times on the noble Tower of Wisbeche Church, and as they were formerly in a window of Linton Church in Cambridgeshire, as I have it in a manuscript of church notes taken above a century ago. However these accord not with those for our bishop in his own cathedral twice, viz. in the east window of the north aisle of the presbytery, and in another window of the same aisle, where they are still remaining, and are thus blasoned: Quarterly gules and ermine, on the 1st and 4th three goat's heads erased argent, attired or.

In popular culture[edit]
In the 1972 BBC television series The Shadow of the Tower, which focused on the reign of Henry VII, Morton was played by Denis Carey.[11] In the Netflix/Canal series "Borgia," Morton appears in one scene in season 2, episode 4, and is portrayed by David Gant.

Life[edit]
Born in Dorset,[2] he was probably educated at Balliol College, Oxford. After graduating with a BCL in 1448, he practised law in ecclesiastical courts, including the Court of Archesbeing appointed rector of Shellingford (Berkshire) in 1453. He was made prebendary of Sarum in 1458, rector of St. Dunstan's (in the West), archdeacon of Norwich circa 1460. He became a government lawyer the Lancastrian party and drafted the Bill of Attainder against Richard, Duke of York in 1459. He was cap[tured after the Battle of Towton and attainted, but escaped into exile, joining Queen Margaret in France, where he was Keeper of the Privy Deal to Henry VI in the Lancastrian government in exile and graduated in theology from the University of Louvain in 1469.
He returned to England, but following the failure of the Readeption and the murder of Henry VI, he made his peace with Edward IV.

We believe Mr. Morton is a valuable nominee for the Board in light of his experience as the chairman, chief executive officer and president of several banking institutions, coupled with his service on a number of public company boards. He brings to the Board operational expertise, a deep background in the financial services industry, and a comprehensive understanding of the Company's business, all of which make him particularly qualified and an excellent nominee to serve on the Board.

John Morton, Bishop of ElyBorn: c. 1420Dorset, Dorcestshire, EnglandDied: September 15, 1500Sevenoaks, Kent, England (Age c. 80)

Ely in HistoryJohn Morton is a prime example of the archetypal clerical politician seen in medieval and renaissance England and undoubtedly reminds one of men such as Cardinal Henry Beaufort or, later on, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey. Practically nothing is known of Morton's life before the late 1440s when he was enrolled at Oxford. He would go on to receive his bachelors and doctorate degrees in civil law (BCL & DCL respectively) and would do a great amount of work for the university throughout his life. Morton also began a career in the church and was given several small rectories to run. By 1456, at a time when civil war between the rival houses of Lancaster (led by King Henry VI) and York (led by the Duke of York) had already erupted, Morton had gone into royal service, being made chancellor of Edward, Prince of Wales. Being an experienced lawyer by this point, Morton was responsible for drafting the bills of attainder against the Yorkist lords in 1459. This would prove to be a detrimental move on Morton's part because, in 1461, York's eldest son would have himself crowned as King Edward IV (York had been killed in battle the year prior) after chasing away Henry VI and the Lancastrians. After the Yorkist victory at Towton, Morton was captured as he attempted to escape to Scotland and was thrown in the tower and, ultimately, attainted. Luckily, Morton was able to escape from prison and join the exiled Lancastrian court, consisting of Queen Margaret and Prince Edward, in France, where he would remain until the brief Lancastrian readeption in 1470-71. Unfortunately, Edward IV returned from his short exile and decisively defeated the Lancastrians to reclaim his throne. Prince Edward was killed in the action and Henry VI murdered shortly after, officially ending the house of Lancaster and forcing Morton to declare allegiance to Edward IV and the Yorkists. His surrender was accepted and he received a full pardon.Despite his past loyalties to the house of Lancaster, Morton was still able to become a major player in Edward IV's government. He was created master of the rolls (1472) and was used as an envoy on several occasions to the courts of France and Burgundy, playing a part in the Treaty of Picquigny (1475). Morton also continued to build on his power in the church, acquiring several archdeaconries and being named Bishop of Ely by the pope in 1478. Unfortunately, Ely suffered a setback when Edward IV died and the throne was usurped by his brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, in 1483. Ely was suddenly arrested, imprisoned and attainted by the new king. He was put in the custody of the Duke of Buckingham, Richard III's staunchest supporter, and when the duke soon after rebelled, it is likely that Ely played a part in the rebellion. Buckingham's rebellion was soon put down, and the duke executed, but Ely was able to escape to Flanders where he joined the court of Henry Tudor, an obscure Lancastrian claimant to England's throne. Ely then traveled to Rome where he informed the Pope of Tudor's intent to usurp the throne from Richard III, with complete success. Tudor invaded England in 1485 and defeated Richard III in battle, the king himself being killed, and had himself crowned as King Henry VII. For his loyalty, Ely was greatly rewarded by the new king, being made chancellor of England and being appointed to the royal council. In 1486, Ely received an even greater honor when he was created Archbishop of Canterbury. Throughout the rest of his life, Canterbury remained loyal to Henry VII and continued to be active in both politics and the church. He was a huge advocate of rights for the church and believed that it could work together with the government without being completely destroyed (ironically it would be Henry VII's son and grandchildren that would completely destroy that relationship). In addition, he remained active at the universities. By the end of his life, Canterbury was not popular amongst the common people (despite being a valuable member of the king's government) and was blamed for a number of taxes inflicted on the people. He was personally named by the Cornish rebels when they revolted in 1497. Despite his unpopularity, it cannot be denied that John Morton was a good man to have in royal service and had proved so throughout his life. He died, most likely of plague, in 1500 as a man of roughly eighty.Ely in ShakespeareAppears in: Richard IIIJohn Morton, Bishop of Ely appears briefly in Richard III and is seen at a conference with several lords as they debate when Edward V's coronation should be. Gloucester then enters and asks Ely for some strawberries from his garden. Ely fetches the strawberries but returns to find Gloucester in a foul mood. The duke then arrests Hastings and has him executed. Later in the play, it is announced that Ely has joined the Earl of Richmond in exile against the new king Richard III.ReferencesHarper-Bill, Christopher. ‘Morton,  John  (d.

Show moreFood You want to feed your family healthy food, but making the best choices can be difficult, especially if you're on a budget or short on time   or if you or any members of your family have special dietary needs. Fortunately, Walmart makes it easy to plan meals and stock up on delicious and nutritious food that is also affordable. Barbecue essentials Anytime is a great time to fire up the barbecue. Grab some hot dogs, hamburgers, steaks, chops, corn on the cob and whatever else you like to grill and get ready for a fun food fest. Of course, barbecue essentials don't necessarily need to be cooked on a grill. Don't forget the: Chips and snacks, like pistachios and mixed nuts, almonds and snack crackers Dips and spreads, including salsa, guacamole and black bean dip Side dishes of rice, mac and cheese and pasta salad beans and chili Condiments, like ketchup, mustard, mayo and more You'll also find Walmart's lowest prices on picnic items like paper plates, napkins, plastic cups, plasticware and more, should you want to take your meal to the great outdoors. Beverages From water and juice to coffee, beer and wine, you'll find a wide variety of delicious and refreshing beverages at Walmart, all at Every Day Low Prices. Explore the varied selection of juices, where you'll find common favorites like apple, orange and cranberry juice as well as mixed fruit and vegetable juices and much more. Browse the soft drinks: colas, root beer, cream soda, fruit sodas and more in both standard and sugar-free varieties, including options from popular brands such as Coca Cola, Pepsi and A&W. If you've been exercising, try sports drinks, like Gatorade, to keep yourself hydrated and maybe a caffeinated energy drink to keep yourself going throughout the day. There is also a large selection of hot beverages, including coffee, tea and hot cocoa, plus adult beverages, including beer, wine and spirits. To turn an ordinary glass of water into a more appealing beverage, consider powdered drink mixes and drink enhancers, which come in a wide range of flavors and include diet and fortified options featuring vitamins and electrolytes. Healthy options Are you confused by all the nutritional information that's available? Walmart's Great For You products feature a simple icon that lets you know you're choosing a healthy item. That includes lots of the foods nutritionists say people should get more of, including fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds and lean meats. It's also easy to find foods that meet special requirements. Simply filter your grocery searches by dietary need and you'll find products that are: Gluten free Sugar free Sodium free Fat free Nut free Dairy free There are also natural, organic, vegetarian, kosher and halal options. Walmart makes it easier to find the foods you want while simultaneously meeting your dietary requirements. No matter what type of special diet you are looking for, there are options that will help you make the right food choices day in and day out. Organic foods If you prefer to feed your family with natural or organic foods, enjoy Walmart's inventory of organic delights, which are made without artificial ingredients; they're grown without synthetic pesticides or chemical fertilizers. A food is labeled as organic by the way farmers grow and process their agricultural products, like different meats, fruits, vegetables, grains and dairy products. Organic farming practices are created to promote soil and water conservation and also to reduce pollution. The farmers who grow organic produce don't use what would be considered conventional methods to fertilize and control weeds. For example, organic farming practices would include the use of natural fertilizers to feed the soil and plants, while using crop rotation or mulch to manage the weeds. So what makes a product organic for certain? The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) established a certification program that requires all organic-labeled foods to meet strict government standards first. These standards regulate how such foods are grown, handled and processed. Thus, any product labeled as organic must be USDA certified. You could look through a variety of foods and check for the organic label on each one, but it s a much easier shopping process when everything can be found together, in one convenient location. Whatever your dietary goals or requirements are, you can easily find foods that meet your needs at Walmart. Just filter your search by dietary need and you'll find a large selection of delicious foods. Save Money.

Get your purchases fast with our free two-day shipping programThere's so much convenience when it comes to online shopping. It's easy to find exactly what you're looking for all in one place when you shop with Walmart online. Plus, you can see all the items that you want to purchase and know immediately whether they're in stock or not. However, two issues that arise   that you don't deal with when you're shopping in store   is that you sometimes have to wait several days to get your purchases or pay a higher additional fee to get your purchases shipped faster. However, thanks to Walmart, you don t have to deal with either problem. We offer free two-day shipping on millions of the items that we sell, and it's all available to you without joining a membership club or paying extra fees for the privilege. Combine this with our low prices, every day, on everything, and you can get the things you want quickly at prices that fit your budget.How Walmart's free two-day shipping worksWhen you're looking at our website to find the types of items that you're interested in purchasing, the first step is to look for the logo that says 2-Day Shipping on the product page. Many of these items will also state Free store pickup or Free store pickup today below the free shipping information. If you see these words on the product page for your item, you have the additional option to pick the item up for free at your chosen Walmart location or receive it at your designated location for free as long as you spend $35 or more. If your purchase is less than $35, you can upgrade to free shipping for $5.99.On the left-hand side of all the pages on our website, you'll see a section that section labeled Shipping & Pickup. Beneath that, you'll find the option for 2-Day Shipping. Click the radio button next to 2-Day Shipping and the page will reload, displaying only items that are available for free two-day shipping.
