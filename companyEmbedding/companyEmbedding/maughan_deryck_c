Early life[edit]
He graduated from King's College London with a BA in 1969, and earned a MS from Stanford Graduate School of Business in 1978, where he was a Harkness Fellow.
Career[edit]
Maughan is a partner of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co, where he leads the firm's global financial services practice. He was previously Vice Chairman of Citigroup and CEO of Citigroup International from 1998 to 2004; and Chairman and CEO of Salomon Brothers from 1992–97, a firm he joined in 1983. He served as Vice-Chairman of the New York Stock Exchange from 1996 to 2000. Currently he is a member of the Committee on Capital Markets on Regulation.
Prior to joining Salomon Brothers, Deryck Maughan worked at HM Treasury from 1969 to 1979 and at Goldman Sachs from 1979 to 1983. He is a Director of GlaxoSmithKline, Thomson Reuters and of BlackRock. He is a Trustee of Lincoln Center, NYU Medical Center and Japan Society. He serves on an Advisory Council at Harvard University.
Personal life[edit]
Maughan and his wife, the former Lorraine Hannemann of Honolulu, Hawaii, reside in Manhattan, New York. Lady Maughan is of Samoan heritage, and her father was a teacher and Mormon bishop in Honolulu. Deryck Maughan and Lorraine Hannemann met in London, where she had transferred from Los Angeles, while working as a flight reservation agent for Pan American airlines. After marrying, the Maughans moved to Tokyo,Japan and then to Manhattan. Maughan began using a Samoan name, "Va" as her first name after marrying Maughan. New York Magazine published a scathing article on June 12, 1995 {Vol. 28, No. 24, page 32} by journalist Suzanna Andrews called "Wall Street Weak," in which Deryck and Va Maughan were profiled. It was noted in the article that Va Maughan had been accused by former friends, roommates, and employees of physical violence and threats. Of significant note were statements made by Deryck Maughan's colleagues that Va Maughan had undue influence over Maughan's business decisions while at Saloman Brothers in the 1990s. They subsequently founded a number of scholarships at Stanford University and at Iolani School. They also made a substantial donation to King's College London; the Maughan Library is named in their honour.[1]
Honours[edit]
Maughan was knighted in 2002.

Early life[edit]
He graduated from King's College London with a BA in 1969, and earned a MS from Stanford Graduate School of Business in 1978, where he was a Harkness Fellow.
Career[edit]
Maughan is a partner of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co, where he leads the firm's global financial services practice. He was previously Vice Chairman of Citigroup and CEO of Citigroup International from 1998 to 2004; and Chairman and CEO of Salomon Brothers from 1992–97, a firm he joined in 1983. He served as Vice-Chairman of the New York Stock Exchange from 1996 to 2000. Currently he is a member of the Committee on Capital Markets on Regulation.
Prior to joining Salomon Brothers, Deryck Maughan worked at HM Treasury from 1969 to 1979 and at Goldman Sachs from 1979 to 1983. He is a Director of GlaxoSmithKline, Thomson Reuters and of BlackRock. He is a Trustee of Lincoln Center, NYU Medical Center and Japan Society. He serves on an Advisory Council at Harvard University.
Personal life[edit]
Maughan and his wife, the former Lorraine Hannemann of Honolulu, Hawaii, reside in Manhattan, New York. Lady Maughan is of Samoan heritage, and her father was a teacher and Mormon bishop in Honolulu. Deryck Maughan and Lorraine Hannemann met in London, where she had transferred from Los Angeles, while working as a flight reservation agent for Pan American airlines. After marrying, the Maughans moved to Tokyo,Japan and then to Manhattan. Maughan began using a Samoan name, "Va" as her first name after marrying Maughan. New York Magazine published a scathing article on June 12, 1995 {Vol. 28, No. 24, page 32} by journalist Suzanna Andrews called "Wall Street Weak," in which Deryck and Va Maughan were profiled. It was noted in the article that Va Maughan had been accused by former friends, roommates, and employees of physical violence and threats. Of significant note were statements made by Deryck Maughan's colleagues that Va Maughan had undue influence over Maughan's business decisions while at Saloman Brothers in the 1990s. They subsequently founded a number of scholarships at Stanford University and at Iolani School. They also made a substantial donation to King's College London; the Maughan Library is named in their honour.[1]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
