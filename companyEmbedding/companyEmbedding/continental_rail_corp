About our Communities









Benefits of Rail Delivery

Trucking has been negatively impacted by higher fuel prices, more traffic on the roadways and regulatory changes. Recent regulatory changes include the Environmental Protection Agency’s stricter emissions standards for diesel engines and the Department of Transportation’s hours of service rules which limit truck drivers’ driving hours. Additionally, trucking companies are experiencing difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers and have had to increase salaries to overcome driver shortages.

Safety

Continental Rail has a variety of community safety programs to bring safety initiatives to the people and communities we serve. Our safety campaigns are aimed at specific audiences and specific areas along the rails such as schools and community centers directly affected by our operations. We work to educate and create awareness of grade-crossing safety, pedestrian safety and the importance of staying away from railroad property. We are proud to partner with Operation Lifesaver (Website) to assist in spreading the message of SAFETY. Remember – Safety First- We want everyone to go home safe and healthy at the end of the day.



Rail Road Security

Continental Rail has a commitment to the safety and security of our railroads in the communities where we operate. We have established several partnerships in these communities to provide state police and first responder official’s information they can use to protect our communities. These partnerships provide information, resources and strategies to help better protect the communities in which we operate and protect the cargo we move day in and day out.









Real Estate

Public projects such as highways and utilities often intersect with Continental Rail Property. If you have a construction project that involves railroad property please contact Omega Rail Management They are a valuable resource for information on safely implementing projects from highway-rail grade crossings information regarding utility permitting, accessing Continental Rail property for any purpose.



Environment

Continental Rail is constantly working to improve fuel efficiency and cut greenhouse gas emissions. Thanks to a variety of efforts, like increasing the average weight of trains, investing in greener locomotives and training engineers how to maximize fuel efficiency, freight rail accounts for only two percent of all transportation emissions. America’s railroads account for 40 percent of intercity freight volume, more than any other mode of transportation, so rail’s fuel efficiency is a major bonus for the economy and the environment. Continental Rail is committed to making all of properties as clean and sensitive to the environment as possible. We are proud to partner with both Crouch Engineering and Bayer Crop Science to help us achieve our green goals.
