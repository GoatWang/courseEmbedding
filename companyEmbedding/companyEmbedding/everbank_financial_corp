If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

History[edit]
While the roots of EverBank stretch back to 1961, the current incarnation was formed in 1994 when Chairman Robert Clements led an investor group in acquiring Jacksonville, Florida–based Alliance Mortgage Company. In 1998, Alliance Mortgage Company formed First Alliance Bank in Jacksonville, Florida, and shortly thereafter acquired Marine National Bank, also of Jacksonville, Florida. In parallel, Frank Trotter, Rob Foregger, Vincent Amato, and David Galland led another investor group to found EverBank as a national direct-to-consumer bank.
The World Markets division of EverBank originated as a department of Mark Twain Bank, a small St. Louis, Missouri, bank that founded the WorldCurrency(sm) service in 1986. In April 1997 Mark Twain Bank was acquired by Mercantile Bank. EverBank acquired the world currency division from Mercantile Bank in April 1999. EverBank World Markets is still located in Brentwood, Missouri, a St. Louis suburb and provides certificate of deposit (CD) accounts in euros and other non–U.S. dollar currencies.

EverBank also has a stock brokerage affiliate called EverTrade Direct Brokerage, also located in Brentwood, that provides conventional stock, bond, and exchange-traded fund (ETF) broker services for buying and selling publicly traded securities.




Old EverBank logo


On November 5, 2002, First Alliance Bank acquired EverBank and on February 2, 2004, the company took the name EverBank and EverHome for its consumer-facing operations.
On May 21, 2007, EverBank agreed to acquire NetBank's direct banking and small business financing divisions and mortgage servicing portfolio. On 17 September 2007, Everbank announced that it was terminating this agreement, claiming that NetBank had been unable to comply with provisions regarding certain cash levels due to the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis.
In 2008, Florida Trend magazine described EverBank as being one of the nation's largest online banks.[6]
EverBank's products include high-interest checking, money market accounts and CDs in addition to a suite of FDIC-Insured deposits denominated in foreign currency. EverBank participates in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (CDARS).[7] The institution neither owns nor operates any ATMs, so they will refund ATM fees paid by checking account holders who send in the receipt, up to $6 per month.[8] Everbank may have been the first non-military, non-community bank offering deposits by check scanning for consumers.[9]
On May 28, 2010, EverBank announced that it had acquired all the deposits, substantially all of the assets, and certain liabilities of the Bank of Florida – Southwest, Bank of Florida – Southeast, and Bank of Florida – Tampa Bay (collectively "Bank of Florida") from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"), bringing its total assets to approximately $11.5 billion.[10]
Lawsuit[edit]
On April 24, 2009, a class action lawsuit was filed against EverBank in the Superior Court of California on behalf of purchasers of the bank's Icelandic Krona foreign currency denominated "CDs" as a result of that country's financial collapse of 2008. The lawsuit alleges that EverBank, against the instructions of its customers, closed the "CDs" at a commercially unreasonable exchange rate far below those published by financial institutions and currency exchanges, resulting in a loss of much of the "CD" purchasers' principal.[11] On July 8, 2009, EverBank's Executive Vice President, Frank Trotter filed a declaration to the court in response to the lawsuit. In the declaration, Trotter admitted that a total of 225 investors lost $4,007,662.81 as a result of Everbank's forced closing of their Icelandic Krona denominated "CDs". That averages out to a loss of about $18,000 per account.[12]
"U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg in San Jose granted EverBank summary judgment on all of Vathana's claims, finding, among other things, that EverBank had the discretion to close the CDs because it would have been on the hook for some $12 million in losses had the currency not recovered."[13]
Trotter went on to disclose, based on currency variation, that when investments in all of EverBank's WorldCurrency CDs (including those denominated in foreign currencies other than the Icelandic Krona) are taken into account, investors suffered a net loss amounting to almost $50 million over the past four years.[13]
Community involvement[edit]
EverBank/EverHome Mortgage has sponsored between 25[14] and 52[15] homes in the Jacksonville's Habitat for Humanity program (HabiJax), contributing between $1 million and $1.93 million, and 28,000 employee volunteer hours.
EverBank also supports the following organizations:[16]

The Bridge of Northeast Florida
University of North Florida (UNF)
Habitat for Humanity program (HabiJax)
United Way of America
Step Up for Students

Jacksonville Jaguars[edit]




Everbank Field showing the EverBank signage


On July 26, 2010, the Florida Times-Union reported that EverBank purchased the naming rights to Jacksonville Municipal Stadium. The stadium had not had a sponsor since the end of the 2006 NFL season when the prior contract with Alltel expired. The stadium has been known as EverBank Field since the 2010 season.[17]
The exclusive five-year agreement included EverBank's designation as the official bank of the Jaguars, promotions within Jaguars' game telecasts and a variety of other media rights to the Jaguars and EverBank Field marks, prominent signage in the stadium and elsewhere in Jacksonville, business presence at Jaguars' home games – including EverBank ATMs at the venue for use by fans – and various community outreach initiatives.
Located at One EverBank Field Drive on the shores of the St. Johns River in Jacksonville, EverBank Field is the 67,246-seat home stadium of the National Football League's Jacksonville Jaguars. In 2005, the stadium served as the host site of Super Bowl XXXIX.[18]
On July 25, 2014, EverBank extended the naming rights of the stadium until 2024.[19]
Awards[edit]

EverBank has a 4 (of 5) star rating from Bauer Financial. Banks rated four stars or more are considered "safe, financially sound, and operating well above their regulatory capital requirements."[citation needed]
Forbes and Online Banking Report's "Best of the Web"[citation needed]
Kiplinger's Personal Finance magazine's "Best Checking Account"[18][citation needed]

EverBank's products include high-interest checking, money market accounts and CDs in addition to a suite of FDIC-Insured deposits denominated in foreign currency. EverBank participates in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (CDARS).[7] The institution neither owns nor operates any ATMs, so they will refund ATM fees paid by checking account holders who send in the receipt, up to $6 per month.[8] Everbank may have been the first non-military, non-community bank offering deposits by check scanning for consumers.[9]
On May 28, 2010, EverBank announced that it had acquired all the deposits, substantially all of the assets, and certain liabilities of the Bank of Florida – Southwest, Bank of Florida – Southeast, and Bank of Florida – Tampa Bay (collectively "Bank of Florida") from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"), bringing its total assets to approximately $11.5 billion.[10]
Lawsuit[edit]
On April 24, 2009, a class action lawsuit was filed against EverBank in the Superior Court of California on behalf of purchasers of the bank's Icelandic Krona foreign currency denominated "CDs" as a result of that country's financial collapse of 2008. The lawsuit alleges that EverBank, against the instructions of its customers, closed the "CDs" at a commercially unreasonable exchange rate far below those published by financial institutions and currency exchanges, resulting in a loss of much of the "CD" purchasers' principal.[11] On July 8, 2009, EverBank's Executive Vice President, Frank Trotter filed a declaration to the court in response to the lawsuit. In the declaration, Trotter admitted that a total of 225 investors lost $4,007,662.81 as a result of Everbank's forced closing of their Icelandic Krona denominated "CDs". That averages out to a loss of about $18,000 per account.[12]
"U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg in San Jose granted EverBank summary judgment on all of Vathana's claims, finding, among other things, that EverBank had the discretion to close the CDs because it would have been on the hook for some $12 million in losses had the currency not recovered."[13]
Trotter went on to disclose, based on currency variation, that when investments in all of EverBank's WorldCurrency CDs (including those denominated in foreign currencies other than the Icelandic Krona) are taken into account, investors suffered a net loss amounting to almost $50 million over the past four years.[13]
Community involvement[edit]
EverBank/EverHome Mortgage has sponsored between 25[14] and 52[15] homes in the Jacksonville's Habitat for Humanity program (HabiJax), contributing between $1 million and $1.93 million, and 28,000 employee volunteer hours.
EverBank also supports the following organizations:[16]

The Bridge of Northeast Florida
University of North Florida (UNF)
Habitat for Humanity program (HabiJax)
United Way of America
Step Up for Students

Jacksonville Jaguars[edit]

On July 26, 2010, the Florida Times-Union reported that EverBank purchased the naming rights to Jacksonville Municipal Stadium. The stadium had not had a sponsor since the end of the 2006 NFL season when the prior contract with Alltel expired. The stadium has been known as EverBank Field since the 2010 season.[17]
The exclusive five-year agreement included EverBank's designation as the official bank of the Jaguars, promotions within Jaguars' game telecasts and a variety of other media rights to the Jaguars and EverBank Field marks, prominent signage in the stadium and elsewhere in Jacksonville, business presence at Jaguars' home games – including EverBank ATMs at the venue for use by fans – and various community outreach initiatives.
Located at One EverBank Field Drive on the shores of the St. Johns River in Jacksonville, EverBank Field is the 67,246-seat home stadium of the National Football League's Jacksonville Jaguars. In 2005, the stadium served as the host site of Super Bowl XXXIX.[18]
On July 25, 2014, EverBank extended the naming rights of the stadium until 2024.[19]
Awards[edit]

EverBank has a 4 (of 5) star rating from Bauer Financial. Banks rated four stars or more are considered "safe, financially sound, and operating well above their regulatory capital requirements."[citation needed]
Forbes and Online Banking Report's "Best of the Web"[citation needed]
Kiplinger's Personal Finance magazine's "Best Checking Account"[18][citation needed]

History[edit]
While the roots of EverBank stretch back to 1961, the current incarnation was formed in 1994 when Chairman Robert Clements led an investor group in acquiring Jacksonville, Florida–based Alliance Mortgage Company. In 1998, Alliance Mortgage Company formed First Alliance Bank in Jacksonville, Florida, and shortly thereafter acquired Marine National Bank, also of Jacksonville, Florida. In parallel, Frank Trotter, Rob Foregger, Vincent Amato, and David Galland led another investor group to found EverBank as a national direct-to-consumer bank.
The World Markets division of EverBank originated as a department of Mark Twain Bank, a small St. Louis, Missouri, bank that founded the WorldCurrency(sm) service in 1986. In April 1997 Mark Twain Bank was acquired by Mercantile Bank. EverBank acquired the world currency division from Mercantile Bank in April 1999. EverBank World Markets is still located in Brentwood, Missouri, a St. Louis suburb and provides certificate of deposit (CD) accounts in euros and other non–U.S. dollar currencies.

EverBank also has a stock brokerage affiliate called EverTrade Direct Brokerage, also located in Brentwood, that provides conventional stock, bond, and exchange-traded fund (ETF) broker services for buying and selling publicly traded securities.

On November 5, 2002, First Alliance Bank acquired EverBank and on February 2, 2004, the company took the name EverBank and EverHome for its consumer-facing operations.
On May 21, 2007, EverBank agreed to acquire NetBank's direct banking and small business financing divisions and mortgage servicing portfolio. On 17 September 2007, Everbank announced that it was terminating this agreement, claiming that NetBank had been unable to comply with provisions regarding certain cash levels due to the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis.
In 2008, Florida Trend magazine described EverBank as being one of the nation's largest online banks.[6]
EverBank's products include high-interest checking, money market accounts and CDs in addition to a suite of FDIC-Insured deposits denominated in foreign currency. EverBank participates in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (CDARS).[7] The institution neither owns nor operates any ATMs, so they will refund ATM fees paid by checking account holders who send in the receipt, up to $6 per month.[8] Everbank may have been the first non-military, non-community bank offering deposits by check scanning for consumers.[9]
On May 28, 2010, EverBank announced that it had acquired all the deposits, substantially all of the assets, and certain liabilities of the Bank of Florida – Southwest, Bank of Florida – Southeast, and Bank of Florida – Tampa Bay (collectively "Bank of Florida") from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"), bringing its total assets to approximately $11.5 billion.[10]

While the roots of EverBank stretch back to 1961, the current incarnation was formed in 1994 when Chairman Robert Clements led an investor group in acquiring Jacksonville, Florida–based Alliance Mortgage Company. In 1998, Alliance Mortgage Company formed First Alliance Bank in Jacksonville, Florida, and shortly thereafter acquired Marine National Bank, also of Jacksonville, Florida. In parallel, Frank Trotter, Rob Foregger, Vincent Amato, and David Galland led another investor group to found EverBank as a national direct-to-consumer bank.
The World Markets division of EverBank originated as a department of Mark Twain Bank, a small St. Louis, Missouri, bank that founded the WorldCurrency(sm) service in 1986. In April 1997 Mark Twain Bank was acquired by Mercantile Bank. EverBank acquired the world currency division from Mercantile Bank in April 1999. EverBank World Markets is still located in Brentwood, Missouri, a St. Louis suburb and provides certificate of deposit (CD) accounts in euros and other non–U.S. dollar currencies.

EverBank also has a stock brokerage affiliate called EverTrade Direct Brokerage, also located in Brentwood, that provides conventional stock, bond, and exchange-traded fund (ETF) broker services for buying and selling publicly traded securities.

On November 5, 2002, First Alliance Bank acquired EverBank and on February 2, 2004, the company took the name EverBank and EverHome for its consumer-facing operations.
On May 21, 2007, EverBank agreed to acquire NetBank's direct banking and small business financing divisions and mortgage servicing portfolio. On 17 September 2007, Everbank announced that it was terminating this agreement, claiming that NetBank had been unable to comply with provisions regarding certain cash levels due to the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis.
In 2008, Florida Trend magazine described EverBank as being one of the nation's largest online banks.[6]
EverBank's products include high-interest checking, money market accounts and CDs in addition to a suite of FDIC-Insured deposits denominated in foreign currency. EverBank participates in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (CDARS).[7] The institution neither owns nor operates any ATMs, so they will refund ATM fees paid by checking account holders who send in the receipt, up to $6 per month.[8] Everbank may have been the first non-military, non-community bank offering deposits by check scanning for consumers.[9]
On May 28, 2010, EverBank announced that it had acquired all the deposits, substantially all of the assets, and certain liabilities of the Bank of Florida – Southwest, Bank of Florida – Southeast, and Bank of Florida – Tampa Bay (collectively "Bank of Florida") from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"), bringing its total assets to approximately $11.5 billion.[10]
Lawsuit[edit]
On April 24, 2009, a class action lawsuit was filed against EverBank in the Superior Court of California on behalf of purchasers of the bank's Icelandic Krona foreign currency denominated "CDs" as a result of that country's financial collapse of 2008. The lawsuit alleges that EverBank, against the instructions of its customers, closed the "CDs" at a commercially unreasonable exchange rate far below those published by financial institutions and currency exchanges, resulting in a loss of much of the "CD" purchasers' principal.[11] On July 8, 2009, EverBank's Executive Vice President, Frank Trotter filed a declaration to the court in response to the lawsuit. In the declaration, Trotter admitted that a total of 225 investors lost $4,007,662.81 as a result of Everbank's forced closing of their Icelandic Krona denominated "CDs". That averages out to a loss of about $18,000 per account.[12]
"U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg in San Jose granted EverBank summary judgment on all of Vathana's claims, finding, among other things, that EverBank had the discretion to close the CDs because it would have been on the hook for some $12 million in losses had the currency not recovered."[13]
Trotter went on to disclose, based on currency variation, that when investments in all of EverBank's WorldCurrency CDs (including those denominated in foreign currencies other than the Icelandic Krona) are taken into account, investors suffered a net loss amounting to almost $50 million over the past four years.[13]
Community involvement[edit]
EverBank/EverHome Mortgage has sponsored between 25[14] and 52[15] homes in the Jacksonville's Habitat for Humanity program (HabiJax), contributing between $1 million and $1.93 million, and 28,000 employee volunteer hours.
EverBank also supports the following organizations:[16]

The Bridge of Northeast Florida
University of North Florida (UNF)
Habitat for Humanity program (HabiJax)
United Way of America
Step Up for Students

Jacksonville Jaguars[edit]

On July 26, 2010, the Florida Times-Union reported that EverBank purchased the naming rights to Jacksonville Municipal Stadium. The stadium had not had a sponsor since the end of the 2006 NFL season when the prior contract with Alltel expired. The stadium has been known as EverBank Field since the 2010 season.[17]
The exclusive five-year agreement included EverBank's designation as the official bank of the Jaguars, promotions within Jaguars' game telecasts and a variety of other media rights to the Jaguars and EverBank Field marks, prominent signage in the stadium and elsewhere in Jacksonville, business presence at Jaguars' home games – including EverBank ATMs at the venue for use by fans – and various community outreach initiatives.
Located at One EverBank Field Drive on the shores of the St. Johns River in Jacksonville, EverBank Field is the 67,246-seat home stadium of the National Football League's Jacksonville Jaguars. In 2005, the stadium served as the host site of Super Bowl XXXIX.[18]
On July 25, 2014, EverBank extended the naming rights of the stadium until 2024.[19]
Awards[edit]

EverBank has a 4 (of 5) star rating from Bauer Financial. Banks rated four stars or more are considered "safe, financially sound, and operating well above their regulatory capital requirements."[citation needed]
Forbes and Online Banking Report's "Best of the Web"[citation needed]
Kiplinger's Personal Finance magazine's "Best Checking Account"[18][citation needed]

History[edit]
While the roots of EverBank stretch back to 1961, the current incarnation was formed in 1994 when Chairman Robert Clements led an investor group in acquiring Jacksonville, Florida–based Alliance Mortgage Company. In 1998, Alliance Mortgage Company formed First Alliance Bank in Jacksonville, Florida, and shortly thereafter acquired Marine National Bank, also of Jacksonville, Florida. In parallel, Frank Trotter, Rob Foregger, Vincent Amato, and David Galland led another investor group to found EverBank as a national direct-to-consumer bank.
The World Markets division of EverBank originated as a department of Mark Twain Bank, a small St. Louis, Missouri, bank that founded the WorldCurrency(sm) service in 1986. In April 1997 Mark Twain Bank was acquired by Mercantile Bank. EverBank acquired the world currency division from Mercantile Bank in April 1999. EverBank World Markets is still located in Brentwood, Missouri, a St. Louis suburb and provides certificate of deposit (CD) accounts in euros and other non–U.S. dollar currencies.

EverBank also has a stock brokerage affiliate called EverTrade Direct Brokerage, also located in Brentwood, that provides conventional stock, bond, and exchange-traded fund (ETF) broker services for buying and selling publicly traded securities.

On November 5, 2002, First Alliance Bank acquired EverBank and on February 2, 2004, the company took the name EverBank and EverHome for its consumer-facing operations.
On May 21, 2007, EverBank agreed to acquire NetBank's direct banking and small business financing divisions and mortgage servicing portfolio. On 17 September 2007, Everbank announced that it was terminating this agreement, claiming that NetBank had been unable to comply with provisions regarding certain cash levels due to the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis.
In 2008, Florida Trend magazine described EverBank as being one of the nation's largest online banks.[6]
EverBank's products include high-interest checking, money market accounts and CDs in addition to a suite of FDIC-Insured deposits denominated in foreign currency. EverBank participates in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (CDARS).[7] The institution neither owns nor operates any ATMs, so they will refund ATM fees paid by checking account holders who send in the receipt, up to $6 per month.[8] Everbank may have been the first non-military, non-community bank offering deposits by check scanning for consumers.[9]
On May 28, 2010, EverBank announced that it had acquired all the deposits, substantially all of the assets, and certain liabilities of the Bank of Florida – Southwest, Bank of Florida – Southeast, and Bank of Florida – Tampa Bay (collectively "Bank of Florida") from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"), bringing its total assets to approximately $11.5 billion.[10]
Lawsuit[edit]
On April 24, 2009, a class action lawsuit was filed against EverBank in the Superior Court of California on behalf of purchasers of the bank's Icelandic Krona foreign currency denominated "CDs" as a result of that country's financial collapse of 2008. The lawsuit alleges that EverBank, against the instructions of its customers, closed the "CDs" at a commercially unreasonable exchange rate far below those published by financial institutions and currency exchanges, resulting in a loss of much of the "CD" purchasers' principal.[11] On July 8, 2009, EverBank's Executive Vice President, Frank Trotter filed a declaration to the court in response to the lawsuit. In the declaration, Trotter admitted that a total of 225 investors lost $4,007,662.81 as a result of Everbank's forced closing of their Icelandic Krona denominated "CDs". That averages out to a loss of about $18,000 per account.[12]
"U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg in San Jose granted EverBank summary judgment on all of Vathana's claims, finding, among other things, that EverBank had the discretion to close the CDs because it would have been on the hook for some $12 million in losses had the currency not recovered."[13]
Trotter went on to disclose, based on currency variation, that when investments in all of EverBank's WorldCurrency CDs (including those denominated in foreign currencies other than the Icelandic Krona) are taken into account, investors suffered a net loss amounting to almost $50 million over the past four years.[13]
Community involvement[edit]
EverBank/EverHome Mortgage has sponsored between 25[14] and 52[15] homes in the Jacksonville's Habitat for Humanity program (HabiJax), contributing between $1 million and $1.93 million, and 28,000 employee volunteer hours.
EverBank also supports the following organizations:[16]

The Bridge of Northeast Florida
University of North Florida (UNF)
Habitat for Humanity program (HabiJax)
United Way of America
Step Up for Students

Jacksonville Jaguars[edit]




Everbank Field showing the EverBank signage


On July 26, 2010, the Florida Times-Union reported that EverBank purchased the naming rights to Jacksonville Municipal Stadium. The stadium had not had a sponsor since the end of the 2006 NFL season when the prior contract with Alltel expired. The stadium has been known as EverBank Field since the 2010 season.[17]
The exclusive five-year agreement included EverBank's designation as the official bank of the Jaguars, promotions within Jaguars' game telecasts and a variety of other media rights to the Jaguars and EverBank Field marks, prominent signage in the stadium and elsewhere in Jacksonville, business presence at Jaguars' home games – including EverBank ATMs at the venue for use by fans – and various community outreach initiatives.
Located at One EverBank Field Drive on the shores of the St. Johns River in Jacksonville, EverBank Field is the 67,246-seat home stadium of the National Football League's Jacksonville Jaguars. In 2005, the stadium served as the host site of Super Bowl XXXIX.[18]
On July 25, 2014, EverBank extended the naming rights of the stadium until 2024.[19]
Awards[edit]

EverBank has a 4 (of 5) star rating from Bauer Financial. Banks rated four stars or more are considered "safe, financially sound, and operating well above their regulatory capital requirements."[citation needed]
Forbes and Online Banking Report's "Best of the Web"[citation needed]
Kiplinger's Personal Finance magazine's "Best Checking Account"[18][citation needed]

History[edit]
While the roots of EverBank stretch back to 1961, the current incarnation was formed in 1994 when Chairman Robert Clements led an investor group in acquiring Jacksonville, Florida–based Alliance Mortgage Company. In 1998, Alliance Mortgage Company formed First Alliance Bank in Jacksonville, Florida, and shortly thereafter acquired Marine National Bank, also of Jacksonville, Florida. In parallel, Frank Trotter, Rob Foregger, Vincent Amato, and David Galland led another investor group to found EverBank as a national direct-to-consumer bank.
The World Markets division of EverBank originated as a department of Mark Twain Bank, a small St. Louis, Missouri, bank that founded the WorldCurrency(sm) service in 1986. In April 1997 Mark Twain Bank was acquired by Mercantile Bank. EverBank acquired the world currency division from Mercantile Bank in April 1999. EverBank World Markets is still located in Brentwood, Missouri, a St. Louis suburb and provides certificate of deposit (CD) accounts in euros and other non–U.S. dollar currencies.

EverBank also has a stock brokerage affiliate called EverTrade Direct Brokerage, also located in Brentwood, that provides conventional stock, bond, and exchange-traded fund (ETF) broker services for buying and selling publicly traded securities.




Old EverBank logo


On November 5, 2002, First Alliance Bank acquired EverBank and on February 2, 2004, the company took the name EverBank and EverHome for its consumer-facing operations.
On May 21, 2007, EverBank agreed to acquire NetBank's direct banking and small business financing divisions and mortgage servicing portfolio. On 17 September 2007, Everbank announced that it was terminating this agreement, claiming that NetBank had been unable to comply with provisions regarding certain cash levels due to the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis.
In 2008, Florida Trend magazine described EverBank as being one of the nation's largest online banks.[6]
EverBank's products include high-interest checking, money market accounts and CDs in addition to a suite of FDIC-Insured deposits denominated in foreign currency. EverBank participates in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (CDARS).[7] The institution neither owns nor operates any ATMs, so they will refund ATM fees paid by checking account holders who send in the receipt, up to $6 per month.[8] Everbank may have been the first non-military, non-community bank offering deposits by check scanning for consumers.[9]
On May 28, 2010, EverBank announced that it had acquired all the deposits, substantially all of the assets, and certain liabilities of the Bank of Florida – Southwest, Bank of Florida – Southeast, and Bank of Florida – Tampa Bay (collectively "Bank of Florida") from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"), bringing its total assets to approximately $11.5 billion.[10]
Lawsuit[edit]
On April 24, 2009, a class action lawsuit was filed against EverBank in the Superior Court of California on behalf of purchasers of the bank's Icelandic Krona foreign currency denominated "CDs" as a result of that country's financial collapse of 2008. The lawsuit alleges that EverBank, against the instructions of its customers, closed the "CDs" at a commercially unreasonable exchange rate far below those published by financial institutions and currency exchanges, resulting in a loss of much of the "CD" purchasers' principal.[11] On July 8, 2009, EverBank's Executive Vice President, Frank Trotter filed a declaration to the court in response to the lawsuit. In the declaration, Trotter admitted that a total of 225 investors lost $4,007,662.81 as a result of Everbank's forced closing of their Icelandic Krona denominated "CDs". That averages out to a loss of about $18,000 per account.[12]
"U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg in San Jose granted EverBank summary judgment on all of Vathana's claims, finding, among other things, that EverBank had the discretion to close the CDs because it would have been on the hook for some $12 million in losses had the currency not recovered."[13]
Trotter went on to disclose, based on currency variation, that when investments in all of EverBank's WorldCurrency CDs (including those denominated in foreign currencies other than the Icelandic Krona) are taken into account, investors suffered a net loss amounting to almost $50 million over the past four years.[13]
Community involvement[edit]
EverBank/EverHome Mortgage has sponsored between 25[14] and 52[15] homes in the Jacksonville's Habitat for Humanity program (HabiJax), contributing between $1 million and $1.93 million, and 28,000 employee volunteer hours.
EverBank also supports the following organizations:[16]

The Bridge of Northeast Florida
University of North Florida (UNF)
Habitat for Humanity program (HabiJax)
United Way of America
Step Up for Students

Jacksonville Jaguars[edit]




Everbank Field showing the EverBank signage


On July 26, 2010, the Florida Times-Union reported that EverBank purchased the naming rights to Jacksonville Municipal Stadium. The stadium had not had a sponsor since the end of the 2006 NFL season when the prior contract with Alltel expired. The stadium has been known as EverBank Field since the 2010 season.[17]
The exclusive five-year agreement included EverBank's designation as the official bank of the Jaguars, promotions within Jaguars' game telecasts and a variety of other media rights to the Jaguars and EverBank Field marks, prominent signage in the stadium and elsewhere in Jacksonville, business presence at Jaguars' home games – including EverBank ATMs at the venue for use by fans – and various community outreach initiatives.
Located at One EverBank Field Drive on the shores of the St. Johns River in Jacksonville, EverBank Field is the 67,246-seat home stadium of the National Football League's Jacksonville Jaguars. In 2005, the stadium served as the host site of Super Bowl XXXIX.[18]
On July 25, 2014, EverBank extended the naming rights of the stadium until 2024.[19]
Awards[edit]

EverBank has a 4 (of 5) star rating from Bauer Financial. Banks rated four stars or more are considered "safe, financially sound, and operating well above their regulatory capital requirements."[citation needed]
Forbes and Online Banking Report's "Best of the Web"[citation needed]
Kiplinger's Personal Finance magazine's "Best Checking Account"[18][citation needed]

History[edit]
While the roots of EverBank stretch back to 1961, the current incarnation was formed in 1994 when Chairman Robert Clements led an investor group in acquiring Jacksonville, Florida–based Alliance Mortgage Company. In 1998, Alliance Mortgage Company formed First Alliance Bank in Jacksonville, Florida, and shortly thereafter acquired Marine National Bank, also of Jacksonville, Florida. In parallel, Frank Trotter, Rob Foregger, Vincent Amato, and David Galland led another investor group to found EverBank as a national direct-to-consumer bank.
The World Markets division of EverBank originated as a department of Mark Twain Bank, a small St. Louis, Missouri, bank that founded the WorldCurrency(sm) service in 1986. In April 1997 Mark Twain Bank was acquired by Mercantile Bank. EverBank acquired the world currency division from Mercantile Bank in April 1999. EverBank World Markets is still located in Brentwood, Missouri, a St. Louis suburb and provides certificate of deposit (CD) accounts in euros and other non–U.S. dollar currencies.

EverBank also has a stock brokerage affiliate called EverTrade Direct Brokerage, also located in Brentwood, that provides conventional stock, bond, and exchange-traded fund (ETF) broker services for buying and selling publicly traded securities.

On November 5, 2002, First Alliance Bank acquired EverBank and on February 2, 2004, the company took the name EverBank and EverHome for its consumer-facing operations.
On May 21, 2007, EverBank agreed to acquire NetBank's direct banking and small business financing divisions and mortgage servicing portfolio. On 17 September 2007, Everbank announced that it was terminating this agreement, claiming that NetBank had been unable to comply with provisions regarding certain cash levels due to the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis.
In 2008, Florida Trend magazine described EverBank as being one of the nation's largest online banks.[6]
EverBank's products include high-interest checking, money market accounts and CDs in addition to a suite of FDIC-Insured deposits denominated in foreign currency. EverBank participates in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (CDARS).[7] The institution neither owns nor operates any ATMs, so they will refund ATM fees paid by checking account holders who send in the receipt, up to $6 per month.[8] Everbank may have been the first non-military, non-community bank offering deposits by check scanning for consumers.[9]
On May 28, 2010, EverBank announced that it had acquired all the deposits, substantially all of the assets, and certain liabilities of the Bank of Florida – Southwest, Bank of Florida – Southeast, and Bank of Florida – Tampa Bay (collectively "Bank of Florida") from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"), bringing its total assets to approximately $11.5 billion.[10]
Lawsuit[edit]
On April 24, 2009, a class action lawsuit was filed against EverBank in the Superior Court of California on behalf of purchasers of the bank's Icelandic Krona foreign currency denominated "CDs" as a result of that country's financial collapse of 2008. The lawsuit alleges that EverBank, against the instructions of its customers, closed the "CDs" at a commercially unreasonable exchange rate far below those published by financial institutions and currency exchanges, resulting in a loss of much of the "CD" purchasers' principal.[11] On July 8, 2009, EverBank's Executive Vice President, Frank Trotter filed a declaration to the court in response to the lawsuit. In the declaration, Trotter admitted that a total of 225 investors lost $4,007,662.81 as a result of Everbank's forced closing of their Icelandic Krona denominated "CDs". That averages out to a loss of about $18,000 per account.[12]
"U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg in San Jose granted EverBank summary judgment on all of Vathana's claims, finding, among other things, that EverBank had the discretion to close the CDs because it would have been on the hook for some $12 million in losses had the currency not recovered."[13]
Trotter went on to disclose, based on currency variation, that when investments in all of EverBank's WorldCurrency CDs (including those denominated in foreign currencies other than the Icelandic Krona) are taken into account, investors suffered a net loss amounting to almost $50 million over the past four years.[13]
Community involvement[edit]
EverBank/EverHome Mortgage has sponsored between 25[14] and 52[15] homes in the Jacksonville's Habitat for Humanity program (HabiJax), contributing between $1 million and $1.93 million, and 28,000 employee volunteer hours.
EverBank also supports the following organizations:[16]

The Bridge of Northeast Florida
University of North Florida (UNF)
Habitat for Humanity program (HabiJax)
United Way of America
Step Up for Students

Jacksonville Jaguars[edit]




Everbank Field showing the EverBank signage


On July 26, 2010, the Florida Times-Union reported that EverBank purchased the naming rights to Jacksonville Municipal Stadium. The stadium had not had a sponsor since the end of the 2006 NFL season when the prior contract with Alltel expired. The stadium has been known as EverBank Field since the 2010 season.[17]
The exclusive five-year agreement included EverBank's designation as the official bank of the Jaguars, promotions within Jaguars' game telecasts and a variety of other media rights to the Jaguars and EverBank Field marks, prominent signage in the stadium and elsewhere in Jacksonville, business presence at Jaguars' home games – including EverBank ATMs at the venue for use by fans – and various community outreach initiatives.
Located at One EverBank Field Drive on the shores of the St. Johns River in Jacksonville, EverBank Field is the 67,246-seat home stadium of the National Football League's Jacksonville Jaguars. In 2005, the stadium served as the host site of Super Bowl XXXIX.[18]
On July 25, 2014, EverBank extended the naming rights of the stadium until 2024.[19]
Awards[edit]

EverBank has a 4 (of 5) star rating from Bauer Financial. Banks rated four stars or more are considered "safe, financially sound, and operating well above their regulatory capital requirements."[citation needed]
Forbes and Online Banking Report's "Best of the Web"[citation needed]
Kiplinger's Personal Finance magazine's "Best Checking Account"[18][citation needed]

EverBank is not responsible for, nor do we guarantee, the content or services associated with this product. All problems, questions or concerns regarding Trusteer Rapport should be directed to www.trusteer.com/support.
The Yield Pledge® Checking Account is a tiered, variable rate account. The quoted Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) are accurate as of 7/28/2017 12:00:00 AM. A fixed, 1-year introductory APY is available for first-time Yield Pledge Checking account holders on balances up to $250,000. The 1-year introductory APY for balances (i) up to $250,000 is 1.21%, and (ii) from $250,000.01 to $10,000,000 is best expressed as a range: 1.21% to 0.72%. Otherwise the variable ongoing APY applies by balance tier. Ongoing APYs and tiers may change without notice. If your average daily balance is within a tier, then your entire balance will have that corresponding APY, except as described above for the 1-year introductory APY. Current ongoing APYs and tiers are: 0.71% for $100,000 - $10,000,000; 0.61% for $50,000 - $99,999.99; 0.51% for $25,000 - $49,999.99; 0.46% for $10,000 - $24,999.99; and 0.25% for balances under $10,000.

The Yield Pledge® Checking Account is a tiered, variable rate account. The quoted Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) are accurate as of 7/28/2017 12:00:00 AM. A fixed, 1-year introductory APY is available for first-time Yield Pledge Checking account holders on balances up to $250,000. The 1-year introductory APY for balances (i) up to $250,000 is 1.21%, and (ii) from $250,000.01 to $10,000,000 is best expressed as a range: 1.21% to 0.72%. Otherwise the variable ongoing APY applies by balance tier. Ongoing APYs and tiers may change without notice. If your average daily balance is within a tier, then your entire balance will have that corresponding APY, except as described above for the 1-year introductory APY. Current ongoing APYs and tiers are: 0.71% for $100,000 - $10,000,000; 0.61% for $50,000 - $99,999.99; 0.51% for $25,000 - $49,999.99; 0.46% for $10,000 - $24,999.99; and 0.25% for balances under $10,000. Higher balances are accepted. Accounts opened and initially funded with money transferred from another EverBank account are not eligible for the 1-year introductory APY. The required minimum opening deposit is $5,000. Fees may reduce earnings.
National Average APY information as of 7/27/2017 12:00:00 AM, as tracked in Bankrate.com's BRM National Index. National Average APYs and terms and conditions can change at any time.
The quoted Bump Rate CD interest rates and Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) are accurate as of 7/28/2017 12:00:00 AM. APY assumes that interest remains of deposit until maturity. These interest rates and APYs are applicable to CD principal balances up to $250,000. This is the maximum amount that can be deposited into each CD. The required minimum opening deposit is $1,500. Early withdrawal penalties apply. Fees may reduce earnings.
Federal regulation limits this account to 6 transfers or withdrawals per month, for most types of transfers and withdrawals. Certain transfers and withdrawals are not subject to this limit. See Business and Non-Personal Account Terms, Disclosures and Agreements Booklet for details. Withdrawals and transfers above this limit are subject to a fee. We may close or convert your account to a checking account for repeated occurrences.
The Yield Pledge® Money Market Account is a tiered, variable rate account, unless it was opened prior to 11/06/2016, in which case it is a variable rate account but not tiered. The quoted Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) are accurate as of 7/28/2017 12:00:00 AM. A fixed, 1-year introductory APY is available for first-time Yield Pledge Money Market account holders on balances up to $250,000. The 1-year introductory APY for balances (i) up to $250,000 is 1.21%, and (ii) from $250,000.01 to $10,000,000 is best expressed as a range: 1.21% to 0.72%. Otherwise the variable ongoing APY applies (by balance tier, if applicable). Ongoing APYs and tiers may change without notice. If your average daily balance is within a tier, then your entire balance will have that corresponding APY, except as described above for the 1-year introductory APY. Current ongoing APYs and tiers are: 0.71% for $100,000 - $10,000,000; 0.71% for $50,000 - $99,999.99; 0.71% for $25,000 - $49,999.99; 0.71% for $10,000 - $24,999.99; and 0.71% for balances under $10,000. For accounts opened prior to 11/06/2016, the current ongoing APY for balances up to $10,000,000 is 0.71%. Higher balances are accepted.
