ServicesHydraulic FracturingCalfrac is a full service hydraulic fracturing provider.

Treatment types and additives (such as surfactants, biocides and diverters) are customized to meet desired operational, treatment and production success.
ServicesCoiled TubingOur fleet of coiled tubing equipment provides services from shallow through deep — below 10,000 ft. (3,000 m) true vertical depth, with reel capacities up to 24,000 ft. (7,200 m) for 2 3/8 inches (60.3 mm) coiled tubing — and covers the majority of today’s wells, including long-leg multi-stage fractured horizontals drilled in deep shales and tight sands.
ServicesCementingCalfrac cement testing labs are state-of-the-art, with modern equipment and testing procedures that meet or exceed current oilfield standards. Calfrac offers primary and remedial cementing services in a variety of wells. We use different classes of conventional and special cements, as well as specially developed cementing systems.

Forward Looking Statements
Certain statements on or through this website may constitute forward-looking statements and forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws. The use of words such as "seek", "anticipate", "plan", "continue", "estimate", "expect", "may", "will", "project", "predict", "potential", "targeting", "intend", "could", "might", "should", "believe" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements or information. These forward-looking statements and information are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by Calfrac in light of its experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following: the economic and political environment in which Calfrac operates; Calfrac's expectations for its customers' capital budgets and geographical areas of focus; the effect unconventional oil and gas projects have had on supply and demand fundamentals for oil and natural gas; Calfrac's existing contracts and the status of current negotiations with key customers and suppliers; the effectiveness of cost reduction measures instituted by Calfrac; and the likelihood that the current tax and regulatory regime will remain substantially unchanged.
Although Calfrac believes that the expectations and assumptions on which such forward looking statements and information are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements and information as Calfrac cannot give any assurance that they will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements and information address future events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks. These include, but are not limited to, risks associated with: global economic conditions; the level of exploration, development and production for oil and natural gas in Canada, the United States, Russia, Argentina and Mexico; the demand for fracturing and other stimulation services during drilling and completion of oil and natural gas wells; volatility in market prices for oil and natural gas and the effect of this volatility on the demand for oilfield services generally; excess oilfield equipment levels; regional competition; the availability of capital on satisfactory terms; restrictions resulting from compliance with debt covenants and risk of acceleration of indebtedness; direct and indirect exposure to volatile credit markets, including credit rating risk; currency exchange rate risk; risks associated with foreign operations; operating restrictions and compliance costs associated with legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing and the protection of workers and the environment; changes in legislation and the regulatory environment; dependence on, and concentration of, major customers; liabilities and risks, including environmental liabilities and risks, inherent in oil and natural gas operations; uncertainties in weather and temperature affecting the duration of the service periods and the activities that can be completed; liabilities and risks associated with prior operations; failure to maintain Calfrac's safety standards and record; failure to realize anticipated benefits of acquisitions and dispositions; the ability to integrate technological advances and match advances from competitors; intellectual property risks; sourcing, pricing and availability of raw materials, component parts, equipment, suppliers, facilities and skilled personnel; and the effect of accounting pronouncements issued periodically.
Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list of risks and uncertainties is not exhaustive. Additional information on these and other risk factors that could affect Calfrac's operations or financial results are included in Calfrac's annual information form and may be accessed through the SEDAR website (www.sedar.com). Calfrac does not undertake any obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements or information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless so required by applicable securities laws.

It was a tough go getting the equipment spotted and rigged in. If the Calfrac crew is still happy to be there after 8 hours of struggling with surface conditions, it’s going to take something of biblical proportion to break their spirit. It’s getting tough to find crews like that.Completions Superintendent, Large Independent Oil & Gas Producer

Business[edit]
Operating revenue in 2005 was CDN$314MM with a market capitalization of CDN$1.4bn. Since then, Calfrac has become one of the largest frac service companies in Canada, and is growing internationally through strategic acquisitions.
History[edit]
Calfrac Well Servicing Ltd. (CWS) was founded in June 1999 as a private corporation by Ronald P. Mathison, Douglas Ramsay, Gordon Dibb, and Robert (Robbie) Roberts. At that time, Calfrac had a single coiled tubing unit and was based in Medicine Hat, Alberta. In December 2000, Calfrac acquired Dynafrac Well Services Ltd. and with it a two-pumper fracturing spread, a shallow coiled tubing unit, a high rate nitrogen pumper and four acid pumpers. By the spring of 2001, Calfrac had acquired and constructed seven fracturing spreads plus other well stimulation equipment.
Early in 2002, CWS expanded to the U.S. Rocky Mountain region by setting up a field office in Platteville, Colorado, and began providing fracturing services in the U.S., mostly to EnCana. Calfrac continued to construct more fracturing spreads in 2002 and 2003, and had nine complete spreads by the start of 2004. In addition to building fracturing spreads in 2003, CWS also purchased four shallow coiled tubing units from private companies to increase its fleet of coiled tubing units to eight.
In March 2004 Denison Energy Inc. reorganized and transferred all material assets to Denison Mines and Denison Oil Corporation (parent of Denison Resources), leaving income tax attributes and the purchase option agreement among Calfrac, Matco Investments (on behalf of itself and the other shareholders of Calfrac) and Denison Energy Inc. granting an irrevocable option to Denison Energy Inc. to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of Calfrac for an aggregate purchase price of approximately CDN$227.5 million less the net debt of Calfrac of approximately CDN$83.6 million. Denison Energy Inc. then de-incorporated from Ontario, and incorporated within Alberta. Following this, Matco Investments acquired class A common shares from the treasury (representing 45% of the total number of issued and outstanding class A common shares). Denison Energy Inc. then amalgamated with Calfrac and changed its name to Calfrac Well Services Ltd. The original founders of CWS remained with Calfrac, and form part of the current Board of Directors.
