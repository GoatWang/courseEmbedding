Discover Financial CEO Nelms seeks opportunities for growth

Posted 8/27/2006 8:39 PM ET
E-mail | Print | 




By Kathy Chu, USA TODAY
Ask David Nelms, the boyish-looking CEO of Discover Financial, what GNP stands for, and he laughs before answering correctly: gross national product.
The right answer didn't always come easily. During high school, Nelms missed out on a $10,000 college scholarship when he incorrectly defined GNP on a written test as "gross national profit." That experience dealt a valuable, if painful, life lesson.
"It's called 'attention to detail,' " says Nelms, 45, who lives in the Chicago suburbs, a 15-minute drive from Discover's 80-acre campus. "Some of the best lessons are when you get something wrong and learn from it."
Fast-forward nearly 30 years. Nelms heads a payments empire that generates about $100 billion in annual credit card spending, employs 14,000 and boasts 50 million cardholders. U.S. consumers have been increasingly paying with credit and debit cards, rather than cash and checks, creating richer revenue streams for Discover and its competitors.
But the industry is consolidating, and Discover, a unit of Morgan Stanley, is fighting larger rivals for every scrap of market share. Discover, whose largely blue-collar brand lacks the cachet of its competitors, is struggling to get its cards in the hands of more customers and to get overseas merchants to accept them.
Nelms has been through tough challenges before. In the late 1990s, the mistake he made — and learned from — was expanding Discover too quickly. 
It was 1999, a year after Nelms had jumped from MBNA, the credit card giant now owned by Bank of America, to Discover. As president, Nelms launched Discover's card operations in the United Kingdom, introduced its Platinum card and stepped up efforts to court customers through balance-transfer offers.
In two years, the company added $18 billion in new credit card loans and more than 11 million new accounts. It also boosted the number of merchants that accepted its cards to about 4 million U.S. locations, on par with MasterCard and Visa at the time. (Today, Discover is accepted at 4.3 million locations, compared with Visa's and MasterCard's 5.9 million locations, according to Nilson Report, an industry newsletter.)
A few years later, as the economy weakened, debt charge-offs grew, peaking in 2002 (a charge-off is considered an uncollectible loan). "We probably grew faster than we should have," Nelms acknowledges. "If I had to do it again, I would have focused on more consistent growth. That's what we're doing now."
The company has bettered its charge-off rate to half what it was a few years ago, partly by reaching out to some customers before they fall behind on their debt. Discover has also forged deals with GE Consumer Finance to issue Wal-Mart and Sam's Club credit cards, taking advantage of recent court rulings that allowed banks to partner with Discover. It has moved into debit-card processing by buying the Pulse electronic network and is expanding its card acceptance in Asia.
Yet, Discover remains an underdog. In dollars spent on credit cards, Discover holds a modest 5.6% market share, far behind American Express (23.2%), MasterCard (29.1%) and Visa (42.2%), according to Nilson.
Brad Hintz, an equity research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, calls Discover the "Betamax of credit card companies." Like Betamax, the now-obsolete rival to VHS videocassettes, Hintz says, "There was nothing fundamentally wrong with the system; the problem was that it was subscale in size."
Nelms is "an extremely capable credit card executive, but he's been in a tough position with Discover," says Hintz, who was an executive at Morgan Stanley before Nelms arrived and still holds an equity stake. 
Making of a businessman 
If pride and loyalty alone could revitalize a business, Nelms would have no problem closing Discover's sizable gap with its competitors. He is the ultimate Discover cheerleader. He drives a Corvette with the license plate DISCOVR. The car is orange — the color on the company's credit card logo. Nelms also has a 21-foot ski boat called Discover (though it's not orange).
And, "Every time I see him, he has an orange tie on," says David Sidwell, chief financial officer for Morgan Stanley, Discover's parent company. "He's so proud, and that's what you want" a company leader to be.
Nelms' knack for business was evident early. The son of an engineer and an elementary school teacher, he grew up in a middle-class neighborhood in St. Petersburg, Fla. At 14, he started a lawn-mowing business. In high school, he joined Junior Achievement, a non-profit that teaches business to youth, and set up a stock-picking company sponsored by a brokerage firm.
"You'll see that a lot of the success he has today was because he was a very serious kid," says Sandy Daffé, president of Junior Achievement of Chicago. Nelms serves with Daffé on the JA chapter's board.
Even as a full-time undergraduate at the University of Florida, Nelms managed up to 50 rental properties. Income from real estate investments helped pay for his studies in mechanical engineering and for his graduate education at Harvard Business School.
Mechanical engineering might seem like a curious major for someone who didn't plan to be an engineer. But not when your father was an engineer — and you had considered your future as much as Nelms had.
"The reason I went into engineering first is you do a lot of problem solving," he says. "You get a good analytical background, whether it's about constructing an organization or making a decision in investments."
One of Discover's key problems to solve: how to maximize business opportunities while being anchored to its parent, Morgan Stanley. Discover "doesn't control its own destiny as part of a larger financial services company, especially one that's so large," says David Robertson, publisher of Nilson Report.
Last year, Morgan Stanley announced it would spin off the Discover unit. A few months later, it backtracked and said it planned to keep it.
The reversal underscores the difficulty of leading a company that must bow to the wishes of another. Nelms recognizes Discover's limits: "Certainly, we are part of a larger firm and have to do what's right for all of Morgan Stanley. So when you're thinking about budgets and priorities, one always has to think" of that.
Sidwell says retaining the credit card issuer "fits pretty well" in the "context of (Morgan Stanley's) strategy of being a diversified financial services firm." Stable credit card fee income also appealed to Morgan Stanley. Last year, Discover contributed about 13% to its parent's $26.78 billion net revenue (after interest and consumer-loan expenses).
Spreading Discover's message 
In the mid-1980s, Discover was known for pioneering the first cash-back offers and no-annual-fee credit cards. Over the years, though, competitors have launched a slew of similar products, some more generous than Discover's. 
Today, Nelms' challenge is to "grow beyond that identity" of cash-back and no-annual-fee cards to attract new customers and keep existing ones, says Michael Auriemma, president of Auriemma Consulting, which advises Discover.
Discover has launched a marketing drive to reintroduce itself as the card company that "put(s) you first." Print and TV ads urge consumers to cut up other cards and move to one that gets rid of "the hype, the confusion" about terms, rates and benefits.
The ads are part of Discover's drive to carve out a bigger space for itself in the industry. Nelms says the brand's core features — its rewards and customer service — help distinguish it from competitors.
"We're trying to stand out more," he says. "We think we have a great story to tell."
