Why PennyMac?










We service the loans we originate — Unlike most lenders, we stay committed to our customers throughout the life of the loan. When you originate a loan with PennyMac, we’ll service your loan because we value your trust and decision to choose us.







No expensive brick-and-mortar retail offices — We believe in passing on the savings to our customers with low, competitive rates and fees available today.







A full range of loan products and beneficial services —  PennyMac’s Pre-qualification Certificate, for example, helps you understand how much you can afford before you start shopping. Your offer will stand out, and because you've put some of the paperwork behind you, your loan can close more quickly.













My loan officer worked very hard to ensure that our house refinance loan was processed in a short window of time so that it would be completed before our scheduled trip out of the country.
— Jeff M.

I like to thank Carlos Robles and Richard Kennimer. They were both very helpful and I greatly appreciated their assistance throughout the process. They made it easy to process the loan and hand in the required paperwork. The document upload process was simplified using the PennyMac secure website with my own personal account.
— Michael C.

About PennyMac Loan Services
As a top direct national mortgage lender, PennyMac is committed to providing its customers with a range of innovative solutions to help them purchase, refinance or simply remain in their homes. Whether they’re first-time buyers who are new to the loan process or someone who is specifically seeking a competitive Conventional, FHA or VA loan, PennyMac is dedicated to offering great rates and unparalleled service.

The company’s licensed loan officers are trained specifically to service home loans and to help customers through the process every step of the way.
Since being founded in 2008 by a team of mortgage industry veterans, PennyMac has sought to restore Americans’ trust in home ownership by improving the quality and consistency of the mortgage experience. The company is a major participant in the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP), the government program created in 2009 to assist underwater homeowners in refinancing their mortgages. PennyMac also buys loans from banks and other lenders, using its industry expertise to help customers restructure their mortgages so they can stay in their homes. To date, the company serviced more than a million loans.

(the “ Agreement ”), dated as of August 1, 2008,
is made by and between PNMAC Mortgage Opportunity Fund, L.P. (the
“ Company ”), a Delaware limited partnership
which will be registered as a nondiversified closed-end management
investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the

(the “ Investment Manager ”), a Delaware limited
liability company registered as an investment adviser under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “ Advisers Act
”). Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this
Agreement shall have the meanings given to them in the Limited
Partnership Agreement of the Company dated as of August 1, 2008 (as
the same may be amended from time to time, the “
Partnership Agreement ”) or the Limited Liability
Company Agreement of PNMAC Mortgage Opportunity Fund, LLC (the

(b)                                 
In addition to the authority granted
to the Investment Manager in Section 1 (a) of this Agreement, the
Company hereby makes, constitutes and appoints the Investment
Manager, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful
agent and attorney-in-fact, with full power and authority in its
name, place and stead, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement (i) to sign, execute, certify, swear to, acknowledge,
deliver, file, receive and record any and all documents which the
Investment Manager reasonably deems necessary or appropriate in
connection with its investment management duties under this
Agreement and as required by the 1940 Act and (ii) to (A) subject
to any policies adopted by the Board with respect thereto, exercise
in its discretion any voting or consent rights associated with any
securities, instruments or obligations included in the
Company’s Assets, (B) execute proxies, waivers, consents and
other instruments with respect to such securities, instruments or
obligations, (C) endorse, transfer or deliver such securities,
instruments and obligations and (D) participate in or consent (or
decline to consent) to any modification, work-out, restructuring,
bankruptcy proceeding, class action, plan of reorganization,
merger, combination, consolidation, liquidation or similar plan or
transaction with regard to such securities, instruments and
obligations. To the extent permitted by applicable law, this grant
of power of attorney is irrevocable and coupled with an interest,
and it shall survive and not be affected by the subsequent
dissolution or bankruptcy of the Company; provided that this
grant of power of attorney will expire, and the Investment Manager
will cease to have any power to act as the Company’s
attorney-in-fact, upon termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms. The Company shall execute and deliver to the
Investment Manager all such other powers of attorney, proxies,
dividend and other orders, and all such instruments, as the
Investment Manager may reasonably request for the purpose of
enabling the Investment Manager to exercise the rights and powers
which it is entitled to exercise pursuant to this Agreement. Each
of the Investment Manager and the Company shall take such other
actions, and furnish such certificates, opinions and other
documents, as may be reasonably requested by the other party hereto
in order to effectuate the purposes of this Agreement and to
facilitate compliance with applicable laws and regulations and the
terms of this Agreement.
 

(c)                                  
The Investment Manager shall act in
conformity with the written instructions and directions of the
Board, except to the extent that authority has been delegated to
the Investment Manager pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and
the Partnership Agreement. The Investment Manager will not be bound
to follow any amendment to the Partnership Agreement until it has
received written notice thereof and until it has received a copy of
the amendment from the Company; provided that if any such
amendment materially and adversely affects the rights or duties of
the Investment Manager, the Investment Manager shall not be
obligated to respect or comply with the terms of such amendment
unless it consents thereto. Subject to the fiduciary duty of the
Board, the Company agrees that it shall not permit any amendment to
the Partnership Agreement that materially and adversely affects the
rights or duties of the Investment Manager to become effective
unless the Investment Manager has been given prior written notice
of such amendment and has consented thereto in writing.

 

(d)                                 
The Investment Manager may, with
respect to the affairs of the Company, consult with such legal
counsel, accountants and other advisors as may be selected by the
Investment Manager. The Investment Manager shall be fully
protected, to the extent permitted by applicable law, in acting or
failing to act hereunder if such action or inaction is taken or not
taken in good faith by the Investment Manager in accordance with
the advice or opinion of such counsel, accountants or other
advisors. The Investment Manager shall be fully protected in
relying upon any writing signed in the appropriate manner with
respect to any instruction, direction or approval of the Board and
may also rely on opinions of the Investment Manager’s counsel
with respect to such instructions, directions and approvals. The
Investment Manager shall also be fully protected when acting upon
any instrument, certificate or other writing the Investment Manager
believes in good faith to be genuine and to be signed or presented
by the proper person or persons. The Investment Manager shall be
under no duty to make any investigation or inquiry as to any
statement contained in any such writing and may accept the same as
conclusive evidence of the truth and accuracy of the statements
therein contained if the Investment Manager in good faith believes
the same to be genuine.

 

2.                                      
No Joint Venture
.

 

Nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed to create a joint venture or partnership between the parties
with respect to the arrangements set forth in this Agreement. For
all purposes hereof, the Investment Manager shall be deemed to be
an independent contractor and, unless otherwise provided herein or
specifically authorized by the Board from time to time, shall have
no authority to act for or represent the Company.

3.                                      
Portfolio Execution
.

 

The Investment Manager shall effect
all purchases and sales of securities in a manner consistent with
the principles of best execution, taking into account net price
(including commissions) and execution capability and other services
which the broker or other intermediary may provide. In this regard,
the Investment Manager may effect transactions which cause the
Company to pay a commission in excess of a commission which another
broker or other intermediary would have charged; provided ,
however , that the Investment Manager shall have first
determined that such commission is reasonable in relation to the
value of the brokerage or research services performed by that
broker or other intermediary or that the Company is the sole
beneficiary of the services provided.

 

4.                                      
Compensation
.

 

(a)                                 
The Company agrees to pay to the
Investment Manager and the Investment Manager agrees to accept as
compensation for services rendered by the Investment Manager as
such, a base fee (the “ Base Management Fee ”),
which is accrued at the end of each month and is payable quarterly
in arrears at an annual rate equal to (i) during the Commitment
Period, an annualized rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) of
the total Capital Commitments and (ii) thereafter, an annualized
rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the Company’s net
asset value so long as such amount does not exceed one and one-half
percent (1.5%) of the aggregate Capital Contributions to the
Company; provided, however, that such fee shall not be payable to
the extent of any base management fees payable to the Investment
Manager or an affiliate thereof by any registered investment
company that invests in the Company. The Base Management Fee shall
be prorated for any partial payment period.

 

(b)                                 
In addition to the Base Management
Fee, the Company agrees to pay to the General Partner, after the
common equity holders of each registered investment company that
has invested in Common Interests in the Company have received
distributions in an aggregate amount equal to the sum of (i) the
aggregate initial net asset value of their cumulative Capital
Contributions and (ii) a preferred return on the amounts described
in clause (i) above calculated at a rate of 8% per annum
compounded annually on the average daily amount outstanding each
annual period, an amount equal to 20% of the sum of (A) the amounts
distributed to the members of the Parent pursuant to clause (ii)
above and (B) the amount paid to the General Partner pursuant to
this clause and, thereafter, 20% of all realized proceeds;
provided, however, that the Company shall pay such amount only to
the extent the Company does not distribute such amount to the
General Partner pursuant to Section 8.1 of the Partnership
Agreement.

 

5.                                      
Expenses .

 

The Company will be responsible for
paying the compensation of the Investment Manager and General
Partner, due diligence, negotiation and broken deal expenses, fees
and expenses of custodians, administrators, transfer and
distribution agents, counsel and directors, insurance, filings and
registrations, proxy expenses, expenses of communications to
investors, interest, taxes, portfolio transaction expenses,
indemnification, litigation and other extraordinary expenses and
such other expenses as the Investment Manager is not obligated to
provide (such as services the Investment Manager is required to
supervise, review or coordinate) and as are approved by the
directors as being reasonably related to the organization,
offering, capitalization, operation, regulatory compliance or
administration of the Company and any portfolio investments.
Expenses associated with the general overhead of the Investment
Manager will not be covered by the Company. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, and subject to review by the Board, the Parent and/or
the Company will bear the costs and expenses of the Investment
Manager as set forth in Section 9 of the Operating Agreement and
Section 9.3 of the Partnership Agreement, which provisions may not
be amended without the Investment Manager’s written consent.
On behalf of the Company, the Investment Manager may advance
payment of any such fees and expenses of the Company, and the
Company shall reimburse the Investment Manager therefor within 30
days following written request from the Investment Manager. Nothing
in this Section 5 shall limit t
