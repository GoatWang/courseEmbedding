Important Privacy Information*





Privacy StatementIntroductionAs a valued customer, we want to ensure your private information is kept private and only shared with those companies who are authorized either by yourself or as allowed or required by law.  This document explains our privacy policy, gives you reasons why we ask for the type of information we do, and if we do reserve a right to share information with non-affiliated third parties, lets you "opt-out" of our reservation to do so.  Please take a moment to read this entire policy.Collection of InformationThe purchase of a motor vehicle requires considerable accumulation of nonpublic personal information.  For example, if we sell or lease you a vehicle - extending you credit at your request - we will receive information from you in order to determine your creditworthiness.  We may also obtain information from a credit-reporting agency.  We may also obtain information from third parties such as employers, references and insurance companies.Some of the information we obtain from you may be required by state of federal agencies, such as the Department of Motor Vehicles or the Internal Revenue Service. This information may be required even if you were to pay cash for your vehicle. Examples would be a driver's license or social security number.Protecting Your InformationWe safeguard nonpublic personal information according to established industry standards and procedures.  We maintain physical and electronic safeguards that comply with state and federal law.  We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees and outside contractors who need to know the information to provide product or service to you.  We prohibit our employees and agents from giving information about you to anyone in a manner that would violate any applicable law or our privacy policy.Information SharingUnless we have indicated our desire to share your nonpublic personal information with non-affiliated third parties (by checking the box in the section below), we share information:A) For everyday business purposes, such as to process transactions, maintain account(s), respond to court orders and legal investigations, or report to credit bureaus.B) For purposes of processing a sale or lease transaction as your request or authorize, such as submitting information to third party financial institutions that may be requested to take an assignment of the contract or verifying insurance coverage information.C) When using outside service providers to help us provide you with products and services.  Before providing information to our service providers we enter into contractual agreements prohibiting them from disclosing or using the information other than for the purpose it was disclosed.D) With "Affiliated" companies.  Companies that are affiliated with us include any company that controls us, any company we control, or any company under common control with us. 



(enter your initials)I am interested in purchasing or leasing a vehicle and request that my Consumer Credit Report be obtained, at no cost to me, in order to help determine the types and extent of financing which may be available to me. 

 







If the item to the left is checked, this dealership reserves the right to disclose nonpublic personal information to third parties, such as market research firms, direct marketing companies, finance service providers and others who may from time to time seek to provide you information on valuable products or services.  


If the item to the left is checked, I direct you not to share nonpublic personal information about me to non-affiliated third parties, except as provided in this Privacy Policy.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch Rates Hyundai Auto Receivables Trust 2015-A



2015-03-24 14:42:25









CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to the notes issued by Hyundai Auto Receivables Trust 2015-A (2015-A):--Class A-1 asset-backed notes 'F1+sf';--Class A-2 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-3 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-4 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class B asset-backed notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class C asset-backed notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;--Class D asset-backed notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.KEY RATING DRIVERSStrong Collateral Quality: The 2015-A pool is relatively consistent with recently issued HART transactions, exhibiting a weighted average (WA) Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score of 743 and new vehicles comprising 94.5% of the pool. WA seasoning is slightly higher relative to 2013 to 2014 HART transactions at 8.4 months.Sufficient CE Structure: Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for all classes is similar to recent transactions. In addition, target levels have not changed from prior deals, and excess spread is 2.44%, up slightly from the HART 2014-B level at 2.27%. Initial CE is sufficient to withstand Fitch's base case cumulative net loss (CNL) proxy of 1.65% for all classes of notes at each class' respective loss coverage multiple.Improved Loss Performance: HCA's portfolio and securitization losses declined significantly from peak 2008 levels, driven by stronger underwriting and credit quality, as well as the improving U.S. economy and stable used vehicle values.Stable Origination, Underwriting and Servicing: HCA demonstrates adequate abilities as originator, underwriter and servicer to service 2015-A, as evidenced by the historical performance of its managed portfolio and securitizations.Integrity of the Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of HCA would not impair the timeliness of the payments on the securities.RATING SENSITIVITIESUnanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case. This could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to all classes of 2015-A to increased losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the notes display limited sensitivity to increased defaults and losses, showing no expected impact on the rating of the notes under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. The notes could experience a downgrade of one to two rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.The presale report is available at 'www.fitchratings.com' or by clicking on the above link.Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.Applicable Criteria and Related Research:--'Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria' (Aug. 4, 2014);--'Rating Criteria for U.S. Auto Loan ABS' (April 7, 2014);--'Counterparty Criteria for Structured Finance Transactions and Covered Bonds' (May 14, 2014);--'Structured Finance Tranche Thickness Metrics' (July 29, 2011);--'Criteria for Interest Rate Stresses in Structured Finance Transactions and Covered Bonds' (Dec. 19, 2014);--'Hyundai Auto Receivables Trust 2015-A' (Jan. 8, 2015);--'Hyundai Auto Receivables Trust 2015-A Appendix' (Jan. 8, 2015).Applicable Criteria and Related Research:Hyundai Auto Receivables Trust 2015-A (US ABS)http://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm rpt_id=849348Global Structured Finance Rating Criteriahttp://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm rpt_id=754389Rating Criteria for U.S. Auto Loan ABShttp://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm rpt_id=738718Counterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bondshttp://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm rpt_id=744158Structured Finance Tranche Thickness Metricshttp://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm rpt_id=646951Criteria for Interest Rate Stresses in Structured Finance Transactions and Covered Bondshttp://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm rpt_id=838868Hyundai Auto Receivables Trust 2015-A -- Appendixhttp://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm rpt_id=851008Additional DisclosureSolicitation Statushttp://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation pr_id=974816ALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
