Established in 1908 its current head office is in Glenview, Illinois.[1] It manages funds valued at $20 billion.
Sustainable Investment[edit]
The GBOPHB follows the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.[2] It identifies several countries as having "prolonged and systematic patterns of human rights violations."[3]
These countries include the Central African Republic, Israel, North Korea, and Saudi Arabia.[4] A total of 44 companies are excluded from its investment funds including all of Israel's major banks. The board also excludes a further nine companies due to their contribution to global warming.[5][6]

						Welcome to your "Benefit Connection" to the Virginia Conference! 
						 The office of the Virginia United Methodist Pensions, 
						Inc. (VUMPI), located in the Virginia United Methodist 
						Center in Glen Allen, Va., was established in 1965 to 
						provide support for those actively employed in, or 
						retired from, service in the ministry.

						Book of Discipline states that VUMPI shall "have charge of the interests and work of 
						providing for and contributing to the support, relief, 
						assistance, and pensioning of clergy and their families, 
						other church workers, and lay employees of the United 
						Methodist Church, its institutions, organizations, and 
						agencies within the" Virginia Conference "except as 
						otherwise provided for by the general board."

						is your primary contact for all matters relating to 
						pensions and insurance offered by the Virginia 
						Conference and/or the General Board of Pension and 
						Health Benefits of the United Methodist Church (GBOPHB).

						numerous employee pension and benefit plans sponsored by 
						the Virginia Conference.  Some plans are employer-paid, 
						while others are voluntary and 100 
						percent participant-paid.   

						For clergy participants, these plans include: 

						VUMPI
