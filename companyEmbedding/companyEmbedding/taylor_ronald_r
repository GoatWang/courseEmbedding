Item Description: InterVarsity Press, 2000. Hardcover. Book Condition: Fine. Dust Jacket Condition: Fine. hardcover with dust jacket, in Fine / Fine condition, looks like new, no "flaws" to note, a very nice looking book and jacket, ; A-315; "Lord, have mercy." This was Alliette's simple but profound plea as she drove herself to the hospital. She had been standing in her kitchen doing dishes. . . . Her husband and older daughters were not at home. Suddenly she felt something like water running down her leg. Alliette knew what it meant, but she couldn't believe it. She was only twenty-two weeks along. . . . She decided to drive herself to the hospital. She soon regretted it. In these pages you will find five stories of babies born before their time, fifteen to eighteen weeks short of the nine months allotted to form a child. Written by Daniel Taylor from extensive interviews, each story arises out of the practice of Dr. Ronald Hoekstra at Children's Hospital in Minneapolis, Minnesota. You will enter the neonatal intensive care unit, a quietly crowded place of babies, doctors, nurses, parents and machines. A place of drama, heartache, waiting and joy. And a place where God is found. The questions raised by the stories of these smallest of infants are as large as life itself. What makes life worth living? What is the balance of medicine and faith? This book is not a collection of case studies but the stories of women, men and tiny children with whom we explore the meaning of life, death and faith. Here is a book to encourage and inspire, a book about both the struggle and joy of life. "In the high-tech intensive care nursery of a major American hospital, we meet six premature babies, their devoted parents and a praying doctor. Their miraculous stories told in Before Their Time remind us that the most important formula we can feed our children is faith." Diane M. Komp, M.D., author of Images of Grace: A Pediatrician's Trilogy of Faith, Hope & Love "Daniel Taylor is one of the finest writers of our age. . . . The stories read like mysteries of grace which rivet us to the seasons of our own lives that feel premature and incomplete. What I learned not only brought me to tears of joy but to a deeper passion for the glorious timing of God's plan in my life." Dan B. Allender, coauthor of The Cry of the Soul.

I have been a patient of Dr. Taylor since 1994, and I can personally say that he is the best dentist I have ever visited. He is very professional, helpful, and knowledgeable, and his staff is always friendly and courteous. He is very diligent with staying on top of my routine dental maintenance and keeping me aware of any information or concerns I should know about. I visit him for both routine cleanings and for more important procedures, such as having my wisdom teeth removed. His dental hygienist, Debbie, has been performing my tooth cleanings for over ten years, and she is always great as well. I would highly recommend him to anyone in need of great dental care.







Had great experience at this dentist office..very professional.. and friendly..I will be using him from now on..







This happen about 5 years ago. Never herd of YELP till recently. He told me I needed a crown or other work on a certain tooth ASAP. That was 5 or more years now. Nothing happened then and it never did







I have been seeing Dr. Taylor since 1996 when they were in another location and followed them to the new location.  The staff is friendly and on top of things, I have never had an issue with billing or scheduling.  They have great hours, offering appointments as early as 7:30 a.m. which means I don't have to take time off work to get my teeth cleaned.  Terri cleans my teeth and does a wonderful job!  I had a dental implant about 9 years ago and it is still holding steady with absolutely no problems!  Strongly recommend him!

I have been a patient of Dr. Taylor since 1994, and I can personally say that he is the best dentist I have ever visited. He is very professional, helpful, and knowledgeable, and his staff is always friendly and courteous. He is very diligent with staying on top of my routine dental maintenance and keeping me aware of any information or concerns I should know about. I visit him for both routine cleanings and for more important procedures, such as having my wisdom teeth removed. His dental hygienist, Debbie, has been performing my tooth cleanings for over ten years, and she is always great as well. I would highly recommend him to anyone in need of great dental care.







Had great experience at this dentist office..very professional.. and friendly..I will be using him from now on..







This happen about 5 years ago. Never herd of YELP till recently. He told me I needed a crown or other work on a certain tooth ASAP. That was 5 or more years now. Nothing happened then and it never did







I have been seeing Dr. Taylor since 1996 when they were in another location and followed them to the new location.  The staff is friendly and on top of things, I have never had an issue with billing or scheduling.  They have great hours, offering appointments as early as 7:30 a.m. which means I don't have to take time off work to get my teeth cleaned.  Terri cleans my teeth and does a wonderful job!  I had a dental implant about 9 years ago and it is still holding steady with absolutely no problems!  Strongly recommend him!

I have been a patient of Dr. Taylor since 1994, and I can personally say that he is the best dentist I have ever visited. He is very professional, helpful, and knowledgeable, and his staff is always friendly and courteous. He is very diligent with staying on top of my routine dental maintenance and keeping me aware of any information or concerns I should know about. I visit him for both routine cleanings and for more important procedures, such as having my wisdom teeth removed. His dental hygienist, Debbie, has been performing my tooth cleanings for over ten years, and she is always great as well. I would highly recommend him to anyone in need of great dental care.

I have been seeing Dr. Taylor since 1996 when they were in another location and followed them to the new location.  The staff is friendly and on top of things, I have never had an issue with billing or scheduling.  They have great hours, offering appointments as early as 7:30 a.m. which means I don't have to take time off work to get my teeth cleaned.  Terri cleans my teeth and does a wonderful job!  I had a dental implant about 9 years ago and it is still holding steady with absolutely no problems!  Strongly recommend him!

Advances in dental technology, such as dental implants, offer a real solution to the problems that typically occur with missing or damaged teeth. If you currently suffer with missing teeth due to injury, damage or decay, and reside in the Las Vegas, Nevada area, consider dental implants at Ronald R. Taylor, DDS Dentistry.RestorativeBridgesMissing teeth have a great effect on both function and appearance, and replicating both can be a difficult task to accomplish, but dental implants in Las Vegas, NV have become a great alternative for patients who are looking to enhance their smile. Dentures, bridges and crowns are some of the most popular forms of tooth restoration, but the results of these treatments are limited, and oftentimes, the cons can outweigh the pros. Dental implants provide Las Vegas residents with a stable, long-lasting alternative that enhances both the look and function of their smiles.CrownsFor those individuals in Las Vegas, NV who have lost their teeth due to damage, decay or periodontal disease, mini dental implants may be just what you need. While there is a range of dental implant options available to patients, one of the most popular choices currently is mini dental implants. Mini dental implants are smaller in size when compared to traditional dental implants—allowing dentists to use them in a variety of dental procedures including placement of crowns, bridges and dentures.EndodonticsRoot Canal TreatmentWhether you are interested in replacing broken, damaged, decayed or missing teeth with mini dental implants, require more specialized treatments such as a root canal, or wish to enhance your smile with cosmetic dental treatments, Ronald R. Taylor, DDS Dentistry’s dental practice is your one stop destination.ProsthodonticsDenturesAll men and women in Las Vegas, Nevada strive to perfect their smile, but with so many options for replacing broken, damaged, decayed and missing teeth, it can be difficult to determine what the best options are. For those patients looking to replace a large group of teeth—a full arch or a full set—dentures are the logical choice. Are dentures right for you? The experts at Ronald R. Taylor, DDS Dentistry in Las Vegas, NV can help.Oral and Maxillofacial SurgeryOral SurgeryTooth ExtractionsBone GraftingThe main difference between traditional dental implants and mini dental implants (MDIs) is the size. Mini dental implants are smaller in diameter than regular dental implants—this smaller diameter allows the mini implants to be successful in patients that might not be candidates for traditional implants. The quantity and quality of bone in the jaw are one of the determining factors for candidacy—those without enough bone were once considered to not be ideal candidates for treatments and often needed to undergo treatments such as bone grafting before implants could be placed. Mini dental implants, due to their smaller stature, have allowed more patients to undergo treatment.GeneralTeeth WhiteningCosmetic DentistryAsk any dentist, especially Ronald R. Taylor, DDS in Las Vegas, NV, and they will tell you that the mini dental implant have revolutionized cosmetic dentistry.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
