This shows 
                  the fully populated 1024 pin test interface for the J750.

It is fully compatible 
            with existing probe interface boards (PIBs) and probe cards, and is 
            well suited for high-speed multi-DUT applications where electrical 
            cross talk is of critical concern.

            The PPRs modular design groups the contacts into 8 removable 
            pin segments, each segment containing 128 high-speed 50-ohm contacts. 
            Each of these high-speed contacts has its own adjacent return contact 
            (common ground), which reduces simultaneous switching noise. Device 
            power supplies and other functions are routed through the utility 
            contacts. There are 102 of these utility contacts per segment, and 
            each contact can handle 3 amperes.

 


 



      Fully populated, the PPR has 1,024 high-speed channel paths and 816 utility 
      contacts, but, if you prefer, you can configure it with only enough segments 
      to support your target tester configuration. Spring blocks are available 
      for any unused segment positions, to balance the forces on the probe card.

      The 8.47-diameter applications area on the probe/DUT card can accommodate 
      multi-DUT handler and probe patterns. A separate compression ring assembly 
      allows for program debug or hardware development free of the peripheral 
      (prober or handler). The compression ring works directly over the pin field 
      without infringing on the applications area. And you wont need special 
      frame or mounting hardware for the probe/DUT cards.

Company Overview





 
inTEST Corporation was founded in 1981 in Cherry Hill, 
      New Jersey. We design, manufacture, and market products that are used primarily 
      by semiconductor manufacturers to test their integrated circuits and wafer 
      products. Our solutions stem from two product segments; inTEST EMS Products Division with test head manipulators, docking hardware, and test interfaces, and inTEST Thermal Solutions with thermal test systems.








	  Recognizing the worldwide nature of the semiconductor industry and its need 
      for service and close technical support, we established operations 
      in Japan in 1987, Singapore in 1990, and Germany in 2000. Through these 
      inTEST subsidiaries, we quickly became known for our unsurpassed worldwide 
      service and support, which has been an important factor in our growth and 
      profitability.

      We conducted our initial public offering in 1997. With this additional capital, 
      we accelerated our internal growth and expanded our market presence with 
      important related technologies. We acquired TestDesign Corporation, a manufacturer 
      of tester interface products, in 1998, and Temptronic Corporation, which 
      makes thermal test systems, in 2000.

      inTEST test head manipulator and docking hardware products are manufactured 
      in New Jersey, and Singapore. Our thermal test systems are made 
      in Massachusetts and our tester interface products are made in California. 
      All of these products enable semiconductor manufacturers to enhance their 
      own profitability by improving the efficiency of their IC and wafer test 
      processes.

      Our end-user customers are among the worlds most important manufacturers 
      of semiconductors, including Analog Devices, Freescale Semiconductor (formerly 
      the Motorola Semiconductor Group), Intel, Sony, ST Microelectronics, and 
      Texas Instruments. Our OEM customers include the major automatic test equipment 
      (ATE) suppliers Accretech, Cascade Microtech, Credence 
      Systems Corporation, Electroglas, LTX, Teradyne and Verigy.

					Full Description



inTEST Corporation, incorporated on March 21, 1997, is an independent designer, manufacturer and marketer of thermal, mechanical and electrical products that are used by semiconductor manufacturers in conjunction with automated test equipment (ATE), in the testing of integrated circuits (ICs). In addition, the Company also markets its products to markets, such as the automotive, consumer electronics, defense/aerospace, energy, industrial and telecommunications markets. The Company operates through three segments: Thermal Products, Mechanical Products and Electrical Products. Thermal Products segment consists of the Company's subsidiaries in Mansfield, Massachusetts, which includes Temptronic Corporation; Germany, which includes inTEST Thermal Solutions GmbH, and Singapore, which includes inTEST Pte Ltd. Temptronic Corporation manufactures products under the Temptronic, Sigma and Thermonics brand names. Mechanical Products segment consists of the Company's manufacturing operation in Mt. Laurel, New Jersey. Electrical Products segment consists of the Company's subsidiary in Fremont, California, which includes inTEST Silicon Valley Corporation.Thermal ProductsThe Company's thermal products are sold into the environmental test market encompassing a range of markets, including the ATE, automotive, consumer electronics, defense/aerospace, energy, industrial and telecommunications markets. Its thermal products enable a manufacturer to test semiconductor wafers and ICs, electronic components and assemblies, mechanical assemblies and electromechanical assemblies. These products provide the ability to characterize and stress test a range of materials over extreme and variable temperature conditions that can occur in actual use. Thermal Products consists of ThermoStream(R) Products, ThermoChambers, Thermal Platforms, ThermoChuck(R) Products and Thermonics(R) Products. ThermoStream(R) Products are used in the semiconductor market as a standalone temperature management tool, or in a range of electronic test applications as part of MobileTemp systems. ThermoStream(R) products provide a source of heated and cooled air, which can be directed over the component or device under test. As a standalone tool, ThermoStreams provide a temperature-controlled air stream to stabilize the temperature of packaged ICs and other devices.The Company's MobileTemp Series combines ThermoStream(P) products to offer thermal test systems with uniform temperature control in a compact package enabling temperature testing at the test location. MobileTemp Systems are designed for small thermal-mass applications beyond the semiconductor market and have application in the automotive, electronic, fiber optic and oil field service markets testing, such as electronic sub-assemblies, sensor assemblies and printed circuit boards. ThermoChamber products are available in a range of sizes and can be designed to utilize liquid nitrogen or liquid carbon dioxide cooling or mechanical refrigeration. Thermal Platforms provide a flat, thermally conductive, temperature controllable surface that is ideal for conditioning of testing devices with a flat surface. Platforms are available with temperature ranges -100 degrees Celsius to +250 degrees Celsius.ThermoChuck(R) Products include precision vacuum platform assemblies, used primarily in the semiconductor to stabilize the temperature of semiconductor wafers uniformly during testing without removing the wafer from its testing environment. Such temperatures can range from as low as -65 degrees Celsius to +300 degrees Celsius. ThermoChucks(R) are incorporated into wafer prober equipment for laboratory analysis and for in-line production testing of semiconductor wafers. Thermonics temperature conditioning products provide tempered gas or fluid to enable customers to maintain desired thermal conditions within their tool or process. Its applications include general industrial, chemical processing, energy, electronics and semiconductor industries.Mechanical ProductsThe Company offers three lines of manipulator products: the in2(R), the Aero Series and the Cobal Series. These manipulators enable an operator to reposition a test head for alternate use with any one of several probers or handlers on a test floor. Certain members of the Aero family are also available as a solution for prober-only or handler-only test cell applications. The in2(R) and Cobal Series of manipulator products incorporate the Company's balanced floating-head design. This design permits a test head weighing approximately 1,600 pounds to be held in a weightless state, so it can be moved manually or with optional powered assistance, up or down, right or left, forward or backward and rotated around each axis (known as six degrees of motion freedom) by an operator. The same design features enable the operator to dock the test head without causing inadvertent damage to the electrical contacts.The Aero Series of manipulator products consists of the Aero 450H and Aero 150P manipulators. These manipulators are designed to handle test heads weighing approximately 1,500 pounds. The up and down movement is supported by an air-pressure-based floating state technology.The Company's docking hardware products protect the interface contacts and ensure proper repeatable and alignment between the test head's interface board and the prober's probing assembly or the handler's test socket. Its docking hardware products are used with floating-head universal manipulators when maximum mobility and inter-changeability of handlers and probers between test heads is required.Electrical ProductsThe Company's electrical products, which include various types of tester interfaces, provide the electrical connections between the tester and the wafer prober or IC handler to carry the electrical signals between the tester and the probe card on the prober or the test socket on the handler. The tester interfaces can be used with digital or mixed signal testers used in testing complex ICs. The Company provides a custom design service that allows its customers to use virtually any tester, prober or handler combination with any type of device, such as analog, digital, mixed signal and radio frequency. The Company also offers over 200 different types of tester interface models that the Company custom designed for its customers' specific applications.The Company competes with SP Industries, MPI Corporation, Cascade Microtech, Inc., ERS Electronik GmbH, Espec Corp, Cincinnati Sub-Zero Products, Inc., Espec Corp., Thermotron Industries, Environmental Stress Systems Inc., Advantest Corporation, Esmo AG, Reid-Ashman Manufacturing, Teradyne, Inc. and Knight Automation.

Boost 
      Your Yield With Better Interfaces  And A Better Interface Company
inTEST interfaces are designed to deliver higher yield 
      than competitive interfaces... And this is why: 

Engineering Excellence. 
          inTEST interfaces avoid lossy plastics and other components 
          that compromise performance. Our special materials and state-of-the-art 
          design give you wider bandwidths, lower cross-talk, and tightly controlled 
          impedance. The result? Fast-rise-time pulses with significantly better 
          signal integrity.
Deep Customizing.
          inTEST interfaces combine the reliability of selected standardized design 
          elements with an extensive program of deep customization, precisely 
          matching interface performance not only to the requirements of your 
          test, but also to the environment in which your test will be 
          conducted.
Rugged Dependability. 
          Our interfaces are designed and manufactured to be more durable than 
          competitors units. They last longer, so your test floor stays 
          up and running.















 
 


 



An 
            Interface You Can Trust

            We design and manufacture all our test interfaces at the Fremont, CA facility. Weve installed a 
            Class 10,000 clean room environment that is cleaner than those of 
            our competitors  in fact, it is comparable to that of most semiconductor 
            test floors. But we do more than that to earn your trust. 

            Unlike other manufacturers, we characterize the interfaces signal 
            path, using VNA (Vector Network Analysis) for cross-talk and bandwidth, 
            and TDR (Time Domain Reflectometry) for impedance, so were sure 
            weve met the parameters of your design requirement.

            In fact, we guarantee it. 

            If an inTEST interface does not meet the specified project parameters 
            for bandwidth and impedance, we will redesign it for you. Free. 
            









A 
        Company You Want to Work With

        When you get an inTEST interface, youre getting industry-leading 
        electrical and mechanical performance to meet your most demanding yield 
        targets. But even world-class interface design and superb engineering 
        arent enough. 

        You need an expertly designed company, too. A company that delivers 
        the interface fast. A company that has it working for you right out of 
        the box. A company that delivers another one as soon as you need it, exactly 
        like the first. A company that designs new interfaces for your new products 
        faster  and more efficiently  than anyone else in the business. 
        

That company is inTEST.

The company operates through two segments, inTEST Thermal Solutions and inTEST Electromechanical Semiconductor Products. The inTEST Thermal Solutions segment offers ThermoStream temperature management tools, MobileTemp systems, ThermoChambers, Thermal Platforms, ThermoChuck precision vacuum platform assemblies, and Thermonics temperature conditioning products. Its products are used to test semiconductor wafers and ICs, electronic components and assemblies, mechanical assemblies, and electromechanical assemblies. The inTEST Electromechanical Semiconductor Products segment provides in2 and Cobal Series manipulators that hold various test heads and enable an operator to reposition a test head for alternate use with various probers or handlers on a test floor; and docking hardware products that protect the interface contacts and ensure repeatable and precise alignment between the test head's interface board and the prober's probing assembly or the handler's test socket. This segment also offers tester interfaces that provide electrical connections between the tester and the wafer prober or IC handler to carry the electrical signals between the tester and the probe card on the prober or the test socket on the handler. Its products are used in the testing of wafers and specialized packaged ICs by semiconductor manufacturers, and in the front-end and back-end testing of ICs. The company markets and sells its products directly, as well as through ATE manufacturers, independent sales representatives, and distributors to semiconductor manufacturers, semiconductor test subcontractors, third-party foundries, test and assembly houses, and original equipment manufacturers. inTEST Corporation was founded in 1981 and is headquartered in Mount Laurel, New Jersey.Corporate GovernanceinTEST Corporation’s ISS Governance QualityScore as of N/A is N/A.
