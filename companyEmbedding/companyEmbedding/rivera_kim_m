            Kim M. Rivera        








Kim Rivera is Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary for DaVita HealthCare Partners (NYSE DVA) a global Fortune 500 healthcare services company with 65,000 teammates and operations in 11 countries. Kim is responsible for global risk management, internal audit, and legal matters. She has 20 years experience in advising Fortune 500 companies on corporate transactions, including acquisitions and divestitures, governance, compliance, risk management and litigation. 
Kim has managed a complex and diverse portfolio of business, risk and legal matters during her tenure at DaVita. She helped navigate the company and the board through DaVita’s most significant corporate acquisition, international expansion, a standstill with the company’s largest shareholder, an antitakeover program, multiple regulatory investigations, and the most fundamental regulatory shift in healthcare since the advent of Medicare. As a member of executive management and advisor to the board, Kim has worked on all aspects of these and other strategic enterprise matters. She is adept at managing risk in a fast-paced growth environment against a backdrop of intense regulatory scrutiny and change. 
Before joining DaVita, Kim was the Chief Compliance Officer, head of International Legal Operations and oversaw global labor and employment counseling and litigation at The Clorox Company. She also supported the Audit and Finance Committees of the Clorox board, including conducting internal investigations at the direction of the board and reporting on key risk management matters. Before joining Clorox, Kim served as General Counsel for a $2B division of Rockwell International. She helped negotiate and structure key commercial and international development agreements. She later served as Chief Litigation Counsel for Rockwell. She reported to the board on significant litigation and risk matters. 
Kim began her career at Jones Day where she advised Fortune 500 companies on diverse litigation matters including class action, commercial, employment and product liability matters. During her time at Jones Day she worked on several high profile matters and advised on the public relations, media and regulatory aspects of litigation. 
In addition to her work as a business executive and lawyer, Kim has served on numerous non-profit boards including the California Latino Community Foundation and the Denver Metro Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. As a board member for these organizations, she helped develop their brand, long-term strategy, and fundraising strategies. Kim has also been a frequent speaker on diversity and inclusion in corporations and the legal profession, with emphasis on women in leadership.
