Home » About Us

 About Us
Axeon Specialty Products (Axeon SP) is a specialty petroleum products company with a proud lineage.  Originally part of CITGO Asphalt Refining Company, the company was acquired by NuStar Energy LP in 2008.  In 2012, NuStar Energy sold 50% of its ownership of the asphalt business to Lindsay Goldberg LLC, a private investment firm located in NYC, to form a joint venture called NuStar Asphalt LLC.  Lindsay Goldberg LLC then purchased the company outright in February 2014, naming it Axeon Specialty Products.
Axeon SP boasts an extensive logistics network that includes a vast terminal system with significant storage and distribution capability.  The company also provides an array of petroleum-based specialty products, including high-performance modified asphalts and warm-mix products.  Finally, Axeon SP provides state-of-the-art technical services related to product development, solving pavement problems and providing general field support.
Headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, the company’s largest facility is located in Paulsboro, NJ, across the Delaware River from Philadelphia.  This Axeon SP refinery is comprised of two petroleum refining units, a liquid storage terminal for petroleum and chemical products, three marine docks, rail offloading capacity, a polymer modified asphalt (PMA) production facility and a testing laboratory.  The storage facility has a capacity of 4.1 million barrels.

Refinery Management
Where Petroleum Products Are Created













Let’s master your challenges together
In a refinery, day-to-day business involves many challenging processes and tasks, such as production planning, shipment planning, the loading and unloading of dangerous goods, production, storage, quantity accounting and stock management, financial accounting, customs and tax handling, risk management, and compliance with safety and security measures.
Your challenges:

Increasing operational efficiency
Optimizing planning
Reducing costs
Achieving a competitive edge in today’s challenging business environment
Simplifying complex IT landscapes
Achieving maximum transparency

 
Implico creates solutions that are designed to make your work easier. We optimize and automate your logistics and administrative processes. With our unique wealth of experience, gained over many decades in the industry, we can help you to get the most out of your refinery.
Example: Net Production
To enable flexible monitoring, a precise insight into the refinery’s production is needed, which requires an enormous amount of work. Often, employees working in production are provided with refinery mass balance software, which generates production flow schematics to offer a high-level technical view of the facility. 
For the supply and sales team at head office, however, this data is only of very limited use, since they urgently require an overview of the commercial transactions made during production. To meet these complex requirements, Implico offers sophisticated management tools with extensive automation.

Learn more about optimized refinery management!
We would be delighted to show you how to get the most out of your refinery.
