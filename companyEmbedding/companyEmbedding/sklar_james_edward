Overview
Carrying forward the tradition of the eminent Tyndale Commentary Series, these newly composed and revised commentaries take advantage of the wealth of biblical scholarship that has emerged since the original volumes were first published. More than a mere “updating” to replace old volumes with new ones, the editors of the series have seized the opportunity to update not only the content but also the format of the series. This new format emphasizes linguistics and the larger context of passages beyond the individual verses viewed in isolation in order that the reader may more readily see and understand the meaning of the biblical text.
These commentaries are designed to help the reader of the Bible understand what the text says and what it means. The Introduction to each book gives a concise but thorough treatment of its authorship, date, original setting and purpose. Following a structural analysis, each commentary takes the book section by section, drawing out its main themes, and also comments on individual verses and problems of interpretation. Additional notes provide fuller discussion of particular difficulties. In these new volumes, the commentary on each section of the text is structured under three headings: Context, Comment and Meaning. The goal is to explain the true meaning of the Bible and make its message plain.

Leviticus

Author: Jay Sklar
Series: Tyndale Commentaries
Publisher: IVP Academic
Publication Date: 2014
Pages: 336

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Levitical rules and regulations can at first appear irrelevant to contemporary Christians—but they provide important Old Testament background for understanding large portions of the New Testament. Leviticus describes a point in human history when God came and dwelt in the midst of the ancient Israelites and taught them what their purpose in life really was. Jay Sklar’s commentary makes clear what it is that the Lord said to them and, in so doing, makes clear what he says to us today.
This new commentary fills the place of the previous one written by R.K. Harrison and brings this sometimes difficult text even more keenly into focus for modern readers.


If you have always baulked at reading Leviticus, then get this book, and use it as a guide. It will be money and time well-spent.
—John de Hoog, Vox Reformata
Pastors, seminarians, and Bible teachers will surely benefit from this volume, and its readers will likely quote many of Sklar’s modern-day analogies.
—Kazuyuki Hayashi, Journal for the Evangelical Study of the Old Testament, 5.1 (2016)


Jay Sklar (PhD, University of Gloucestershire) is professor of Old Testament and dean of faculty at Covenant Seminary, St. Louis, Missouri.




 

Deuteronomy

Author: Edward J. Woods
Series: Tyndale Commentaries
Publisher: IVP Academic
Publication Date: 2011
Pages: 333

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Deuteronomy has been aptly described as a book “on the boundary.” It addresses the possibilities of new life “beyond the Jordan” as dependent upon Israel’s keeping of the law and acknowledgment of Yahweh’s supremacy. Moses leaves the people with his last will and testament that would ensure their success and well-being in the new land.
In this completely new volume on Deuteronomy in the Tyndale Commentary series, Edward Woods expounds upon the book’s breathtaking and all-encompassing vision. He shows how the Israelites—from king to ordinary citizen—were exhorted to make its words the interpreter of their life’s story within the land.


Edward J. Woods, now retired, was formerly senior lecturer in Old Testament at the Melbourne School of Theology, Victoria, Australia (formerly the Bible College of Victoria), where he still teaches part time. He has also served as a moderator in Old Testament studies for the Australian College of Theology, as a pastor in Australia and as a theological teacher in Northern Zambia.




 

Psalms

Author: Tremper Longman III
Series: Tyndale Commentaries
Publisher: IVP Academic
Publication Date: 2014
Pages: 479

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




The book of Psalms is the heart of the Old Testament, the libretto of the most vibrant worship imaginable. It informs our intellect, stimulates our imagination, arouses our emotions and stirs us to holy thoughts and actions. It is also a pivotal witness to, and anticipation of, Jesus Christ. Tremper Longman’s commentary interprets each psalm in its Old Testament setting, summarizes its message and reflects on its significance from a New Testament perspective, noting any citation and also providing a Christological reading.
This fresh commentary brings new perspectives from the two previous Tyndale commentaries on the Psalms by Derek Kidner.


This is a significant work of scholarship, accessible to the general audience, which provides both a compelling framework and an applicatory trajectory that is Christ-focused, all of which will gratify the judicious reader.
—Josh Moody, Journal for the Evangelical Study of the Old Testament, 5.1 (2016)
Longman’s contribution is a solid, sober, and up-to-date revision of an influential commentary on the book of Psalms in a series designed for pastors, students, and laypeople and will serve the readership well for the next generation.
—John C. Crutchfield, Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society 58, no. 3


Tremper Longman III (PhD, Yale University) is Robert H. Gundry Professor of Biblical Studies at Westmont College in Santa Barbara, California.

The Song of Songs

Author: Iain M. Duguid
Series: Tyndale Commentaries
Publisher: IVP Academic
Publication Date: 2015
Pages: 160

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




This Old Testament book, ‘the best of songs’, has fascinated and perplexed interpreters for centuries. We hear the passionate melody of romantic love, and are confronted by erotic imagery—but whose love is described? Is it a couple’s love for each other, God’s love for his people, or a poem that speaks to love in all its dimensions? Iain Duguid’s commentary explains how the Song is designed to show us an idealized picture of married love, in the context of a fallen and broken world. It also convicts us of how far short of this perfection we fall, both as humans and as lovers, and drives us repeatedly into the arms of our true heavenly husband, Jesus Christ.
Replacing G. Lloyd Carr’s The Song of Solomon, Duguid’s commentary on the Song of Songs utilizes up-to-date scholarship to paint a fresh picture of this provocative Old Testament text.


As one who found the original Tyndale OT Commentaries extremely helpful, this reviewer can only express the desire that all volumes from the original series will be rewritten with the same clarity as the volume that has been reviewed here.
—Ellis R. Brotzman, Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society 58, no. 3
Throughout Song of Songs the reader is pushed to know, meditate upon, and apply biblical wisdom in regards to marriage. Duguid has written an excellent commentary that calls one to draw closer to God. This work is a welcome addition for students seeking to get an introductory view of the Song of Songs, and it will be an excellent addition to any pastor’s library.
—Brian Koning, Journal of Biblical and Theological Studies, Vol. 2, Issue 1

Jeremiah and Lamentations

Author: Hetty Lalleman
Series: Tyndale Commentaries
Publisher: IVP Academic
Publication Date: 2013
Pages: 373

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Despite the themes of doom and destruction, the primary message of Jeremiah is one of the love and grace of a God who never gives up on those he has called to be his own. The prophet’s life is characterized by suffering, but he points to a new beginning, a new covenant and a new hope, eventually made possible through the unique Suffering Servant. Lamentations powerfully expresses personal and national suffering. Yet, even in these utterances of desperate grief, there are glimpses of hope.
Replacing the earlier Tyndale commentary by R.K. Harrison, in this new volume, Hetty Lalleman opens up these fascinating books for today’s readers.


Hetty Lalleman is tutor in Old Testament studies at Spurgeon’s College, London. She is the author of Celebrating the Law? Rethinking Old Testament Ethics, and is on the advisory board for an Old Testament commentary series in Dutch, to which she has contributed a volume on Jeremiah. Her PhD thesis was entitled Jeremiah in Prophetic Tradition.




 

Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi

Author: Andrew E. Hill
Series: Tyndale Commentaries
Publisher: IVP Academic
Publication Date: 2012
Pages: 368

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Despite the return of the Hebrews from the Babylonian exile, selfishness, apathy and despair crippled their community spirit. In response to this distress, God raised up three prophetic voices in Jerusalem. Haggai rallied the people to rebuild the Second Temple. Zechariah was given visions of the return of the glory of the Lord to Zion. Malachi preached repentance, covenant justice and restoration of proper temple worship. Andrew Hill’s excellent commentary on these oracles shows how they remain timely for the Christian church’s worship and mission in the world.
This newly composed commentary from Hill replaces the edition written by the late Joyce Baldwin.


Andrew E. Hill is professor of Old Testament at Wheaton College in Wheaton, Illinois. He is the author of commentaries on Malachi (Anchor Bible Commentary) and 1 & 2 Chronicles (NIVAC), coauthor of A Survey of the Old Testament and the Cornerstone Biblical Commentary on the minor prophets, and coeditor of The Baker Illustrated Bible Commentary.




 

Mark

Author: Eckhard J. Schnabel
Series: Tyndale Commentaries
Publisher: IVP Academic
Publication Date: 2017
Pages: 441

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Mark wrote his Gospel to explain why and how Jesus is the Messiah and Son of God who fulfills God’s promises as he proclaims and embodies the coming kingdom of God. Mark emphasizes Jesus’ authority and also his suffering and death as God’s will for his messianic mission. Eckhard Schnabel’s commentary seeks to help today’s Christian disciples communicate the significance of Jesus and the transforming power of the good news. Schnabel’s volume replaces the previous commentary from R. Alan Cole.


Eckhard J. Schnabel (PhD, University of Aberdeen) is Mary F. Rockefeller Distinguished Professor of New Testament Studies at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary in South Hamilton, Massachusetts. He has taught previously at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School (Deerfield, Illinois), Freie Theologische Akademie (Giessen, Germany), Wiedenest Bible College (Bergneustadt, Germany), and Asian Theological Seminary (Manila, Philippines). His books include Early Christian Mission (volumes 1 & 2), Paul the Missionary, and Der erste Brief des Paulus an die Korinther. He is the author of numerous articles, including “Luke” (with David W. Pao) in Commentary on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament and contributions in Dictionary of Paul and His Letters and Dictionary of the Later New Testament & Its Developments.




 

2 Corinthians

Author: Colin G. Kruse
Edition: Revised
Series: Tyndale Commentaries
Publisher: IVP Academic
Publication Date: 2015
Pages: 288

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Paul’s long, complicated history with the Corinthian church culminates in this ardent defense of Christian ministry in general and of his own ministry in particular. Colin G. Kruse provides an insightful analysis that illuminates Paul’s contrast of the old and new and covenants and his eloquent exposition of the ministry of reconciliation. He also charts a clear, plausible course through the maze of the literary history of Paul’s correspondence with the Corinthian Christians.
This second edition has been thoroughly revised, expanded, and updated by Kruse in the light of more recent scholarship.


Colin G. Kruse (PhD, Fuller Theological Seminary) is senior lecturer of New Testament at Melbourne School of Theology. In the twenty years following his ordination into the Anglican ministry, Kruse gained practical experience in parishes in Australia and the U.S. along with five years of missionary service as a theological lecturer in Indonesia. Besides journal articles on the New Testament, Old Testament and the Dead Sea Scrolls, Kruse has authored several books including Paul, the Law and Justification and New Testament Models for Ministry: Jesus and Paul. He has also written the Tyndale New Testament Commentary on 2 Corinthians and the Pillar New Testament Commentary titles The Letters of John and Paul’s Letter to the Romans.




 

James

Author: Douglas J. Moo
Edition: Revised
Series: Tyndale Commentaries
Publisher: IVP Academic
Publication Date: 2015
Pages: 196

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




The letter of James has often been defined in terms of moral earnestness, repentance and consistent social action, leading many to argue that it is not theological. This separation between theology and practice, Douglas J. Moo observes, can all too easily lead people to read Scripture as a book to be analyzed rather than a message to be obeyed - the very mindset against which James inveighs. Moo’s exposition of these themes illuminates James’s rich letter and its message for us today.
In this newly revised edition, Moo draws from important books and articles on James that have been published in the 30 years since the publication of the first edition to “tweak” some of his original interpretive conclusions.


The sixteenth volume in the acclaimed Tyndale New Testament Commentary series, James: Revised Edition is a masterpiece of theological scholarship and very highly recommended for personal, community, church, seminary, and academic library New Testament studies reference collections and supplemental studies reading lists.
—John Taylor, The Midwest Book Review, August 2015


Douglas J. Moo (PhD, University of St. Andrews) is the Kenneth T. Wessner Professor of New Testament at Wheaton College Graduate School. He has written numerous New Testament commentaries for the NIV Application Commentary series and the Tyndale New Testament Commentary series, specifically on the Pauline and general letters. Since 2006, he has chaired the Committee on Bible Translation, the group of scholars charged with revising the text of the NIV, and is the coauthor of The Rapture: Pre-, Mid-, or Post-Tribulational? and The Law, the Gospel, and the Modern Christian: Five Views.
