Improvement Act of 1996 ("NSMIA") [Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416 (Oct. 11, 1996)] imposes on the ability of States to
require information. As a result, if the securities that are the subject of this Form D are "covered securities" for purposes
of NSMIA, whether in all instances or due to the nature of the offering that is the subject of this Form D, States cannot
routinely require offering materials under this undertaking or otherwise and can require offering materials only to the
extent NSMIA permits them to do so under NSMIA's preservation of their anti-fraud authority.
