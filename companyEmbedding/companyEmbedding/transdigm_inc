TransDigm Group | Company Info, Products, Financials

















TransDigm Group (TDG)

















TransDigm Group (NYSE:TDG) | Products & Business Units





TransDigm Inc. was formed in July 1993 in connection with the acquisition of certain businesses from IMO Industries Inc. 
TransDigm Group Incorporated was formed in July 2003 to facilitate the acquisition of TransDigm, Inc.
The company was owned by private equity funds until its Initial Public Offering (IPO) in 2006.


TransDigm Group is a leading global designer, producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use 
on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today. TransDigm Group's business is well diversified due to its broad range of products. 
The company estimates that about 90% of total net sales for fiscal year 2014 were generated by proprietary products. 
In addition, it is estimated that TransDigm generated about 75% of its net sales from products for which the company is the sole source provider.
Most of the company's products generate significant aftermarket revenue. Once TransDigm's parts are designed into and sold on a new aircraft, 
the company generates net sales from aftermarket consumption over the life of that aircraft, which is generally estimated to be approx. 30 years. 
A typical platform can be produced for 25 to 30 years, which gives TransDigm an estimated product life cycle of 50-60 years to work with. 
TransDigm estimates that approximately 55%, 55% and 53% of total net sales in fiscal year 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, were generated from aftermarket sales, 
the vast majority of which come from the commercial and military aftermarkets. These aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin 
and been more stable than sales to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).


TransDigm Group is headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio and incorporated in the state of Delaware.


During the company's third quarter ended June 29, 2013, TransDigm changed its internal management structure and its reporting structure. 


TransDigm Group's businesses are now organized and managed in three reporting segments:  



• Power & Control
• Airframe
• Non-aviation


The following table highlights TransDigm Group's sales from 2012 to 2014 by segment:


TransDigm operates through the following business groups:
Acme Aerospace, Inc.;
Adams Rite Aerospace;
Adel Wiggins Group;
ADS/Transicoil;
AeroControlex Group;
Aero Fluid Products;
AmSafe;
Avionic Instruments, Inc.;
Avtech Corporation;
Bruce Aerospace;
CDA InterCorp;
CEF Industries;
Champion Aerospace;
Dukes Aerospace, Inc.;
Electromech Technologies;
HARCO;
Hartwell Corporation;
Marathon Norco;
Schneller;
Semco Instruments, Inc.;
Skurka Aerospace, Inc.;
Technical Airborne Components;
and Tyee Aircraft.


Products

TransDigm primarily designs, produces and supplies highly-engineered proprietary aerospace components (and certain systems/subsystems) with significant 
aftermarket content. The company seeks to develop highly customized products to solve specific needs for aircraft operators and manufacturers. 
TransDigm attempts to differentiate itself based on engineering, service and manufacturing capabilities. The company typically chooses not 
to compete for non-proprietary build-to-print (BTP) business because it frequently offers lower margins than proprietary products. 
TransDigm believes that its products have strong brand names within the industry and that the company has a reputation for high quality, 
reliability and customer support.


TransDigm's business is well diversified due to the broad range of products that it offers to customers. 
Some of the company's more significant product offerings, substantially all of which are ultimately provided to end-users in the aerospace industry, 
include mechanical/electro-mechanical actuators and controls, ignition systems and engine technology, specialized pumps and valves, 
power conditioning devices, specialized AC/DC electric motors and generators, NiCad batteries and chargers, engineered latching and locking devices, 
rods and locking devices, engineered connectors and elastomers, cockpit security components and systems, specialized cockpit displays, 
aircraft audio systems, specialized lavatory components, seatbelts and safety restraints, engineered interior surfaces, 
lighting and control technology and military personnel parachutes and cargo delivery systems.


Active commercial production programs include the Boeing 
737, 747, 767, 777 and 787, the Airbus A319/A320/A321, A330 and A380, 
the Bombardier CRJs and Challenger, the Embraer ERJs, the Cessna Citation family, the Raytheon Premier and Hawker and most Gulfstream airframes. 
Military platforms include aircraft such as the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, 
F-15 Eagle/F-15E Strike Eagle 
and F/A-18 Hornet/Super Hornet, 
CH-47 Chinook, 
and AH-64 Apache helicopters;
the Lockheed Martin
C-130J, 
the Airbus A400M, F-16 Fighting Falcon, 
and F-35 Lightning II (Joint Strike Fighter);
the Northrop Grumman
E-2C/D Advanced Hawkeye;  
the Sikorsky
UH-60 Blackhawk, 
the General Atomics MQ-1 Predator UAV 
and the Raytheon Patriot Missile. 
TransDigm has been awarded numerous contracts for the development of engineered products for production on the Airbus A320neo, 
the Boeing 737 MAX, and the Sikorsky S-97 helicopter.

TransDigm Group Incorporated (TDG  -  Free Report)	 announced the recent acquisition of three add-on aerospace product lines, for a total consideration of roughly $100 million.These product lines mainly comprise proprietary, sole-source products with significant aftermarket content. These product lines are in sync with the company’s long-term plan and reflect TransDigm’s strategy to acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content, in a bid to fortify its core business.The acquired business lines have combined revenues of about $32 million and will be consolidated into TransDigm’s existing businesses. The company financed the acquisitions through existing cash on hand.These acquisitions will add to TransDigm’s product range with their proprietary products that enjoy strong positions on high use platforms, robust aftermarket content and an excellent reputation. Products offered by them include highly engineered aerospace controls, quick disconnect couplings, as well as communication electronics.This step will enable TransDigm to expand its content on a number of substantial commercial and defense aerospace platforms.The company frequently acquires proprietary businesses with significant aftermarket content, which fortifies its footprint in its core market and is in line with its operating strategies.TransDigm recently completed the acquisition of SCHROTH Safety Products GmbH, and aviation & defense assets and liabilities of Takata Corporation.During the past year, TransDigm has acquired numerous businesses, including DDC, Young & Franklin/Tactair and Schroth. In the recently reported quarter, TransDigm posted an impressive 9.6% year-over-year increase in top line, as its accretive acquisitions contributed $70 million to sales. These businesses, which TransDigm acquired over the past year, include DDC, Young & Franklin/Tactair and Schroth.The company has been enjoying revenue growth in majority of its commercial aftermarket businesses. About 90% of its sales are generated by proprietary products. This translates into consistent revenue generation capacity through all phases of the aerospace cycle. We believe that stable aftermarkets, which have historically produced higher gross margins, will continue to drive financial performance in the upcoming quarters for this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company.These positive factors have reflected in the company’s stock price as well, in recent times. Over the past six months, TransDigm’s shares have appreciated 9.7%, outperforming the Zacks categorized Aerospace/Defense Equipment industry’s positive average return of 7.7%.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering in the industry include Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report)	, Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report)	 and Esterline Technologies Corporation (ESL  -  Free Report)	. While Rockwell Collins sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Raytheon and Esterline Technologies carry a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Rockwell Collins surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average surprise of 2.5%.Raytheon has managed to beat estimates each time in the trailing four quarters, for a positive earnings surprise of 5.2%.Esterline Technologies has a positive average earnings surprise of 34.9% for the trailing four quarters, beating estimates all through.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

History[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (March 2011)


Beginnings[edit]
Transdigm Incorporated was established in 1993 by W. Nicholas Howley and Douglas W. Peacock[3] after acquiring Adel Fasteners, Aero Products Component Services, Controlex Corporation and Wiggins Connectors from IMO Industries.[4]
Four years later, in 1997, the company purchased Marathon Power Technologies. [5]
Acquisition of Transdigm Incorporated by Odyssey Investment Partners[edit]
The next year, Transdigm Incorporated was acquired by Odyssey Investment Partners.[6]
Then, during the final two years of the century, the company added to its list of acquisitions with Adams Rite Aerospace and Christie Electric.[5]
In May 2001, Transdigm Incorporated procured Champion Aviation Products, a supplier of igniters, spark plugs and oil filters from Federal-Mogul Corporation for approximately $160 million.[7] It was at this time that Nicholas Howley took over the position of Chief Executive Officer from Douglas Peacock as Peacock transferred into his role as Chairman of the Board.[3]
Formation of Transdigm Group Incorporated[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (March 2011)


In 2003, Transdigm Group Incorporated was formed by Warburg Pincus Private Equity VIII to acquire Transdigm Incorporated.[8] This transaction materialized shortly after TransTechnology Corporation sold Norco, Inc. to Marathon Power Technologies.[9]
Then, in 2004, Transdigm Group procured Avionic Instruments of Avenel, New Jersey, a supplier of specialized power conversion devices for aerospace products.[10]
The following year, Transdigm Group purchased Skurka Engineering of Camarillo, California, a manufacturer and distributor of electromagnetic equipment[11] as well as the Fluid Regulators division of Esterline Technologies, who manufactures flight control valves and pressure valves.[12]
In June 2006, the company then procured both Sweeney Engineering and Electra-Motion Industries for a grand total of $27 million, along with CDA InterCorp in October of that year for an additional $45 million.[13][14] Three months later, Aviation Technologies, a producer of avionics and instruments, became a part of the TransDigm family followed by Bruce Industries, a producer of fluorescent aircraft lighting, in August 2007.[15][16] [17]
Inaccurate filings with Department of Defense and "hidden monopoly"[edit]
On January 20, 2017, Citron Research (CR) published a report on TransDigm highlighting its debt-financed acquisitions followed by deep cost cuts and "price gouging".[18] CR published another report on March 9, 2017, accusing TransDigm of illegal activity, noting that twelve of its subsidiaries failed to report their common ownership on federal forms under penalty of perjury. CR pointed out that this omission could be used to defeat federal procurement cost controls.[19]
On March 20, 2017, U.S. Representative Ro Khanna sent a letter to the Department of Defense Inspector General describing reports of "waste, fraud, and abuse" by TransDigm Group and calling for an investigation.[20] He wrote that TransDigm was able to operate as a "hidden monopoly" because its subsidiaries failed to report their common corporate ownership on filings with the Department of Defense (DoD). This omission allowed TransDigm to avoid the requirement that monopoly suppliers to DoD report their costs. The letter also cited several large price increases that occurred after the suppliers had been acquired by TransDigm. For example, a cable assembly increased in price from $1737 to $7863. Rep. Khanna's letter asked the DoD Inspector General to investigate (1) TransDigm price increases borne by DoD and whether performance improvements were behind the increases, (2) how procurement officers would have treated TransDigm differently had their filings been accurate, (3) how to lower short-term costs to DoD of procurement from TransDigm subsidiaries.

Cleveland, Ohio – TransDigm Group Inc. has acquired the stock of Schroth Safety Products GmbH and certain aviation and defense assets and liabilities from subsidiaries of Takata Corp. for approximately $90 million in cash. The primary businesses purchased are that of Schroth Safety Products GmbH and Takata Protection Systems Inc., both of which will be known going forward as Schroth, which design and manufacture proprietary, highly engineered, advanced safety systems for aviation, racing, and military ground vehicles throughout the world. Nearly all of the revenues are from proprietary products. Aftermarket content accounts for approximately 40% of the revenues, while aerospace and defense accounts for approximately 80% of the revenues. Schroth, which accounts for approximately 90% of the revenues, specializes in specialty technical restraints, passenger belts covering Airbus and Boeing platforms, structural monument airbags for Airbus and Boeing platforms including the Boeing 787, and cockpit security components for the Airbus A350 and A380 platforms. Schroth also provides restraint systems into business jet, general aviation, helicopter, military, and racing markets. Located in Arnsberg, Germany and Pompano Beach and Orlando, Florida, the acquired business employs approximately 260 people and is estimated to have revenues of approximately $43 million for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017.  W. Nicholas Howley, chairman and CEO of TransDigm, stated, "Schroth has built a solid reputation based on technical expertise and product excellence. The company has significant and growing aftermarket on attractive high-use platforms. Schroth fits well with our consistent product and acquisition strategy.
