Item Description

Specifications


Mimic two mature bucks fighting with the Primos Rack-n-Roll. The Rack-n-Roll was designed and tested in an independent sound lab where a real recording of two 140 in class bucks was broken down and analyzed by tone and frequency. Our engineers then took that data and created individually tuned nodes that exactly match those tones and frequencies produced by mature bucks in battle. Multiple sections of nodes were combined to create the volume and realism of two full sets of antlers coming together. To top it off, the Rack-n-Roll is the only rattling device that allows you to rattle with one hand so you have a free hand to keep your bow or rifle ready! Reproduces the sound of two full racks of mature bucks fighting Easy one handed use Quiet to carry and easy to pack Call Type: Rattling Systems Type: Deer Call Reproduces the sound of two full racks of mature bucks fightingEasy one handed useQuiet to carry and easy to pack

Dazzle Distributors
Dazzle Distributors, founded in 2013, mission is to bring Niche, Novel , and Unique products to the Dance and Performing Arts World that DAZZLE!
Dazzle Distributors originally started out as a dealer for  the first ever invented rolling Dance Bag with an attached garment  rack called “Rac n Roll”. As Rac n Rolls only dealer in the U.S.A. we provide Rac n Roll both retail to the public and wholesale to Dance Stores.  Rac n Roll is an innovative product that was originally invented to help dancers stay organized and have a place to hang up their Dance Costumes at Dance Competitions. Rac n Roll becomes a mobile closet on wheels! Today Rac n Roll has crossed over to countless industries, including the travel industry. Models, gymnasts, pageant participants, ice skaters, sports teams, cheerleading, pep squads, song girls, twirlers, theater performers, tap dancers, hip hop dancers, contemporary dancers, jazz dancers, ballet dancers, competitive dancers, airbrush artists, makeup and hair artists, sales reps, professional dance teams, summer camp kids, college students, photographers, teachers  and heck even the dry cleaner on the corner has a Rac n Roll set up! Rac n Roll creates a mobile dressing room on wheels! Anyplace you might need to hang up wardrobe or clothes, Rac n Roll is your solution. Rac n Roll has also become a stable in the travel industry.  Especially when travelling on a cruise ship where closet space is very limited. Rac n Roll is not a “duffel” bag. Rac n Roll is an actual piece of luggage or suitcase on wheels. It is perfect for the world traveler with or without  the garment rack in use.
Being that Dazzle Distributors is all about unique, niche, and novel products, it made perfect sense in 2015 to further that mission by introducing our Custom Airbrush Program.  A Rac n Roll Dance Bag is even more Dazzling with your custom airbrush name, studio name, dance studio name, team name, company logo, dance team logo, sports team logo, or whatever you would like airbrushed, WE CAN DO IT! It makes for a very special and unique gift! Need that special wedding gift with a wow factor? A personalized airbrushed bag with the new Mr. and Mrs. creates a priceless wedding gift! Need the best baby shower gift? What new mom doesnt need a rolling bag?
Our custom airbrush program is about encouraging people to be themselves! Be you, be unique, and be proud of it! You will also be the envy of the dressing room rolling in with a Custom Airbrushed Rac n Roll! Each bag is a unique work of art. No two bags are identical.
Although Dazzle Distributors was originally founded to do just that “distribute” dazzling products, in 2016 due to a  unfulfilled need we saw in the market, we introduced 2 of our own brand name products, dot2dance Portable Dance Floor and boobie bubble!
dot2dance Portable Dance Floor creates a SAFE SPOT to practice on a DOT! Although frequently referred to as a “turnboard” it is far from only  a turnboard. dot2dance can be used to practice dance ANY genera of dance anyplace SAFELY. Yes dot2dance is perfect  to practice dance turns, ballet turns, jazz turns, pirouettes, but it is perfect for so many other things too! dot2dance radiates the most clean, clear, crisp tap you will ever hear! Do to its innovative design and quality craftsmanship dot2dance is excellent for tap dance. dot2dance priority is safety. dot2 dance keeps the dancer safe, the dancers wardrobe safe, and the surface it is used on safe. With its genuine dance studio flooring “Marley” top, and its slip resistant backing it screams SAFETY top to bottom. Furthering our mission of unique products dot2dance comes in 4 sizes and can be personalized!
Dazzle Distributors newest product is boobie bubble. Another niche and novel product for dancers and endless industries. boobie bubble is a sticky bra travel storage case. It was designed with a purpose, but cute enough to even just use as a purse. Adhesive bras or commonly referred to as “sticky bras” are widely used by dancers, performers, or anyone wanting to not have their bras straps showing. They are very commonly worn under dance costumes, solo dance costumes, small clothing, tank tops, backless tops, formal gowns, prom dresses, sleeveless tops, little black dresses, sun dresses, summer dresses, costumes, halter tops and so many other items. Adhesive or sticky bras are designed to be worn multiple times. Due to lack of proper storage typically these items are worm only once. With boobie bubble not only do you have a place to store your sticky items, it also preserves it. bobbie bubble with its innovative and unique design has a secret panel inside that helps protect and preserve the sticky! Dazzle Distributors boobie bubble helps saves you the expense of having to buy sticky bras over and over. Preserve the first pair with a boobie bubble!
Dazzle Distributors is pleased to offer other dazzling products like personalized Arch and Foot Stretchers by FlexExpress and YOFI Performance Cosmetics. We are always looking for niche, novel, and unique products that Dazzle so please feel free to contact us if you offer something that Dazzles!

I live in a townhouse with limited space and I did not want to mess up my walls by mounting a bike rack for my sons bike. The bike rack Stand was perfect.  My son didn't have to use his kickstand. The rack kept The bike in its proper position. I was very satisfied with this product.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
