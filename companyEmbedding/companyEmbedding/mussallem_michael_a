In Memoriam: Charles Mussallem III, 57

        No Comments
      



Charles Mussallem III, a
highly respected leader in the area rug business who also helped establish No-Muv
Corp. as a top supplier of carpet padding, died on Aug. 24 due to complications
from heart disease. He was 57.
A
lifelong resident of Jacksonville, Fla., Mussallem was president of Mussallem Oriental
Rugs and Galleries, which has been a family-run business since 1897. He also
headed No-Muv Corp., a supplier of carpet and rug padding that manufactures
product in Dalton, Ga., using recycled waste yarn. In his duel capacity as a
marketer of fine rugs and a manufacturer of padding products, Mussallem is
widely credited with elevating the area rug segment and helping consumers optimize
the look and performance of their investment.   
Mussallem
was highly active in his local community, devoting himself to expanding the
economy by developing international trade opportunities. He served on the
Jacksonville Port Authority, Zoning and Planning Commission, the Chamber of
Commerce, the International Relations and Marketing Development Commission, the
North Florida Regional International Affairs Commission, and the Industry
Sector Advisory Committee on Textiles & Apparel. He also served on the
board of trustees of Jacksonville University and the board of the Florida
Community College at Jacksonville Foundation.
His
appreciation for the beauty and artistry of Oriental rugs inspired him to
gather some of the finest examples he could find and create a one-of-a-kind
gallery exhibit. After about 18 months, a collection of 36 rugs was assembled
and exhibited called “Kings, Heroes and Nomads” in 1983. He also wanted to
share the core beliefs that defined his life. In 2002, he published a book
titled About Life, A Philosophy
of Living.  
Mussallem
is predeceased by his parents, Charles S. Mussallem, Jr. and Marie Hero
Mussallem. He is survived by his wife, Dawn M. Mussallem; seven children, Tori
Mussallem, Anna Mussallem, Cristina Mussallem Haddad (Michael), Charles
Mussallem IV, Michael Mussallem, Cecelia Mussallem and Sophia Mussallem; and siblings,
Rosemarie D'Amour, Joanne Herro, Linda Herro (Kahlil), James Mussallem (Kristi)
and Marlene Jabour (Jay).
Services were held in
Jacksonville at Assumption Catholic Church Aug. 26, followed by a burial at
Evergreen Cemetery. In lieu of flowers the family requests donations be made to
the Charles S. Mussallem III Memorial Fund, 5801 Philips Highway, Jacksonville,
Fla., 32216.
