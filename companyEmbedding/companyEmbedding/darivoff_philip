Phil Darivoff of DFG Investment Advisers Headlines Ivy Family Office New York City Forum



Share Article


















Phil Darivoff of DFG Investment Advisers discusses CLO strategies for family offices; leads a discussion on credit markets.







Phil Darivoff

Value-sensitive money managers such as hedge funds, have become the dominant buyers of mezzanine CLO debt (securities rated Single-B, Double-B or Triple-B). Mezzanine CLO yields have remained attractive compared to high yield bond or bank loan funds.


New York, NY (PRWEB)
February 27, 2014
 The Ivy Family Office Network hosted its February 2014 Family Office Outlook Forum in New York, NY on February 13th. Phil Darivoff, Chairman of DFG Investment Advisers, led a panel discussion on “Finding Yield in a ZIRP Environment”.
Darivoff commented, “Opportunities in the credit markets have arisen from financial crisis spawned regulation.  Before the crisis, commercial banks were among the most active investors in CLO debt. Now, Banks have largely stepped back from this market. Value-sensitive money managers, such as hedge funds, have become the dominant buyers of mezzanine CLO debt (securities rated Single-B, Double-B or Triple-B). This is largely because mezzanine CLO yields have remained attractive compared to mainstream opportunities like high yield bond or bank loan funds.”
He continued, “DFG has been able to find value in the current mezzanine CLO market, and we see yields continuing to remain attractive. With higher yields, lower interest rate risk and lower risk of loss from default compared to high yield bonds and bank loans, we believe the CLO market is a good place to find value. ”
Other speakers on the panel included Eric Rosen of Reef Road Capital, Patrick Maldari of Aberdeen Asset Management, Zhengyuan Lu of OnDeck and Mickey Vetter of Market Access Partners.

July 18, 2013 9:56 am




Philip M. Darivoff, a recently retired Goldman Sachs partner, has been appointed chairman of DFG Investment Advisers, an asset management firm in New York.
Mr. Darivoff, who spent 27 years at Goldman before retiring this year, was also named chairman of DFG’s parent company, Vibrant Capital Partners, according to an announcement on Wednesday. DFG, founded in 2006, specializes in structured and alternative credit products.
“We are very pleased to welcome Phil to our firm,” Volkan Kurtas, the founder and chief executive of DFG, said in a statement. “I believe both our clients and team will benefit tremendously from his expertise, leadership and integrity.”
Most recently, Mr. Darivoff was a member of Goldman’s structured finance capital committee and director of the firm’s office of alumni relations. He joined the firm in 1985 and was named partner in 1998. He served in various roles, including head of capital markets and co-head of the corporate bond department. 
Mr. Darivoff, who received undergraduate and business degrees from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, is among many members of his Goldman partnership class to find new career opportunities after retiring from the firm.

Leadership Spotlight: Phil Darivoff, W’79, WG’85 

By Elisa Ludwig
The medieval rabbi and philosopher Maimonides wrote that we might anticipate charity by preventing poverty. Teaching someone a trade, for example, can prevent poverty and, in turn, the need for charity.
For Phil Darivoff (W’79, WG ’85), whose grandparents came to America from Russian and Eastern Europe to find greater opportunities for his generation, these words have personal significance. Indeed, they are a guiding principle in his professional and philanthropic life.
“I often think about what we Wharton graduates do when we succeed, and the leveraged contribution that a successful business person can make to our society,” says Darivoff. A partner and managing director at Goldman Sachs, Darivoff has made his own contributions through a consistent and active commitment to Wharton.
Darivoff was himself introduced to Wharton by a likeminded alumnus, Morris Nunes, C’70. Nunes encountered the teenage Darivoff in a Fairfax, VA, hardware store and suggested that he consider applying to Wharton. Darivoff took this passing advice to heart, and enrolled in 1975. As an undergraduate, he met his wife, Betsy Marks Darivoff, C’79, discovered a passion for finance and decided to pursue his MBA. “Wharton was absolutely a transforming opportunity for me,” Darivoff says.
After graduation, Darivoff joined Goldman Sachs as an associate in mortgage securities, a job he believes he would not have been offered without his Wharton degree. “When I came into the firm I understood corporate strategy, which allowed me to think more like a senior executive than a technician,” he says. Two years in, he was promoted to vice president. Today, in addition to his roles as partner and managing director, Darivoff is chairman of credit capital markets.
Darivoff’s interest in philanthropy developed in tandem with his career. “I got to a point where I looked back and reflected on the initial sacrifices of my parents and grandparents and the great opportunity I had been given to go to Penn and Wharton,” he says. Darivoff has been offering the same opportunities to others by leading Goldman Sachs’ recruitment effort at Wharton for nearly a decade. He currently sits on Wharton’s Board of Overseers and serves as a co-chair for the 20th reunion of his MBA class.
In addition, the Darivoffs have recently honored their grandparents by naming a study room in their honor in Jon M. Huntsman Hall and endowing the Rebecca and Morris Marks Professorship in accounting. Darivoff sees all of this as part of a larger effort to “anticipate charity” and encourage others in the business community to give back. “It is difficult to repay the people who have helped you, except by honoring them in some way, and in doing so, you hope you can also help others.”
