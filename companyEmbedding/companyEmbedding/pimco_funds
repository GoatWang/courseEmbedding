Equity



Equity strategies offer the potential for attractive long-term returns relative to other asset classes as well as a high level of liquidity. While historically more volatile than investments in fixed income, investments in stocks often serve as core holdings in balanced portfolios for many types of investors.

Real Assets



​Strategies that employ real assets aim to have either an explicit or implicit return correlation to inflation. Real assets include inflation-linked bonds, commodities and real estate or some combination of those assets. This can potentially enhance portfolio diversification, mitigate inflation risk and provide more stable real (after-inflation) returns.

Commodities-Based StrategiesGlobal Real Return Strategies




Currency



Currency strategies can provide efficient and risk-aware portfolio diversification while targeting opportunities to exploit structural inefficiencies and valuation misalignments in global currency markets. They can offer exposure to select developed and developing economies where favorable economic fundamentals indicate a potential for currency appreciation.

Asset Allocation



PIMCO's asset allocation strategies employ our proven investment process to create portfolios positioned in key global risk factors within traditional and alternative asset classes. These strategies seek attractive risk adjusted returns and true portfolio diversification utilizing dynamic multi asset and risk factor solutions. These approaches may also employ a tail risk hedging program to help protect against systemic market shocks.

Jackson National Drops PIMCO Fund for DoubleLine Product 

							One of the largest providers of variable annuities is planning to bump PIMCO's total return strategy out of its products, replacing it with DoubleLine’s core fixed income fund.
						


By Julie Segal



Copyright: Bigstock.


Jackson National, one of the largest variable annuity
    providers in the U.S., is planning to remove PIMCOs total
    return strategy, made famous by Bill Gross until his
    high-profile departure in 2014, and replace it with
    DoubleLines core fixed income fund.
With a variable annuity, which is a tax-advantaged form of
    insurance, individuals get to choose money managers to oversee
    their underlying investments in the annuity. Insurance
    companies vet money managers and then create an authorized list
    of investments for clients to pick from. Jackson National will
    change the subadvisor for its JNL/Total Return Bond Fund from
    the PIMCO fund, which now has $3.4 billion in assets from the
    insurers clients, to DoubleLine Capital, according to a
    Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
Jackson National has offered the PIMCO total return strategy
    since 1998. The insurance company offers the investment
    strategy within a separate account created specifically for the
    variable annuity product. Since Grosss departure, the
    PIMCO Total Return Fund has been overseen by Mark Kiesel, Mihir
    Worah and Scott Mather.
DoubleLines $8 billion Core Fixed Income Fund is
    co-managed by co-founder Jeffrey Gundlach and Jeffrey Sherman,
    the firms deputy chief investment officer. A PIMCO
    spokesman declined to comment. A spokesman for DoubleLine also
    declined to comment and referred questions to Jackson National.
    Jackson National did not return calls by press time.
Jackson National will continue to offer other PIMCO
    strategies, including PIMCO Real Return and PIMCO Credit
    Income, and is also planning to begin offering the PIMCO Income
    Fund, according to the SEC filing. PIMCO Income is one of the
    money managers best performing funds and its largest. The
    life insurance company is also planning to add other funds,
    including ten portfolios from the Vanguard Group, as well as
    funds from Invesco and other asset managers.
DoubleLine has been offering other funds in Jackson
    Nationals variable annuity series, including the Total
    Return Bond strategy, which is focused on mortgage-backed
    securities; Emerging Markets Fixed Income; and the DoubleLine
    Shiller Enhanced CAPE fund, a smart beta equity fund. 
Since Grosss departure from PIMCO, clients have been
    draining assets from the total return fund. At its peak the
    fund managed more than $200 billion. Now it has $73.8 billion,
    according to Morningstar.
PIMCOs Total Return Fund returned 2.88 percent
    annually over the past five years as of June 5, compared
    with the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate bond
    indexs return of 2.27 percent. The DoubleLine Core Fixed
    Income Fund generated a 3.54 percent return annually over the
    same time period.

Performance quoted represents past performance. Past performance is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so that Fund shares may be worth more or less than their original cost when sold. Performance data current to the most recent month-end is available by clicking HERE or by calling 888-400-4ETF. Differences in the Fund’s performance versus the index and related attribution information with respect to particular categories of securities or individual positions may be attributable, in part, to differences in the pricing methodologies used by the Fund and the index. 
Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the funds carefully before investing. This and other information are contained in the fund’s prospectus, which may be obtained by contacting your PIMCO representative or by clicking HERE. Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest.






A Word About Risk : Exchange Traded Funds (“ETF”) are afforded certain exemptions from the Investment Company Act. The exemptions allow, among other things, for individual shares to trade on the secondary market. Individual shares cannot be directly purchased from or redeemed by the ETF. Purchases and redemptions directly with ETFs are only accomplished through creation unit aggregations or “baskets” of shares. Shares of an ETF are bought and sold at market price (not NAV). Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Investment policies, management fees and other information can be found in the individual ETF’s prospectus. 
ETFs are subject to secondary market trading risks. Shares of an ETF will be listed for trading on an exchange, however, there can be no guarantee that an active trading market for such shares will develop or continue. There can be no guarantee that an ETF's exchange listing or ability to trade its shares will continue or remain unchanged. Shares of an ETF may trade on an exchange at prices at, above or below their most recent NAV. The per share NAV of an ETF is calculated at the end of each business day, and fluctuates with changes in the market value of the Fund’s holdings. The trading prices of an ETF's shares fluctuate continuously throughout the trading day based on market supply and demand, which may not correlate to NAV. The trading prices of an ETF's shares may differ significantly from NAV during periods of market volatility, which may, among other factors, lead to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV. 
Premiums (when market price is above NAV) or discounts (when market price is below NAV) reflect the differences (expressed as a percentage) between the NAV and the Market Price of the Fund on a given day, generally at the time the NAV is calculated. A discount or premium could be significant. Data in chart format displaying the frequency distribution of discounts and premiums of the Market Price against the NAV can be found for each Fund at www.pimcoetfs.com. 
Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions. Due to the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract significantly from investment returns. Investment in Fund shares may not be advisable for investors who expect to engage in frequent trading.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
