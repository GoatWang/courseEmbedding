High Performance Beverage Co. to Ship Additional Product to Amazon.com as Company Looks to Focus on U.S. SalesTweet

CAVE CREEK, AZ--(NewMediaWire - Sep 7, 2016) - High Performance Beverage Co. (OTC PINK: TBEV) (the "Company") is pleased to announce additional shipments of their High Performance Sports Drink to Amazon.com and the settlement of its litigation with Overtime Marketing SE, LLC.
Over the last several weeks the Company has experienced peek interest in their sports drink resulting in additional cases being sent to Amazon.com in order to meet anticipated order demands. An additional 500 cases has been sent out this week representing the maximum amount that Amazon.com will hold in their warehouses for inventory purposes. However, the Company is currently seeking to have Amazon.com expand their inventory allowance to several thousand cases in order to keep better inventory levels available at all times and prevent them from selling out, as they have previously done before. This will also help to reduce shipping costs for the Company since the product is distributed to several regional Amazon warehouses spread throughout the country.
