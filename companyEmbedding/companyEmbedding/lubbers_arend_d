Notes



[1]



Arend Donselaar "Don" Lubbers (born July 23, 1931) was president of Grand Valley State University (and predecessor Grand Valley State College) from 1969 to 2001. He was the second president of Grand Valley, serving after James Zumberge and before Mark Murray. He currently holds the title of President Emeritus. Most of the university's growth came during his tenure.
Early life[edit]
Lubbers graduated from Hope College, where his father Irwin Lubbers was president, and received his master's degree from Rutgers University in 1956.
He taught at Wittenberg University .
He served as president of Central College in Pella, Iowa, until he became Grand Valley's president.
Grand Valley State University[edit]
Lubbers became president of what was then Grand Valley State College at the age of 37, making him one of the nation's youngest university presidents.
The university expanded from a small cluster of colleges to Michigan's fastest growing university.
Lubbers Stadium on the Allendale Campus is named for him.
When he retired in 2001, Lubbers was the longest serving state university leader in the country.

Arend D. Lubbers













Arend (Don) Lubbers was Grand Valley State University's highly celebrated president from its youth in 1968 to its modern image in 2001. Don grew up on college campuses. His father was president of Hope College from 1945 to 1963, and was a professor and president of other colleges before that. Don graduated from Hope and earned his Master of Arts in History from Rutgers University in 1956. He taught at Wittenberg College in Ohio before returning to Rutgers in 1958 to pursue a doctorate. In 1960 he was appointed president of Central College in Pella, Iowa at the age of 29, becoming the youngest college president in the nation. Two years later, the young academic attracted national attention when Life magazine included him in its 1962 feature "Red-Hot Hundred," profiling 100 outstanding American leaders under 40. Don was still among the youngest college presidents in the nation when he accepted Grand Valley's offer in November 1968 and assumed the Presidency in January 1969. When Don retired in 2001, he was the longest-serving public university president in the country. During Don's tenure, Grand Valley saw the construction of academic buildings and residence halls in Allendale, the creation of the Meijer Campus in Holland, and the opening of the Eberhard Center and Richard M. DeVos Center in Grand Rapids (all occurred during the Lubbers presidency). The university also extended its service with programs in Muskegon and Traverse City, in cooperation with local community colleges. Don guided the university's response to regional education needs with the establishment of the Seidman College of Business, the Kirkhof College of Nursing, and the Schools of Education, Social Work, Health Sciences, Engineering, and Communication. Also during his tenure, GVSU's programs in music, art, chemistry, education, social work, business, and nursing have earned professional accreditations. Lubbers Stadium on the Allendale Campus is named for him.

History[edit]
"Lakers Stadium" - as it was originally known - hosted its first football game on September 15, 1973 against Kalamazoo College. The Lakers won their first ever home game by defeating the Hornets 27-14.[6] The stadium was officially dedicated and formally named "Arend D. Lubbers Stadium" on September 15, 1979.[7]
Location[edit]
Lubbers Stadium is located in the northwest part of campus along with most all other athletics facilities, just north of the Kelly Family Sports Center and just south of Lake Michigan Drive.

Expansions[edit]
Beginning in the spring of 2011, Lubbers Stadium began undergoing a series of expansions and renovations that will increase capacity, concessions, and restroom facilities. The improvements are being paid for by several large private gifts.[8]
2011[edit]
The first year of expansion included replacing the student seating section with new stands, increasing student seating by 400 seats and wrapping around the corners of the stadium creating a horseshoe. Permanent concession stands and restrooms behind student section were also built to accommodate the increase in seating and the fans sitting in the south end. The wooden benches in the east and west grandstands were wrapped in blue acrylic plastic to provide more comfortable seating and a longer lifespan.
2012[edit]
In second year of renovations the field was lowered by eight feet and the outdoor track surface was removed and replaced by the new track and lacrosse stadium that was constructed on the south side of campus. Lowering the field gave the opportunity to add four rows of seating down toward the field in a horseshoe configuration, adding 2,000 seats. Chair-back seats were added in four of the new sections behind the home sideline. A grass slope was built behind the north end zone and in front of the video board for overflow seating and the band section was moved to the southeast corner. The field was then replaced with an artificial turf playing surface.[9]
2016[edit]
The existing video board in the stadium was replaced. The new board is 40 feet tall and 72.5 feet wide, a total display area of 2,900 square ft. making the new board nine times larger than the old one. It is the largest board in Division II and would rank second among all FCS schools, it is the third largest in the state of Michigan and the 40th largest on-campus display board in the country. In addition a 18 x 8 scoreboard was added to the south side of the stadium.[10]
Beyond[edit]
Designed with the future in mind, the stadium can have permanent seating added when needed, with ultimate expansion to 20,000 seats.[4] In the years beyond this expansion the University plans on adding visiting locker rooms under the east grandstand and remove the existing press box and replace it with a larger one to add more seating and sky boxes. These improvements would be paid for by a public fund raising campaign.

Stadium traditions[edit]

"Cannons" – After every touchdown or field goal score by GVSU, "cannons" or fireworks are shot off behind the student section on the south end of the stadium.
"Grass slopes" – Grass slopes have existed in Lubbers Stadium since its initial construction. Through various expansions and renovations, the athletic department has made it a priority to preserve a grass slope in the stadium.[8]
"Rowing" – After every touchdown or field goal score by GVSU, the Laker student section sits down and "rows" like a rowboat the total number of points scored by the team thus far in the game.
"Lubbers Leap" - When the team enters the field from the north ramp prior to kickoff they run across the field and leap into the student section in the south endzone.

History[edit]
"Lakers Stadium" - as it was originally known - hosted its first football game on September 15, 1973 against Kalamazoo College. The Lakers won their first ever home game by defeating the Hornets 27-14.[6] The stadium was officially dedicated and formally named "Arend D. Lubbers Stadium" on September 15, 1979.[7]
Location[edit]
Lubbers Stadium is located in the northwest part of campus along with most all other athletics facilities, just north of the Kelly Family Sports Center and just south of Lake Michigan Drive.

Expansions[edit]
Beginning in the spring of 2011, Lubbers Stadium began undergoing a series of expansions and renovations that will increase capacity, concessions, and restroom facilities. The improvements are being paid for by several large private gifts.[8]
2011[edit]
The first year of expansion included replacing the student seating section with new stands, increasing student seating by 400 seats and wrapping around the corners of the stadium creating a horseshoe. Permanent concession stands and restrooms behind student section were also built to accommodate the increase in seating and the fans sitting in the south end. The wooden benches in the east and west grandstands were wrapped in blue acrylic plastic to provide more comfortable seating and a longer lifespan.
2012[edit]
In second year of renovations the field was lowered by eight feet and the outdoor track surface was removed and replaced by the new track and lacrosse stadium that was constructed on the south side of campus. Lowering the field gave the opportunity to add four rows of seating down toward the field in a horseshoe configuration, adding 2,000 seats. Chair-back seats were added in four of the new sections behind the home sideline. A grass slope was built behind the north end zone and in front of the video board for overflow seating and the band section was moved to the southeast corner. The field was then replaced with an artificial turf playing surface.[9]
2016[edit]
The existing video board in the stadium was replaced. The new board is 40 feet tall and 72.5 feet wide, a total display area of 2,900 square ft. making the new board nine times larger than the old one. It is the largest board in Division II and would rank second among all FCS schools, it is the third largest in the state of Michigan and the 40th largest on-campus display board in the country. In addition a 18 x 8 scoreboard was added to the south side of the stadium.[10]
Beyond[edit]
Designed with the future in mind, the stadium can have permanent seating added when needed, with ultimate expansion to 20,000 seats.[4] In the years beyond this expansion the University plans on adding visiting locker rooms under the east grandstand and remove the existing press box and replace it with a larger one to add more seating and sky boxes. These improvements would be paid for by a public fund raising campaign.

Stadium traditions[edit]

"Cannons" – After every touchdown or field goal score by GVSU, "cannons" or fireworks are shot off behind the student section on the south end of the stadium.
"Grass slopes" – Grass slopes have existed in Lubbers Stadium since its initial construction. Through various expansions and renovations, the athletic department has made it a priority to preserve a grass slope in the stadium.[8]
"Rowing" – After every touchdown or field goal score by GVSU, the Laker student section sits down and "rows" like a rowboat the total number of points scored by the team thus far in the game.
"Lubbers Leap" - When the team enters the field from the north ramp prior to kickoff they run across the field and leap into the student section in the south endzone.

History[edit]
"Lakers Stadium" - as it was originally known - hosted its first football game on September 15, 1973 against Kalamazoo College. The Lakers won their first ever home game by defeating the Hornets 27-14.[6] The stadium was officially dedicated and formally named "Arend D. Lubbers Stadium" on September 15, 1979.[7]
Location[edit]
Lubbers Stadium is located in the northwest part of campus along with most all other athletics facilities, just north of the Kelly Family Sports Center and just south of Lake Michigan Drive.

Expansions[edit]
Beginning in the spring of 2011, Lubbers Stadium began undergoing a series of expansions and renovations that will increase capacity, concessions, and restroom facilities. The improvements are being paid for by several large private gifts.[8]
2011[edit]
The first year of expansion included replacing the student seating section with new stands, increasing student seating by 400 seats and wrapping around the corners of the stadium creating a horseshoe. Permanent concession stands and restrooms behind student section were also built to accommodate the increase in seating and the fans sitting in the south end. The wooden benches in the east and west grandstands were wrapped in blue acrylic plastic to provide more comfortable seating and a longer lifespan.
2012[edit]
In second year of renovations the field was lowered by eight feet and the outdoor track surface was removed and replaced by the new track and lacrosse stadium that was constructed on the south side of campus. Lowering the field gave the opportunity to add four rows of seating down toward the field in a horseshoe configuration, adding 2,000 seats. Chair-back seats were added in four of the new sections behind the home sideline. A grass slope was built behind the north end zone and in front of the video board for overflow seating and the band section was moved to the southeast corner. The field was then replaced with an artificial turf playing surface.[9]
2016[edit]
The existing video board in the stadium was replaced. The new board is 40 feet tall and 72.5 feet wide, a total display area of 2,900 square ft. making the new board nine times larger than the old one. It is the largest board in Division II and would rank second among all FCS schools, it is the third largest in the state of Michigan and the 40th largest on-campus display board in the country. In addition a 18 x 8 scoreboard was added to the south side of the stadium.[10]
Beyond[edit]
Designed with the future in mind, the stadium can have permanent seating added when needed, with ultimate expansion to 20,000 seats.[4] In the years beyond this expansion the University plans on adding visiting locker rooms under the east grandstand and remove the existing press box and replace it with a larger one to add more seating and sky boxes. These improvements would be paid for by a public fund raising campaign.

Stadium traditions[edit]

"Cannons" – After every touchdown or field goal score by GVSU, "cannons" or fireworks are shot off behind the student section on the south end of the stadium.
"Grass slopes" – Grass slopes have existed in Lubbers Stadium since its initial construction. Through various expansions and renovations, the athletic department has made it a priority to preserve a grass slope in the stadium.[8]
"Rowing" – After every touchdown or field goal score by GVSU, the Laker student section sits down and "rows" like a rowboat the total number of points scored by the team thus far in the game.
"Lubbers Leap" - When the team enters the field from the north ramp prior to kickoff they run across the field and leap into the student section in the south endzone.

Notes



[1]



Arend Donselaar "Don" Lubbers (born July 23, 1931) was president of Grand Valley State University (and predecessor Grand Valley State College) from 1969 to 2001. He was the second president of Grand Valley, serving after James Zumberge and before Mark Murray. He currently holds the title of President Emeritus. Most of the university's growth came during his tenure.
Early life[edit]
Lubbers graduated from Hope College, where his father Irwin Lubbers was president, and received his master's degree from Rutgers University in 1956.
He taught at Wittenberg University .
He served as president of Central College in Pella, Iowa, until he became Grand Valley's president.
Grand Valley State University[edit]
Lubbers became president of what was then Grand Valley State College at the age of 37, making him one of the nation's youngest university presidents.
The university expanded from a small cluster of colleges to Michigan's fastest growing university.
Lubbers Stadium on the Allendale Campus is named for him.
When he retired in 2001, Lubbers was the longest serving state university leader in the country.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
