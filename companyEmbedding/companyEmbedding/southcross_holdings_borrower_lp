CALL 811 FOR LINE LOCATIONS! 
This federally mandated national “call before you dig” number, 811, was created to help protect companies and individuals from unintentionally hitting underground utility lines while digging.
Southcross advises using the nationwide One-Call phone system at least two to three days before digging. Dial either 811 from anywhere in the United States or one of the state One-Call numbers below. Your call will be routed to the local One-Call center. Tell the operator where you are planning to dig and what type of work you will be doing. The local utilities and companies who operate underground facilities around your project will be notified about your plans to dig. In a few days, a utility or company representative will arrive at your work site and will mark the approximate location of underground lines, pipes and cables.
Please visit www.digsafely.com for more information.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Southcross Holdings emerges from Chapter 11 bankruptcy








April 14, 2016



































Southcross Holdings LP,an owner and operator of gathering and fractionation assets in the midstream energy sector, has consummated its pre-packaged plan of reorganization (POR) and emerged from bankruptcy protection. Holdings commenced voluntary cases under chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas on March 27, 2016. The bankruptcy court confirmed the POR on April 11, 2016.
Among other things, the POR eliminated nearly $700 million of funded debt and preferred equity obligations of holdings, and provided for a new equity investment from certain of its existing equity holders.
Southcross Holdings LP, through its subsidiary Southcross Holdings Borrower LP, owns 100% of Southcross Energy Partners GP LLC, the general partner of Southcross, as well as a portion of Southcross’ common units, and all of Southcross’ subordinated units and Class B convertible units. Holdings also owns natural gas gathering and treating assets as well as NGL pipelines and fractionation facilities in South Texas.
