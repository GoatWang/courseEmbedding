How can I be sure that my application has been received?

The Bank of Hawaii Corporation (BOH) is a regional commercial bank headquartered in Honolulu, Hawaii. It is Hawaii's second oldest bank and its largest locally owned bank in that the majority of the voting stockholders reside within the state. Bank of Hawaii has the most accounts, customers, branches, and ATMs of any financial institution in the state (although BancWest's First Hawaiian Bank holds a greater number of dollars in deposits). The bank consists of four business segments: retail banking, commercial banking, investment services, and treasury.[3] The bank is currently headed by Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Peter S. Ho.[4]

Beginnings[edit]
In 1893, Charles Montague Cooke (1849–1909) with his brother-in-law Joseph Ballard Atherton and business partner Peter Cushman Jones founded Bank of Hawaii. In 1897, it was chartered in the Republic of Hawaii by Interior Minister James A. King.[5] A decade after its founding, in 1903, the bank opened its first branch in Kauai. In 1922, the bank acquired First Bank of Hilo, which had four branches. In 1930, it amalgamated Bank of Maui.
Bank of Maui[edit]
Charles Dexter Lufkin organized First National Bank of Wailuku in 1901.[6] Five years later, he had organized Lahaina National Bank. Then he organized the First National Bank of Paia in 1913.[6] Lastly, in 1917, First National Bank of Paia merged with Lahaina National Bank and First National Bank of Wailuku to form Bank of Maui.[6]
Activities in Hawaii since 1971[edit]
In 1971, BOH formed a bank holding company called Hawaii Bancorporation.[7]
In 1979, Hawaii Bancorporation changed its name to Bancorp Hawaii.[8] In 1985, BOH as Bancorp Hawaii acquired the Hawaiian Trust Company for $19 million.[9][10]
In 1990, BOH as Bancorp Hawaii acquired FirstFed America Inc. with its First Federal Savings and Loan Association in Hawaii and First Savings of Guam subsidiaries for $141 million in cash.[11] First Federal Savings was maintained as a separate entity until 1998 when it was merged into the Bank of Hawaii.[12]
Bancorp Hawaii changed its name to Pacific Century Financial Corporation (PCFC) in 1997.[8][13]
Large drop in the firm's stock in early 2000 caused by bad loans and quick expansion outside of he firm's core business of Hawaii, Guam, and American Samoa[14][15] led to a change in management.[16]
BOH as Pacific Century Financial Corporation sold off its credit card division to American Express for an undisclosed amount in 2001.[17][18][19]
In 2002, Pacific Century Financial Corporation was renamed Bank of Hawaii Corporation.[20]
Activities on the U.S. Mainland[edit]
In its first expansion onto the continental United States, BOH as Bancorp Hawaii acquired the Phoenix, Arizona-based First National Bancorp of Arizona with its five-office First National Bank of Arizona subsidiary for an undisclosed amount in 1987.[21] Ten years later, through its First National Bank of Arizona subsidiary, BOH acquired all four Arizona branch offices from Home Savings of America for an undisclosed amount in 1997 and merged those offices into First National while at nearly the same time changed the name of First National to Pacific Century Bank NA.[22]
The following year, BOH as Pacific Century Financial Corporation acquired the Encino, California-based CU Bancorp with its California United Bank subsidiary for $183 million in stock and cash.[23][24][25] Just shortly after the acquisition was finalized in 1998, California United and its 22 offices in Southern California was merged into phoenix-based Pacific Century Bank and the headquarters for the newly combined Pacific Century Bank was moved to Encino.
After 14 years on the Mainland, BOH decided to abandon their activities on the Mainland in 2001 by selling all 9 Arizona branch offices of the Pacific Century Bank to Zions Bancorporation for an undisclosed amount[26][27] and all 20 California branch offices of the Pacific Century Bank to U.S. Bancorp for an undisclosed amount.[28][29][30] Zion merged their purchase into their National Bank of Arizona subsidiary.[26]
International activities[edit]
It was not until 1959 that BOH made another novel move when it opened its first Pacific Islands branch on Kwajalein. Two years later, it opened a branch in both Palau and Guam. Ten years later, BOH continued its international expansion by absorbing Bank of American Samoa, which the Navy had established in 1914. That same year, it created Banque de Tahiti as a joint venture between itself and Crédit Lyonnais. The next year, BOH established a branch in Yap. Branches in Ponape and Kosrae followed in the subsequent years.
It also continued its expansion outside Hawaii with the establishment of a branch in Saipan. Three years later, BOH and Crédit Lyonnais established another joint-venture, Banque de Nouvelle Calédonie in Nouméa.
In 1980, BOH opened a branch in Tokyo.
BOH acquired Wells Fargo Bank's Seoul, Korea, and Singapore operations in 1991.[31][32] Two years later, it acquired Banque Indosuez's operations in Vanuatu, which became Banque d’Hawaii (Vanuatu). That same year, BOH also opened its first branch in Suva, Fiji in 1993. Branches in Nadi and Lautoka followed. In 1994, BOH acquired Commonwealth Bank of Australia's 51% ownership in the National Bank of Solomon Islands.[33] BOH also acquired Crédit Lyonnais' holdings in Banque de Nouvelle Calédonie, giving BOH 91 percent ownership.[34]
Banque de Nouvelle Calédonie changed its name to Bank of Hawaii—Nouvelle Calédonie.[35] BOH also purchased Banque Indosuez Nuigini in Papua New Guinea from Banque Indosuez for $5.6 million[36] and renamed it Bank of Hawaii (PNG) Ltd. In addition to its main office in Port Moresby, Bank of Hawaii (PNG) also had an office in Lae, PNG's second port city on the Northeast Coast. Indosuez Nuigini was established in 1983 with 49 percent Indosuez participation, 41.5 percent Bank of Papua New Guinea, and the remainder public.
International acquisitions[edit]
In 1998, BOH bought 5.4mn convertible notes of Bank of Queensland for $22 million as part of a strategic alliance giving rise to a true reflecting of the convertible note value into 49% ownership at that time.[37][38] It also acquired 100 percent of Banque Paribas Pacifique (est. 1972; 3 branches) and 70 percent of Banque Paribas Polynésie (est. 1984; 1 branch).[39] BOH integrated the operations with Bank of Hawaii-Nouvelle Calédonie and Banque de Tahiti, respectively. In 1999, BOH bought 5.8mn shares (approx. 10 percent) in Bank of Queensland.[40]
Withdraw from international financial services markets[edit]
In 2001, BOH sold its 6.2mn shares and 5.4mn convertible notes in Bank of Queensland for $20 million and $16 million respectively.[41] The decision reflected PCFC's new strategic plan, which mandated a focus on the bank's core markets in Hawaii, American Samoa, and Guam. BOH sold its shareholding in the Bank of Tonga and Pacific Commercial Bank of Samoa to Westpac. BOH and Westpac both had 30 percent interests in Bank of Tonga and 42 percent interests in Pacific Commercial Bank.[42][43] BOH sold its operations in Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, and Fiji to ANZ for AU$100 million.[44] BOH sold its approximately 95 percent share interest in its French Polynesia and New Caledonia operations to France-based Caisse Nationale des Caisses d'Epargne (CNCE). Its operations in French Polynesia included 17 branches of its subsidiary, Banque de Tahiti, and about 265 employees. Its operations in New Caledonia included eight branches of subsidiary Bank of Hawaii-Nouvelle Caledonie and about 190 employees.[45][46] Lastly, BOH closed its offices in Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore, and Taipei.
In 2002, BOH was unable to find a buyer for its bank properties in the Central Pacific when it was trying to withdraw from those markets. As a result, BOH closed its Majuro branch in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) and its three branches in Pohnpei, Yap, and Kosrae in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM).[47] BOH turned over its 51 percent interest in National Bank of Solomon Islands to the government of the Solomon Islands.
Governance[edit]
Poor performance by the bank in early 2000, contributed to chairman and CEO Lawrence M. Johnson's resignation in 2000[16] and bank president Richard Dahl being passed over as Johnson's replacement. Dahl left the company in 2002.[48]
In November 2000, Michael E. O'Neill was hired from outside the company to serve as chairman and CEO to correct mistakes made by the previous management.[49] O'Neill did not take a salary or any bonuses during his three years at the helm, but in 2004 he controlled about 2.73 million — about 5 percent — of the bank's total shares directly or under option.[50] O'Neill reversed the company's decline by selling off properties outside the company's core business area of Hawaii, Guam, and American Samoa. O'Neill stepped down as chairman and CEO in 2004.[51]
In December 2003, Allan R. Landon was promoted from chief financial officer to president[52][53] and later to chairman and CEO upon O'Neill leaving in September 2004.[54] Under Landon’s leadership, the Bank of Hawaii "survived the financial crisis without federal assistance and prospered in its aftermath".
In 2008, Landon handed his position of president to Peter S. Ho while Landon retained his chairman and CEO posts.[55] Two years later Ho was given the additional titles of chairman and chief executive officer in addition to president upon the retirement of Allan R. Landon in 2010.[56]

Beginnings[edit]
In 1893, Charles Montague Cooke (1849–1909) with his brother-in-law Joseph Ballard Atherton and business partner Peter Cushman Jones founded Bank of Hawaii. In 1897, it was chartered in the Republic of Hawaii by Interior Minister James A. King.[5] A decade after its founding, in 1903, the bank opened its first branch in Kauai. In 1922, the bank acquired First Bank of Hilo, which had four branches. In 1930, it amalgamated Bank of Maui.
Bank of Maui[edit]
Charles Dexter Lufkin organized First National Bank of Wailuku in 1901.[6] Five years later, he had organized Lahaina National Bank. Then he organized the First National Bank of Paia in 1913.[6] Lastly, in 1917, First National Bank of Paia merged with Lahaina National Bank and First National Bank of Wailuku to form Bank of Maui.[6]
Activities in Hawaii since 1971[edit]
In 1971, BOH formed a bank holding company called Hawaii Bancorporation.[7]
In 1979, Hawaii Bancorporation changed its name to Bancorp Hawaii.[8] In 1985, BOH as Bancorp Hawaii acquired the Hawaiian Trust Company for $19 million.[9][10]
In 1990, BOH as Bancorp Hawaii acquired FirstFed America Inc. with its First Federal Savings and Loan Association in Hawaii and First Savings of Guam subsidiaries for $141 million in cash.[11] First Federal Savings was maintained as a separate entity until 1998 when it was merged into the Bank of Hawaii.[12]
Bancorp Hawaii changed its name to Pacific Century Financial Corporation (PCFC) in 1997.[8][13]
Large drop in the firm's stock in early 2000 caused by bad loans and quick expansion outside of he firm's core business of Hawaii, Guam, and American Samoa[14][15] led to a change in management.[16]
BOH as Pacific Century Financial Corporation sold off its credit card division to American Express for an undisclosed amount in 2001.[17][18][19]
In 2002, Pacific Century Financial Corporation was renamed Bank of Hawaii Corporation.[20]
Activities on the U.S. Mainland[edit]
In its first expansion onto the continental United States, BOH as Bancorp Hawaii acquired the Phoenix, Arizona-based First National Bancorp of Arizona with its five-office First National Bank of Arizona subsidiary for an undisclosed amount in 1987.[21] Ten years later, through its First National Bank of Arizona subsidiary, BOH acquired all four Arizona branch offices from Home Savings of America for an undisclosed amount in 1997 and merged those offices into First National while at nearly the same time changed the name of First National to Pacific Century Bank NA.[22]
The following year, BOH as Pacific Century Financial Corporation acquired the Encino, California-based CU Bancorp with its California United Bank subsidiary for $183 million in stock and cash.[23][24][25] Just shortly after the acquisition was finalized in 1998, California United and its 22 offices in Southern California was merged into phoenix-based Pacific Century Bank and the headquarters for the newly combined Pacific Century Bank was moved to Encino.
After 14 years on the Mainland, BOH decided to abandon their activities on the Mainland in 2001 by selling all 9 Arizona branch offices of the Pacific Century Bank to Zions Bancorporation for an undisclosed amount[26][27] and all 20 California branch offices of the Pacific Century Bank to U.S. Bancorp for an undisclosed amount.[28][29][30] Zion merged their purchase into their National Bank of Arizona subsidiary.[26]
International activities[edit]
It was not until 1959 that BOH made another novel move when it opened its first Pacific Islands branch on Kwajalein. Two years later, it opened a branch in both Palau and Guam. Ten years later, BOH continued its international expansion by absorbing Bank of American Samoa, which the Navy had established in 1914. That same year, it created Banque de Tahiti as a joint venture between itself and Crédit Lyonnais. The next year, BOH established a branch in Yap. Branches in Ponape and Kosrae followed in the subsequent years.
It also continued its expansion outside Hawaii with the establishment of a branch in Saipan. Three years later, BOH and Crédit Lyonnais established another joint-venture, Banque de Nouvelle Calédonie in Nouméa.
In 1980, BOH opened a branch in Tokyo.
BOH acquired Wells Fargo Bank's Seoul, Korea, and Singapore operations in 1991.[31][32] Two years later, it acquired Banque Indosuez's operations in Vanuatu, which became Banque d’Hawaii (Vanuatu). That same year, BOH also opened its first branch in Suva, Fiji in 1993. Branches in Nadi and Lautoka followed. In 1994, BOH acquired Commonwealth Bank of Australia's 51% ownership in the National Bank of Solomon Islands.[33] BOH also acquired Crédit Lyonnais' holdings in Banque de Nouvelle Calédonie, giving BOH 91 percent ownership.[34]
Banque de Nouvelle Calédonie changed its name to Bank of Hawaii—Nouvelle Calédonie.[35] BOH also purchased Banque Indosuez Nuigini in Papua New Guinea from Banque Indosuez for $5.6 million[36] and renamed it Bank of Hawaii (PNG) Ltd. In addition to its main office in Port Moresby, Bank of Hawaii (PNG) also had an office in Lae, PNG's second port city on the Northeast Coast. Indosuez Nuigini was established in 1983 with 49 percent Indosuez participation, 41.5 percent Bank of Papua New Guinea, and the remainder public.
International acquisitions[edit]
In 1998, BOH bought 5.4mn convertible notes of Bank of Queensland for $22 million as part of a strategic alliance giving rise to a true reflecting of the convertible note value into 49% ownership at that time.[37][38] It also acquired 100 percent of Banque Paribas Pacifique (est. 1972; 3 branches) and 70 percent of Banque Paribas Polynésie (est. 1984; 1 branch).[39] BOH integrated the operations with Bank of Hawaii-Nouvelle Calédonie and Banque de Tahiti, respectively. In 1999, BOH bought 5.8mn shares (approx. 10 percent) in Bank of Queensland.[40]
Withdraw from international financial services markets[edit]
In 2001, BOH sold its 6.2mn shares and 5.4mn convertible notes in Bank of Queensland for $20 million and $16 million respectively.[41] The decision reflected PCFC's new strategic plan, which mandated a focus on the bank's core markets in Hawaii, American Samoa, and Guam. BOH sold its shareholding in the Bank of Tonga and Pacific Commercial Bank of Samoa to Westpac. BOH and Westpac both had 30 percent interests in Bank of Tonga and 42 percent interests in Pacific Commercial Bank.[42][43] BOH sold its operations in Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, and Fiji to ANZ for AU$100 million.[44] BOH sold its approximately 95 percent share interest in its French Polynesia and New Caledonia operations to France-based Caisse Nationale des Caisses d'Epargne (CNCE). Its operations in French Polynesia included 17 branches of its subsidiary, Banque de Tahiti, and about 265 employees. Its operations in New Caledonia included eight branches of subsidiary Bank of Hawaii-Nouvelle Caledonie and about 190 employees.[45][46] Lastly, BOH closed its offices in Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore, and Taipei.
In 2002, BOH was unable to find a buyer for its bank properties in the Central Pacific when it was trying to withdraw from those markets. As a result, BOH closed its Majuro branch in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) and its three branches in Pohnpei, Yap, and Kosrae in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM).[47] BOH turned over its 51 percent interest in National Bank of Solomon Islands to the government of the Solomon Islands.
Governance[edit]
Poor performance by the bank in early 2000, contributed to chairman and CEO Lawrence M. Johnson's resignation in 2000[16] and bank president Richard Dahl being passed over as Johnson's replacement. Dahl left the company in 2002.[48]
In November 2000, Michael E. O'Neill was hired from outside the company to serve as chairman and CEO to correct mistakes made by the previous management.[49] O'Neill did not take a salary or any bonuses during his three years at the helm, but in 2004 he controlled about 2.73 million — about 5 percent — of the bank's total shares directly or under option.[50] O'Neill reversed the company's decline by selling off properties outside the company's core business area of Hawaii, Guam, and American Samoa. O'Neill stepped down as chairman and CEO in 2004.[51]
In December 2003, Allan R. Landon was promoted from chief financial officer to president[52][53] and later to chairman and CEO upon O'Neill leaving in September 2004.[54] Under Landon’s leadership, the Bank of Hawaii "survived the financial crisis without federal assistance and prospered in its aftermath".
In 2008, Landon handed his position of president to Peter S. Ho while Landon retained his chairman and CEO posts.[55] Two years later Ho was given the additional titles of chairman and chief executive officer in addition to president upon the retirement of Allan R. Landon in 2010.[56]

In 1999, BOH bought 5.8mn shares (approx. 10 percent) in Bank of Queensland.[40]
Withdraw from international financial services markets[edit]
In 2001, BOH sold its 6.2mn shares and 5.4mn convertible notes in Bank of Queensland for $20 million and $16 million respectively.[41] The decision reflected PCFC's new strategic plan, which mandated a focus on the bank's core markets in Hawaii, American Samoa, and Guam. BOH sold its shareholding in the Bank of Tonga and Pacific Commercial Bank of Samoa to Westpac. BOH and Westpac both had 30 percent interests in Bank of Tonga and 42 percent interests in Pacific Commercial Bank.[42][43] BOH sold its operations in Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, and Fiji to ANZ for AU$100 million.[44] BOH sold its approximately 95 percent share interest in its French Polynesia and New Caledonia operations to France-based Caisse Nationale des Caisses d'Epargne (CNCE). Its operations in French Polynesia included 17 branches of its subsidiary, Banque de Tahiti, and about 265 employees. Its operations in New Caledonia included eight branches of subsidiary Bank of Hawaii-Nouvelle Caledonie and about 190 employees.[45][46] Lastly, BOH closed its offices in Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore, and Taipei.
In 2002, BOH was unable to find a buyer for its bank properties in the Central Pacific when it was trying to withdraw from those markets. As a result, BOH closed its Majuro branch in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) and its three branches in Pohnpei, Yap, and Kosrae in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM).[47] BOH turned over its 51 percent interest in National Bank of Solomon Islands to the government of the Solomon Islands.
Governance[edit]
Poor performance by the bank in early 2000, contributed to chairman and CEO Lawrence M. Johnson's resignation in 2000[16] and bank president Richard Dahl being passed over as Johnson's replacement. Dahl left the company in 2002.[48]
In November 2000, Michael E. O'Neill was hired from outside the company to serve as chairman and CEO to correct mistakes made by the previous management.[49] O'Neill did not take a salary or any bonuses during his three years at the helm, but in 2004 he controlled about 2.73 million — about 5 percent — of the bank's total shares directly or under option.[50] O'Neill reversed the company's decline by selling off properties outside the company's core business area of Hawaii, Guam, and American Samoa. O'Neill stepped down as chairman and CEO in 2004.[51]
In December 2003, Allan R. Landon was promoted from chief financial officer to president[52][53] and later to chairman and CEO upon O'Neill leaving in September 2004.[54] Under Landon’s leadership, the Bank of Hawaii "survived the financial crisis without federal assistance and prospered in its aftermath".
In 2008, Landon handed his position of president to Peter S. Ho while Landon retained his chairman and CEO posts.[55] Two years later Ho was given the additional titles of chairman and chief executive officer in addition to president upon the retirement of Allan R. Landon in 2010.[56]

Beginnings[edit]
In 1893, Charles Montague Cooke (1849–1909) with his brother-in-law Joseph Ballard Atherton and business partner Peter Cushman Jones founded Bank of Hawaii. In 1897, it was chartered in the Republic of Hawaii by Interior Minister James A. King.[5] A decade after its founding, in 1903, the bank opened its first branch in Kauai. In 1922, the bank acquired First Bank of Hilo, which had four branches. In 1930, it amalgamated Bank of Maui.
Bank of Maui[edit]
Charles Dexter Lufkin organized First National Bank of Wailuku in 1901.[6] Five years later, he had organized Lahaina National Bank. Then he organized the First National Bank of Paia in 1913.[6] Lastly, in 1917, First National Bank of Paia merged with Lahaina National Bank and First National Bank of Wailuku to form Bank of Maui.[6]
Activities in Hawaii since 1971[edit]
In 1971, BOH formed a bank holding company called Hawaii Bancorporation.[7]
In 1979, Hawaii Bancorporation changed its name to Bancorp Hawaii.[8] In 1985, BOH as Bancorp Hawaii acquired the Hawaiian Trust Company for $19 million.[9][10]
In 1990, BOH as Bancorp Hawaii acquired FirstFed America Inc. with its First Federal Savings and Loan Association in Hawaii and First Savings of Guam subsidiaries for $141 million in cash.[11] First Federal Savings was maintained as a separate entity until 1998 when it was merged into the Bank of Hawaii.[12]
Bancorp Hawaii changed its name to Pacific Century Financial Corporation (PCFC) in 1997.[8][13]
Large drop in the firm's stock in early 2000 caused by bad loans and quick expansion outside of he firm's core business of Hawaii, Guam, and American Samoa[14][15] led to a change in management.[16]
BOH as Pacific Century Financial Corporation sold off its credit card division to American Express for an undisclosed amount in 2001.[17][18][19]
In 2002, Pacific Century Financial Corporation was renamed Bank of Hawaii Corporation.[20]
Activities on the U.S. Mainland[edit]
In its first expansion onto the continental United States, BOH as Bancorp Hawaii acquired the Phoenix, Arizona-based First National Bancorp of Arizona with its five-office First National Bank of Arizona subsidiary for an undisclosed amount in 1987.[21] Ten years later, through its First National Bank of Arizona subsidiary, BOH acquired all four Arizona branch offices from Home Savings of America for an undisclosed amount in 1997 and merged those offices into First National while at nearly the same time changed the name of First National to Pacific Century Bank NA.[22]
The following year, BOH as Pacific Century Financial Corporation acquired the Encino, California-based CU Bancorp with its California United Bank subsidiary for $183 million in stock and cash.[23][24][25] Just shortly after the acquisition was finalized in 1998, California United and its 22 offices in Southern California was merged into phoenix-based Pacific Century Bank and the headquarters for the newly combined Pacific Century Bank was moved to Encino.
After 14 years on the Mainland, BOH decided to abandon their activities on the Mainland in 2001 by selling all 9 Arizona branch offices of the Pacific Century Bank to Zions Bancorporation for an undisclosed amount[26][27] and all 20 California branch offices of the Pacific Century Bank to U.S. Bancorp for an undisclosed amount.[28][29][30] Zion merged their purchase into their National Bank of Arizona subsidiary.[26]
International activities[edit]
It was not until 1959 that BOH made another novel move when it opened its first Pacific Islands branch on Kwajalein. Two years later, it opened a branch in both Palau and Guam. Ten years later, BOH continued its international expansion by absorbing Bank of American Samoa, which the Navy had established in 1914. That same year, it created Banque de Tahiti as a joint venture between itself and Crédit Lyonnais. The next year, BOH established a branch in Yap. Branches in Ponape and Kosrae followed in the subsequent years.
It also continued its expansion outside Hawaii with the establishment of a branch in Saipan. Three years later, BOH and Crédit Lyonnais established another joint-venture, Banque de Nouvelle Calédonie in Nouméa.
In 1980, BOH opened a branch in Tokyo.
BOH acquired Wells Fargo Bank's Seoul, Korea, and Singapore operations in 1991.[31][32] Two years later, it acquired Banque Indosuez's operations in Vanuatu, which became Banque d’Hawaii (Vanuatu). That same year, BOH also opened its first branch in Suva, Fiji in 1993. Branches in Nadi and Lautoka followed. In 1994, BOH acquired Commonwealth Bank of Australia's 51% ownership in the National Bank of Solomon Islands.[33] BOH also acquired Crédit Lyonnais' holdings in Banque de Nouvelle Calédonie, giving BOH 91 percent ownership.[34]
Banque de Nouvelle Calédonie changed its name to Bank of Hawaii—Nouvelle Calédonie.[35] BOH also purchased Banque Indosuez Nuigini in Papua New Guinea from Banque Indosuez for $5.6 million[36] and renamed it Bank of Hawaii (PNG) Ltd. In addition to its main office in Port Moresby, Bank of Hawaii (PNG) also had an office in Lae, PNG's second port city on the Northeast Coast. Indosuez Nuigini was established in 1983 with 49 percent Indosuez participation, 41.5 percent Bank of Papua New Guinea, and the remainder public.
International acquisitions[edit]
In 1998, BOH bought 5.4mn convertible notes of Bank of Queensland for $22 million as part of a strategic alliance giving rise to a true reflecting of the convertible note value into 49% ownership at that time.[37][38] It also acquired 100 percent of Banque Paribas Pacifique (est. 1972; 3 branches) and 70 percent of Banque Paribas Polynésie (est. 1984; 1 branch).[39] BOH integrated the operations with Bank of Hawaii-Nouvelle Calédonie and Banque de Tahiti, respectively. In 1999, BOH bought 5.8mn shares (approx. 10 percent) in Bank of Queensland.[40]
Withdraw from international financial services markets[edit]
In 2001, BOH sold its 6.2mn shares and 5.4mn convertible notes in Bank of Queensland for $20 million and $16 million respectively.[41] The decision reflected PCFC's new strategic plan, which mandated a focus on the bank's core markets in Hawaii, American Samoa, and Guam. BOH sold its shareholding in the Bank of Tonga and Pacific Commercial Bank of Samoa to Westpac. BOH and Westpac both had 30 percent interests in Bank of Tonga and 42 percent interests in Pacific Commercial Bank.[42][43] BOH sold its operations in Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, and Fiji to ANZ for AU$100 million.[44] BOH sold its approximately 95 percent share interest in its French Polynesia and New Caledonia operations to France-based Caisse Nationale des Caisses d'Epargne (CNCE). Its operations in French Polynesia included 17 branches of its subsidiary, Banque de Tahiti, and about 265 employees. Its operations in New Caledonia included eight branches of subsidiary Bank of Hawaii-Nouvelle Caledonie and about 190 employees.[45][46] Lastly, BOH closed its offices in Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore, and Taipei.
In 2002, BOH was unable to find a buyer for its bank properties in the Central Pacific when it was trying to withdraw from those markets. As a result, BOH closed its Majuro branch in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) and its three branches in Pohnpei, Yap, and Kosrae in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM).[47] BOH turned over its 51 percent interest in National Bank of Solomon Islands to the government of the Solomon Islands.
Governance[edit]
Poor performance by the bank in early 2000, contributed to chairman and CEO Lawrence M. Johnson's resignation in 2000[16] and bank president Richard Dahl being passed over as Johnson's replacement. Dahl left the company in 2002.[48]
In November 2000, Michael E. O'Neill was hired from outside the company to serve as chairman and CEO to correct mistakes made by the previous management.[49] O'Neill did not take a salary or any bonuses during his three years at the helm, but in 2004 he controlled about 2.73 million — about 5 percent — of the bank's total shares directly or under option.[50] O'Neill reversed the company's decline by selling off properties outside the company's core business area of Hawaii, Guam, and American Samoa. O'Neill stepped down as chairman and CEO in 2004.[51]
In December 2003, Allan R. Landon was promoted from chief financial officer to president[52][53] and later to chairman and CEO upon O'Neill leaving in September 2004.[54] Under Landon’s leadership, the Bank of Hawaii "survived the financial crisis without federal assistance and prospered in its aftermath".
In 2008, Landon handed his position of president to Peter S. Ho while Landon retained his chairman and CEO posts.[55] Two years later Ho was given the additional titles of chairman and chief executive officer in addition to president upon the retirement of Allan R. Landon in 2010.[56]

The Bank of Hawaii Corporation (BOH) is a regional commercial bank headquartered in Honolulu, Hawaii. It is Hawaii's second oldest bank and its largest locally owned bank in that the majority of the voting stockholders reside within the state. Bank of Hawaii has the most accounts, customers, branches, and ATMs of any financial institution in the state (although BancWest's First Hawaiian Bank holds a greater number of dollars in deposits). The bank consists of four business segments: retail banking, commercial banking, investment services, and treasury.[3] The bank is currently headed by Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Peter S. Ho.[4]

Beginnings[edit]
In 1893, Charles Montague Cooke (1849–1909) with his brother-in-law Joseph Ballard Atherton and business partner Peter Cushman Jones founded Bank of Hawaii. In 1897, it was chartered in the Republic of Hawaii by Interior Minister James A. King.[5] A decade after its founding, in 1903, the bank opened its first branch in Kauai. In 1922, the bank acquired First Bank of Hilo, which had four branches. In 1930, it amalgamated Bank of Maui.
Bank of Maui[edit]
Charles Dexter Lufkin organized First National Bank of Wailuku in 1901.[6] Five years later, he had organized Lahaina National Bank. Then he organized the First National Bank of Paia in 1913.[6] Lastly, in 1917, First National Bank of Paia merged with Lahaina National Bank and First National Bank of Wailuku to form Bank of Maui.[6]
Activities in Hawaii since 1971[edit]
In 1971, BOH formed a bank holding company called Hawaii Bancorporation.[7]
In 1979, Hawaii Bancorporation changed its name to Bancorp Hawaii.[8] In 1985, BOH as Bancorp Hawaii acquired the Hawaiian Trust Company for $19 million.[9][10]
In 1990, BOH as Bancorp Hawaii acquired FirstFed America Inc. with its First Federal Savings and Loan Association in Hawaii and First Savings of Guam subsidiaries for $141 million in cash.[11] First Federal Savings was maintained as a separate entity until 1998 when it was merged into the Bank of Hawaii.[12]
Bancorp Hawaii changed its name to Pacific Century Financial Corporation (PCFC) in 1997.[8][13]
Large drop in the firm's stock in early 2000 caused by bad loans and quick expansion outside of he firm's core business of Hawaii, Guam, and American Samoa[14][15] led to a change in management.[16]
BOH as Pacific Century Financial Corporation sold off its credit card division to American Express for an undisclosed amount in 2001.[17][18][19]
In 2002, Pacific Century Financial Corporation was renamed Bank of Hawaii Corporation.[20]
Activities on the U.S. Mainland[edit]
In its first expansion onto the continental United States, BOH as Bancorp Hawaii acquired the Phoenix, Arizona-based First National Bancorp of Arizona with its five-office First National Bank of Arizona subsidiary for an undisclosed amount in 1987.[21] Ten years later, through its First National Bank of Arizona subsidiary, BOH acquired all four Arizona branch offices from Home Savings of America for an undisclosed amount in 1997 and merged those offices into First National while at nearly the same time changed the name of First National to Pacific Century Bank NA.[22]
The following year, BOH as Pacific Century Financial Corporation acquired the Encino, California-based CU Bancorp with its California United Bank subsidiary for $183 million in stock and cash.[23][24][25] Just shortly after the acquisition was finalized in 1998, California United and its 22 offices in Southern California was merged into phoenix-based Pacific Century Bank and the headquarters for the newly combined Pacific Century Bank was moved to Encino.
After 14 years on the Mainland, BOH decided to abandon their activities on the Mainland in 2001 by selling all 9 Arizona branch offices of the Pacific Century Bank to Zions Bancorporation for an undisclosed amount[26][27] and all 20 California branch offices of the Pacific Century Bank to U.S. Bancorp for an undisclosed amount.[28][29][30] Zion merged their purchase into their National Bank of Arizona subsidiary.[26]
International activities[edit]
It was not until 1959 that BOH made another novel move when it opened its first Pacific Islands branch on Kwajalein. Two years later, it opened a branch in both Palau and Guam. Ten years later, BOH continued its international expansion by absorbing Bank of American Samoa, which the Navy had established in 1914. That same year, it created Banque de Tahiti as a joint venture between itself and Crédit Lyonnais. The next year, BOH established a branch in Yap. Branches in Ponape and Kosrae followed in the subsequent years.
It also continued its expansion outside Hawaii with the establishment of a branch in Saipan. Three years later, BOH and Crédit Lyonnais established another joint-venture, Banque de Nouvelle Calédonie in Nouméa.
In 1980, BOH opened a branch in Tokyo.
BOH acquired Wells Fargo Bank's Seoul, Korea, and Singapore operations in 1991.[31][32] Two years later, it acquired Banque Indosuez's operations in Vanuatu, which became Banque d’Hawaii (Vanuatu). That same year, BOH also opened its first branch in Suva, Fiji in 1993. Branches in Nadi and Lautoka followed. In 1994, BOH acquired Commonwealth Bank of Australia's 51% ownership in the National Bank of Solomon Islands.[33] BOH also acquired Crédit Lyonnais' holdings in Banque de Nouvelle Calédonie, giving BOH 91 percent ownership.[34]
Banque de Nouvelle Calédonie changed its name to Bank of Hawaii—Nouvelle Calédonie.[35] BOH also purchased Banque Indosuez Nuigini in Papua New Guinea from Banque Indosuez for $5.6 million[36] and renamed it Bank of Hawaii (PNG) Ltd. In addition to its main office in Port Moresby, Bank of Hawaii (PNG) also had an office in Lae, PNG's second port city on the Northeast Coast. Indosuez Nuigini was established in 1983 with 49 percent Indosuez participation, 41.5 percent Bank of Papua New Guinea, and the remainder public.
International acquisitions[edit]
In 1998, BOH bought 5.4mn convertible notes of Bank of Queensland for $22 million as part of a strategic alliance giving rise to a true reflecting of the convertible note value into 49% ownership at that time.[37][38] It also acquired 100 percent of Banque Paribas Pacifique (est. 1972; 3 branches) and 70 percent of Banque Paribas Polynésie (est. 1984; 1 branch).[39] BOH integrated the operations with Bank of Hawaii-Nouvelle Calédonie and Banque de Tahiti, respectively. In 1999, BOH bought 5.8mn shares (approx. 10 percent) in Bank of Queensland.[40]
Withdraw from international financial services markets[edit]
In 2001, BOH sold its 6.2mn shares and 5.4mn convertible notes in Bank of Queensland for $20 million and $16 million respectively.[41] The decision reflected PCFC's new strategic plan, which mandated a focus on the bank's core markets in Hawaii, American Samoa, and Guam. BOH sold its shareholding in the Bank of Tonga and Pacific Commercial Bank of Samoa to Westpac. BOH and Westpac both had 30 percent interests in Bank of Tonga and 42 percent interests in Pacific Commercial Bank.[42][43] BOH sold its operations in Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, and Fiji to ANZ for AU$100 million.[44] BOH sold its approximately 95 percent share interest in its French Polynesia and New Caledonia operations to France-based Caisse Nationale des Caisses d'Epargne (CNCE). Its operations in French Polynesia included 17 branches of its subsidiary, Banque de Tahiti, and about 265 employees. Its operations in New Caledonia included eight branches of subsidiary Bank of Hawaii-Nouvelle Caledonie and about 190 employees.[45][46] Lastly, BOH closed its offices in Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore, and Taipei.
In 2002, BOH was unable to find a buyer for its bank properties in the Central Pacific when it was trying to withdraw from those markets. As a result, BOH closed its Majuro branch in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) and its three branches in Pohnpei, Yap, and Kosrae in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM).[47] BOH turned over its 51 percent interest in National Bank of Solomon Islands to the government of the Solomon Islands.
Governance[edit]
Poor performance by the bank in early 2000, contributed to chairman and CEO Lawrence M. Johnson's resignation in 2000[16] and bank president Richard Dahl being passed over as Johnson's replacement. Dahl left the company in 2002.[48]
In November 2000, Michael E. O'Neill was hired from outside the company to serve as chairman and CEO to correct mistakes made by the previous management.[49] O'Neill did not take a salary or any bonuses during his three years at the helm, but in 2004 he controlled about 2.73 million — about 5 percent — of the bank's total shares directly or under option.[50] O'Neill reversed the company's decline by selling off properties outside the company's core business area of Hawaii, Guam, and American Samoa. O'Neill stepped down as chairman and CEO in 2004.[51]
In December 2003, Allan R. Landon was promoted from chief financial officer to president[52][53] and later to chairman and CEO upon O'Neill leaving in September 2004.[54] Under Landon’s leadership, the Bank of Hawaii "survived the financial crisis without federal assistance and prospered in its aftermath".
In 2008, Landon handed his position of president to Peter S. Ho while Landon retained his chairman and CEO posts.[55] Two years later Ho was given the additional titles of chairman and chief executive officer in addition to president upon the retirement of Allan R. Landon in 2010.[56]

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Forward-Looking Statements  This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and may include statements concerning, among other things, the anticipated economic and business environment in our service area and elsewhere, credit quality and other financial and business matters in future periods, our future results of operations and financial position, our business strategy and plans and our objectives and future operations. We also may make forward-looking statements in our other documents filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). In addition, our senior management may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others. Our forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions, any of which could prove to be inaccurate, and actual results may differ materially from those projected because of a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to: 1) general economic conditions either nationally, internationally, or locally may be different than expected, and particularly, any event that negatively impacts the tourism industry in Hawaii; 2) unanticipated changes in the securities markets, public debt markets, and other capital markets in the U.S. and internationally; 3) competitive pressures in the markets for financial services and products; 4) the impact of legislative and regulatory initiatives, particularly the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") and the new administration's review of potential changes to such initiatives; 5) changes in fiscal and monetary policies of the markets in which we operate; 6) the increased cost of maintaining or the Company's ability to maintain adequate liquidity and capital, based on the requirements adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and U.S. regulators; 7) actual or alleged conduct which could harm our reputation; 8) changes in accounting standards; 9) changes in tax laws or regulations or the interpretation of such laws and regulations; 10) changes in our credit quality or risk profile that may increase or decrease the required level of our reserve for credit losses; 11) changes in market interest rates that may affect credit markets and our ability to maintain our net interest margin; 12) the impact of litigation and regulatory investigations of the Company, including costs, expenses, settlements, and judgments; 13) any failure in or breach of our operational systems, information systems or infrastructure, or those of our merchants, third party vendors and other service providers; 14) any interruption or breach of security of our information systems resulting in failures or disruptions in customer account management, general ledger processing, and loan or deposit systems; 15) changes to the amount and timing of proposed common stock repurchases; and 16) natural disasters, public unrest or adverse weather, public health, and other conditions impacting us and our customers' operations. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement as a prediction of our actual results. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included under the section entitled "Risk Factors" in Part II of this report and Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and subsequent periodic and current reports filed with the SEC. Words such as "believes," "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "targeted," and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect later events or circumstances, except as may be required by law.  Table of Contents  Overview  Bank of Hawaii Corporation (the "Parent") is a Delaware corporation and a bank holding company headquartered in Honolulu, Hawaii. The Parent's principal operating subsidiary is Bank of Hawaii (the "Bank").  The Bank, directly and through its subsidiaries, provides a broad range of financial services and products to businesses, consumers, and governments in Hawaii, Guam, and other Pacific Islands. References to "we," "our," "us," or the "Company" refer to the Parent and its subsidiaries that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes.  Our business strategy is to use our unique market knowledge, prudent management discipline and brand strength to deliver exceptional value to our stakeholders. Hawaii Economy  General economic conditions in Hawaii remained positive during the second quarter of 2017 due to a continuation of the strong tourism market, active construction industry, low unemployment, and robust real estate market. For the first five months of 2017, total visitor arrivals increased 4.2% while total visitor spending increased 9.8% compared to the same period in 2016. The statewide seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 2.7% in June 2017 compared to 4.4% nationally. For the first six months of 2017, the volume of single-family home sales on Oahu increased 4.4%, while the volume of condominium sales on Oahu increased 6.0% compared with the same period in 2016. The median price of single-family home sales and condominium sales on Oahu increased 3.2% and 3.6%, respectively, for the first six months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. As of June 30, 2017, months of inventory of single-family homes and condominiums on Oahu remained low at 2.7 months and 2.8 months, respectively.  Earnings Summary  Net income for the second quarter of 2017 was $44.7 million, an increase of $0.4 million or 1% compared to the same period in 2016. Diluted earnings per share was $1.05 for the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $0.02 or 2% compared to the same period in 2016.  Our higher earnings for the second quarter of 2017 were primarily due to the following:   Net interest income for the second quarter of 2017 was $112.3 million, an increase of $8.7 million or 8% compared to the same period in 2016. This increase was primarily due to a higher level of earning assets, including growth in both our commercial and consumer lending portfolios, combined with a higher net interest margin. The higher level of earning assets was primarily funded by higher deposit balances. Our net interest margin was 2.92% in the second quarter of 2017, an increase of 7 basis points compared to the same period in 2016. The higher margin in 2017 was primarily due to our loans, which generally have higher yields than our investment securities, comprising a larger percentage of our earning assets compared to 2016.  This increase was partially offset by the following:   Provision for credit losses for the second quarter of 2017 was $4.3 million, an increase of $3.3 million compared to the same period in 2016. The level of the provision recorded is reflective of our evaluation of the adequacy of the Allowance.   Provision for income taxes for the second quarter of 2017 was $20.4 million, an increase of $1.7 million or 9% compared to the same period in 2016. The second quarter of 2016 was favorably impacted by a $1.3 million credit to the provision for income taxes resulting from the release of state tax reserves due to the lapse in the statute of limitations related to prior tax years.   Net occupancy expense for the second quarter of 2017 was $8.1 million, an increase of $1.0 million or 14% compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to a $1.3 million gain on sale of real estate property in Maui during the second quarter of 2016.   Trust and asset management income for the second quarter of 2017 was $11.8 million, a decrease of $0.9 million or 7% compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to a $1.2 million service fee resulting from the sale of real estate property in the second quarter of 2016.   Net equipment expense for the second quarter of 2017 was $5.7 million, an increase of $0.6 million or 13% compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to an increase in software license fees and maintenance.  Table of Contents  Net income for the first six months of 2017 was $95.8 million, an increase of $1.4 million or 1% compared to the same period in 2016. Diluted earnings per share was $2.24 for the first six months of 2017, an increase of $0.05 or 2% compared to the same period in 2016.  Our higher earnings for the first six months of 2017 were primarily due to the following:   Net interest income for the first six months of 2017 was $222.2 million, an increase of $15.6 million or 8% compared to the same period in 2016. This increase was primarily due to a higher level of earning assets, including growth in both our commercial and consumer lending portfolios, combined with a higher net interest margin. The higher level of earning assets was primarily funded by higher deposit balances. Our net interest margin was 2.90% for the first six months of 2017, an increase of 4 basis points compared to the same period in 2016. The higher margin in 2017 was primarily due to our loans, which generally have higher yields than our investment securities, comprising a larger percentage of our earning assets compared to 2016.  This increase was partially offset by the following:   Provision for credit losses for the first six months of 2017 was $8.7 million compared to a $1.0 million negative provision in the same period in 2016. The negative provision was primarily due to the recovery of a commercial loan previously charged-off.   Net occupancy expense for the first six months of 2017 was $16.3 million, an increase of $2.1 million or 15% compared to the same period in 2016. This increase was primarily due to a $1.5 million gain on the sale of real estate property in Guam during the first quarter of 2016, coupled with the aforementioned $1.3 million gain on sale of real estate property in Maui during the second quarter of 2016.   Other noninterest income for the first six months of 2017 was $8.3 million, a decrease of $1.3 million or 13% compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to a $1.6 million decrease in net gain on sale of leased assets. This decrease was partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in profit from foreign exchange contracts.   Salaries and benefits for the first six months of 2017 was $101.7 million, an increase of $0.9 million or 1% compared to the same period in 2016. Salaries increased by $2.0 million primarily due to merit increases. In addition, payroll taxes increased by $0.5 million. These increases were partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in incentive compensation and a $0.7 million decrease in separation expense.  We maintained a strong balance sheet during the second quarter of 2017, with what we believe are adequate reserves for credit losses and high levels of liquidity and capital.   The allowance for loan and lease losses (the "Allowance") was $106.4 million as of June 30, 2017, an increase of $2.1 million or 2% from December 31, 2016. The Allowance represents 1.13% of total loans and leases outstanding as of June 30, 2017 and 1.17% of total loans and leases outstanding as of December 31, 2016. The level of our Allowance was commensurate with the Company's credit risk profile, loan portfolio growth and composition, and a healthy Hawaii economy.   As of June 30, 2017, the total carrying value of our investment securities portfolio was $6.1 billion, an increase of $80.4 million or 1% compared to December 31, 2016. During the first six months of 2017, we primarily increased our holdings in mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae. In addition, we also increased our holdings in Small Business Administration securities, while decreasing our holdings in U.S. Treasury securities. Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities continue to be the largest concentration in our portfolio.   Total deposits were $14.8 billion as of June 30, 2017, an increase of $464.4 million or 3% from December 31, 2016 primarily due to an increase in time deposits.   Total shareholders' equity was $1.2 billion as of June 30, 2017, an increase of $52.2 million or 4% from December 31, 2016. We continued to return capital to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. During the first six months of 2017, we repurchased 255,629 shares of our common stock at a total cost of $21.3 million under our share repurchase program and from shares purchased from employees and/or directors in connection with income tax withholdings related to the vesting of restricted stock, shares purchased for a deferred compensation plan, and stock swaps, less shares distributed from the deferred compensation plan. We also paid cash dividends of $42.8 million during the first six months of 2017.  Table of Contents  Our financial highlights are presented in Table 1.

See the "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section below.  Table of Contents  Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  The ratios "tangible common equity to tangible assets" and "tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets" are Non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes these measurements are useful for investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate capital adequacy relative to other financial institutions. Although these Non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a financial institution, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. Table 2 provides a reconciliation of these Non-GAAP financial measures with their most closely related GAAP measures.

The Bank of Hawaii Corporation (BOH) is a regional commercial bank headquartered in Honolulu, Hawaii. It is Hawaii's second oldest bank and its largest locally owned bank in that the majority of the voting stockholders reside within the state. Bank of Hawaii has the most accounts, customers, branches, and ATMs of any financial institution in the state (although BancWest's First Hawaiian Bank holds a greater number of dollars in deposits). The bank consists of four business segments: retail banking, commercial banking, investment services, and treasury.[3] The bank is currently headed by Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Peter S. Ho.[4]

Beginnings[edit]
In 1893, Charles Montague Cooke (1849–1909) with his brother-in-law Joseph Ballard Atherton and business partner Peter Cushman Jones founded Bank of Hawaii. In 1897, it was chartered in the Republic of Hawaii by Interior Minister James A. King.[5] A decade after its founding, in 1903, the bank opened its first branch in Kauai. In 1922, the bank acquired First Bank of Hilo, which had four branches. In 1930, it amalgamated Bank of Maui.
Bank of Maui[edit]
Charles Dexter Lufkin organized First National Bank of Wailuku in 1901.[6] Five years later, he had organized Lahaina National Bank. Then he organized the First National Bank of Paia in 1913.[6] Lastly, in 1917, First National Bank of Paia merged with Lahaina National Bank and First National Bank of Wailuku to form Bank of Maui.[6]
Activities in Hawaii since 1971[edit]
In 1971, BOH formed a bank holding company called Hawaii Bancorporation.[7]
In 1979, Hawaii Bancorporation changed its name to Bancorp Hawaii.[8] In 1985, BOH as Bancorp Hawaii acquired the Hawaiian Trust Company for $19 million.[9][10]
In 1990, BOH as Bancorp Hawaii acquired FirstFed America Inc. with its First Federal Savings and Loan Association in Hawaii and First Savings of Guam subsidiaries for $141 million in cash.[11] First Federal Savings was maintained as a separate entity until 1998 when it was merged into the Bank of Hawaii.[12]
Bancorp Hawaii changed its name to Pacific Century Financial Corporation (PCFC) in 1997.[8][13]
Large drop in the firm's stock in early 2000 caused by bad loans and quick expansion outside of he firm's core business of Hawaii, Guam, and American Samoa[14][15] led to a change in management.[16]
BOH as Pacific Century Financial Corporation sold off its credit card division to American Express for an undisclosed amount in 2001.[17][18][19]
In 2002, Pacific Century Financial Corporation was renamed Bank of Hawaii Corporation.[20]
Activities on the U.S. Mainland[edit]
In its first expansion onto the continental United States, BOH as Bancorp Hawaii acquired the Phoenix, Arizona-based First National Bancorp of Arizona with its five-office First National Bank of Arizona subsidiary for an undisclosed amount in 1987.[21] Ten years later, through its First National Bank of Arizona subsidiary, BOH acquired all four Arizona branch offices from Home Savings of America for an undisclosed amount in 1997 and merged those offices into First National while at nearly the same time changed the name of First National to Pacific Century Bank NA.[22]
The following year, BOH as Pacific Century Financial Corporation acquired the Encino, California-based CU Bancorp with its California United Bank subsidiary for $183 million in stock and cash.[23][24][25] Just shortly after the acquisition was finalized in 1998, California United and its 22 offices in Southern California was merged into phoenix-based Pacific Century Bank and the headquarters for the newly combined Pacific Century Bank was moved to Encino.
After 14 years on the Mainland, BOH decided to abandon their activities on the Mainland in 2001 by selling all 9 Arizona branch offices of the Pacific Century Bank to Zions Bancorporation for an undisclosed amount[26][27] and all 20 California branch offices of the Pacific Century Bank to U.S. Bancorp for an undisclosed amount.[28][29][30] Zion merged their purchase into their National Bank of Arizona subsidiary.[26]
International activities[edit]
It was not until 1959 that BOH made another novel move when it opened its first Pacific Islands branch on Kwajalein. Two years later, it opened a branch in both Palau and Guam. Ten years later, BOH continued its international expansion by absorbing Bank of American Samoa, which the Navy had established in 1914. That same year, it created Banque de Tahiti as a joint venture between itself and Crédit Lyonnais. The next year, BOH established a branch in Yap. Branches in Ponape and Kosrae followed in the subsequent years.
It also continued its expansion outside Hawaii with the establishment of a branch in Saipan. Three years later, BOH and Crédit Lyonnais established another joint-venture, Banque de Nouvelle Calédonie in Nouméa.
In 1980, BOH opened a branch in Tokyo.
BOH acquired Wells Fargo Bank's Seoul, Korea, and Singapore operations in 1991.[31][32] Two years later, it acquired Banque Indosuez's operations in Vanuatu, which became Banque d’Hawaii (Vanuatu). That same year, BOH also opened its first branch in Suva, Fiji in 1993. Branches in Nadi and Lautoka followed. In 1994, BOH acquired Commonwealth Bank of Australia's 51% ownership in the National Bank of Solomon Islands.[33] BOH also acquired Crédit Lyonnais' holdings in Banque de Nouvelle Calédonie, giving BOH 91 percent ownership.[34]
Banque de Nouvelle Calédonie changed its name to Bank of Hawaii—Nouvelle Calédonie.[35] BOH also purchased Banque Indosuez Nuigini in Papua New Guinea from Banque Indosuez for $5.6 million[36] and renamed it Bank of Hawaii (PNG) Ltd. In addition to its main office in Port Moresby, Bank of Hawaii (PNG) also had an office in Lae, PNG's second port city on the Northeast Coast. Indosuez Nuigini was established in 1983 with 49 percent Indosuez participation, 41.5 percent Bank of Papua New Guinea, and the remainder public.
International acquisitions[edit]
In 1998, BOH bought 5.4mn convertible notes of Bank of Queensland for $22 million as part of a strategic alliance giving rise to a true reflecting of the convertible note value into 49% ownership at that time.[37][38] It also acquired 100 percent of Banque Paribas Pacifique (est. 1972; 3 branches) and 70 percent of Banque Paribas Polynésie (est. 1984; 1 branch).[39] BOH integrated the operations with Bank of Hawaii-Nouvelle Calédonie and Banque de Tahiti, respectively. In 1999, BOH bought 5.8mn shares (approx. 10 percent) in Bank of Queensland.[40]
Withdraw from international financial services markets[edit]
In 2001, BOH sold its 6.2mn shares and 5.4mn convertible notes in Bank of Queensland for $20 million and $16 million respectively.[41] The decision reflected PCFC's new strategic plan, which mandated a focus on the bank's core markets in Hawaii, American Samoa, and Guam. BOH sold its shareholding in the Bank of Tonga and Pacific Commercial Bank of Samoa to Westpac. BOH and Westpac both had 30 percent interests in Bank of Tonga and 42 percent interests in Pacific Commercial Bank.[42][43] BOH sold its operations in Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, and Fiji to ANZ for AU$100 million.[44] BOH sold its approximately 95 percent share interest in its French Polynesia and New Caledonia operations to France-based Caisse Nationale des Caisses d'Epargne (CNCE). Its operations in French Polynesia included 17 branches of its subsidiary, Banque de Tahiti, and about 265 employees. Its operations in New Caledonia included eight branches of subsidiary Bank of Hawaii-Nouvelle Caledonie and about 190 employees.[45][46] Lastly, BOH closed its offices in Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore, and Taipei.
In 2002, BOH was unable to find a buyer for its bank properties in the Central Pacific when it was trying to withdraw from those markets. As a result, BOH closed its Majuro branch in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) and its three branches in Pohnpei, Yap, and Kosrae in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM).[47] BOH turned over its 51 percent interest in National Bank of Solomon Islands to the government of the Solomon Islands.
Governance[edit]
Poor performance by the bank in early 2000, contributed to chairman and CEO Lawrence M. Johnson's resignation in 2000[16] and bank president Richard Dahl being passed over as Johnson's replacement. Dahl left the company in 2002.[48]
In November 2000, Michael E. O'Neill was hired from outside the company to serve as chairman and CEO to correct mistakes made by the previous management.[49] O'Neill did not take a salary or any bonuses during his three years at the helm, but in 2004 he controlled about 2.73 million — about 5 percent — of the bank's total shares directly or under option.[50] O'Neill reversed the company's decline by selling off properties outside the company's core business area of Hawaii, Guam, and American Samoa. O'Neill stepped down as chairman and CEO in 2004.[51]
In December 2003, Allan R. Landon was promoted from chief financial officer to president[52][53] and later to chairman and CEO upon O'Neill leaving in September 2004.[54] Under Landon’s leadership, the Bank of Hawaii "survived the financial crisis without federal assistance and prospered in its aftermath".
In 2008, Landon handed his position of president to Peter S. Ho while Landon retained his chairman and CEO posts.[55] Two years later Ho was given the additional titles of chairman and chief executive officer in addition to president upon the retirement of Allan R. Landon in 2010.[56]

Beginnings[edit]
In 1893, Charles Montague Cooke (1849–1909) with his brother-in-law Joseph Ballard Atherton and business partner Peter Cushman Jones founded Bank of Hawaii. In 1897, it was chartered in the Republic of Hawaii by Interior Minister James A. King.[5] A decade after its founding, in 1903, the bank opened its first branch in Kauai. In 1922, the bank acquired First Bank of Hilo, which had four branches. In 1930, it amalgamated Bank of Maui.
Bank of Maui[edit]
Charles Dexter Lufkin organized First National Bank of Wailuku in 1901.[6] Five years later, he had organized Lahaina National Bank. Then he organized the First National Bank of Paia in 1913.[6] Lastly, in 1917, First National Bank of Paia merged with Lahaina National Bank and First National Bank of Wailuku to form Bank of Maui.[6]
Activities in Hawaii since 1971[edit]
In 1971, BOH formed a bank holding company called Hawaii Bancorporation.[7]
In 1979, Hawaii Bancorporation changed its name to Bancorp Hawaii.[8] In 1985, BOH as Bancorp Hawaii acquired the Hawaiian Trust Company for $19 million.[9][10]
In 1990, BOH as Bancorp Hawaii acquired FirstFed America Inc. with its First Federal Savings and Loan Association in Hawaii and First Savings of Guam subsidiaries for $141 million in cash.[11] First Federal Savings was maintained as a separate entity until 1998 when it was merged into the Bank of Hawaii.[12]
Bancorp Hawaii changed its name to Pacific Century Financial Corporation (PCFC) in 1997.[8][13]
Large drop in the firm's stock in early 2000 caused by bad loans and quick expansion outside of he firm's core business of Hawaii, Guam, and American Samoa[14][15] led to a change in management.[16]
BOH as Pacific Century Financial Corporation sold off its credit card division to American Express for an undisclosed amount in 2001.[17][18][19]
In 2002, Pacific Century Financial Corporation was renamed Bank of Hawaii Corporation.[20]
Activities on the U.S. Mainland[edit]
In its first expansion onto the continental United States, BOH as Bancorp Hawaii acquired the Phoenix, Arizona-based First National Bancorp of Arizona with its five-office First National Bank of Arizona subsidiary for an undisclosed amount in 1987.[21] Ten years later, through its First National Bank of Arizona subsidiary, BOH acquired all four Arizona branch offices from Home Savings of America for an undisclosed amount in 1997 and merged those offices into First National while at nearly the same time changed the name of First National to Pacific Century Bank NA.[22]
The following year, BOH as Pacific Century Financial Corporation acquired the Encino, California-based CU Bancorp with its California United Bank subsidiary for $183 million in stock and cash.[23][24][25] Just shortly after the acquisition was finalized in 1998, California United and its 22 offices in Southern California was merged into phoenix-based Pacific Century Bank and the headquarters for the newly combined Pacific Century Bank was moved to Encino.
After 14 years on the Mainland, BOH decided to abandon their activities on the Mainland in 2001 by selling all 9 Arizona branch offices of the Pacific Century Bank to Zions Bancorporation for an undisclosed amount[26][27] and all 20 California branch offices of the Pacific Century Bank to U.S. Bancorp for an undisclosed amount.[28][29][30] Zion merged their purchase into their National Bank of Arizona subsidiary.[26]
International activities[edit]
It was not until 1959 that BOH made another novel move when it opened its first Pacific Islands branch on Kwajalein. Two years later, it opened a branch in both Palau and Guam. Ten years later, BOH continued its international expansion by absorbing Bank of American Samoa, which the Navy had established in 1914. That same year, it created Banque de Tahiti as a joint venture between itself and Crédit Lyonnais. The next year, BOH established a branch in Yap. Branches in Ponape and Kosrae followed in the subsequent years.
It also continued its expansion outside Hawaii with the establishment of a branch in Saipan. Three years later, BOH and Crédit Lyonnais established another joint-venture, Banque de Nouvelle Calédonie in Nouméa.
In 1980, BOH opened a branch in Tokyo.
BOH acquired Wells Fargo Bank's Seoul, Korea, and Singapore operations in 1991.[31][32] Two years later, it acquired Banque Indosuez's operations in Vanuatu, which became Banque d’Hawaii (Vanuatu). That same year, BOH also opened its first branch in Suva, Fiji in 1993. Branches in Nadi and Lautoka followed. In 1994, BOH acquired Commonwealth Bank of Australia's 51% ownership in the National Bank of Solomon Islands.[33] BOH also acquired Crédit Lyonnais' holdings in Banque de Nouvelle Calédonie, giving BOH 91 percent ownership.[34]
Banque de Nouvelle Calédonie changed its name to Bank of Hawaii—Nouvelle Calédonie.[35] BOH also purchased Banque Indosuez Nuigini in Papua New Guinea from Banque Indosuez for $5.6 million[36] and renamed it Bank of Hawaii (PNG) Ltd. In addition to its main office in Port Moresby, Bank of Hawaii (PNG) also had an office in Lae, PNG's second port city on the Northeast Coast. Indosuez Nuigini was established in 1983 with 49 percent Indosuez participation, 41.5 percent Bank of Papua New Guinea, and the remainder public.
International acquisitions[edit]
In 1998, BOH bought 5.4mn convertible notes of Bank of Queensland for $22 million as part of a strategic alliance giving rise to a true reflecting of the convertible note value into 49% ownership at that time.[37][38] It also acquired 100 percent of Banque Paribas Pacifique (est. 1972; 3 branches) and 70 percent of Banque Paribas Polynésie (est. 1984; 1 branch).[39] BOH integrated the operations with Bank of Hawaii-Nouvelle Calédonie and Banque de Tahiti, respectively. In 1999, BOH bought 5.8mn shares (approx. 10 percent) in Bank of Queensland.[40]
Withdraw from international financial services markets[edit]
In 2001, BOH sold its 6.2mn shares and 5.4mn convertible notes in Bank of Queensland for $20 million and $16 million respectively.[41] The decision reflected PCFC's new strategic plan, which mandated a focus on the bank's core markets in Hawaii, American Samoa, and Guam. BOH sold its shareholding in the Bank of Tonga and Pacific Commercial Bank of Samoa to Westpac. BOH and Westpac both had 30 percent interests in Bank of Tonga and 42 percent interests in Pacific Commercial Bank.[42][43] BOH sold its operations in Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, and Fiji to ANZ for AU$100 million.[44] BOH sold its approximately 95 percent share interest in its French Polynesia and New Caledonia operations to France-based Caisse Nationale des Caisses d'Epargne (CNCE). Its operations in French Polynesia included 17 branches of its subsidiary, Banque de Tahiti, and about 265 employees. Its operations in New Caledonia included eight branches of subsidiary Bank of Hawaii-Nouvelle Caledonie and about 190 employees.[45][46] Lastly, BOH closed its offices in Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore, and Taipei.
In 2002, BOH was unable to find a buyer for its bank properties in the Central Pacific when it was trying to withdraw from those markets. As a result, BOH closed its Majuro branch in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) and its three branches in Pohnpei, Yap, and Kosrae in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM).[47] BOH turned over its 51 percent interest in National Bank of Solomon Islands to the government of the Solomon Islands.
Governance[edit]
Poor performance by the bank in early 2000, contributed to chairman and CEO Lawrence M. Johnson's resignation in 2000[16] and bank president Richard Dahl being passed over as Johnson's replacement. Dahl left the company in 2002.[48]
In November 2000, Michael E. O'Neill was hired from outside the company to serve as chairman and CEO to correct mistakes made by the previous management.[49] O'Neill did not take a salary or any bonuses during his three years at the helm, but in 2004 he controlled about 2.73 million — about 5 percent — of the bank's total shares directly or under option.[50] O'Neill reversed the company's decline by selling off properties outside the company's core business area of Hawaii, Guam, and American Samoa. O'Neill stepped down as chairman and CEO in 2004.[51]
In December 2003, Allan R. Landon was promoted from chief financial officer to president[52][53] and later to chairman and CEO upon O'Neill leaving in September 2004.[54] Under Landon’s leadership, the Bank of Hawaii "survived the financial crisis without federal assistance and prospered in its aftermath".
In 2008, Landon handed his position of president to Peter S. Ho while Landon retained his chairman and CEO posts.[55] Two years later Ho was given the additional titles of chairman and chief executive officer in addition to president upon the retirement of Allan R. Landon in 2010.[56]

The Bank of Hawaii Corporation (BOH) is a regional commercial bank headquartered in Honolulu, Hawaii. It is Hawaii's second oldest bank and its largest locally owned bank in that the majority of the voting stockholders reside within the state. Bank of Hawaii has the most accounts, customers, branches, and ATMs of any financial institution in the state (although BancWest's First Hawaiian Bank holds a greater number of dollars in deposits). The bank consists of four business segments: retail banking, commercial banking, investment services, and treasury.[3] The bank is currently headed by Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Peter S. Ho.[4]

Beginnings[edit]
In 1893, Charles Montague Cooke (1849–1909) with his brother-in-law Joseph Ballard Atherton and business partner Peter Cushman Jones founded Bank of Hawaii. In 1897, it was chartered in the Republic of Hawaii by Interior Minister James A. King.[5] A decade after its founding, in 1903, the bank opened its first branch in Kauai. In 1922, the bank acquired First Bank of Hilo, which had four branches. In 1930, it amalgamated Bank of Maui.
Bank of Maui[edit]
Charles Dexter Lufkin organized First National Bank of Wailuku in 1901.[6] Five years later, he had organized Lahaina National Bank. Then he organized the First National Bank of Paia in 1913.[6] Lastly, in 1917, First National Bank of Paia merged with Lahaina National Bank and First National Bank of Wailuku to form Bank of Maui.[6]
Activities in Hawaii since 1971[edit]
In 1971, BOH formed a bank holding company called Hawaii Bancorporation.[7]
In 1979, Hawaii Bancorporation changed its name to Bancorp Hawaii.[8] In 1985, BOH as Bancorp Hawaii acquired the Hawaiian Trust Company for $19 million.[9][10]
In 1990, BOH as Bancorp Hawaii acquired FirstFed America Inc. with its First Federal Savings and Loan Association in Hawaii and First Savings of Guam subsidiaries for $141 million in cash.[11] First Federal Savings was maintained as a separate entity until 1998 when it was merged into the Bank of Hawaii.[12]
Bancorp Hawaii changed its name to Pacific Century Financial Corporation (PCFC) in 1997.[8][13]
Large drop in the firm's stock in early 2000 caused by bad loans and quick expansion outside of he firm's core business of Hawaii, Guam, and American Samoa[14][15] led to a change in management.[16]
BOH as Pacific Century Financial Corporation sold off its credit card division to American Express for an undisclosed amount in 2001.[17][18][19]
In 2002, Pacific Century Financial Corporation was renamed Bank of Hawaii Corporation.[20]
Activities on the U.S. Mainland[edit]
In its first expansion onto the continental United States, BOH as Bancorp Hawaii acquired the Phoenix, Arizona-based First National Bancorp of Arizona with its five-office First National Bank of Arizona subsidiary for an undisclosed amount in 1987.[21] Ten years later, through its First National Bank of Arizona subsidiary, BOH acquired all four Arizona branch offices from Home Savings of America for an undisclosed amount in 1997 and merged those offices into First National while at nearly the same time changed the name of First National to Pacific Century Bank NA.[22]
The following year, BOH as Pacific Century Financial Corporation acquired the Encino, California-based CU Bancorp with its California United Bank subsidiary for $183 million in stock and cash.[23][24][25] Just shortly after the acquisition was finalized in 1998, California United and its 22 offices in Southern California was merged into phoenix-based Pacific Century Bank and the headquarters for the newly combined Pacific Century Bank was moved to Encino.
After 14 years on the Mainland, BOH decided to abandon their activities on the Mainland in 2001 by selling all 9 Arizona branch offices of the Pacific Century Bank to Zions Bancorporation for an undisclosed amount[26][27] and all 20 California branch offices of the Pacific Century Bank to U.S. Bancorp for an undisclosed amount.[28][29][30] Zion merged their purchase into their National Bank of Arizona subsidiary.[26]
International activities[edit]
It was not until 1959 that BOH made another novel move when it opened its first Pacific Islands branch on Kwajalein. Two years later, it opened a branch in both Palau and Guam. Ten years later, BOH continued its international expansion by absorbing Bank of American Samoa, which the Navy had established in 1914. That same year, it created Banque de Tahiti as a joint venture between itself and Crédit Lyonnais. The next year, BOH established a branch in Yap. Branches in Ponape and Kosrae followed in the subsequent years.
It also continued its expansion outside Hawaii with the establishment of a branch in Saipan. Three years later, BOH and Crédit Lyonnais established another joint-venture, Banque de Nouvelle Calédonie in Nouméa.
In 1980, BOH opened a branch in Tokyo.
BOH acquired Wells Fargo Bank's Seoul, Korea, and Singapore operations in 1991.[31][32] Two years later, it acquired Banque Indosuez's operations in Vanuatu, which became Banque d’Hawaii (Vanuatu). That same year, BOH also opened its first branch in Suva, Fiji in 1993. Branches in Nadi and Lautoka followed. In 1994, BOH acquired Commonwealth Bank of Australia's 51% ownership in the National Bank of Solomon Islands.[33] BOH also acquired Crédit Lyonnais' holdings in Banque de Nouvelle Calédonie, giving BOH 91 percent ownership.[34]
Banque de Nouvelle Calédonie changed its name to Bank of Hawaii—Nouvelle Calédonie.[35] BOH also purchased Banque Indosuez Nuigini in Papua New Guinea from Banque Indosuez for $5.6 million[36] and renamed it Bank of Hawaii (PNG) Ltd. In addition to its main office in Port Moresby, Bank of Hawaii (PNG) also had an office in Lae, PNG's second port city on the Northeast Coast. Indosuez Nuigini was established in 1983 with 49 percent Indosuez participation, 41.5 percent Bank of Papua New Guinea, and the remainder public.
International acquisitions[edit]
In 1998, BOH bought 5.4mn convertible notes of Bank of Queensland for $22 million as part of a strategic alliance giving rise to a true reflecting of the convertible note value into 49% ownership at that time.[37][38] It also acquired 100 percent of Banque Paribas Pacifique (est. 1972; 3 branches) and 70 percent of Banque Paribas Polynésie (est. 1984; 1 branch).[39] BOH integrated the operations with Bank of Hawaii-Nouvelle Calédonie and Banque de Tahiti, respectively. In 1999, BOH bought 5.8mn shares (approx. 10 percent) in Bank of Queensland.[40]
Withdraw from international financial services markets[edit]
In 2001, BOH sold its 6.2mn shares and 5.4mn convertible notes in Bank of Queensland for $20 million and $16 million respectively.[41] The decision reflected PCFC's new strategic plan, which mandated a focus on the bank's core markets in Hawaii, American Samoa, and Guam. BOH sold its shareholding in the Bank of Tonga and Pacific Commercial Bank of Samoa to Westpac. BOH and Westpac both had 30 percent interests in Bank of Tonga and 42 percent interests in Pacific Commercial Bank.[42][43] BOH sold its operations in Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, and Fiji to ANZ for AU$100 million.[44] BOH sold its approximately 95 percent share interest in its French Polynesia and New Caledonia operations to France-based Caisse Nationale des Caisses d'Epargne (CNCE). Its operations in French Polynesia included 17 branches of its subsidiary, Banque de Tahiti, and about 265 employees. Its operations in New Caledonia included eight branches of subsidiary Bank of Hawaii-Nouvelle Caledonie and about 190 employees.[45][46] Lastly, BOH closed its offices in Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore, and Taipei.
In 2002, BOH was unable to find a buyer for its bank properties in the Central Pacific when it was trying to withdraw from those markets. As a result, BOH closed its Majuro branch in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) and its three branches in Pohnpei, Yap, and Kosrae in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM).[47] BOH turned over its 51 percent interest in National Bank of Solomon Islands to the government of the Solomon Islands.
Governance[edit]
Poor performance by the bank in early 2000, contributed to chairman and CEO Lawrence M. Johnson's resignation in 2000[16] and bank president Richard Dahl being passed over as Johnson's replacement. Dahl left the company in 2002.[48]
In November 2000, Michael E. O'Neill was hired from outside the company to serve as chairman and CEO to correct mistakes made by the previous management.[49] O'Neill did not take a salary or any bonuses during his three years at the helm, but in 2004 he controlled about 2.73 million — about 5 percent — of the bank's total shares directly or under option.[50] O'Neill reversed the company's decline by selling off properties outside the company's core business area of Hawaii, Guam, and American Samoa. O'Neill stepped down as chairman and CEO in 2004.[51]
In December 2003, Allan R. Landon was promoted from chief financial officer to president[52][53] and later to chairman and CEO upon O'Neill leaving in September 2004.[54] Under Landon’s leadership, the Bank of Hawaii "survived the financial crisis without federal assistance and prospered in its aftermath".
In 2008, Landon handed his position of president to Peter S. Ho while Landon retained his chairman and CEO posts.[55] Two years later Ho was given the additional titles of chairman and chief executive officer in addition to president upon the retirement of Allan R. Landon in 2010.[56]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
