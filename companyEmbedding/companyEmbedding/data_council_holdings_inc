Next Meeting Date and Location To Be Determined







October 2016 Agenda


Previous Meetings









WHAT IS ?
MISSION + GOALS


The Department of Commerce collects, processes, and disseminates approximately 36% of the federal open data. That data fuels planning, research and operations that support society and the economy. Commerce is continuously working to improve in its delivery of services. To help guide the Department's efforts, Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker has assembled the Commerce Data Advisory Council (CDAC). The CDAC provides expert guidance and insight to the Department of Commerce's data leadership, covering a wide range of pressing issues in data and technology: 








Data management practices that make it easier to rack and disseminate integrated interoperable data for diverse users
                                


Best practices that can be deployed across Commerce to achieve common, open standards related to taxonomy, vocabulary, APIs metadata, and other key data characteristics
                                


Policy issues that arrive from expanding access to data, including issues related to privacy, latency, and consistency
                                






Opportunities and risks related to the combination of public and private data sources and the development of joint data products and services resulting from public-private partnerships
                                


External uses of Commerce data and similar federal, state, and private data sets by businesses
                                


Methods to enhance communication and collaboration between stakeholders and subject-matter experts at Commerce on data access and use
                                









Council meetings are held up to four times per year. Members of the public may observe the proceedings in person or via live stream.
