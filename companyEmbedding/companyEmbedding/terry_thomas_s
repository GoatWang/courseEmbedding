“The Terry Thomas provides a window into the soul of a firm that practices what it preaches and whose approach to sustainability is as much rooted in common sense as it is in the eco-enthusiasm of its employees.” – Jim Schneider, eco-structure, 6.2008
The Terry Thomas is a highly sustainable, LEED Gold for Core and Shell certified commercial building located in Seattle’s South Lake Union neighborhood. Wrapped in windows, it is a building designed along a modern aesthetic with a combination of time-tested strategies from the pre-HVAC era and complimentary new technologies. It is Seattle’s first commercial office building structure developed in decades without central air conditioning and is a working demonstration of the possibilities of sustainable design.
The design choices made for The Terry Thomas reflect changing attitudes about the environment, climate change and employee well-being. The building reduces its carbon footprint with no air conditioning, reduced lighting, a feature stair that encourages use, and a single elevator. The passive cooling system features operable windows, automated louvers and a courtyard. Warm air is drawn into the central courtyard, which acts as a chimney, sending it skyward. Glass sunshades, exterior automated blinds, and a reflective roof protects occupants from solar heat gain. Designing to optimize the natural ventilation went hand in hand with enabling natural light to penetrate the building, dramatically reducing the need for electrical lighting. Both strongly contribute to occupants’ well-being, satisfaction and productivity – part of The Terry Thomas’s original vision.

          One of Britain's most beloved eccentric comedians, the irrepressible, gap-toothed Terry-Thomas was born Thomas Terry Hoar Stevens in Lichfield Grove, Finchley. He was the son of Ellen Elizabeth (Hoar) and Ernest Frederick Stevens, a fairly well-to-do London businessman. He was afforded a private education at Ardingly College in Sussex, with the understanding that this was to lead him towards a prosperous future in the world of commerce. Ironically, deemed to have no acting talent and thus spurned by his school's dramatic society, young Thomas took to music and soon fronted his own jazz band, "The Rhythm Maniacs", in which he also played ukulele. His initial experience in the work force was, at best humdrum, at worst traumatic. He started as a transport clerk with the Union Cold Storage Company, went on selling meat at the Smithfield Markets and then peddled insurance policies for Norwich Union. By both choice and inclination, he didn't fit into any of these jobs, was often bullied and consequently adopted as his life-long mantra the motto "I Shall Not Be Cowed".Trying everything to break out of what he perceived as lower middle class mediocrity, he first changed his accent from North London to the posh upper-crust tones of then-matinee idol Owen Nares. He turned to professional ballroom dancing, found work in films as an extra and performed comedy monologues, as well as impersonations in night clubs and cabaret. He also tried several variations for a stage name people would remember, including a reversed spelling of Tom Stevens: 'Mot Snevets'. Not surprisingly, this didn't catch on and so he eventually settled on 'Terry Thomas', later adding the hyphen, which he likened to the gap between his teeth. His theatrical debut did not eventuate until he was twenty-eight, performing at the Tivoli Theatre in Hull. The onset of World War II put his burgeoning career on hold. He enlisted in the Army Signals Corps and, somehow, rose to the rank of sergeant. Between 1940 and 1942, Terry participated in the ENSA program, staging his own shows "Cabaret Parade" and "Stars in Battledress". It was at this time, that he first adopted the affected mannerisms, which later became his stock-in-trade. He also demonstrated an amazing repertoire for imitating popular vocalists and for recreating all types of sound effects with his voice.In July 1946, Terry joined the cast of the revue "Piccadilly Hayride" and suddenly became the comic discovery of the year, which ended with a Royal Variety Performance in front of King and Queen. His proper breakthrough, though, came via his radio show "To Town with Terry" (and its sequel), aired on the BBC Home Service from October 1948. This opened many doors, including Terry getting his own TV series, How Do You View? (1949). He was invited to a cabaret gig at New York's Waldorf Astoria in 1951. Terry was featured on the inaugural cover of TV Mirror, even before the part of his career he is primarily remembered for had begun in earnest. After a brace of nondescript roles, he was finally cast as the effete, derisive Major Hitchcock in the first of several films produced by the Boulting brothers, Private's Progress (1956). For several years after, Terry's popularity flourished with similar films taking a jaundiced view of British institutions. Following his overbearing Bertrand Welch in Lucky Jim (1957), he starred as the titular Man in a Cocked Hat (1959), a satire paralleling the Suez Affair, which turned out to be one of his best roles. Terry played an inept, blundering diplomat appointed as 'special ambassador' to sort out the political quagmire of an obscure former colony, overrun by foreign agents and on the verge of an uprising. For this assignment, his character has little more to draw upon, other than his knowledge of Debrett's Peerage and Sporting Life. This film, established the dandified "jolly good show"-type Terry-Thomas screen personae once and for all.After Carleton-Browne, came I'm All Right Jack (1959) (in which he recreated his Major Hitchcock character as a representative of management vis-à-vis labour) and School for Scoundrels (1960), in which he was perfectly cast a first-class bounder. Alternating dastardly, moustache-twirling comic villains (Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines or How I Flew from London to Paris in 25 hours 11 minutes (1965)) with sophisticated, rakish bon vivants and impeccably British chauffeurs (Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die (1966) or butlers (How to Murder Your Wife (1965), popularised Terry on both sides of the Atlantic. Mostly, he came to epitomise the archetypal British 'silly ass' -- an instantly recognisable figure replete with RAF-style moustache, cheeky gap-toothed grin, mobile eyebrows, flashy waistcoats, button-hole carnation, suede shoes and enormous cigarette holders (including one studded with 42 diamonds!). Life imitated art, when it came to womanising, clothing and accessories. Terry, a founding member of the London Waistcoat Club, ended up owning more than 150 of these garments, in addition to 80 Savile Row bespoke suits.In the late 1960's, Terry settled on the island of Ibiza with his twenty-six year old second wife. However, by 1984, his prior extravagant lifestyle and the exorbitant costs associated with the treatment of Parkinson's disease, with which he had been diagnosed in 1971, forced the couple to sell the villa and move back to a sparse flat in Britain. Almost destitute, his remaining days were made easier by his numerous friends in show business who managed to raise 51,000 pounds for him at a London benefit. Terry-Thomas died at a high care nursing home in Godalming, Surrey, in January 1990 at the age of 78.

      In 1966 he was about to co-star in a movie called "Easy Come, Easy Go" with Jan Berry and Dean Torrence in the leading roles. Due to a car wreck during shooting, in which Berry suffered a severe brain damage and paralysis, the film was canceled. The film would have marked the screen debut of Mel Brooks, who also would have starred in the movie.


      The producer of Two's Company (1975) tried to get him to play a recurring character part in the series, but Thomas's suffering from Parkinson's disease made it impossible for him to sign the contract.


      Having played Bertie Wooster in two radio plays in 1964 ('Indian Summer of an Uncle' and 'Jeeves Takes Charge'), he was also the first choice for the same role in the television series The World of Wooster (1965), eventually portrayed by Ian Carmichael.

      He was asked by director Derek Jarman to star as "Prospero" in his Shakespeare adaptation The Tempest (1979), but his failing health didn't allow him to play this role, which was eventually portrayed by Heathcote Williams.


      The gap in his upper teeth is so famous that in British medicine there is a Terry-Thomas sign - the gap between the scaphoid and lunate bones (scapho-lunate disassociation) on x-rays. These two bones are in the human wrist.


      He and producer Douglas Rankin headed their own production company together. It was called Thomkins Productions Ltd.


      Although mentioned in some German Edgar Wallace books, Terry-Thomas did not appear in The Trygon Factor (1966) as "Thompson", neither in the original English nor in the German version of the film. The role was played by Allan Cuthbertson.


      He used to say that the hyphen in his name Terry-Thomas represented the famous gap between his teeth.


      The Marvel UK comic book villain Mad Jim Jaspers is based on him.


      In 1965 he brought a successful court action against "Private Eye" magazine after a cartoon image in the August 23 edition depicted him as a "drunken dissolute character standing under a stage door" (The Times, February 9, 1965).


      A comic heritage plaque now commemorates his ownership of 11 Queen's Gate Mews, South Kensington, London, SW7. He lived at the West London Mews from 1949 until 1981.


      Was charged with driving a car in Great Windmill Street, Soho, on December 23 1957 "while under the influence of drink to such an extent as to be incapable of proper control of the vehicle."At Bow Street Court on January 16, 1958 he pled not guilty and elected to go for trial. At the trial on March 14, 1958 he was found not guilty and discharged.


Henri-Georges Clouzot wanted him to star in the movie Les espions (1957), but Terry-Thomas had to reject due to his full working schedule.


      Terry's and his wife Ida Patlanski had a dachshund dog which appeared in the film Miss Tulip Stays the Night (1955) credited as Archie Terry - Thomas.


      Became good friends with actor Stuart Whitman while filming Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines or How I Flew from London to Paris in 25 hours 11 minutes (1965). Whitman said he was greatly saddened by his friend's illness, which took away most of his motor functions toward the end of his life.


      Turnrd down the role of Dr Ezra Mungo which then went to Lionel Jeffries in the film Call Me Bwana.


      Had to turn down the role of Prospero in Derek Jarman's adaption of The Tempest (1970) due to ill health. The role then went to Heathcote Williams.

          One of Britain's most beloved eccentric comedians, the irrepressible, gap-toothed Terry-Thomas was born Thomas Terry Hoar Stevens in Lichfield Grove, Finchley. He was the son of Ellen Elizabeth (Hoar) and Ernest Frederick Stevens, a fairly well-to-do London businessman. He was afforded a private education at Ardingly College in Sussex, with the understanding that this was to lead him towards a prosperous future in the world of commerce. Ironically, deemed to have no acting talent and thus spurned by his school's dramatic society, young Thomas took to music and soon fronted his own jazz band, "The Rhythm Maniacs", in which he also played ukulele. His initial experience in the work force was, at best humdrum, at worst traumatic. He started as a transport clerk with the Union Cold Storage Company, went on selling meat at the Smithfield Markets and then peddled insurance policies for Norwich Union. By both choice and inclination, he didn't fit into any of these jobs, was often bullied and consequently adopted as his life-long mantra the motto "I Shall Not Be Cowed".Trying everything to break out of what he perceived as lower middle class mediocrity, he first changed his accent from North London to the posh upper-crust tones of then-matinee idol Owen Nares. He turned to professional ballroom dancing, found work in films as an extra and performed comedy monologues, as well as impersonations in night clubs and cabaret. He also tried several variations for a stage name people would remember, including a reversed spelling of Tom Stevens: 'Mot Snevets'. Not surprisingly, this didn't catch on and so he eventually settled on 'Terry Thomas', later adding the hyphen, which he likened to the gap between his teeth. His theatrical debut did not eventuate until he was twenty-eight, performing at the Tivoli Theatre in Hull. The onset of World War II put his burgeoning career on hold.

Terry Thomas Building By Weber Thompson

CourtyardA year ago I wrote about this Seattle building under the title "Smart Architect Builds Dumb Building." I meant it as a compliment; we need more dumb buildings that work like buildings used to, with natural light and ventilation, and without what Donovan Rypkema calls "green thingies"- expensive new technologies when older, simpler methods are more appropriate.Now it is done, and it looks terrific. Not only that, they seem to be happy with it, and have even blogged about it. Results so far: it is still a work in progress, but they say "From the first week that we occupied the building, we noticed how the Terry Thomas affected the culture of our firm. While we are still collecting objective information, the general mood is clearly elevated. We attribute this to having proper levels of natural daylight, the ability to open windows and the louvers that automatically open and close as CO2 levels and the temperature rise and fall."Love the courtyard at night!Why do I like this so much? They say things like Less is more in Sustainable Design : "Sustainable design is not only the wiz-bang high-tech features of a green building. Simple solutions contribute to a sustainable design, too." They expose the structure and paint it white: "Not only does this tell the story of how the building works, the white paint enhances the light reflection for both daylight harvesting and indirect lighting of open office areas. The design of the beams also serves as a design aesthetic, informing other choices we made in the build-out of our office space."Noise appears to be a bit of a problem: " We are tossing around ideas to mitigate the sound – white noise machines, additional homasote boards on blank walls – but one of our (unnamed) principals has come up with his own solution: a personal sound isolation booth."However, it appears that the Terry Thomas building is, as they say on their blog, a breath of fresh air. It is what a green building should be: not just about energy, but about being healthy and happy as well. ::The Terry Thomas

Terry Thomas


A childhood conversation still drives Terry Thomas.
He vividly remembers his sixth-grade teacher, mother and nine aunts and uncles sitting him down in the family's Danville ranch house to tell him how they had failed to achieve their goals. No one in the family had graduated from college, and they believed the boy could break the pattern. Yet he wasn't applying himself in school and appeared to be headed down the wrong path.
The conversation resonated with Mr. Thomas, and 25 years later he is on the corporate fast track at Purchase, N.Y.-based PepsiCo Inc. He oversees a Chicago-based unit with a $2-billion portfolio that includes household brands Lay's potato chips, Gatorade and Aquafina.
"I wouldn't be where I am today if not for the conversation," says Mr. Thomas, who lives in Glenview with his wife and three young daughters.
He earned a football scholarship to Northwestern University, where he was a four-year starter at cornerback and co-captain as a senior. He graduated with an economics degree, later received an MBA from Kellogg School of Management and rose quickly through the marketing and sales ranks at Procter & Gamble Co., Coca-Cola Co. and Frito-Lay, owned by PepsiCo.
As a vice-president of Frito-Lay's Central region in 2003, Mr. Thomas was recognized for managing a team with the best business results in the company.
 6 TO 7 P.M.When the family comes together for dinner and he hears about his wife and three young daughters' days.
His success stems from his skill at developing strategies that benefit his company as well as retailers, says Doug Cygan, a vice-president at Jewel-Osco. "Terry is a young guy with a tremendous amount of passion," Mr. Cygan says. "He is on the path to do significantly more at PepsiCo."
Mr. Thomas was promoted last year to oversee PepsiCo's accounts with four of its major retail customers: Meijer Inc., H. E. Butt Grocery Co., Publix Super Markets and Wegmans Food Markets. He is in charge of generating sales and profits for PepsiCo products at more than 1,600 stores and leads more than 100 employees nationwide.
"I want to use this as a springboard into a CEO-type position," Mr. Thomas says. "I absolutely want to lead a large organization."
