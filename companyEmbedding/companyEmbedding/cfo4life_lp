FAQs

FAQs







WHY THE NAME CFO4LIFE?

Most businesses have a CFO to handle their financial matters. Given the complicated nature of personal finance and the endless choices available, we believe individuals should also have their own personal CFO. Most folks do not have the time, tools, or expertise to juggle the complex world of personal finances – taxes, investments, insurance, college, retirement and estate planning. A personal CFO can help you make better decisions that could allow you to shorten the path to financial independence.

WHO IS YOUR TYPICAL CLIENT?

We have a wide range of clientele that includes business owners, executives, professionals, and high net worth individuals.

HOW DOES THE FEE STRUCTURE WORK?

We are a fee based wealth management firm. Investment management clients are charged a quarterly fee based on their assets under management.

WHAT KIND OF PROTECTION DOES MY CUSTODIAL ACCOUNT HAVE?

All wealth management clients of CFO4Life are required to maintain their account assets at a qualified custodian, that is not affiliated with CFO4Life. CFO4Life recommends that wealth management clients utilize TD Ameritrade as the account custodian. TD Ameritrade’s SIPC Membership provides account protection up to a maximum of $500,000 per customer, of which $250,000 may be claims for cash. An explanatory brochure is available at www.sipc.org. The account protection applies when an SIPC member firm fails financially and is unable to meet obligations to securities clients, but it does not protect against losses from the rise and fall in the market value of investments. Additionally, TD Ameritrade accounts have additional securities protection to cover the net equity of customer accounts which is subject to conditions and limitations. Please refer to your TD Ameritrade account documentation for additional information.

WHAT CAN I EXPECT AT THE FIRST MEETING?

At your first meeting we want to understand how you got to where you are today and where you want to go. We will ask you a lot of questions regarding your goals. There will be no sales tactics employed or any sales pressure. Our mission is to shorten your path to financial independence and help you attain your goals. Our initial meeting is complimentary.

WHAT DOES THE CFA® DESIGNATION MEAN?

The Chartered Financial Analyst® (CFA®) Program is a professional credential offered by the CFA® Institute to investment and financial professionals. A candidate who successfully completes the program becomes a "CFA® charter holder". The CFA® exams are widely considered to be extremely difficult, with pass rates usually below 50% for all three levels. It covers a broad range of topics relating to investment management, financial analysis, stocks, bonds and derivatives.

WHAT IS A CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™?

The CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ certification is granted by the CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ Board of Standards, Inc. To attain the CFP® certification an individual must complete various college level course studies addressing financial planning areas, attain a bachelor’s degree from a regionally accredited college or university, and pass a comprehensive examination. In addition, an individual must agree to be bound by the CFP® Board’s Standards of Professional Conduct, a set of documents outlining the ethical and practice standards for CFP® professionals.

WHY DO YOU HAVE CPAS ON STAFF?

We believe that tax preparation and planning is vital to a sound financial plan. Most financial advisors overlook tax planning for individuals, particularly when it comes to looking at investments or the client’s overall tax situation. We have over 50 years of experience on our team with three CPAs on staff. One of our CPAs led a Fortune 500 Tax Department and we utilize that experience for our clients.

HOW DO YOU SELECT INVESTMENTS?

We have over 70 years of combined experience in portfolio construction. We have a Chief Investment Officer, a CFA®, and a CFA® candidate all on staff, as well as an investment committee that meets weekly. We have no proprietary products so we are free to choose any investments that have passed our due diligence process and that we believe are appropriate for a particular client. There are thousands of investments to consider and the vetting process is critical. Being a Registered Investment Advisor, we have access to numerous research tools which assist us in our selection process.
