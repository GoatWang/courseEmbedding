2016 Annual Report




2016 Corporate Responsibility Report




Business Principles





Kosmos Energy is a pathfinding oil and gas exploration and production company focused on frontier and emerging areas along the Atlantic Margin. We are oil finders, driven to unlock significant new petroleum systems, and to grow and mature discovered hydrocarbon basins through additional exploration success, as well as development and production.

 

Kosmos is fueled by a passion to explore for substantial quantities of oil and gas. By pursuing a focused and disciplined strategy and utilizing the most advanced technology, our exploration efforts have resulted in significant discoveries and world class developments. Building on our legacy of success, we have established an exploration portfolio with tremendous potential in some of the world’s most prospective hydrocarbon provinces.

 

Initial production at the Jubilee field offshore Ghana commenced in late 2010. Execution of the next development phase at Jubilee is underway, designed to capture additional resources and support high production levels in this long-life field. In addition, we are appraising and developing a number of other oil and gas condensate discoveries offshore Ghana, which will deliver significant reserve and production growth for Kosmos.

 

Kosmos is committed to being a caring corporate citizen wherever we operate – advancing progress, enhancing lives and respecting the environment. We are implementing social responsibility programs, focused on healthcare initiatives and educational enhancement in our areas of operation.

 

Kosmos is building a premier independent exploration and production organization in the industry. To support and further develop our outstanding exploration and development programs, we are looking for dynamic individuals who desire to make significant contributions to our team.

Kosmos Energy's stock tumbles after largest shareholders pare holdings
Shares of Kosmos Energy Ltd.  tumbled 6.5% in premarket trade Tuesday, after the oil and gas exploration company said a large stock offering by its two largest shareholders priced at a discount. The company said late Monday that Blackstone Group , its second-largest shareholder, was selling 30 million shares to the public, and that Warburg Pincus, its largest shareholder, was selling 10 million shares. The secondary offering represents about 10.3% of the total shares outstanding. On Tuesday, Kosmos said the offering priced at $7.25 a share, or 7.5% below Monday's closing price of $7.84. The stock had run up 32% since May 5, after the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter results, to be up 12% year to date through Monday. In comparison, the SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF  has lost 9.8% this year, while the S&P 500  has gained 6.9%.

Kosmos Energy's stock tumbles after largest shareholders pare holdings
Shares of Kosmos Energy Ltd.  tumbled 6.5% in premarket trade Tuesday, after the oil and gas exploration company said a large stock offering by its two largest shareholders priced at a discount. The company said late Monday that Blackstone Group , its second-largest shareholder, was selling 30 million shares to the public, and that Warburg Pincus, its largest shareholder, was selling 10 million shares. The secondary offering represents about 10.3% of the total shares outstanding. On Tuesday, Kosmos said the offering priced at $7.25 a share, or 7.5% below Monday's closing price of $7.84. The stock had run up 32% since May 5, after the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter results, to be up 12% year to date through Monday. In comparison, the SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF  has lost 9.8% this year, while the S&P 500  has gained 6.9%.

Kosmos Energy is an American[3] international oil company founded and based in Dallas, Texas.[4] It also maintains offices in the Bermudas, Morocco, Suriname and Ghana. It has been involved in the discovery and development of the Jubilee oil field off the coast of Ghana.
Kosmos was a focus of the BBC documentary Storyville: Power, Money, Greed and Oil.[5]
From 19 December 2014, the company started a highly controversial oil drilling in the Cap Boujdour area off the coast of Western Sahara. The license is signed with the Moroccan state oil company ONHYM. The UN stated in 2002 that any further oil exploration in Western Sahara would be in violation of international law if it was not in accordance with the wishes of the people of the territory.[6] In an article from February 2015, former UN legal counsel Hans Corell stated that the ongoing exploration activities by Kosmos and Glencore is in violation of the legal opinion he wrote for the UN Security Council.[7]
On March 2, 2015 Kosmos Energy said it drilled dry at its CB-1 exploration well at the Cap Boujdour area.[8] Despite this, the company is planning for a second drill.[9]
On April 28, 2015 Kosmos Energy has made a significant gas discovery at its Tortue-1 development well in Block C-8, offshore Mauritania.[10] The well was drilled to test the Tortue West prospect, which forms part of the Greater Tortue complex. It was drilled to a 4,630m depth, where it encountered 107m of net hydrocarbon pay and a single gas pool in the primary Lower Cenomanian objective.

Kosmos Energy Ltd. Risk Points versus Energy


Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE:KOS)  Risk Points versus Energy (XLE) 
	Date Published:
	
		2017-07-19	




PREFACE

		This is a scatter plot analysis of the critical risk points from the option market for Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE:KOS)  
						compared to its own past and the Energy ETF.		In order to examine the forward looking risk for Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE:KOS)  the next 30-days, we must look to the option market. 
		
		Now, before we dive into the analysis on KOS, we make one critical note since we're talking about options:
		








Option trading isn't about luck -- this four minute video will change your trading life forever:  Option Trading and Truth


		In the "Why This Matters" section at the end of this article on Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE:KOS) , we're going to take a step back and show in great specificity
		that there is actually a lot less "luck" in successful option trading than many people know. 
		
		But that's at the end, now let's jump back into the risk point charting and number crunching for Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE:KOS) . We start by noting that KOS		 is in the oil, gas and consumable fuels sector which means along with some other industries we also compare the company to the closest match we could find, which was
		 the Energy ETF (XLE) as a proxy for Kosmos Energy Ltd..
		 
		 We have highlighted the IV30® for XLE and for KOS in the table below.

		The IV30® is the risk reflected by the option market in the stock price for the next 30 calendar days.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Kosmos Energy is an American[3] international oil company founded and based in Dallas, Texas.[4] It also maintains offices in the Bermudas, Morocco, Suriname and Ghana. It has been involved in the discovery and development of the Jubilee oil field off the coast of Ghana.
Kosmos was a focus of the BBC documentary Storyville: Power, Money, Greed and Oil.[5]
From 19 December 2014, the company started a highly controversial oil drilling in the Cap Boujdour area off the coast of Western Sahara. The license is signed with the Moroccan state oil company ONHYM. The UN stated in 2002 that any further oil exploration in Western Sahara would be in violation of international law if it was not in accordance with the wishes of the people of the territory.[6] In an article from February 2015, former UN legal counsel Hans Corell stated that the ongoing exploration activities by Kosmos and Glencore is in violation of the legal opinion he wrote for the UN Security Council.[7]
On March 2, 2015 Kosmos Energy said it drilled dry at its CB-1 exploration well at the Cap Boujdour area.[8] Despite this, the company is planning for a second drill.[9]
On April 28, 2015 Kosmos Energy has made a significant gas discovery at its Tortue-1 development well in Block C-8, offshore Mauritania.[10] The well was drilled to test the Tortue West prospect, which forms part of the Greater Tortue complex. It was drilled to a 4,630m depth, where it encountered 107m of net hydrocarbon pay and a single gas pool in the primary Lower Cenomanian objective.

Business Principles





Kosmos Energy is a pathfinding oil and gas exploration and production company focused on frontier and emerging areas along the Atlantic Margin. We are oil finders, driven to unlock significant new petroleum systems, and to grow and mature discovered hydrocarbon basins through additional exploration success, as well as development and production.

 

Kosmos is fueled by a passion to explore for substantial quantities of oil and gas. By pursuing a focused and disciplined strategy and utilizing the most advanced technology, our exploration efforts have resulted in significant discoveries and world class developments. Building on our legacy of success, we have established an exploration portfolio with tremendous potential in some of the world’s most prospective hydrocarbon provinces.

 

Initial production at the Jubilee field offshore Ghana commenced in late 2010. Execution of the next development phase at Jubilee is underway, designed to capture additional resources and support high production levels in this long-life field. In addition, we are appraising and developing a number of other oil and gas condensate discoveries offshore Ghana, which will deliver significant reserve and production growth for Kosmos.

 

Kosmos is committed to being a caring corporate citizen wherever we operate – advancing progress, enhancing lives and respecting the environment. We are implementing social responsibility programs, focused on healthcare initiatives and educational enhancement in our areas of operation.

 

Kosmos is building a premier independent exploration and production organization in the industry. To support and further develop our outstanding exploration and development programs, we are looking for dynamic individuals who desire to make significant contributions to our team.

On April 28, 2015 Kosmos Energy has made a significant gas discovery at its Tortue-1 development well in Block C-8, offshore Mauritania.[10] The well was drilled to test the Tortue West prospect, which forms part of the Greater Tortue complex. It was drilled to a 4,630m depth, where it encountered 107m of net hydrocarbon pay and a single gas pool in the primary Lower Cenomanian objective.

Kosmos Energy is an American[3] international oil company founded and based in Dallas, Texas.[4] It also maintains offices in the Bermudas, Morocco, Suriname and Ghana. It has been involved in the discovery and development of the Jubilee oil field off the coast of Ghana.
Kosmos was a focus of the BBC documentary Storyville: Power, Money, Greed and Oil.[5]
From 19 December 2014, the company started a highly controversial oil drilling in the Cap Boujdour area off the coast of Western Sahara. The license is signed with the Moroccan state oil company ONHYM. The UN stated in 2002 that any further oil exploration in Western Sahara would be in violation of international law if it was not in accordance with the wishes of the people of the territory.[6] In an article from February 2015, former UN legal counsel Hans Corell stated that the ongoing exploration activities by Kosmos and Glencore is in violation of the legal opinion he wrote for the UN Security Council.[7]
On March 2, 2015 Kosmos Energy said it drilled dry at its CB-1 exploration well at the Cap Boujdour area.[8] Despite this, the company is planning for a second drill.[9]
On April 28, 2015 Kosmos Energy has made a significant gas discovery at its Tortue-1 development well in Block C-8, offshore Mauritania.[10] The well was drilled to test the Tortue West prospect, which forms part of the Greater Tortue complex. It was drilled to a 4,630m depth, where it encountered 107m of net hydrocarbon pay and a single gas pool in the primary Lower Cenomanian objective.
