Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/21/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

History[edit]
J.L. Turner and Son: 1939–1964[edit]




J.L. Turner and Son in 1939.


Dollar General has its origins in Scottsville, Kentucky from James Luther "J.L." Turner and Cal Turner Jr. James Luther (J.L.) Turner's father died in an accident in 1902 when J.L. was only 11. J.L. had to quit school so he could work the family farm and help provide for his mother and siblings. He never completed his education. J.L. knew his limited education demanded that he become a quick study of the world around him. After two unsuccessful attempts at retailing, J.L. became a traveling dry goods salesman for a Nashville wholesale grocer. J.L. left the sales job after 10 years and settled his family in Scottsville, Kentucky. During the Great Depression, he began buying and liquidating bankrupt general stores. J.L.'s only child, Cal Turner, Sr., accompanied his father to these closeouts at a young age, gaining valuable business knowledge and skills.[4]
In October 1939, J.L. and Cal opened J.L. Turner and Son with an initial investment of $5,000 each. Wholesaling quickly gave way to retailing;– J.L.'s third and final attempt at retailing. The switch to retailing resulted in annual sales above $2 million by the early 1950s. By the mid-1950s Turner had 35 department stores in Kentucky and Tennessee. In 1955 Cal Turner developed his idea of a retail store selling goods for a dollar, based on the Dollar Days promotions held at other department stores, by converting Turner's Department Store in Springfield, Kentucky into the first Dollar General Store.[5] In 1964 J.L. Turner died leaving his son Cal Turner to succeed him.
1968–Present[edit]




The first Dollar General store was established in Springfield, Kentucky in 1955.


The company Cal Turner co-founded went public as Dollar General Corporation in 1968, posting annual sales of more than $40 million and net income in excess of $1.5 million. In 1977, Cal Turner, Jr., who joined the company in 1965 as the third generation Turner, succeeded his father as president of Dollar General. Cal Jr.[6] led the company until his retirement in 2002. Under his leadership, the company grew to more than 6,000 stores and $6 billion in sales. In 1997 a distribution center was established in South Boston, Virginia.[7]
In 2000 Dollar General opens a new corporate headquarters in Goodlettsville, Tennessee. By the end of 2000 sales at Dollar General exceeded $4 billion.[8] The distribution center in Homerville, Georgia was closed in April 2000 and moving operations to a new distribution center in Alachua, Florida.[9] Cal Jr. retired in 2002 and was succeeded by David Perdue in 2003.[10] Dollar General entered the grocery market with the establishment of Dollar General Market in 2003.[11] In 2004 Dollar General expanded to low-cost Asian markets by opening a sourcing office in Hong Kong.[12]




Senator David Perdue succeeded Cal Turner Jr. in 2003 as CEO of Dollar General.


On June 21, 2007 CEO David Perdue announced his resignation leaving David Bere as interim CEO.[13] One month later all shares of Dollar General stock were acquired by private equity investors for $22 per share. An investment group consisting of affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR), GS Capital Partners (an affiliate of Goldman Sachs), Citigroup Private Equity and other co-investors completed an acquisition of Dollar General Corporation for a total enterprise value of $7.3 billion.
As a part of the transition to a privately held company, Dollar General assessed each location at the end of its lease against a model known as "EZ Stores". This assessment included evaluating whether the location had a loading dock, garbage dumpsters, adequate parking, and acceptable profitability. Stores that did not pass this evaluation were relocated or closed. Over 400 stores were closed as part of this initiative.[14]
Dollar General filed on August 20, 2009 for an initial public offering of up to $750 Million turning the company once again into a publicly traded corporation.[15][16] In 2013 Dollar General started selling cigarettes in response to its competitor Family Dollar selling cigarettes in 2012.[17][18] Dollar General's 12th distribution center opened on May 31, 2014 in Bethel, Pennsylvania to serve the northeast and midwest stores.[19] On August 18, 2014, Dollar General lodged a competing bid of $9.7 billion against Dollar Tree for Family Dollar. The bid was rejected on August 20, 2014 by the Family Dollar board, which said it would proceed with the deal with Dollar Tree.[20]
Effective June 3, 2015, Chief Operating Officer Todd Vasos replaced Rick Dreiling as chief executive. Dreiling remained as senior advisor and chairman until his retirement in January 2016.[21] Dollar General's 13th distribution center opened in San Antonio, Texas on June 6, 2016 with a local investment of $100 million and the creation of over 500 jobs.[22] In September 2015, the Janesville City Council, in Wisconsin, approved an agreement to bring a Dollar General distribution center to the town. The center created more than 500 jobs in the area and became the 14th Dollar General distribution center.[23]
On September 15, 2016, Dollar General announced plans to hire 10,000 new employees and open 900 new stores in fiscal 2016 and 1,000 in fiscal 2017. Dollar General had operated 13,000 stores as of August 2016.[24] Dollar Express and all of its 323 locations were acquired by Dollar General in April 2017.[25] In Jackson, Georgia Dollar General will open a 15th distribution center in fall 2017 to serve stores in Georgia and the surrounding state.[26]

Dollar General created its abbreviation, the letters "DG", as a store brand for "inexpensive" household products sold through the Dollar General stores. DG is also the company's NYSE ticker symbol.
In 2010, Dollar General was able to outbid the famous Italian Fashion House Dolce and Gabbana that sells very expensive fashion products under another "DG" label in the acquisition of the "DG" symbol as the Internet address. The domain "DG.com" was purchased in a private sale from EMC Corporation, the successor to the defunct Data General computer manufacturer in June 2010, making Dollar General the 107th large company in the world to own their initials as a 2-letter Internet address. The DG symbol is used by the company for a variety of in-house products called DG Home,[33] DG Baby,[34] DG Health and DG Body.
Dollar General uses the Clover Valley store brand for grocery products.

History[edit]
J.L. Turner and Son: 1939–1964[edit]




J.L. Turner and Son in 1939.


Dollar General has its origins in Scottsville, Kentucky from James Luther "J.L." Turner and Cal Turner Jr. James Luther (J.L.) Turner's father died in an accident in 1902 when J.L. was only 11. J.L. had to quit school so he could work the family farm and help provide for his mother and siblings. He never completed his education. J.L. knew his limited education demanded that he become a quick study of the world around him. After two unsuccessful attempts at retailing, J.L. became a traveling dry goods salesman for a Nashville wholesale grocer. J.L. left the sales job after 10 years and settled his family in Scottsville, Kentucky. During the Great Depression, he began buying and liquidating bankrupt general stores. J.L.'s only child, Cal Turner, Sr., accompanied his father to these closeouts at a young age, gaining valuable business knowledge and skills.[4]
In October 1939, J.L. and Cal opened J.L. Turner and Son with an initial investment of $5,000 each. Wholesaling quickly gave way to retailing;– J.L.'s third and final attempt at retailing. The switch to retailing resulted in annual sales above $2 million by the early 1950s. By the mid-1950s Turner had 35 department stores in Kentucky and Tennessee. In 1955 Cal Turner developed his idea of a retail store selling goods for a dollar, based on the Dollar Days promotions held at other department stores, by converting Turner's Department Store in Springfield, Kentucky into the first Dollar General Store.[5] In 1964 J.L. Turner died leaving his son Cal Turner to succeed him.
1968–Present[edit]




The first Dollar General store was established in Springfield, Kentucky in 1955.


The company Cal Turner co-founded went public as Dollar General Corporation in 1968, posting annual sales of more than $40 million and net income in excess of $1.5 million. In 1977, Cal Turner, Jr., who joined the company in 1965 as the third generation Turner, succeeded his father as president of Dollar General. Cal Jr.[6] led the company until his retirement in 2002. Under his leadership, the company grew to more than 6,000 stores and $6 billion in sales. In 1997 a distribution center was established in South Boston, Virginia.[7]
In 2000 Dollar General opens a new corporate headquarters in Goodlettsville, Tennessee. By the end of 2000 sales at Dollar General exceeded $4 billion.[8] The distribution center in Homerville, Georgia was closed in April 2000 and moving operations to a new distribution center in Alachua, Florida.[9] Cal Jr. retired in 2002 and was succeeded by David Perdue in 2003.[10] Dollar General entered the grocery market with the establishment of Dollar General Market in 2003.[11] In 2004 Dollar General expanded to low-cost Asian markets by opening a sourcing office in Hong Kong.[12]




Senator David Perdue succeeded Cal Turner Jr. in 2003 as CEO of Dollar General.


On June 21, 2007 CEO David Perdue announced his resignation leaving David Bere as interim CEO.[13] One month later all shares of Dollar General stock were acquired by private equity investors for $22 per share. An investment group consisting of affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR), GS Capital Partners (an affiliate of Goldman Sachs), Citigroup Private Equity and other co-investors completed an acquisition of Dollar General Corporation for a total enterprise value of $7.3 billion.
As a part of the transition to a privately held company, Dollar General assessed each location at the end of its lease against a model known as "EZ Stores". This assessment included evaluating whether the location had a loading dock, garbage dumpsters, adequate parking, and acceptable profitability. Stores that did not pass this evaluation were relocated or closed. Over 400 stores were closed as part of this initiative.[14]
Dollar General filed on August 20, 2009 for an initial public offering of up to $750 Million turning the company once again into a publicly traded corporation.[15][16] In 2013 Dollar General started selling cigarettes in response to its competitor Family Dollar selling cigarettes in 2012.[17][18] Dollar General's 12th distribution center opened on May 31, 2014 in Bethel, Pennsylvania to serve the northeast and midwest stores.[19] On August 18, 2014, Dollar General lodged a competing bid of $9.7 billion against Dollar Tree for Family Dollar. The bid was rejected on August 20, 2014 by the Family Dollar board, which said it would proceed with the deal with Dollar Tree.[20]
Effective June 3, 2015, Chief Operating Officer Todd Vasos replaced Rick Dreiling as chief executive. Dreiling remained as senior advisor and chairman until his retirement in January 2016.[21] Dollar General's 13th distribution center opened in San Antonio, Texas on June 6, 2016 with a local investment of $100 million and the creation of over 500 jobs.[22] In September 2015, the Janesville City Council, in Wisconsin, approved an agreement to bring a Dollar General distribution center to the town. The center created more than 500 jobs in the area and became the 14th Dollar General distribution center.[23]
On September 15, 2016, Dollar General announced plans to hire 10,000 new employees and open 900 new stores in fiscal 2016 and 1,000 in fiscal 2017. Dollar General had operated 13,000 stores as of August 2016.[24] Dollar Express and all of its 323 locations were acquired by Dollar General in April 2017.[25] In Jackson, Georgia Dollar General will open a 15th distribution center in fall 2017 to serve stores in Georgia and the surrounding state.[26]

History[edit]
J.L. Turner and Son: 1939–1964[edit]




J.L. Turner and Son in 1939.


Dollar General has its origins in Scottsville, Kentucky from James Luther "J.L." Turner and Cal Turner Jr. James Luther (J.L.) Turner's father died in an accident in 1902 when J.L. was only 11. J.L. had to quit school so he could work the family farm and help provide for his mother and siblings. He never completed his education. J.L. knew his limited education demanded that he become a quick study of the world around him. After two unsuccessful attempts at retailing, J.L. became a traveling dry goods salesman for a Nashville wholesale grocer. J.L. left the sales job after 10 years and settled his family in Scottsville, Kentucky. During the Great Depression, he began buying and liquidating bankrupt general stores. J.L.'s only child, Cal Turner, Sr., accompanied his father to these closeouts at a young age, gaining valuable business knowledge and skills.[4]
In October 1939, J.L. and Cal opened J.L. Turner and Son with an initial investment of $5,000 each. Wholesaling quickly gave way to retailing;– J.L.'s third and final attempt at retailing. The switch to retailing resulted in annual sales above $2 million by the early 1950s. By the mid-1950s Turner had 35 department stores in Kentucky and Tennessee. In 1955 Cal Turner developed his idea of a retail store selling goods for a dollar, based on the Dollar Days promotions held at other department stores, by converting Turner's Department Store in Springfield, Kentucky into the first Dollar General Store.[5] In 1964 J.L. Turner died leaving his son Cal Turner to succeed him.
1968–Present[edit]




The first Dollar General store was established in Springfield, Kentucky in 1955.


The company Cal Turner co-founded went public as Dollar General Corporation in 1968, posting annual sales of more than $40 million and net income in excess of $1.5 million. In 1977, Cal Turner, Jr., who joined the company in 1965 as the third generation Turner, succeeded his father as president of Dollar General. Cal Jr.[6] led the company until his retirement in 2002. Under his leadership, the company grew to more than 6,000 stores and $6 billion in sales. In 1997 a distribution center was established in South Boston, Virginia.[7]
In 2000 Dollar General opens a new corporate headquarters in Goodlettsville, Tennessee. By the end of 2000 sales at Dollar General exceeded $4 billion.[8] The distribution center in Homerville, Georgia was closed in April 2000 and moving operations to a new distribution center in Alachua, Florida.[9] Cal Jr. retired in 2002 and was succeeded by David Perdue in 2003.[10] Dollar General entered the grocery market with the establishment of Dollar General Market in 2003.[11] In 2004 Dollar General expanded to low-cost Asian markets by opening a sourcing office in Hong Kong.[12]




Senator David Perdue succeeded Cal Turner Jr. in 2003 as CEO of Dollar General.


On June 21, 2007 CEO David Perdue announced his resignation leaving David Bere as interim CEO.[13] One month later all shares of Dollar General stock were acquired by private equity investors for $22 per share. An investment group consisting of affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR), GS Capital Partners (an affiliate of Goldman Sachs), Citigroup Private Equity and other co-investors completed an acquisition of Dollar General Corporation for a total enterprise value of $7.3 billion.
As a part of the transition to a privately held company, Dollar General assessed each location at the end of its lease against a model known as "EZ Stores". This assessment included evaluating whether the location had a loading dock, garbage dumpsters, adequate parking, and acceptable profitability. Stores that did not pass this evaluation were relocated or closed. Over 400 stores were closed as part of this initiative.[14]
Dollar General filed on August 20, 2009 for an initial public offering of up to $750 Million turning the company once again into a publicly traded corporation.[15][16] In 2013 Dollar General started selling cigarettes in response to its competitor Family Dollar selling cigarettes in 2012.[17][18] Dollar General's 12th distribution center opened on May 31, 2014 in Bethel, Pennsylvania to serve the northeast and midwest stores.[19] On August 18, 2014, Dollar General lodged a competing bid of $9.7 billion against Dollar Tree for Family Dollar. The bid was rejected on August 20, 2014 by the Family Dollar board, which said it would proceed with the deal with Dollar Tree.[20]
Effective June 3, 2015, Chief Operating Officer Todd Vasos replaced Rick Dreiling as chief executive. Dreiling remained as senior advisor and chairman until his retirement in January 2016.[21] Dollar General's 13th distribution center opened in San Antonio, Texas on June 6, 2016 with a local investment of $100 million and the creation of over 500 jobs.[22] In September 2015, the Janesville City Council, in Wisconsin, approved an agreement to bring a Dollar General distribution center to the town. The center created more than 500 jobs in the area and became the 14th Dollar General distribution center.[23]
On September 15, 2016, Dollar General announced plans to hire 10,000 new employees and open 900 new stores in fiscal 2016 and 1,000 in fiscal 2017. Dollar General had operated 13,000 stores as of August 2016.[24] Dollar Express and all of its 323 locations were acquired by Dollar General in April 2017.[25] In Jackson, Georgia Dollar General will open a 15th distribution center in fall 2017 to serve stores in Georgia and the surrounding state.[26]

Rexall ibuprofen






Dollar General store in Lake City, Florida.


Dollar General created its abbreviation, the letters "DG", as a store brand for "inexpensive" household products sold through the Dollar General stores. DG is also the company's NYSE ticker symbol.
In 2010, Dollar General was able to outbid the famous Italian Fashion House Dolce and Gabbana that sells very expensive fashion products under another "DG" label in the acquisition of the "DG" symbol as the Internet address. The domain "DG.com" was purchased in a private sale from EMC Corporation, the successor to the defunct Data General computer manufacturer in June 2010, making Dollar General the 107th large company in the world to own their initials as a 2-letter Internet address. The DG symbol is used by the company for a variety of in-house products called DG Home,[33] DG Baby,[34] DG Health and DG Body.

History[edit]
J.L. Turner and Son: 1939–1964[edit]




J.L. Turner and Son in 1939.


Dollar General has its origins in Scottsville, Kentucky from James Luther "J.L." Turner and Cal Turner Jr. James Luther (J.L.) Turner's father died in an accident in 1902 when J.L. was only 11. J.L. had to quit school so he could work the family farm and help provide for his mother and siblings. He never completed his education. J.L. knew his limited education demanded that he become a quick study of the world around him. After two unsuccessful attempts at retailing, J.L. became a traveling dry goods salesman for a Nashville wholesale grocer. J.L. left the sales job after 10 years and settled his family in Scottsville, Kentucky. During the Great Depression, he began buying and liquidating bankrupt general stores. J.L.'s only child, Cal Turner, Sr., accompanied his father to these closeouts at a young age, gaining valuable business knowledge and skills.[4]
In October 1939, J.L. and Cal opened J.L. Turner and Son with an initial investment of $5,000 each. Wholesaling quickly gave way to retailing;– J.L.'s third and final attempt at retailing. The switch to retailing resulted in annual sales above $2 million by the early 1950s. By the mid-1950s Turner had 35 department stores in Kentucky and Tennessee. In 1955 Cal Turner developed his idea of a retail store selling goods for a dollar, based on the Dollar Days promotions held at other department stores, by converting Turner's Department Store in Springfield, Kentucky into the first Dollar General Store.[5] In 1964 J.L. Turner died leaving his son Cal Turner to succeed him.
1968–Present[edit]




The first Dollar General store was established in Springfield, Kentucky in 1955.


The company Cal Turner co-founded went public as Dollar General Corporation in 1968, posting annual sales of more than $40 million and net income in excess of $1.5 million. In 1977, Cal Turner, Jr., who joined the company in 1965 as the third generation Turner, succeeded his father as president of Dollar General. Cal Jr.[6] led the company until his retirement in 2002. Under his leadership, the company grew to more than 6,000 stores and $6 billion in sales. In 1997 a distribution center was established in South Boston, Virginia.[7]
In 2000 Dollar General opens a new corporate headquarters in Goodlettsville, Tennessee. By the end of 2000 sales at Dollar General exceeded $4 billion.[8] The distribution center in Homerville, Georgia was closed in April 2000 and moving operations to a new distribution center in Alachua, Florida.[9] Cal Jr. retired in 2002 and was succeeded by David Perdue in 2003.[10] Dollar General entered the grocery market with the establishment of Dollar General Market in 2003.[11] In 2004 Dollar General expanded to low-cost Asian markets by opening a sourcing office in Hong Kong.[12]




Senator David Perdue succeeded Cal Turner Jr. in 2003 as CEO of Dollar General.


On June 21, 2007 CEO David Perdue announced his resignation leaving David Bere as interim CEO.[13] One month later all shares of Dollar General stock were acquired by private equity investors for $22 per share. An investment group consisting of affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR), GS Capital Partners (an affiliate of Goldman Sachs), Citigroup Private Equity and other co-investors completed an acquisition of Dollar General Corporation for a total enterprise value of $7.3 billion.
As a part of the transition to a privately held company, Dollar General assessed each location at the end of its lease against a model known as "EZ Stores". This assessment included evaluating whether the location had a loading dock, garbage dumpsters, adequate parking, and acceptable profitability. Stores that did not pass this evaluation were relocated or closed. Over 400 stores were closed as part of this initiative.[14]
Dollar General filed on August 20, 2009 for an initial public offering of up to $750 Million turning the company once again into a publicly traded corporation.[15][16] In 2013 Dollar General started selling cigarettes in response to its competitor Family Dollar selling cigarettes in 2012.[17][18] Dollar General's 12th distribution center opened on May 31, 2014 in Bethel, Pennsylvania to serve the northeast and midwest stores.[19] On August 18, 2014, Dollar General lodged a competing bid of $9.7 billion against Dollar Tree for Family Dollar. The bid was rejected on August 20, 2014 by the Family Dollar board, which said it would proceed with the deal with Dollar Tree.[20]
Effective June 3, 2015, Chief Operating Officer Todd Vasos replaced Rick Dreiling as chief executive. Dreiling remained as senior advisor and chairman until his retirement in January 2016.[21] Dollar General's 13th distribution center opened in San Antonio, Texas on June 6, 2016 with a local investment of $100 million and the creation of over 500 jobs.[22] In September 2015, the Janesville City Council, in Wisconsin, approved an agreement to bring a Dollar General distribution center to the town. The center created more than 500 jobs in the area and became the 14th Dollar General distribution center.[23]
On September 15, 2016, Dollar General announced plans to hire 10,000 new employees and open 900 new stores in fiscal 2016 and 1,000 in fiscal 2017. Dollar General had operated 13,000 stores as of August 2016.[24] Dollar Express and all of its 323 locations were acquired by Dollar General in April 2017.[25] In Jackson, Georgia Dollar General will open a 15th distribution center in fall 2017 to serve stores in Georgia and the surrounding state.[26]

Dollar General is also active in the Verizon IndyCar Series since 2008, serving as the primary sponsor for owner/driver Sarah Fisher's Sarah Fisher Racing team.[30] In 2010, both Fisher and Graham Rahal drove part-time for the team finishing 9th at the Honda Grand Prix of St. Petersburg. Fisher also led the field at the Peak Antifreeze & Motor Oil Indy 300 at Chicagoland Speedway.

Store brands[edit]




Rexall ibuprofen






Dollar General store in Lake City, Florida.


Dollar General created its abbreviation, the letters "DG", as a store brand for "inexpensive" household products sold through the Dollar General stores. DG is also the company's NYSE ticker symbol.
In 2010, Dollar General was able to outbid the famous Italian Fashion House Dolce and Gabbana that sells very expensive fashion products under another "DG" label in the acquisition of the "DG" symbol as the Internet address. The domain "DG.com" was purchased in a private sale from EMC Corporation, the successor to the defunct Data General computer manufacturer in June 2010, making Dollar General the 107th large company in the world to own their initials as a 2-letter Internet address. The DG symbol is used by the company for a variety of in-house products called DG Home,[33] DG Baby,[34] DG Health and DG Body.
Dollar General uses the Clover Valley store brand for grocery products.

Liggett that gradually became a powerhouse as a pharmaceutical drug store chain.[35] In March 2010 Dollar General became the exclusive retailer for Rexall products. Rexall vitamins and supplements began appearing at Dollar General stores in March and by Fall 2010 a full line of Rexall products was available at Dollar General.[36]

History[edit]
J.L. Turner and Son: 1939–1964[edit]




J.L. Turner and Son in 1939.


Dollar General has its origins in Scottsville, Kentucky from James Luther "J.L." Turner and Cal Turner Jr. James Luther (J.L.) Turner's father died in an accident in 1902 when J.L. was only 11. J.L. had to quit school so he could work the family farm and help provide for his mother and siblings. He never completed his education. J.L. knew his limited education demanded that he become a quick study of the world around him. After two unsuccessful attempts at retailing, J.L. became a traveling dry goods salesman for a Nashville wholesale grocer. J.L. left the sales job after 10 years and settled his family in Scottsville, Kentucky. During the Great Depression, he began buying and liquidating bankrupt general stores. J.L.'s only child, Cal Turner, Sr., accompanied his father to these closeouts at a young age, gaining valuable business knowledge and skills.[4]
In October 1939, J.L. and Cal opened J.L. Turner and Son with an initial investment of $5,000 each. Wholesaling quickly gave way to retailing;– J.L.'s third and final attempt at retailing. The switch to retailing resulted in annual sales above $2 million by the early 1950s. By the mid-1950s Turner had 35 department stores in Kentucky and Tennessee. In 1955 Cal Turner developed his idea of a retail store selling goods for a dollar, based on the Dollar Days promotions held at other department stores, by converting Turner's Department Store in Springfield, Kentucky into the first Dollar General Store.[5] In 1964 J.L. Turner died leaving his son Cal Turner to succeed him.
1968–Present[edit]




The first Dollar General store was established in Springfield, Kentucky in 1955.


The company Cal Turner co-founded went public as Dollar General Corporation in 1968, posting annual sales of more than $40 million and net income in excess of $1.5 million. In 1977, Cal Turner, Jr., who joined the company in 1965 as the third generation Turner, succeeded his father as president of Dollar General. Cal Jr.[6] led the company until his retirement in 2002. Under his leadership, the company grew to more than 6,000 stores and $6 billion in sales. In 1997 a distribution center was established in South Boston, Virginia.[7]
In 2000 Dollar General opens a new corporate headquarters in Goodlettsville, Tennessee. By the end of 2000 sales at Dollar General exceeded $4 billion.[8] The distribution center in Homerville, Georgia was closed in April 2000 and moving operations to a new distribution center in Alachua, Florida.[9] Cal Jr. retired in 2002 and was succeeded by David Perdue in 2003.[10] Dollar General entered the grocery market with the establishment of Dollar General Market in 2003.[11] In 2004 Dollar General expanded to low-cost Asian markets by opening a sourcing office in Hong Kong.[12]




Senator David Perdue succeeded Cal Turner Jr. in 2003 as CEO of Dollar General.


On June 21, 2007 CEO David Perdue announced his resignation leaving David Bere as interim CEO.[13] One month later all shares of Dollar General stock were acquired by private equity investors for $22 per share. An investment group consisting of affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR), GS Capital Partners (an affiliate of Goldman Sachs), Citigroup Private Equity and other co-investors completed an acquisition of Dollar General Corporation for a total enterprise value of $7.3 billion.
As a part of the transition to a privately held company, Dollar General assessed each location at the end of its lease against a model known as "EZ Stores". This assessment included evaluating whether the location had a loading dock, garbage dumpsters, adequate parking, and acceptable profitability. Stores that did not pass this evaluation were relocated or closed. Over 400 stores were closed as part of this initiative.[14]
Dollar General filed on August 20, 2009 for an initial public offering of up to $750 Million turning the company once again into a publicly traded corporation.[15][16] In 2013 Dollar General started selling cigarettes in response to its competitor Family Dollar selling cigarettes in 2012.[17][18] Dollar General's 12th distribution center opened on May 31, 2014 in Bethel, Pennsylvania to serve the northeast and midwest stores.[19] On August 18, 2014, Dollar General lodged a competing bid of $9.7 billion against Dollar Tree for Family Dollar. The bid was rejected on August 20, 2014 by the Family Dollar board, which said it would proceed with the deal with Dollar Tree.[20]
Effective June 3, 2015, Chief Operating Officer Todd Vasos replaced Rick Dreiling as chief executive. Dreiling remained as senior advisor and chairman until his retirement in January 2016.[21] Dollar General's 13th distribution center opened in San Antonio, Texas on June 6, 2016 with a local investment of $100 million and the creation of over 500 jobs.[22] In September 2015, the Janesville City Council, in Wisconsin, approved an agreement to bring a Dollar General distribution center to the town. The center created more than 500 jobs in the area and became the 14th Dollar General distribution center.[23]
On September 15, 2016, Dollar General announced plans to hire 10,000 new employees and open 900 new stores in fiscal 2016 and 1,000 in fiscal 2017. Dollar General had operated 13,000 stores as of August 2016.[24] Dollar Express and all of its 323 locations were acquired by Dollar General in April 2017.[25] In Jackson, Georgia Dollar General will open a 15th distribution center in fall 2017 to serve stores in Georgia and the surrounding state.[26]

Rexall ibuprofen






Dollar General store in Lake City, Florida.


Dollar General created its abbreviation, the letters "DG", as a store brand for "inexpensive" household products sold through the Dollar General stores. DG is also the company's NYSE ticker symbol.
In 2010, Dollar General was able to outbid the famous Italian Fashion House Dolce and Gabbana that sells very expensive fashion products under another "DG" label in the acquisition of the "DG" symbol as the Internet address. The domain "DG.com" was purchased in a private sale from EMC Corporation, the successor to the defunct Data General computer manufacturer in June 2010, making Dollar General the 107th large company in the world to own their initials as a 2-letter Internet address. The DG symbol is used by the company for a variety of in-house products called DG Home,[33] DG Baby,[34] DG Health and DG Body.
Dollar General uses the Clover Valley store brand for grocery products.

History[edit]
J.L. Turner and Son: 1939–1964[edit]




J.L. Turner and Son in 1939.


Dollar General has its origins in Scottsville, Kentucky from James Luther "J.L." Turner and Cal Turner Jr. James Luther (J.L.) Turner's father died in an accident in 1902 when J.L. was only 11. J.L. had to quit school so he could work the family farm and help provide for his mother and siblings. He never completed his education. J.L. knew his limited education demanded that he become a quick study of the world around him. After two unsuccessful attempts at retailing, J.L. became a traveling dry goods salesman for a Nashville wholesale grocer. J.L. left the sales job after 10 years and settled his family in Scottsville, Kentucky. During the Great Depression, he began buying and liquidating bankrupt general stores. J.L.'s only child, Cal Turner, Sr., accompanied his father to these closeouts at a young age, gaining valuable business knowledge and skills.[4]
In October 1939, J.L. and Cal opened J.L. Turner and Son with an initial investment of $5,000 each. Wholesaling quickly gave way to retailing;– J.L.'s third and final attempt at retailing. The switch to retailing resulted in annual sales above $2 million by the early 1950s. By the mid-1950s Turner had 35 department stores in Kentucky and Tennessee. In 1955 Cal Turner developed his idea of a retail store selling goods for a dollar, based on the Dollar Days promotions held at other department stores, by converting Turner's Department Store in Springfield, Kentucky into the first Dollar General Store.[5] In 1964 J.L. Turner died leaving his son Cal Turner to succeed him.
1968–Present[edit]




The first Dollar General store was established in Springfield, Kentucky in 1955.


The company Cal Turner co-founded went public as Dollar General Corporation in 1968, posting annual sales of more than $40 million and net income in excess of $1.5 million. In 1977, Cal Turner, Jr., who joined the company in 1965 as the third generation Turner, succeeded his father as president of Dollar General. Cal Jr.[6] led the company until his retirement in 2002. Under his leadership, the company grew to more than 6,000 stores and $6 billion in sales. In 1997 a distribution center was established in South Boston, Virginia.[7]
In 2000 Dollar General opens a new corporate headquarters in Goodlettsville, Tennessee. By the end of 2000 sales at Dollar General exceeded $4 billion.[8] The distribution center in Homerville, Georgia was closed in April 2000 and moving operations to a new distribution center in Alachua, Florida.[9] Cal Jr. retired in 2002 and was succeeded by David Perdue in 2003.[10] Dollar General entered the grocery market with the establishment of Dollar General Market in 2003.[11] In 2004 Dollar General expanded to low-cost Asian markets by opening a sourcing office in Hong Kong.[12]




Senator David Perdue succeeded Cal Turner Jr. in 2003 as CEO of Dollar General.


On June 21, 2007 CEO David Perdue announced his resignation leaving David Bere as interim CEO.[13] One month later all shares of Dollar General stock were acquired by private equity investors for $22 per share. An investment group consisting of affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR), GS Capital Partners (an affiliate of Goldman Sachs), Citigroup Private Equity and other co-investors completed an acquisition of Dollar General Corporation for a total enterprise value of $7.3 billion.
As a part of the transition to a privately held company, Dollar General assessed each location at the end of its lease against a model known as "EZ Stores". This assessment included evaluating whether the location had a loading dock, garbage dumpsters, adequate parking, and acceptable profitability. Stores that did not pass this evaluation were relocated or closed. Over 400 stores were closed as part of this initiative.[14]
Dollar General filed on August 20, 2009 for an initial public offering of up to $750 Million turning the company once again into a publicly traded corporation.[15][16] In 2013 Dollar General started selling cigarettes in response to its competitor Family Dollar selling cigarettes in 2012.[17][18] Dollar General's 12th distribution center opened on May 31, 2014 in Bethel, Pennsylvania to serve the northeast and midwest stores.[19] On August 18, 2014, Dollar General lodged a competing bid of $9.7 billion against Dollar Tree for Family Dollar. The bid was rejected on August 20, 2014 by the Family Dollar board, which said it would proceed with the deal with Dollar Tree.[20]
Effective June 3, 2015, Chief Operating Officer Todd Vasos replaced Rick Dreiling as chief executive. Dreiling remained as senior advisor and chairman until his retirement in January 2016.[21] Dollar General's 13th distribution center opened in San Antonio, Texas on June 6, 2016 with a local investment of $100 million and the creation of over 500 jobs.[22] In September 2015, the Janesville City Council, in Wisconsin, approved an agreement to bring a Dollar General distribution center to the town. The center created more than 500 jobs in the area and became the 14th Dollar General distribution center.[23]
On September 15, 2016, Dollar General announced plans to hire 10,000 new employees and open 900 new stores in fiscal 2016 and 1,000 in fiscal 2017. Dollar General had operated 13,000 stores as of August 2016.[24] Dollar Express and all of its 323 locations were acquired by Dollar General in April 2017.[25] In Jackson, Georgia Dollar General will open a 15th distribution center in fall 2017 to serve stores in Georgia and the surrounding state.[26]

Dollar General sponsored Brian Vickers in the Nationwide Series in 2013. Dollar General became a primary sponsor for Matt Kenseth in the Sprint Cup Series starting in 2013.[27] Dollar General and Turner (formerly Braun Racing) have been partnered together since 2008, with the team previously sponsoring cars for Frank Cicci Racing and Kevin Harvick Incorporated. In 2010, Dollar General sponsored some races in the Camping World Truck Series for Kyle Busch Motorsports with Kyle Busch in the No. 18 Toyota Tundra and sponsored Kyle Busch's Motorsports No. 51 Toyota Tundra for four races in 2014 with Busch driving three and Erik Jones driving one.[28] Dollar General was the title sponsor for Nationwide Series races held in Charlotte every fall, Chicagoland every summer, and Phoenix in the spring.

Store brands[edit]




Rexall ibuprofen






Dollar General store in Lake City, Florida.


Dollar General created its abbreviation, the letters "DG", as a store brand for "inexpensive" household products sold through the Dollar General stores. DG is also the company's NYSE ticker symbol.
In 2010, Dollar General was able to outbid the famous Italian Fashion House Dolce and Gabbana that sells very expensive fashion products under another "DG" label in the acquisition of the "DG" symbol as the Internet address. The domain "DG.com" was purchased in a private sale from EMC Corporation, the successor to the defunct Data General computer manufacturer in June 2010, making Dollar General the 107th large company in the world to own their initials as a 2-letter Internet address. The DG symbol is used by the company for a variety of in-house products called DG Home,[33] DG Baby,[34] DG Health and DG Body.
Dollar General uses the Clover Valley store brand for grocery products.
Rexall[edit]
The brand name Rexall was first established in 1903 by Louis K. Liggett that gradually became a powerhouse as a pharmaceutical drug store chain.[35] In March 2010 Dollar General became the exclusive retailer for Rexall products. Rexall vitamins and supplements began appearing at Dollar General stores in March and by Fall 2010 a full line of Rexall products was available at Dollar General.[36]
