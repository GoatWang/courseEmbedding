Q&A: David Twardock, Prudential Mortgage Capital Company

			By Alessia Pirolo March 6, 2013 11:00 am












The Mortgage Observer caught up with outgoing PMCC President David Twardock at last month’s Mortgage Bankers Association in San Diego. We covered the up-and-down nature of the business as well as his post-PMCC plans.SEE ALSO: PGIM’s Marcia Diaz Talks Originations and the Evolution of the Life Company
 
David Twardock
The Mortgage Observer: You’re retiring this month after over 30 years with Prudential. Have you spent your entire career there?
David Twardock: No, I had a two-year stint with Otis Elevator Company. I was an elevator salesman. The joke is that I went from one up-and-down business to another.
How did you move to real estate?
I was working on my MBA at the University of Chicago, because I wanted to transition into the real estate business. Prudential came in and interviewed [me] on campus in 1982. I was fortunate enough to get hired, thinking that I was going to work my way into the development side of Prudential. Prudential was one of the biggest real estate developers, if not the biggest, in the country in the early 1980s.
But you didn’t end up in development?
I never got that spot. Prudential had been out of the mortgage business, because interest rates were so high from 1979 until 1984. I spent the first couple of years buying buildings, selling buildings and managing assets. Then, in 1984, they decided they wanted to get back in the commercial mortgage business and they drafted me to be in that business. I was not happy with that. I wanted to be building buildings. I didn’t want to be financing them. It turned out to be the best thing that could have ever happened to me. It was a brand-new organization, nobody had had any experience doing this for five years and it gave me an opportunity to really step into a business area with Prudential’s brand and financial backing and do deals, as a really young guy. I was 27 years old and I was doing major deals in Chicago.
How did you move up within Prudential?
I ran the New York office from 1986 to 1989. Then they asked me to move to corporate headquarters in Newark and I started running about a third of the country for our lending operations. I had always wanted to get back to Chicago, and they sent me back in 1992. But three years later they said, “We need you back in New Jersey, and you’re going to be running a major business.” That was in the mid-’90s, and the first assignment that I had when I got back to New Jersey was to downsize our real estate operation by about 50 percent. It was really difficult.
Was it the most difficult time in your career?
Yes, that was the most difficult. Just because of the impact on people. It was half of the organization. Hundreds of people. But after that, the business sort of re-established itself and I was given the job of running the real estate equity business for Prudential’s on-book portfolio. We had about $5.5 billion of equities. At the time, John Strangfeld—who is now our chairman—was my boss, and we came up with a strategy to significantly reduce those holdings.
Anything particularly creative that you did?
We were one of the original investors in Strategic Hotels, which is now a major hotel company. We took our assets and, together with Goldman Sachs, we formed that company. We sold to Boston Properties some major assets—the Prudential Center in Boston, the Embarcadero Center in San Francisco, two of the sites at Times Square that they ultimately developed. We took back stock positions in Boston Properties as part of that. We sold our industrial portfolio to Meridian Industrial Trust, for a nice sale. We took back stock. Meridian later was merged into ProLogis and we got another nice return on stock after we sold it.
Can you talk about your role as a head of Prudential Mortgage Capital Company?
They brought me in to run PMCC in 1998. At the time, PMCC was an investment division, like a lot of life companies have. We were investing Prudential’s money, and we had the idea of trying to commercialize the business. And so we got capital; we formed a securitization conduit. We bought a company called WMF in 2000, which gave us a Fannie Mae DUS license and FHA and Ginnie Mae license. We consolidated all that and formed a servicing business in Dallas, which was new for us. The net of all that was, through the 2000s, we had more pockets of capital.
What was the difference between Prudential’s CMBS business pre- and post-2007?
We stopped the CMBS business in 2007. We’ve now formed a venture with Perella Weinberg [Partners] called Liberty Island [Group] that does that business, but in a different way. Before 2007, we did everything on our balance sheet. We originated it and we put it on our balance sheet. We hedged and we contributed to a securitization. It was completely a balance sheet-based business. With Perella Weinberg, they provide most of the capital for that venture, and it’s not on our balance sheet. We make a loan that goes on the venture’s balance sheet. We have a small economic stake in the venture, but much smaller, a fraction than what we had before. Our primary role is to be the operating partner for the venture. So we originate, we have the securitization team, we get paid more on fees and on the success of the venture that we do on any balance sheet business. This takes the risk off the table.
What are your plans after retiring?
At the end of March, it will be my last day in the office. I’m going to take six months and enjoy my sailing and my golfing and my outdoor activities, and then I’m not going to take another job, I’m just going to maybe do some board work and advisory work. But I’m going to own my own time, more than I do now.

Prudential’s Transition from Twardock to Durning Has Deep Roots





























Prudential’s Transition from Twardock to Durning Has Deep Roots

David Twardock
Yesterday’s announcement that Prudential Mortgage Capital Co. president David Twardock will retire in April, to be succeeded by David Durning, currently senior managing director and the company’s head of originations, is obviously big news, coming as it does from such a CRE lending powerhouse.
What might not be immediately apparent is how this transition is based in Twardock’s long-time emphasis on developing talent within the Prudential organization. Though neither Twardock nor Durning was available for interviews as of press time, it’s possible to see how the roots of this succession go back more than 20 years.
A profile of Twardock in the November 2010 issue of Commercial Property Executive noted that he saw the company’s then-ongoing expansion of its loan servicing business, especially its special servicing team, as a signal learning opportunity, particularly for more junior staff.
“Special servicing is a great training ground for younger professionals,” he said. Because of the long CRE growth streak, Twardock said, “People can go through half their careers without seeing a problem.” To truly understand the business, he contended, a loan officer has to understand “what this stuff looks like when it goes bad.”
David Durning
At a decisive point in Durning’s early career at Prudential, Twardock’s mentoring played a crucial role. After Durning graduated from Harvard Business School, he joined Pru in 1988 and worked for about 18 months as an investment analyst in Prudential Mortgage Capital’s Boston office.
This initial assignment, however, coincided with a recession, and one day Twardock told Durning privately that Prudential had decided to close the office. Though the flip side was a chance for the younger man to work in loan originations and workouts in Prudential’s New York office, leaving Boston was complicated by the career of Durning’s wife, Catherine, who was practicing law there.
Twardock’s heads-up gave both Durnings to make a smooth professional and geographic transition. “I was greatly appreciative,” Durning said, “because it allowed me to have some control over my life” by making it possible for his wife to get a new job in the New York area.
Once he steps up in April, Durning will have substantial shoes to fill. Despite the recession, Prudential Mortgage Capital under Twardock’s leadership has introduced several new initiatives.
In September 2009, for example, the company formally launched a lending operation in Japan, a contrarian move at a time when many institutional players had recently exited that market.
Tomoyuki Ishikawa, head of Prudential Mortgage Capital’s Tokyo office, noted at the time that the enterprise addressed a significant gap in Japan’s real estate capital markets. By offering long-term, fixed-rate financing to investors, Prudential provided an alternative to the short-term, floating-rate debt more commonly available in Japan.
In April 2010, Prudential Mortgage Capital closed its first loan in Japan, a $46 million financing package for an affiliate of Mitsubishi Corp., secured by five logistics buildings, mostly in Tokyo.
That same month, Prudential launched Agency Gateway, a short-term lending program designed for properties that are not yet eligible for permanent financing from a government-sponsored enterprise. The program was designed to provide loans of $5 million to $25 million to properties that are newly completed or renovated, but have yet to reach stabilized occupancy.
In addition to his MBA from Harvard, Durning has a bachelor’s degree from Middlebury College and holds the Chartered Financial Analyst designation. Before joining Prudential, he was a lending officer at Chemical Bank and a corporate finance associate at Shearson Lehman.
In addition to his role at Prudential Mortgage Capital, Durning is a member of the Prudential Investment Management Investment Committee and serves on the executive board of the National Multifamily Housing Council. He is a former vice chair of the Fannie Mae DUS Advisory Council and is a member of the Urban Land Institute and of the Association for Investment Management and Research.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.
