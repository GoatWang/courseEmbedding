About






















Why We Do What We Do







At Electus Global Education Co., we are an innovative and pioneering organization focused on one central objective – to ensure children transition into financially capable and entrepreneurial adults. We’re achieving this by revolutionizing the way children learn money management, entrepreneurship and life management skills. Our very existence revolves around two words:
Innovate. Transfer.





These two words encompass everything we do, from experiential educational innovation, to knowledge and skills transfer, to apparatus and system design, to business development and user servicing, to quality assurance. These words are the fabric and foundation of our work. We innovate and then transfer that into revolutionary products and services that make a consequential difference to how we educate children.
Our mantra is who we are; we live and breathe it every single day with the sole purpose of improving the lives of children today so they can ensure a better life for themselves and secure their future.
We provide a unique and progressive educational approach and experience for children because we believe that they need to be taught how to think rather than what to think. We believe that within every child lies an inherent potential that needs to be nurtured and cultivated. Providing an engaging way for kids to learn how to learn and behave financially and professionally, and consequently instilling a habit of learning, is the cornerstone of the education that we deliver. We’re preparing children for our rapidly changing world by equipping them with critical thinking skills, practical real-world readiness, valuable knowledge, a global perspective, and an understanding and respect for core values.





A Focused Mission







We see our mission to help kids achieve independence, professional and life success as our obligation. The purpose of our existence is to perpetually incubate, cultivate, and generate future generations of leaders, creators, thinkers, and innovators who can meet the social and economic challenges in the 21st century.
Linked with our commitment to globally providing effective financial and entrepreneurship education to youth around the world, is the vision to foster the inner moral compasses of children. Our ground-breaking hardware and software technology help open kids up to larger issues like community engagement and giving back. This understanding provides balance to children and empowers them to take charge of their choices and actions and guides them through personal and professional challenges.
When they have the education and knowledge, and are empowered to act upon it, kids grow to exhibit independence, capability, and confidence as brilliant young adults. It’s only through effectively educating our children that the future of our world can be impacted and transformed.





Always Looking Forward









In our quest for excellence, we embrace the challenge to remain at the forefront of educational changes, innovations and progress with continues improvements in experiential teaching and learning techniques as well as leading-edge technologies.
Our technologies and processes present an opportunity to broaden horizons and facilitate the building of knowledge, skills and responsible behaviors in an effortless, inspirational, and enjoyable manner. We strongly believe that this creates a new realm in education resulting in fun, meaningful and effective learning. We distinguish ourselves by delivering cutting-edge strategies, innovative techniques and robust real-world practical education to make the learning process fun and measurable, skills easily attainable and positive habits and behaviors permanent.
With your support, we can continuously strive to raise the bar of excellence we mold young minds with sound character traits, wide knowledge, superb skills and clarity of thought with the courage to succeed.
We innovate. We transfer. We are Team Electus.
