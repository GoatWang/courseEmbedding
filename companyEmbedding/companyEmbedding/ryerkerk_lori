					Axalta Partners With SureFlight to Refinish Helicopters for Nicklaus Children’s Hospital




Axalta Coating Systems, a leading global supplier of liquid and powder coatings, partnered with SureFlight premiere aviation completion specialists to refinish two colorful, child-friendly pediatric critical care transport helicopters for Nicklaus Children's Hospital, part of Miami Children’s Health System. 
Axalta and SureFlight spent over 1,000 man hours refinishing the aircraft using Axalta’s Corlar 13550 S, Epoxy Primer, Imron AF700 Basecoat and Imron AF740 Clearcoat brands. Through this project, both companies took great pride in the creativity, expertise and talent they brought to bear on the project. But most importantly, their greatest reward came from knowing who would benefit most from the newly refinished helicopters.
“The care and love the team took in painting the aircraft went above and beyond,” stated Michael Cash, President of Industrial Coatings. “It was great to see both companies join forces to utilize their specialties for a very rewarding and meaningful project.” 
 Kenneth Patino, Program Director for LifeFlight Transfer Center, Trauma and Emergency Services for Nicklaus Children’s Hospital, said, “Our aircraft have never looked better. This recent paint job is simply spectacular.”
Once completed, the helicopters were given the thumbs up by their most important critics- a group of eight children, who proudly stood beside the aircraft for a photo.

					Axalta Celebrates 150 Years in the Coatings Industry




In 2016, Axalta Coating Systems (NYSE: AXTA) celebrates 150 years of creating innovative industrial coatings. Axalta’s heritage dates back to 1866 when its first products were developed in Germany and since then the company has grown into one of the world’s leading manufacturers of liquid and powder coatings.
“All of us at Axalta are excited to reach this important milestone in the history of our company,” explained Axalta Chairman and CEO Charlie Shaver. “Over the next 12 months we will celebrate our past and build on our extensive knowledge and experience for the next 150 years. With nearly 13,000 employees and 120,000 customers in 130 countries, we will continue to use advanced technologies to develop next generation coatings while providing outstanding quality and service in the years ahead.”
From the earliest products that supplied European carriage manufacturers with colorful coatings in the nineteenth century, Axalta evolved to meet the needs of an automotive industry that flourished in the twentieth century. In the 1920s, Axalta introduced the first quick drying multi-color lacquer line for automobile production in the U.S. Company scientists developed the L,a,b color equations that became a key analytic tool in the catalogue of color science. In the subsequent decades, technology at Axalta evolved to produce coatings that were increasingly durable and productive. In the 1980s, the company ushered in the first more environmentally responsible liquid coating systems with the introduction of waterborne products.
Building on experience acquired with its original Spies Hecker® and Standox® products, Axalta branched out to provide refinish technicians with improved coating products and systems. In the 1990s, the Cromax® family of waterborne products was introduced to automotive body shops. Handheld spectrophotometers and VINdicator™ color tools were developed to help provide excellent color matching which saves repair time and reduces waste.
As the needs across many industries evolved, so did Axalta’s portfolio of products. To serve a growing number of industrial customers, Axalta introduced Nap-Gard® powder coatings for oil and gas pipeline manufacturers. Today, both functional coatings and a wide array of decorative Alesta® powder coatings are used in thousands of applications. Voltatex® electrical insulation coatings enhance the productivity of motors and a host of electrical components. Vehicles ranging from heavy duty trucks and buses to trains and other rail stock rely on Imron® to protect their vehicles from the elements while using vibrant colors to build recognition for their brands.

					Graco Introduces Reactor® A-XP1 Plural-Component Sprayer




Graco Inc., a leading manufacturer of fluid handling equipment, today formally released the Reactor A-XP1 plural-component sprayer. This entry-level, high-pressure, air system is best for low to medium output applications and is an excellent value for both residential and commercial use. "Whether you are spraying foam or applying polyurea coatings, we now have an air solution to meet our customers' needs," said Tryg Waterhouse, product marketing manager, Graco Applied Fluid Technologies Division. "Just like our popular Reactor A-25 systems, the A-XP1 is the best choice for affordability."

					Axalta Partners With SureFlight to Refinish Helicopters for Nicklaus Children’s Hospital




Axalta Coating Systems, a leading global supplier of liquid and powder coatings, partnered with SureFlight premiere aviation completion specialists to refinish two colorful, child-friendly pediatric critical care transport helicopters for Nicklaus Children's Hospital, part of Miami Children’s Health System. 
Axalta and SureFlight spent over 1,000 man hours refinishing the aircraft using Axalta’s Corlar 13550 S, Epoxy Primer, Imron AF700 Basecoat and Imron AF740 Clearcoat brands. Through this project, both companies took great pride in the creativity, expertise and talent they brought to bear on the project. But most importantly, their greatest reward came from knowing who would benefit most from the newly refinished helicopters.
“The care and love the team took in painting the aircraft went above and beyond,” stated Michael Cash, President of Industrial Coatings. “It was great to see both companies join forces to utilize their specialties for a very rewarding and meaningful project.” 
 Kenneth Patino, Program Director for LifeFlight Transfer Center, Trauma and Emergency Services for Nicklaus Children’s Hospital, said, “Our aircraft have never looked better. This recent paint job is simply spectacular.”
Once completed, the helicopters were given the thumbs up by their most important critics- a group of eight children, who proudly stood beside the aircraft for a photo.

					Axalta Celebrates 150 Years in the Coatings Industry




In 2016, Axalta Coating Systems (NYSE: AXTA) celebrates 150 years of creating innovative industrial coatings. Axalta’s heritage dates back to 1866 when its first products were developed in Germany and since then the company has grown into one of the world’s leading manufacturers of liquid and powder coatings.
“All of us at Axalta are excited to reach this important milestone in the history of our company,” explained Axalta Chairman and CEO Charlie Shaver. “Over the next 12 months we will celebrate our past and build on our extensive knowledge and experience for the next 150 years. With nearly 13,000 employees and 120,000 customers in 130 countries, we will continue to use advanced technologies to develop next generation coatings while providing outstanding quality and service in the years ahead.”
From the earliest products that supplied European carriage manufacturers with colorful coatings in the nineteenth century, Axalta evolved to meet the needs of an automotive industry that flourished in the twentieth century. In the 1920s, Axalta introduced the first quick drying multi-color lacquer line for automobile production in the U.S. Company scientists developed the L,a,b color equations that became a key analytic tool in the catalogue of color science. In the subsequent decades, technology at Axalta evolved to produce coatings that were increasingly durable and productive. In the 1980s, the company ushered in the first more environmentally responsible liquid coating systems with the introduction of waterborne products.
Building on experience acquired with its original Spies Hecker® and Standox® products, Axalta branched out to provide refinish technicians with improved coating products and systems. In the 1990s, the Cromax® family of waterborne products was introduced to automotive body shops. Handheld spectrophotometers and VINdicator™ color tools were developed to help provide excellent color matching which saves repair time and reduces waste.
As the needs across many industries evolved, so did Axalta’s portfolio of products. To serve a growing number of industrial customers, Axalta introduced Nap-Gard® powder coatings for oil and gas pipeline manufacturers. Today, both functional coatings and a wide array of decorative Alesta® powder coatings are used in thousands of applications. Voltatex® electrical insulation coatings enhance the productivity of motors and a host of electrical components. Vehicles ranging from heavy duty trucks and buses to trains and other rail stock rely on Imron® to protect their vehicles from the elements while using vibrant colors to build recognition for their brands.
“We have been expanding both the global capabilities and global reach of Axalta,” added Shaver. “We have accelerated our investments to expand production capacity in Germany, Brazil, China, Mexico and India. We announced construction of a new Global Innovation Center in Philadelphia, PA and began construction of an Asia-Pacific technology center in China that will keep our technology at the cutting edge. We’ve taken strong regional brands and introduced them globally. All of these measures, plus the many advances we are making in color technology, are focused on meeting the needs of our customers well into the future.”

    Shell’s Lori Ryerkerk honored for trailblazing leadership | Shell United States                                                Skip to main content        Home - Shell in the United States           Search     What are you looking for?

As an honoree in the ‘Women of Influence’ category, Lori was recognized for her high achievements as a leading executive in the oil manufacturing sector, noted for hands-on leadership with a unwavering focus on safety, environmental and social performance. “I’m thrilled to be honored alongside so many other outstanding women in the Energy business,” Lori says. “It is really great to see so many successful women in our business. That’s a very different case from when I started in this industry 32 years ago!” Only in its second year, the leadership awards were launched to celebrate Houston’s stars in energy, particularly those who have overcome challenges to achieve their success. Selection criteria for these leadership awards include career achievement in energy, contribution to company success, community involvement and leadership. Lori received two nominations for this award, one from Shell and another from Burrow Global Services, a local engineering firm.  “Lori shares my passion for “doing it right”, says Mike Burrow, CEO and Chairman of Burrow Global Services, a Houston-based engineering firms. “That means above all, doing it safely but also efficiently and correctly and with respect for the individuals doing the work.” Lori has been a trailblazer in her three-plus decades in the industry. Named the first female GM in the history of ExxonMobil’s Beaumont refinery, Lori has been breaking gender barriers throughout her career— from the early days in the field at a Baton Rouge refinery to more diverse roles overseeing some of the most technically complex operations in the industry. Lori joined Shell in May 2010, serving first as Manufacturing's Regional Vice President, Europe/Africa. In October 2013 she was named Executive Vice President, Manufacturing.                HBJ recognized Lori in the Women of Influence category honoring top leaders of Houston energy companies     “I feel so fortunate to have worked for excellent companies and for and with a large number of people over those 32 years,” notes Lori. “They have truly supported, encouraged and challenged me, and provided a path for me to be able to develop into the person I am today.” With her return back to Houston earlier this year, Lori looks forward to strengthening her public involvement and proudly representing Shell with the Houston business community. She recently joined the Advisory Board for Catalyst Inc., a national nonprofit that advocates for inclusive workplaces for women and will also serve as the senior Shell leader at the James A. Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University. To see Lori’s full profile and learn more about the Houston Business Journal’s Women in Energy Leadership Award.
