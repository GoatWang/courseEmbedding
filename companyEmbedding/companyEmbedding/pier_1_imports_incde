The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death associated with the use of
          thousands of types of consumer products under the agency’s jurisdiction. Deaths, injuries, and property damage from consumer product incidents cost the
          nation more than $1 trillion annually. CPSC is committed to protecting consumers and families from products that pose a fire, electrical, chemical or
          mechanical hazard. CPSC's work to help ensure the safety of consumer products - such as toys, cribs, power tools, cigarette lighters and household
          chemicals -– contributed to a decline in the rate of deaths and injuries associated with consumer products over the past 40 years.
Federal law bars any person from selling products subject to a publicly-announced voluntary recall by a manufacturer or a mandatory recall ordered by the
          Commission.
To report a dangerous product or a product-related injury go online to www.SaferProducts.gov or call CPSC's Hotline at 800-638-2772 or teletypewriter at

	Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.





	On April 3, 2017, Pier 1 Imports, Inc. (the “Company”) announced that Alasdair James will join the Company, effective May 1, 2017, as President and Chief Executive Officer.  Prior to joining the Company, Mr. James, who is 46 years old, was employed by Sears Holdings Corporation as President of Kmart from August 2014 to March 2017. Prior to joining Sears Holdings, he served in various roles at Tesco PLC, a multinational grocery and general merchandise retailer, from June 2007 until August 2013, including Commercial Director - Global Business Unit. From June 2001 to June 2007, he served in various roles at GlaxoSmithKline PLC, a pharmaceutical company, including Global Marketing Director for Future Brands.





	The terms of Mr. James’ employment are set forth in a letter from the Company to Mr. James dated March 28, 2017 (the “Employment Letter”) which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1. The summary of the terms applicable to Mr. James’ employment set forth herein is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Employment Letter. Mr. James will receive an annual base salary of $1,000,000, and will be eligible to earn an annual short-term cash incentive (performance-based) with a target award equal to 100% of his base salary (prorated for the Company’s fiscal year 2018 based on his start date).  He will receive a signing bonus of $300,000 that is repayable to the Company if his employment is terminated for cause or he voluntarily leaves the Company within twelve months.





	Mr. James will be added to the Company’s Board of Directors after his employment commences.  As an employee of the Company, Mr. James will receive no additional compensation for serving as a director and is not expected to serve on any committee of the Board of Directors.





	As an inducement to join the Company, upon the commencement of his employment, Mr. James will receive grants of stock options and shares of restricted stock. The stock options will have a value of approximately $1 million (based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date and Black-Scholes modeling), will have a ten-year term, an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and will vest 25% on the third anniversary of the grant date, 25% on the fourth anniversary of the grant date and 50% on the fifth anniversary of the grant date.





	The restricted stock will consist of two grants.  The first grant of restricted stock will consist of a number of shares having a value of $500,000 on the grant date (based on the 30-day trailing average closing price of Pier 1 Imports common stock) and will cliff vest after three years. The second grant of restricted stock will consist of a number of shares having a value of $2,000,000 on the grant date (based on the 30-day trailing average closing price of Pier 1 Imports common stock) with 25% of the grant being time-based shares and 75% of the grant being performance-based shares.





	The equity awards include “double trigger” provisions that will cause their vesting following a change in control of the Company (as defined) if the equity awards are not assumed or equitably converted by the successor company, or if assumed or equitably converted and Mr. James’ employment is terminated without “cause” or he resigns for “good reason” as defined in the Severance Agreement referred to below within one year of the change in control.





	Mr. James and the Company have entered into an Executive Severance Agreement (the “Severance Agreement”), attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2, providing for certain payments to Mr. James if his employment with the Company is terminated by the Company without Cause or by him for Good Reason (as such terms are defined in the Severance Agreement). In either of such events, he will receive a cash severance payment equal to two times the sum of his then-current base salary plus any annual short-term cash incentive earned for the most recently completed fiscal year.  The severance payment is payable in substantially equal installments over a twenty-four month period following termination of employment as described above. Pursuant to the Severance Agreement, Mr. James will be subject to non-compete and non-solicitation provisions for a period of two years following his termination of employment, and non-disclosure provisions. This summary of the Severance Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Severance Agreement.

	As an executive officer, you will be eligible to receive equity awards pursuant to the Company’s long-term equity incentive program as it may exist from time to time. For fiscal year 2018, the equity awards will consist of a target number of shares of restricted stock valued on the date of grant (based on the 30 day trailing average of the closing price of Pier 1 Imports’ stock) at $2 million, with 25% of the grant being time-based shares and 75% of the grant being performance-based shares. Vesting rates, performance measure(s) and allocation of the performance-based shares among specific performance measures will be determined by the Compensation Committee.


	 


	As an inducement to your employment, you will receive a grant of stock options valued at $1 million (based on the closing price of Pier 1 Imports’ common stock as of the grant date and Black-Scholes modeling).  The stock options will have a ten-year term and an exercise price equal to the closing price of Pier 1 Imports’ common stock on the date of grant.  The stock options will vest 25% after three years, 25% after four years and 50% after five years, subject to your continued employment.


	 


	As further inducement to your employment, you will receive a grant of time-based restricted stock consisting of a number of shares valued on the date of grant (based on a 30 day trailing average of the closing price of Pier 1 Imports’ stock) at $500,000.  The restricted stock will cliff vest 100% after three years, subject to your continued employment.








	2












	 



	These equity awards are subject to (i) the Compensation Committee’s approval, and the grant date of the awards is expected to be the first business date following your employment commencement, and (ii) the terms and conditions of the governing award agreements, which will be sent to you soon after the grant date. Further, these equity awards will be granted either under the Stock Plan or as an employment inducement award under New York Stock Exchange Listing Rules outside of the Stock Plan, but with terms and conditions consistent with the Stock Plan.


	 


	Your equity awards will contain “double trigger” change in control (“CIC”) provisions. In the event of either:


	 



	(i)


	a CIC in which the successor entity will not assume and maintain your outstanding equity awards,

	or




	 



	(ii)


	a CIC in which the successor entity assumes or otherwise equitably converts your outstanding equity awards, and within one year after the CIC, your employment is terminated without “Cause” or by you resigning for “Good Reason” (as defined in the Severance Agreement referenced below),

	then




	 


	all awards with time-based vesting restrictions will become fully vested (and exercisable, if applicable), and all performance-based awards will vest based on target performance and payout on a pro rata basis based on the time elapsed prior to the CIC or termination of employment, as applicable.


	 


	Any future grants of equity awards beyond those described in this section will be based upon your performance and at the sole discretion of the Company.





	 


	 





	Severance:




	You and the Company will enter into an Executive Severance Agreement (the “Severance Agreement”), in a form substantially as attached hereto.  Pursuant to the Severance Agreement, if your employment with the Company is terminated by the Company without Cause or by you for Good Reason (as such terms are defined in the Severance Agreement), you will receive a cash severance equal to two times the sum of your then-current base salary plus any annual short-term cash incentive earned for the most recently completed fiscal year. The severance amount will be payable in equal installments over twenty-four months following the end of your employment.  Pursuant to the Severance Agreement, you will be subject to non-compete and vendor, customer and employee non-solicitation provisions for a period of two years, and non-disclosure provisions following your termination of employment.

	Benefits:




	You will be eligible to participate in savings, retirement, and health and welfare benefit plans and programs that are generally offered to or provided for the executive officers of the Company, including, without limitation, participation in our 401(k) Plan, Stock Purchase Plan and Deferred Compensation Plan

	. Participation in those plans is subject to each plan’s governing documents and satisfaction of required waiting periods, if applicable.

	EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE AGREEMENT





	By this Executive Severance Agreement dated March 30, 2017 (“Agreement”), Pier 1 Imports, Inc. and its affiliates and subsidiaries (herein “Pier 1 Imports”  and/or  “Company”), and Alasdair James (“Executive”), intending to be legally bound, and for good and valuable consideration, agree as follows:









	1.






	Effect of Severance


	.









	(a)

	    

	    


	Severance Benefits


	. If Executive is involuntarily terminated without “Cause” or Executive voluntarily terminates Executive’s employment for “Good Reason” (as such terms are defined in Section 2 below), Executive shall be entitled to the benefits described in subsection (i) and (ii) below (collectively referred to herein as “Severance Benefits”). Executive shall not be entitled to the Severance Benefits if Executive’s employment terminates for any other reason, including due to death or “Disability” (as defined in Section 2 below). Executive shall also not be entitled to Severance Benefits if Executive does not meet all of the other requirements under this Agreement, including under subsection 1(c). The date Executive’s employment terminates for any reason under this Agreement is referred to as the “Date of Termination.”





	(i)

	    

	    


	Continuation of Salary


	.






	(1)


	                


	Pier 1 Imports shall pay Executive cash severance equal to two times Executive’s annual base salary rate in effect as of the Date of Termination plus the amount of Executive’s annual short-term cash incentive earned for the most recent completed fiscal year prior to the Date of Termination. Subject to subsection (a)(i)(2) below, payment of such amount (“Salary Continuation”) shall commence on Executive’s “Separation from Service” (as defined in Section 2 below) and shall be paid in substantially equal installments on each regular salary payroll date for a period of twenty-four  (24) months following the Date of Termination (“Salary Continuation Period”), except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.






	Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Pier 1 Imports obligations under this subsection (a)(i)(1) shall be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis (but not below zero), by the amount, if any, of fees, salary or wages that Executive earns from a subsequent employer (including those arising from self-employment) during the Salary Continuation Period. For avoidance of doubt, Executive shall not be obligated to seek affirmatively or accept an employment, contractor, consulting or other arrangement in order to mitigate Salary Continuation. Further, to the extent Executive does not execute and timely submit the General Release and Waiver (in accordance with subsection 1(c) below) by the deadline specified therein, Salary Continuation payments shall terminate and forever lapse, and Executive shall be required to reimburse Pier 1 Imports for any portion of the Salary Continuation paid during the Salary Continuation Period.












	(2)


	                


	Notwithstanding anything in this subsection (a)(i) to the contrary, if the Salary Continuation payable to Executive in accordance with subsection (a)(i)(1) above during the first six (6) months after Executive’s Separation from Service would exceed the “Section 409A Threshold” and if as of the date of the Separation from Service Executive is a “Specified Employee” (as such terms are defined in Section 2 below), then, payment shall be made to Executive on each regular salary payroll date during the first six (6) months of the Salary Continuation Period until the aggregate amount received equals the Section 409A Threshold. Any portion of the Salary Continuation in excess of the Section 409A Threshold that would otherwise be paid during such first six (6) months, or any portion of the Salary Continuation that is otherwise subject to Section 409A, shall instead be paid to Executive in a lump sum payment on the date that is six (6) months and one (1) day after the date of Executive’s Separation from Service.







	(3)


	                


	All Salary Continuation payments (described under this subsection (a)(i)) will terminate and forever lapse in the event of Executive’s breach of this Agreement (in accordance with Section 12 below), and Executive shall be required to reimburse Pier 1 Imports for any portion of the Salary Continuation paid during the Salary Continuation Period.






	(ii)

	    

	    


	Outplacement


	.





	As of Executive’s Separation from Service, Executive will be immediately eligible for reasonable outplacement services at the expense of Pier 1 Imports. Pier 1 Imports and Executive will mutually agree on which outplacement firm, among current vendors used by Pier 1, will provide these services. Such services will be provided for up to twelve (12) months from the Separation from Service or until employment is obtained, whichever occurs first. Outplacement benefits described in this subsection (a)(ii) will terminate and forever lapse in the event of Executive’s breach of this Agreement (in accordance with Section 12 below).





	(iii)

	    

	    


	Other


	.






	(1)    


	                


	In addition to the foregoing Severance Benefits, a lump sum payment will be made to Executive within ten (10) business days following the Date of Termination in an amount equal to the sum of any base salary and any unused vacation benefits that have accrued through the Date of Termination to the extent allowable pursuant to the Company’s policies and which have not already been paid. No vacation benefits will accrue during the Salary Continuation Period.







	(2)


	                


	Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything herein to the contrary, in the event of Executive’s death during the Salary Continuation Period, any unpaid portion of the Salary Continuation payable in accordance with subsection (a)(i) above shall be paid in a lump sum, within sixty (60) days of death (and no later than such amounts would have been paid absent death), to Executive’s estate.








	2








	(b)

	    

	    


	Impact of Termination on Certain Other Plans/Programs


	.





	(i)    


	Annual Incentive Plan


	.





	Upon Executive’s Date of Termination, Executive’s entitlement to any award under the applicable short-term cash incentive program (“STI”) sponsored by Pier 1 Imports shall be determined in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable STI award letter and governing plan document regarding termination of employment.





	(ii)    


	Long-Term Equity Incentive Program(s)


	.





	Upon Executive’s Date of Termination, Executive’s entitlement to any award granted to Executive under a long-term equity incentive program (“LTI”) sponsored by Pier 1 Imports, including any unvested options, restricted stock or other equity award granted to Executive, shall be determined in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable award agreement and governing plan document regarding termination of employment.






	(c)


	            


	Upon Executive's Date of Termination (whether initiated by Pier 1 Imports or Executive) potentially entitling Executive to Severance Benefits, Executive will execute a binding general release and waiver of claims ("General Release and Waiver") in a form substantially similar to the attached sample. If the General Release and Waiver is not signed within the time specified in the General Release and Waiver or is signed but subsequently revoked, Executive will not continue to receive any Severance Benefits otherwise payable under subsection 1(a) above. Further, Executive shall be obligated to reimburse Pier 1 Imports for any portion of (i) the Salary Continuation paid during the Salary Continuation Period under subsection (1)(a)(i) herein. A sample of this General Release and Waiver is provided as Exhibit A to this Agreement.






	(d)

	    

	    


	Post-Termination Forfeiture of Severance Benefits


	. If Pier 1 Imports determines after Executive’s Date of Termination that Executive engaged in activity during employment with Pier 1 Imports that constituted Cause, Executive shall immediately cease to be eligible for Severance Benefits and shall be required to reimburse Pier 1 Imports for any portion of the Salary Continuation paid to Executive and for the cost of other Severance Benefits received by Executive during the Salary Continuation Period.

	.  During Executive’s employment with Pier 1 Imports and for twenty-four (24) months following the Date of Termination, whether or not Executive receives any Severance Benefits under this Agreement, Executive will not, within the United States, directly or indirectly, engage, either as a principal, management employee, partner, consultant, officer, director or investor (other than a less-than-1% stock interest in a corporation), in a business which is a competitor of the Company. For purposes of this subsection 4(c), a business shall be deemed a “competitor” of the Company if it engages in the commerce of a Specialty Home Fashions or Furniture Business or of an Off-Price Home Fashions or Furniture Business, whether through stores (retail or wholesale), on-line e-commerce or any combination thereof.






	The term “Specialty Home Fashions or Furniture Business” shall mean a business (however organized or conducted, including any on-line e-commerce operations) that operates retailing of conventional or full-markup predominantly of its own branded merchandise consisting of furniture, decorative accessories, housewares, bed and bath, and seasonal goods, or any other category of merchandise sold by the Company during the Executive’s employment, that is manufactured specifically for the business, requires a significant degree of handcraftsmanship and is mostly imported from foreign suppliers.  By way of illustration, a “Specialty Home Fashions or Furniture Business” shall include such businesses as the Company, Restoration Hardware, Inc., Kirkland’s, Inc., Williams-Sonoma, Inc., Pottery Barn, Inc. and Bed, Bath & Beyond, Inc. and stores under the names “World Market,” “Cost Plus,” “Cost Plus World Market,” “Crate & Barrel,” “Home Goods,” “IKEA,” Wayfair,” “Hayneedle,” and “At Home.”

	The term “Off-Price Home Fashions or Furniture Business” shall mean a business (however organized or conducted, including any on-line e-commerce operations) that operates retailing of predominantly branded and/or designer merchandise of third parties consisting of  home fashions and/or furnishings at prices significantly less than or discounted from those of specialty stores and/or department stores.  By way of illustration, an “Off-Price Home Fashions or Furniture Business” shall include such businesses as The TJX Companies, Inc. and Ross Stores, Inc.





	The Company may from time to time prior to, and during the thirty (30) days following, any Date of Termination, by written notice to the Executive, for purposes of clarification, add to the list of illustrative examples of a Specialty Home Fashions or Furniture Business and an Off-Price Home Fashions or Furniture Business set forth in this subsection 4(c) the names of other companies or businesses meeting the definitions of such terms.

	Enforcement of Protective Covenants


	.







	(a)


	            




	Rights and Remedies Upon Breach


	.  The parties specifically acknowledge and agree that the remedy at law for any breach of the restrictions in Section 4 of this Agreement (the “Protective Covenants”) will be inadequate, and that in the event Executive breaches, or threatens to breach, any of the Protective Covenants, Pier 1 Imports shall have the right and remedy, without the necessity of proving actual damage or posting any bond, to enjoin, preliminarily and permanently, Executive from violating or threatening to violate the Protective Covenants and to have the Protective Covenants specifically enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction, it being agreed that any breach or threatened breach of the Protective Covenants would cause irreparable injury to Pier 1 Imports and that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy to Pier 1 Imports.  Executive understands and agrees that if he violates any of the obligations set forth in the Protective Covenants, the period of restriction applicable to each obligation violated shall cease to run during the pendency of any litigation over such violation, provided that such litigation was initiated during the period of effectiveness of the Protective Covenants.  Such rights and remedies shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available to Pier 1 Imports at law or in equity.  Pier 1 Imports’ ability to enforce its rights under the Protective Covenants or applicable law against Executive shall not be impaired in any way by the existence of a claim or cause of action on the part of Executive based on, or arising out of, this Agreement or any other event or transaction.







	(b)


	            




	Severability and Modification of Covenants


	.  Executive acknowledges and agrees that each of the Protective Covenants is reasonable and valid in time and scope and in all other respects.  The parties agree that it is their intention that the Protective Covenants be enforced in accordance with their terms to the maximum extent permitted by law.  Each of the Protective Covenants shall be considered and construed as a separate and independent covenant.  Should any part or provision of any of the Protective Covenants be held invalid, void, or unenforceable, such invalidity, voidness, or unenforceability shall not render invalid, void, or unenforceable any other part or provision of this Agreement or such Protective Covenant.  If any of the provisions of the Protective Covenants should ever be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to exceed the scope permitted by the applicable law, such provision or provisions shall be automatically modified to such lesser scope as such court may deem just and proper for the reasonable protection of Pier 1 Imports’ legitimate business interests and may be enforced by Pier 1 Imports to that extent in the manner described above and all other provisions of this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable.








	9









	6.


	            




	Non-Disparagement


	.  Executive shall not (i) in any way publicly disparage Pier 1 Imports or its affiliates, equity holders, officers, directors, employees or agents, (ii) cause embarrassment or public humiliation to such entities or persons, or (iii) make any public statement that is adverse, inimical or otherwise detrimental to the interests of any such entities or persons.  This Section 6 shall not in any way limit any of Executive’s rights that are expressly reserved in the final sentence of Section 4(a)(i), or in any way limit Executive’s ability to provide truthful testimony or information in response to a subpoena, court or arbitral order, or valid request by a government entity, or as otherwise required by law.







	7.


	            




	Cooperation


	.  Executive agrees, without receiving additional compensation, to fully and completely cooperate with Pier 1 Imports, both during and after his period of employment with Pier 1 Imports (including any Salary Continuation Period), with respect to matters that relate to Executive’s period of employment, in all investigations, potential litigation or litigation in which Pier 1 Imports is involved or may become involved, other than any such investigations, potential litigation or litigation between Pier 1 Imports and Executive.  Pier 1 Imports will reimburse Executive for reasonable travel and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with any such investigations, potential litigation or litigation.







	8.


	            




	Existing Covenants


	.  Executive represents and warrants that his employment with Pier 1 Imports does not and will not breach any agreement that Executive has with any former employer to keep in confidence proprietary or confidential information or not to compete with any such former employer.  Executive will not disclose to Pier 1 Imports or use on its behalf any proprietary or confidential information of any other party required to be kept confidential by Executive.







	9.


	            




	Disclosure of Agreement


	.  Executive acknowledges and agrees that, during the twenty-four (24) months following the Date of Termination, he will disclose the existence and terms of this Agreement to any prospective employer, business partner, investor or lender prior to entering into an employment, partnership or other business relationship with such prospective employer, business partner, investor or lender.  Executive further agrees that Pier 1 Imports shall have the right to make any such prospective employer, business partner, investor or lender of Executive aware of the existence and terms of this Agreement.







	10.


	            




	Employment Status


	.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as a commitment, guarantee, agreement, or understanding of any kind or nature that Pier 1 Imports will continue to employ Executive, nor will this Agreement affect in any way the right of Pier 1 Imports or Executive to terminate Executive’s employment at any time and for any reason, with or without Cause (unless otherwise agreed to by the parties separately in writing).  Executive acknowledges and agrees that he is an “at will” employee.








	10









	11.


	            




	Future Enforcement or Remedy


	. Any waiver, or failure to seek enforcement or remedy for any breach or suspected breach, of any provision of this Agreement by Pier 1 Imports or Executive in any instance shall not be deemed a waiver of any breach or suspected breach of such provision in the future.







	12.


	            




	Breach by Executive


	. In the event of a breach by Executive of any of the provisions of this Agreement, including without limitation the Protective Covenants (Section 4) and the non-disparagement provision (Section 6) of this Agreement, the obligation of Pier 1 Imports to pay Salary Continuation or to provide other Severance Benefits under this Agreement will immediately cease and any Salary Continuation payments already received and the value of any other Severance Benefits already received will be returned by Executive to Pier 1 Imports. The parties agree that if they become involved in legal action regarding an alleged breach of this Agreement by Executive or the enforcement of the Protective Covenants, the prevailing party in such legal action will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy, to recover from the non-prevailing party its or his reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with such legal action.







	13.


	            




	Severability


	. If any provision(s) of this Agreement shall be found invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, in whole or in part, then such provision(s) shall be modified or restricted so as to effectuate as nearly as possible in a valid and enforceable way the provisions hereof, or shall be deemed excised from this Agreement, as the case may require, and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law, as if such provision(s) had been originally incorporated herein as so modified or restricted or as if such provision(s) had not been originally incorporated herein, as the case may be.







	14.


	            




	Governing Law


	. This Agreement will be governed under the internal laws of the state of Texas without regard to principles of conflicts of laws. Executive agrees that the state and federal courts located in the state of Texas shall have exclusive jurisdiction in any action, lawsuit or proceeding based on or arising out of this Agreement, and Executive hereby: (a) submits to the personal jurisdiction of such courts; (b) consents to the service of process in connection with any action, suit, or proceeding against Executive; and (c) waives any other requirement (whether imposed by statute, rule of court, or otherwise) with respect to personal jurisdiction, venue or service of process.







	15.


	            




	Right to Jury


	. Executive agrees to waive any right to a jury trial on any claim contending that this Agreement or the General Release and Waiver is illegal or unenforceable in whole or in part, and Executive agrees to try any claims brought in a court or tribunal without use of a jury or advisory jury. Further, should any claim arising out of Executive’s employment, termination of employment or Salary Continuation Period (if any) be found by a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction to not be released by the General Release and Waiver, Executive agrees to try such claim to the court or tribunal without use of a jury or advisory jury .







	16.


	            




	Other Plans, Programs, Policies and Practices

	This General Release and Waiver does not apply to any claims that may arise after the date I sign this General Release and Waiver.

	Pier 1 Imports Appoints Global Retail and Consumer Brand Executive Alasdair James President and Chief Executive Officer




	FORT WORTH, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 3, 2017--Pier 1 Imports, Inc. (NYSE:PIR) today announced that its Board of Directors has named Alasdair James, 46, as President and Chief Executive Officer, with an effective start date of May 1, 2017. Mr. James will be added to the Company’s Board of Directors after his employment commences.


	“In our search for a new leader to navigate Pier 1 Imports through this challenging and exciting retail environment, our Board sought an innovative, customer-centric and proven leader with a visionary perspective,” said Terry E. London, Chairman of the Board of Pier 1 Imports. “Alasdair comes to us with the strong, consumer-focused background, track record of success and strategic capability we were seeking. We are thrilled to have him join Pier 1 Imports to lead our future success.”


	“With more than 15 years of retail and consumer goods experience in the U.S., U.K. and China, Alasdair has the expertise and global operating skills necessary to drive long-term success for our brand. He is a proven leader in the consumer space, broadly-skilled in sales, marketing, brand management and data analytics, with a track record of implementing consumer-facing initiatives to transform businesses in tough environments while driving operational improvement.”


	“We undertook the kind of thorough and thoughtful search process that our shareholders, customers, business partners and employees deserve. As a result of that process, it became very clear to us that Alasdair is the right person to lead Pier 1 Imports. He has the unanimous support of our Board.”


	Commenting on his appointment, Mr. James, incoming President and CEO, stated, “I am thrilled and honored to lead this great organization and be the steward of a brand as storied as Pier 1 Imports. I look forward to working with such an accomplished executive team who have, over the past five years, successfully transformed the Company to a fully functional omni-channel business.


	The Company’s exceptional brand recognition, loyal customer base and special and deeply-rooted company culture provide a strong platform for future success. I believe there is a significant opportunity in front of us to continue to transform the business and drive growth and shareholder value in today’s quickly evolving retail landscape.”








	Mr. James spent his early career in international marketing and account management in positions of increasing responsibility across the globe, first at PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) and then at GlaxoSmithKline PLC (NYSE:GSK), culminating with the position of Global Marketing Director for Future Brands. In 2007, he joined Tesco PLC (LON:TSCO), one of the world’s largest retailers, where he held several senior executive roles during a period of constant innovation, transformation and reinvention at the company. During his tenure at Tesco, Mr. James served as Commercial Director of the Global Business Unit, as well as Executive Vice President and Commercial Director of Tesco China. Mr. James was most recently with Sears Holdings Corporation (Nasdaq:SHLD), where he served since 2014 as President of Kmart. During his tenure, Mr. James transformed the business into a consumer-focused, digitally-enabled and omni-channel-driven retailer, resulting in substantial growth in digital sales and average customer ticket.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

To start off I would like to say that I will most likely never shop at Pier One again. Our experience started off good, sales lady was very informative and pleasant. We found a love seat we wanted to buy, but they did not have it in stock. We asked if we could buy the floor model but denied. That was fine. We were also interested in a table but were not sure if it would work until we checked at home. We were told they would order one in for us for the next week. (we do not live in kelowna but in Vernon) The next week we picked up our loveseat and wanted to buy the table, but they did not have one. Once again we asked if we could purchase their floor model and were told no. A few days later we ordered by phone the table. So the next week we picked up our table and brought it home...we opened the box and there were two legs missing. We phoned the Kelowna store and were told they would have to be ordered in and it would take two weeks, they also gave us the option to take the two legs from their model or we could even have their floor model??? So why would they not let us buy it in the first place?? We opted to wait for the legs to come in. The manager called back and told us the girl we talked to was mistaken and that the legs would only take a week to come in. So we called the next week and no legs. Talked to another manager and she said she would look into it and she called back to say that they were fedexed and would be in Monday or Tuesday We said we would pick up on Friday... Called Friday and guess what? They do not know if they are in, looks like another week in waiting.
