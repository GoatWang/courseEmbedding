We love to help!Should I form my business as an LLC?Despite being a relatively new option, the limited liability company (LLC) is now one of the most popular business structures among smaller organizations. While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the regulations imposed on other types of companies, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). This means that the personal assets of an LLC's ownership cannot be collected to fulfill the debts of the business. What is involved in forming an LLC?All states require potential LLC owners to file a substantial set of documents, typically called the Articles of Organization, in order to establish their business. We can take care of this process for you, saving you time, effort, and allowing you to focus on developing your business – not filing paperwork. How should I name my LLC?The name you choose for your LLC is an important decision, as it will be how you represent yourself to potential associates and clients. With that in mind, it is advisable that you take some time to craft a name that you will be proud to have representing you and your business.Your name must be unique, and not deceptively similar, to any other trademarked name or business. It is also required that your name not be used to intentionally misrepresent the products or services you offer. For LLCs, nearly all states will also require you to add a signifier of your limited liability status, such as "LLC" or "L.L.C." to the end of your company's name. You may be able to operate under a name other than your formal LLC name by applying for and using a dba. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form an LLC?There is no minimum requirement as to the number of owners (also referred to as members) that an LLC must have. At the federal level, single-member LLCs qualify for pass-through taxation, however this is not always true at the state level.

While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the regulations imposed on other types of companies, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). This means that the personal assets of an LLC's ownership cannot be collected to fulfill the debts of the business. What is involved in forming an LLC?All states require potential LLC owners to file a substantial set of documents, typically called the Articles of Organization, in order to establish their business. We can take care of this process for you, saving you time, effort, and allowing you to focus on developing your business – not filing paperwork. How should I name my LLC?The name you choose for your LLC is an important decision, as it will be how you represent yourself to potential associates and clients. With that in mind, it is advisable that you take some time to craft a name that you will be proud to have representing you and your business.Your name must be unique, and not deceptively similar, to any other trademarked name or business. It is also required that your name not be used to intentionally misrepresent the products or services you offer. For LLCs, nearly all states will also require you to add a signifier of your limited liability status, such as "LLC" or "L.L.C." to the end of your company's name. You may be able to operate under a name other than your formal LLC name by applying for and using a dba. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form an LLC?There is no minimum requirement as to the number of owners (also referred to as members) that an LLC must have. At the federal level, single-member LLCs qualify for pass-through taxation, however this is not always true at the state level.

                    Hospitals can reduce the risk of infection after surgery by making sure they provide
                    care that’s known to get the best results for most patients. Here are some examples:

Giving the recommended antibiotics at the right time before surgery
Stopping the antibiotics within the right timeframe after surgery
Maintaining the patient’s temperature and blood glucose (sugar) at normal levels
Removing catheters that are used to drain the bladder in a timely manner after surgery.


                    Hospitals can also reduce the risk of cardiac problems associated with surgery by:

Making sure that certain prescription drugs are continued in the time before, during,
                        and just after the surgery. This includes drugs used to control heart rhythms and
                        blood pressure.
Giving drugs that prevent blood clots and using other methods such as special stockings
                        that increase circulation in the legs.





                    An acute myocardial infarction (AMI), also called a heart attack, happens when one
                    of the heart’s arteries becomes blocked and the supply of blood and oxygen to part
                    of the heart muscle is slowed or stopped. When the heart muscle doesn’t get the
                    oxygen and nutrients it needs, the affected heart tissue may die. These measures
                    show some of the standards of care provided, if appropriate, for most adults who
                    have had a heart attack.




                    Pneumonia is a serious lung infection that causes difficulty breathing, fever, cough
                    and fatigue. These measures show some of the recommended treatments for pneumonia.
                    Read more information about pneumonia care.




                    Heart Failure is a weakening of the heart's pumping power. With heart failure, your
                    body doesn't get enough oxygen and nutrients to meet its needs. These measures show
                    some of the process of care provided for most adults with heart failure. Read more
                    information about heart failure.




                    Asthma is a chronic lung condition that causes problems getting air in and out of
                    the lungs. Children with asthma may experience wheezing, coughing, chest tightness
                    and trouble breathing.




                    "30-Day Mortality" is when patients die within 30 days of their admission to a hospital.
                    The information that follows shows the death rates for each hospital compared to
                    the U.S. National Rate. The rates take into account how sick patients were before
                    they were admitted to the hospital.




                    "30-Day Readmission" is when patients who have had a recent hospital stay need to
                    go back into a hospital again within 30 days of their discharge. Below, the rates
                    of readmission for each hospital are compared to the U.S. National Rate. The rates
                    take into account how sick patients were before they were admitted to the hospital.
                    Read more information about hospital readmission measures.




                    These measures give you information about hospitals' use of medical imaging tests
                    for outpatients based on the following:

Protecting patients’ safety, such as keeping patients’ exposure to radiation and
                        other risks as low as possible.
Following up properly when screening tests such as mammograms show a possible problem.
Avoiding the risk, stress, and cost of doing imaging tests that patients may not
                        need.


                    The information shown here is limited to medical imaging facilities that are part
                    of a hospital or associated with a hospital. These facilities can be inside or near
                    the hospital, or in a different location. This information only includes medical
                    imaging done on outpatients. Medical imaging tests done for patients who have been
                    admitted to the hospital as inpatients aren’t included.
                

                    These measures are based on Medicare claims data.




                    HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) is a national
                    survey that asks patients about their experiences during a recent hospital stay.
                    Use the results shown here to compare hospitals based on ten important hospital
                    quality topics.




                    Hospital Acquired Conditions are serious conditions that patients may get during
                    an inpatient hospital stay. If hospitals follow proper procedures, patients are
                    less likely to get these conditions. Medicare doesn’t pay for any of these conditions,
                    and patients can’t be billed for them, if they got them while in the hospital. Medicare
                    will only pay for these conditions if patients already had them when they were admitted
                    to the hospital.




                    Serious Complications are based on how often adult patients had certain serious,
                    but potentially preventable complications related to medical or surgical inpatient
                    hospital care.




                    Deaths for Certain Conditions are based on how many patients with these conditions
                    died while they were in the hospital.
