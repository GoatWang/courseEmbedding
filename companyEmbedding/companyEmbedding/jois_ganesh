An MBA's guide to Options, November 22, 2005


By Ganesh V Jois


This review is from: Applied Derivatives: Options, Futures and Swaps (Hardcover)

This is a very well written book from an MBA's perspective. In other words, the emphasis is more on intuition rather than the underlying mathematics of option pricing. The book in fact starts with the Binomial Tree approach to option pricing - a method that is much more intuitive and powerful compared to Black-Scholes. The author walks you through certain arbitrage relationships before developing the binomial tree approach. Black-Scholes is introduced once you have obtained a thorough understanding of the binomial tree approach. There is a decent treatment of Forwards, Futures and Swaps and a very elegant proof for how CAPM weaves into option pricing. I strongly recommend the book to anyone starting out in option pricing. Once you have developed sufficient competence with trees and formulae, you can move to Hull's book which is much more technical but provides robust treatment of exotic options.

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?
