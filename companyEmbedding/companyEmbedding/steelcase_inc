History[edit]




The Steelcase Corporate Development Center near Grand Rapids, Michigan: opened in 1989 at a cost of $111 million, vacated by Steelcase in 2010, sold for $7.5 million in 2014 — and as of 2016, sold to Switch as a datacenter.
42°51′08″N 85°33′37″W﻿ / ﻿42.8523°N 85.5603°W﻿ / 42.8523; -85.5603


Steelcase was founded as the Metal Office Furniture Company in 1912 by Peter M. Wege in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Wege was a veteran of the sheet metal and fireproofing industry and had filed approximately 25 patents prior to starting the company. The Metal Office Furniture Company's first products included fireproof metal safes and four-drawer filing cabinets, which Wege invented and manufactured for the Macey Company.[2]




Victor wastebasket


In 1914, the company received its first product patent for "The Victor," a fireproof steel wastebasket. The Victor gained popularity due to its light weight—achieved through a patented process of bending flat steel at right angles to create boxes—and its ability to prevent fires at a time when smoking was common indoors, particularly in the workplace.[3][4] In 1915, the company began manufacturing and distributing steel desks after designing and producing 200 for Boston's first skyscraper, the Custom House Tower.[3] In 1937, the company collaborated with Frank Lloyd Wright on office furniture for the Johnson Wax Headquarters. The partnership lasted two years and resulted in some of the first modern workstations.[3][5]
The name Steelcase was a result of an advertising campaign to promote metal office furniture over wood and was trademarked in 1921.[6] The company officially changed its name to Steelcase, Inc. in 1954.[4][5]




1977 Series 90001


The company became known as the leader of the furniture industry in the late 1960s due to the volume of its sales.[4][7] Steelcase expanded into new markets during the 1970s, including Asia, Europe, and North Africa.[7] In 1973, the company debuted the Series 9000 furniture line, an office system that became a best seller and the company's flagship brand.[8][9] That same year, the company delivered the largest single furniture shipment to the then-new Sears Tower. The delivery included 43,565 pieces of furniture and furnished 44 floors.[5][7]
During the 1980s and 1990s, Steelcase shifted its approach to designing and creating products in response to changes in the workplace and economy. The company also focused on creativity and internal innovation by working closely with architects and interior designers to develop products as well the company's own workspace in Grand Rapids.[6][8] The company's current headquarters were built in 1983 on 901 44th St. SE in Grand Rapids, Michigan.[5] In 1989, Steelcase opened the pyramid-shaped Steelcase Inc. Corporate Development Center. The center contained ten research laboratories and workspaces meant to encourage interdisciplinary collaboration on product development.[6][8] Steelcase vacated the Pyramid in 2010, and as of 2015 is it still empty.[10] In 1996, Steelcase became the majority stakeholder in design firm IDEO and the firm's CEO, David M. Kelley, became Steelcase's vice president of technical discovery and innovation.[11][12] Steelcase sold its shares back to IDEO's managers starting in 2007.[13]




Multiple 15 desk


In 1996, Steelcase was found at fault in a patent infringement suit brought against them by Haworth, Inc., another furniture company. Steelcase was ordered to pay $211.5 million in damages and interest, thus ending a 17-year dispute with Haworth.[14]
Steelcase became a publicly traded company in 1998 under the symbol SCS.[6] During the 2000s, Steelcase reorganized its workforce and began integrating modern technologies in its products.[15] In 2000, the company opened Steelcase University, a center for ongoing employee development and learning.[16] Steelcase's wood furniture plant in Caledonia, MI earned LEED certification in 2001, becoming the first plant to receive the certification.[17] In 2002, Steelcase partnered with IBM to create BlueSpace, a "smart office" prototype designed using new office technologies.[18] In 2010, Steelcase and IDEO launched new models for higher education classrooms called LearnLabs.[19]
Company overview[edit]
Steelcase is a publicly traded furniture manufacturer headquartered in Grand Rapids, Michigan.[20] It is the largest office furniture manufacturer in the world.[1] The company has approximately 80 locations and 11,000 employees worldwide.[7][21] Its locations include Global Business Centers in Mexico, Malaysia, and Romania that provide support to local Steelcase dealerships and offices; showrooms called WorkLife Centers across the United States, Europe, and Asia, and in Toronto, Mexico City, Sydney, Melbourne, and Dubai; and manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.[7][22]
The company designs and produces furniture, furniture systems, architectural products, textiles, wall surfaces, and ergonomic and technology tools for workspaces, education, and health care.[20][23] Its products are sold online and through approximately 800 dealer locations.[24] The company also offers workplace consulting services.[25]
James Keane has served as CEO and president of the company since March 2014.[15] The company's revenue equaled US$3 billion in 2014, an increase from $2.9 billion in 2013.[21] Steelcase ranked 753 on the Fortune 1000 list in 2014.[20]
Brands[edit]
The three main brands of Steelcase Inc. are Steelcase, Coalesse, and turnstone. The company also has several other brands and subsidiaries, including Designtex, PolyVision, and Steelcase Health and Education.[4]
Steelcase acquired Designtex in 1988. Designtex offers interior textiles and upholstery.[26] The company established its office accessories brand, Details, in 1990.[27] In 1993, the company launched Turnstone, a line of furniture designed for small businesses and home offices.[15] PolyVision was acquired in 2001 and makes light-weight ceramic steel surfaces used for writing, projection, architecture, and interiors.[28] In 2006, Nurture was founded to create products for the health care industry, including furniture and interiors for waiting rooms, offices, and clinics.[29] The brand became Steelcase Health in 2014.[30] Steelcase merged three of its subsidiaries, Brayton International, Metro Furniture and Vecta to form Coalesse in 2008. Coalesse products are meant for what the company calls "live/work” spaces, a result of the frequent overlap of home and office in modern working habits.[31]
Company culture[edit]




The WorkCafe in Steelcase Corporate Headquarters, Grand Rapids, Michigan


In 1985, Steelcase purchased the Meyer May House designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and restored it, opening it to the public in 1987.[32][7] A corporate art program has resulted in a collection including pieces by Pablo Picasso, Andy Warhol and Dale Chihuly.[33][34]
The company employs a research group called WorkSpace Futures to study workplace trends.[35] In 2010, Steelcase underwent a three-year project to update its Grand Rapids headquarters to promote employee productivity and employee well-being, including redesigning a cafeteria into an all-purpose work environment that provides food service and space for meetings, socializing, and independent work.[36][37]
Steelcase's sustainability efforts have included reducing packaging, using regional facilities to reduce shipping distance, cutting greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption, and a goal to reduce its environmental footprint by 25 percent by 2020.[34][38][39] As of 2012, Steelcase had reduced its waste by 80 percent, greenhouse gas emissions by 37 percent and water consumption by 54 percent since 2006.[39] According to the company's WorkFutures group, the company also analyzes its supply chain and materials chemistry to determine product sustainability. As of 2014, the company leads its industry in Cradle to Cradle-certified products.[34] In 2013, Steelcase employees volunteered 6,538 hours and the Steelcase Foundation donated US$5.4 million.[40]
Noteworthy products[edit]




Leap chair






Gesture seating


Steelcase's most noteworthy products include "The Victor" wastebasket, a patented steel fireproof container released in 1914. The Victor became a top seller for the recently founded company and was eventually expanded into a line of products.[4][6] The company released Multiple 15 desks in 1946, which introduced standardized desk sizing and became a universal industry standard.[3][6] Series 9000 was released in 1973 and became Steelcase's most popular line of office systems.[8][9] The Leap chair, introduced in 1999, sold 5,000 units a week during its first year and became the company's most popular release. The ergonomic office chair was designed with eight adjustable areas for users to control, including chair height, armrest positioning, lumbar support, seat depth, and back positioning. The chair was developed over four years, cost $35 million to design, and resulted in 11 academic studies and 23 patents.[41][42] The company released the Gesture chair in 2013, which is designed to support the way workers naturally sit.[42]
Awards[edit]
Steelcase was named among Fortune's most admired Home Equipment and Furnishings companies in 2011, 2012,[43] 2013,[44] and 2014.[45] The company won the Editors' Choice award at the 2014 NeoCon product competition for "Quiet Spaces," a series of workspaces designed for introverts and a collaboration with Susan Cain, author of Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking. In addition, Steelcase's SOTO II Worktools won a Silver Award in the Office Accessories category.[24]

History[edit]




The Steelcase Corporate Development Center near Grand Rapids, Michigan: opened in 1989 at a cost of $111 million, vacated by Steelcase in 2010, sold for $7.5 million in 2014 — and as of 2016, sold to Switch as a datacenter.
42°51′08″N 85°33′37″W﻿ / ﻿42.8523°N 85.5603°W﻿ / 42.8523; -85.5603


Steelcase was founded as the Metal Office Furniture Company in 1912 by Peter M. Wege in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Wege was a veteran of the sheet metal and fireproofing industry and had filed approximately 25 patents prior to starting the company. The Metal Office Furniture Company's first products included fireproof metal safes and four-drawer filing cabinets, which Wege invented and manufactured for the Macey Company.[2]




Victor wastebasket


In 1914, the company received its first product patent for "The Victor," a fireproof steel wastebasket. The Victor gained popularity due to its light weight—achieved through a patented process of bending flat steel at right angles to create boxes—and its ability to prevent fires at a time when smoking was common indoors, particularly in the workplace.[3][4] In 1915, the company began manufacturing and distributing steel desks after designing and producing 200 for Boston's first skyscraper, the Custom House Tower.[3] In 1937, the company collaborated with Frank Lloyd Wright on office furniture for the Johnson Wax Headquarters. The partnership lasted two years and resulted in some of the first modern workstations.[3][5]
The name Steelcase was a result of an advertising campaign to promote metal office furniture over wood and was trademarked in 1921.[6] The company officially changed its name to Steelcase, Inc. in 1954.[4][5]




1977 Series 90001


The company became known as the leader of the furniture industry in the late 1960s due to the volume of its sales.[4][7] Steelcase expanded into new markets during the 1970s, including Asia, Europe, and North Africa.[7] In 1973, the company debuted the Series 9000 furniture line, an office system that became a best seller and the company's flagship brand.[8][9] That same year, the company delivered the largest single furniture shipment to the then-new Sears Tower. The delivery included 43,565 pieces of furniture and furnished 44 floors.[5][7]
During the 1980s and 1990s, Steelcase shifted its approach to designing and creating products in response to changes in the workplace and economy. The company also focused on creativity and internal innovation by working closely with architects and interior designers to develop products as well the company's own workspace in Grand Rapids.[6][8] The company's current headquarters were built in 1983 on 901 44th St. SE in Grand Rapids, Michigan.[5] In 1989, Steelcase opened the pyramid-shaped Steelcase Inc. Corporate Development Center. The center contained ten research laboratories and workspaces meant to encourage interdisciplinary collaboration on product development.[6][8] Steelcase vacated the Pyramid in 2010, and as of 2015 is it still empty.[10] In 1996, Steelcase became the majority stakeholder in design firm IDEO and the firm's CEO, David M. Kelley, became Steelcase's vice president of technical discovery and innovation.[11][12] Steelcase sold its shares back to IDEO's managers starting in 2007.[13]




Multiple 15 desk


In 1996, Steelcase was found at fault in a patent infringement suit brought against them by Haworth, Inc., another furniture company. Steelcase was ordered to pay $211.5 million in damages and interest, thus ending a 17-year dispute with Haworth.[14]
Steelcase became a publicly traded company in 1998 under the symbol SCS.[6] During the 2000s, Steelcase reorganized its workforce and began integrating modern technologies in its products.[15] In 2000, the company opened Steelcase University, a center for ongoing employee development and learning.[16] Steelcase's wood furniture plant in Caledonia, MI earned LEED certification in 2001, becoming the first plant to receive the certification.[17] In 2002, Steelcase partnered with IBM to create BlueSpace, a "smart office" prototype designed using new office technologies.[18] In 2010, Steelcase and IDEO launched new models for higher education classrooms called LearnLabs.[19]
Company overview[edit]
Steelcase is a publicly traded furniture manufacturer headquartered in Grand Rapids, Michigan.[20] It is the largest office furniture manufacturer in the world.[1] The company has approximately 80 locations and 11,000 employees worldwide.[7][21] Its locations include Global Business Centers in Mexico, Malaysia, and Romania that provide support to local Steelcase dealerships and offices; showrooms called WorkLife Centers across the United States, Europe, and Asia, and in Toronto, Mexico City, Sydney, Melbourne, and Dubai; and manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.[7][22]
The company designs and produces furniture, furniture systems, architectural products, textiles, wall surfaces, and ergonomic and technology tools for workspaces, education, and health care.[20][23] Its products are sold online and through approximately 800 dealer locations.[24] The company also offers workplace consulting services.[25]
James Keane has served as CEO and president of the company since March 2014.[15] The company's revenue equaled US$3 billion in 2014, an increase from $2.9 billion in 2013.[21] Steelcase ranked 753 on the Fortune 1000 list in 2014.[20]
Brands[edit]
The three main brands of Steelcase Inc. are Steelcase, Coalesse, and turnstone. The company also has several other brands and subsidiaries, including Designtex, PolyVision, and Steelcase Health and Education.[4]
Steelcase acquired Designtex in 1988. Designtex offers interior textiles and upholstery.[26] The company established its office accessories brand, Details, in 1990.[27] In 1993, the company launched Turnstone, a line of furniture designed for small businesses and home offices.[15] PolyVision was acquired in 2001 and makes light-weight ceramic steel surfaces used for writing, projection, architecture, and interiors.[28] In 2006, Nurture was founded to create products for the health care industry, including furniture and interiors for waiting rooms, offices, and clinics.[29] The brand became Steelcase Health in 2014.[30] Steelcase merged three of its subsidiaries, Brayton International, Metro Furniture and Vecta to form Coalesse in 2008. Coalesse products are meant for what the company calls "live/work” spaces, a result of the frequent overlap of home and office in modern working habits.[31]
Company culture[edit]




The WorkCafe in Steelcase Corporate Headquarters, Grand Rapids, Michigan


In 1985, Steelcase purchased the Meyer May House designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and restored it, opening it to the public in 1987.[32][7] A corporate art program has resulted in a collection including pieces by Pablo Picasso, Andy Warhol and Dale Chihuly.[33][34]
The company employs a research group called WorkSpace Futures to study workplace trends.[35] In 2010, Steelcase underwent a three-year project to update its Grand Rapids headquarters to promote employee productivity and employee well-being, including redesigning a cafeteria into an all-purpose work environment that provides food service and space for meetings, socializing, and independent work.[36][37]
Steelcase's sustainability efforts have included reducing packaging, using regional facilities to reduce shipping distance, cutting greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption, and a goal to reduce its environmental footprint by 25 percent by 2020.[34][38][39] As of 2012, Steelcase had reduced its waste by 80 percent, greenhouse gas emissions by 37 percent and water consumption by 54 percent since 2006.[39] According to the company's WorkFutures group, the company also analyzes its supply chain and materials chemistry to determine product sustainability. As of 2014, the company leads its industry in Cradle to Cradle-certified products.[34] In 2013, Steelcase employees volunteered 6,538 hours and the Steelcase Foundation donated US$5.4 million.[40]
Noteworthy products[edit]




Leap chair






Gesture seating


Steelcase's most noteworthy products include "The Victor" wastebasket, a patented steel fireproof container released in 1914. The Victor became a top seller for the recently founded company and was eventually expanded into a line of products.[4][6] The company released Multiple 15 desks in 1946, which introduced standardized desk sizing and became a universal industry standard.[3][6] Series 9000 was released in 1973 and became Steelcase's most popular line of office systems.[8][9] The Leap chair, introduced in 1999, sold 5,000 units a week during its first year and became the company's most popular release. The ergonomic office chair was designed with eight adjustable areas for users to control, including chair height, armrest positioning, lumbar support, seat depth, and back positioning. The chair was developed over four years, cost $35 million to design, and resulted in 11 academic studies and 23 patents.[41][42] The company released the Gesture chair in 2013, which is designed to support the way workers naturally sit.[42]
Awards[edit]
Steelcase was named among Fortune's most admired Home Equipment and Furnishings companies in 2011, 2012,[43] 2013,[44] and 2014.[45] The company won the Editors' Choice award at the 2014 NeoCon product competition for "Quiet Spaces," a series of workspaces designed for introverts and a collaboration with Susan Cain, author of Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking. In addition, Steelcase's SOTO II Worktools won a Silver Award in the Office Accessories category.[24]

The Victor gained popularity due to its light weight—achieved through a patented process of bending flat steel at right angles to create boxes—and its ability to prevent fires at a time when smoking was common indoors, particularly in the workplace.[3][4] In 1915, the company began manufacturing and distributing steel desks after designing and producing 200 for Boston's first skyscraper, the Custom House Tower.[3] In 1937, the company collaborated with Frank Lloyd Wright on office furniture for the Johnson Wax Headquarters. The partnership lasted two years and resulted in some of the first modern workstations.[3][5]
The name Steelcase was a result of an advertising campaign to promote metal office furniture over wood and was trademarked in 1921.[6] The company officially changed its name to Steelcase, Inc. in 1954.[4][5]




1977 Series 90001


The company became known as the leader of the furniture industry in the late 1960s due to the volume of its sales.[4][7] Steelcase expanded into new markets during the 1970s, including Asia, Europe, and North Africa.[7] In 1973, the company debuted the Series 9000 furniture line, an office system that became a best seller and the company's flagship brand.[8][9] That same year, the company delivered the largest single furniture shipment to the then-new Sears Tower. The delivery included 43,565 pieces of furniture and furnished 44 floors.[5][7]
During the 1980s and 1990s, Steelcase shifted its approach to designing and creating products in response to changes in the workplace and economy. The company also focused on creativity and internal innovation by working closely with architects and interior designers to develop products as well the company's own workspace in Grand Rapids.[6][8] The company's current headquarters were built in 1983 on 901 44th St. SE in Grand Rapids, Michigan.[5] In 1989, Steelcase opened the pyramid-shaped Steelcase Inc. Corporate Development Center. The center contained ten research laboratories and workspaces meant to encourage interdisciplinary collaboration on product development.[6][8] Steelcase vacated the Pyramid in 2010, and as of 2015 is it still empty.[10] In 1996, Steelcase became the majority stakeholder in design firm IDEO and the firm's CEO, David M. Kelley, became Steelcase's vice president of technical discovery and innovation.[11][12] Steelcase sold its shares back to IDEO's managers starting in 2007.[13]

In 1996, Steelcase was found at fault in a patent infringement suit brought against them by Haworth, Inc., another furniture company. Steelcase was ordered to pay $211.5 million in damages and interest, thus ending a 17-year dispute with Haworth.[14]
Steelcase became a publicly traded company in 1998 under the symbol SCS.[6] During the 2000s, Steelcase reorganized its workforce and began integrating modern technologies in its products.[15] In 2000, the company opened Steelcase University, a center for ongoing employee development and learning.[16] Steelcase's wood furniture plant in Caledonia, MI earned LEED certification in 2001, becoming the first plant to receive the certification.[17] In 2002, Steelcase partnered with IBM to create BlueSpace, a "smart office" prototype designed using new office technologies.[18] In 2010, Steelcase and IDEO launched new models for higher education classrooms called LearnLabs.[19]

History[edit]




The Steelcase Corporate Development Center near Grand Rapids, Michigan: opened in 1989 at a cost of $111 million, vacated by Steelcase in 2010, sold for $7.5 million in 2014 — and as of 2016, sold to Switch as a datacenter.
42°51′08″N 85°33′37″W﻿ / ﻿42.8523°N 85.5603°W﻿ / 42.8523; -85.5603


Steelcase was founded as the Metal Office Furniture Company in 1912 by Peter M. Wege in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Wege was a veteran of the sheet metal and fireproofing industry and had filed approximately 25 patents prior to starting the company. The Metal Office Furniture Company's first products included fireproof metal safes and four-drawer filing cabinets, which Wege invented and manufactured for the Macey Company.[2]




Victor wastebasket


In 1914, the company received its first product patent for "The Victor," a fireproof steel wastebasket. The Victor gained popularity due to its light weight—achieved through a patented process of bending flat steel at right angles to create boxes—and its ability to prevent fires at a time when smoking was common indoors, particularly in the workplace.[3][4] In 1915, the company began manufacturing and distributing steel desks after designing and producing 200 for Boston's first skyscraper, the Custom House Tower.[3] In 1937, the company collaborated with Frank Lloyd Wright on office furniture for the Johnson Wax Headquarters. The partnership lasted two years and resulted in some of the first modern workstations.[3][5]
The name Steelcase was a result of an advertising campaign to promote metal office furniture over wood and was trademarked in 1921.[6] The company officially changed its name to Steelcase, Inc. in 1954.[4][5]




1977 Series 90001


The company became known as the leader of the furniture industry in the late 1960s due to the volume of its sales.[4][7] Steelcase expanded into new markets during the 1970s, including Asia, Europe, and North Africa.[7] In 1973, the company debuted the Series 9000 furniture line, an office system that became a best seller and the company's flagship brand.[8][9] That same year, the company delivered the largest single furniture shipment to the then-new Sears Tower. The delivery included 43,565 pieces of furniture and furnished 44 floors.[5][7]
During the 1980s and 1990s, Steelcase shifted its approach to designing and creating products in response to changes in the workplace and economy. The company also focused on creativity and internal innovation by working closely with architects and interior designers to develop products as well the company's own workspace in Grand Rapids.[6][8] The company's current headquarters were built in 1983 on 901 44th St. SE in Grand Rapids, Michigan.[5] In 1989, Steelcase opened the pyramid-shaped Steelcase Inc. Corporate Development Center. The center contained ten research laboratories and workspaces meant to encourage interdisciplinary collaboration on product development.[6][8] Steelcase vacated the Pyramid in 2010, and as of 2015 is it still empty.[10] In 1996, Steelcase became the majority stakeholder in design firm IDEO and the firm's CEO, David M. Kelley, became Steelcase's vice president of technical discovery and innovation.[11][12] Steelcase sold its shares back to IDEO's managers starting in 2007.[13]




Multiple 15 desk


In 1996, Steelcase was found at fault in a patent infringement suit brought against them by Haworth, Inc., another furniture company. Steelcase was ordered to pay $211.5 million in damages and interest, thus ending a 17-year dispute with Haworth.[14]
Steelcase became a publicly traded company in 1998 under the symbol SCS.[6] During the 2000s, Steelcase reorganized its workforce and began integrating modern technologies in its products.[15] In 2000, the company opened Steelcase University, a center for ongoing employee development and learning.[16] Steelcase's wood furniture plant in Caledonia, MI earned LEED certification in 2001, becoming the first plant to receive the certification.[17] In 2002, Steelcase partnered with IBM to create BlueSpace, a "smart office" prototype designed using new office technologies.[18] In 2010, Steelcase and IDEO launched new models for higher education classrooms called LearnLabs.[19]
Company overview[edit]
Steelcase is a publicly traded furniture manufacturer headquartered in Grand Rapids, Michigan.[20] It is the largest office furniture manufacturer in the world.[1] The company has approximately 80 locations and 11,000 employees worldwide.[7][21] Its locations include Global Business Centers in Mexico, Malaysia, and Romania that provide support to local Steelcase dealerships and offices; showrooms called WorkLife Centers across the United States, Europe, and Asia, and in Toronto, Mexico City, Sydney, Melbourne, and Dubai; and manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.[7][22]
The company designs and produces furniture, furniture systems, architectural products, textiles, wall surfaces, and ergonomic and technology tools for workspaces, education, and health care.[20][23] Its products are sold online and through approximately 800 dealer locations.[24] The company also offers workplace consulting services.[25]
James Keane has served as CEO and president of the company since March 2014.[15] The company's revenue equaled US$3 billion in 2014, an increase from $2.9 billion in 2013.[21] Steelcase ranked 753 on the Fortune 1000 list in 2014.[20]
Brands[edit]
The three main brands of Steelcase Inc. are Steelcase, Coalesse, and turnstone. The company also has several other brands and subsidiaries, including Designtex, PolyVision, and Steelcase Health and Education.[4]
Steelcase acquired Designtex in 1988. Designtex offers interior textiles and upholstery.[26] The company established its office accessories brand, Details, in 1990.[27] In 1993, the company launched Turnstone, a line of furniture designed for small businesses and home offices.[15] PolyVision was acquired in 2001 and makes light-weight ceramic steel surfaces used for writing, projection, architecture, and interiors.[28] In 2006, Nurture was founded to create products for the health care industry, including furniture and interiors for waiting rooms, offices, and clinics.[29] The brand became Steelcase Health in 2014.[30] Steelcase merged three of its subsidiaries, Brayton International, Metro Furniture and Vecta to form Coalesse in 2008. Coalesse products are meant for what the company calls "live/work” spaces, a result of the frequent overlap of home and office in modern working habits.[31]
Company culture[edit]




The WorkCafe in Steelcase Corporate Headquarters, Grand Rapids, Michigan


In 1985, Steelcase purchased the Meyer May House designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and restored it, opening it to the public in 1987.[32][7] A corporate art program has resulted in a collection including pieces by Pablo Picasso, Andy Warhol and Dale Chihuly.[33][34]
The company employs a research group called WorkSpace Futures to study workplace trends.[35] In 2010, Steelcase underwent a three-year project to update its Grand Rapids headquarters to promote employee productivity and employee well-being, including redesigning a cafeteria into an all-purpose work environment that provides food service and space for meetings, socializing, and independent work.[36][37]
Steelcase's sustainability efforts have included reducing packaging, using regional facilities to reduce shipping distance, cutting greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption, and a goal to reduce its environmental footprint by 25 percent by 2020.[34][38][39] As of 2012, Steelcase had reduced its waste by 80 percent, greenhouse gas emissions by 37 percent and water consumption by 54 percent since 2006.[39] According to the company's WorkFutures group, the company also analyzes its supply chain and materials chemistry to determine product sustainability. As of 2014, the company leads its industry in Cradle to Cradle-certified products.[34] In 2013, Steelcase employees volunteered 6,538 hours and the Steelcase Foundation donated US$5.4 million.[40]
Noteworthy products[edit]




Leap chair






Gesture seating


Steelcase's most noteworthy products include "The Victor" wastebasket, a patented steel fireproof container released in 1914. The Victor became a top seller for the recently founded company and was eventually expanded into a line of products.[4][6] The company released Multiple 15 desks in 1946, which introduced standardized desk sizing and became a universal industry standard.[3][6] Series 9000 was released in 1973 and became Steelcase's most popular line of office systems.[8][9] The Leap chair, introduced in 1999, sold 5,000 units a week during its first year and became the company's most popular release. The ergonomic office chair was designed with eight adjustable areas for users to control, including chair height, armrest positioning, lumbar support, seat depth, and back positioning. The chair was developed over four years, cost $35 million to design, and resulted in 11 academic studies and 23 patents.[41][42] The company released the Gesture chair in 2013, which is designed to support the way workers naturally sit.[42]
Awards[edit]
Steelcase was named among Fortune's most admired Home Equipment and Furnishings companies in 2011, 2012,[43] 2013,[44] and 2014.[45] The company won the Editors' Choice award at the 2014 NeoCon product competition for "Quiet Spaces," a series of workspaces designed for introverts and a collaboration with Susan Cain, author of Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking. In addition, Steelcase's SOTO II Worktools won a Silver Award in the Office Accessories category.[24]

During the 1980s and 1990s, Steelcase shifted its approach to designing and creating products in response to changes in the workplace and economy. The company also focused on creativity and internal innovation by working closely with architects and interior designers to develop products as well the company's own workspace in Grand Rapids.[6][8] The company's current headquarters were built in 1983 on 901 44th St. SE in Grand Rapids, Michigan.[5] In 1989, Steelcase opened the pyramid-shaped Steelcase Inc. Corporate Development Center. The center contained ten research laboratories and workspaces meant to encourage interdisciplinary collaboration on product development.[6][8] Steelcase vacated the Pyramid in 2010, and as of 2015 is it still empty.[10] In 1996, Steelcase became the majority stakeholder in design firm IDEO and the firm's CEO, David M. Kelley, became Steelcase's vice president of technical discovery and innovation.[11][12] Steelcase sold its shares back to IDEO's managers starting in 2007.[13]




Multiple 15 desk


In 1996, Steelcase was found at fault in a patent infringement suit brought against them by Haworth, Inc., another furniture company. Steelcase was ordered to pay $211.5 million in damages and interest, thus ending a 17-year dispute with Haworth.[14]
Steelcase became a publicly traded company in 1998 under the symbol SCS.[6] During the 2000s, Steelcase reorganized its workforce and began integrating modern technologies in its products.[15] In 2000, the company opened Steelcase University, a center for ongoing employee development and learning.[16] Steelcase's wood furniture plant in Caledonia, MI earned LEED certification in 2001, becoming the first plant to receive the certification.[17] In 2002, Steelcase partnered with IBM to create BlueSpace, a "smart office" prototype designed using new office technologies.[18] In 2010, Steelcase and IDEO launched new models for higher education classrooms called LearnLabs.[19]
Company overview[edit]
Steelcase is a publicly traded furniture manufacturer headquartered in Grand Rapids, Michigan.[20] It is the largest office furniture manufacturer in the world.[1] The company has approximately 80 locations and 11,000 employees worldwide.[7][21] Its locations include Global Business Centers in Mexico, Malaysia, and Romania that provide support to local Steelcase dealerships and offices; showrooms called WorkLife Centers across the United States, Europe, and Asia, and in Toronto, Mexico City, Sydney, Melbourne, and Dubai; and manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.[7][22]
The company designs and produces furniture, furniture systems, architectural products, textiles, wall surfaces, and ergonomic and technology tools for workspaces, education, and health care.[20][23] Its products are sold online and through approximately 800 dealer locations.[24] The company also offers workplace consulting services.[25]
James Keane has served as CEO and president of the company since March 2014.[15] The company's revenue equaled US$3 billion in 2014, an increase from $2.9 billion in 2013.[21] Steelcase ranked 753 on the Fortune 1000 list in 2014.[20]
Brands[edit]
The three main brands of Steelcase Inc. are Steelcase, Coalesse, and turnstone. The company also has several other brands and subsidiaries, including Designtex, PolyVision, and Steelcase Health and Education.[4]
Steelcase acquired Designtex in 1988. Designtex offers interior textiles and upholstery.[26] The company established its office accessories brand, Details, in 1990.[27] In 1993, the company launched Turnstone, a line of furniture designed for small businesses and home offices.[15] PolyVision was acquired in 2001 and makes light-weight ceramic steel surfaces used for writing, projection, architecture, and interiors.[28] In 2006, Nurture was founded to create products for the health care industry, including furniture and interiors for waiting rooms, offices, and clinics.[29] The brand became Steelcase Health in 2014.[30] Steelcase merged three of its subsidiaries, Brayton International, Metro Furniture and Vecta to form Coalesse in 2008. Coalesse products are meant for what the company calls "live/work” spaces, a result of the frequent overlap of home and office in modern working habits.[31]
Company culture[edit]




The WorkCafe in Steelcase Corporate Headquarters, Grand Rapids, Michigan


In 1985, Steelcase purchased the Meyer May House designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and restored it, opening it to the public in 1987.[32][7] A corporate art program has resulted in a collection including pieces by Pablo Picasso, Andy Warhol and Dale Chihuly.[33][34]
The company employs a research group called WorkSpace Futures to study workplace trends.[35] In 2010, Steelcase underwent a three-year project to update its Grand Rapids headquarters to promote employee productivity and employee well-being, including redesigning a cafeteria into an all-purpose work environment that provides food service and space for meetings, socializing, and independent work.[36][37]
Steelcase's sustainability efforts have included reducing packaging, using regional facilities to reduce shipping distance, cutting greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption, and a goal to reduce its environmental footprint by 25 percent by 2020.[34][38][39] As of 2012, Steelcase had reduced its waste by 80 percent, greenhouse gas emissions by 37 percent and water consumption by 54 percent since 2006.[39] According to the company's WorkFutures group, the company also analyzes its supply chain and materials chemistry to determine product sustainability. As of 2014, the company leads its industry in Cradle to Cradle-certified products.[34] In 2013, Steelcase employees volunteered 6,538 hours and the Steelcase Foundation donated US$5.4 million.[40]
Noteworthy products[edit]




Leap chair






Gesture seating


Steelcase's most noteworthy products include "The Victor" wastebasket, a patented steel fireproof container released in 1914. The Victor became a top seller for the recently founded company and was eventually expanded into a line of products.[4][6] The company released Multiple 15 desks in 1946, which introduced standardized desk sizing and became a universal industry standard.[3][6] Series 9000 was released in 1973 and became Steelcase's most popular line of office systems.[8][9] The Leap chair, introduced in 1999, sold 5,000 units a week during its first year and became the company's most popular release. The ergonomic office chair was designed with eight adjustable areas for users to control, including chair height, armrest positioning, lumbar support, seat depth, and back positioning. The chair was developed over four years, cost $35 million to design, and resulted in 11 academic studies and 23 patents.[41][42] The company released the Gesture chair in 2013, which is designed to support the way workers naturally sit.[42]
Awards[edit]
Steelcase was named among Fortune's most admired Home Equipment and Furnishings companies in 2011, 2012,[43] 2013,[44] and 2014.[45] The company won the Editors' Choice award at the 2014 NeoCon product competition for "Quiet Spaces," a series of workspaces designed for introverts and a collaboration with Susan Cain, author of Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking. In addition, Steelcase's SOTO II Worktools won a Silver Award in the Office Accessories category.[24]

Steelcase Health Prescribes New Products for the Healthcare Industry







Steelcase Health Prescribes New Products for the Healthcare Industry
Chicago – June 14, 2010 – Facing an aging population, rising demand for services and increased cost pressures, healthcare providers are always looking for new prescriptions for the healthcare environment. Steelcase Health focuses on healthcare environments and how products within these environments can help make them more comfortable, efficient and conducive to the healing process. At NeoCon 2010, Steelcase Health will introduce its largest new product offering ever.
Over the past six years, members of the Steelcase Health team have conducted observational research at leading health facilities like Ascension Health, Intermountain Healthcare, Kaiser Permanente, Massachusetts General Hospital, Mayo Clinic and other top Integrated Delivery Networks (IDNs) and providers to evaluate a wide variety of interactions in numerous healthcare environments – especially how patients receive care and how caregivers perform their duties.
“People develop routines sub-consciously and if a piece of furniture, equipment or process is uncomfortable or doesn’t work just the right way, they adapt and create workarounds,” said Alan Rheault, Director of Design at Steelcase Health. “Observing people in clinics and hospitals gives us the opportunity to see these adaptations and how people actually work and interact with their surroundings.”
“That’s why something as simple as adding a foot ring to a table or making the same table with a softer, more inviting shape can make a big difference in how people work.”
Steelcase Health products focus on three key groups: patients, caregivers and partners in care. Each group has distinct needs within the healthcare environment and Steelcase Health meets these needs with creative solutions inspired by the unique interactions between these different groups and their work environment.
Steelcase Health will be launching a record number of products at this year’s NeoCon, including an innovative line of mobile workstations, a beautiful family of healthcare seating and a comprehensive casegoods line. The company will also introduce enhancements to a number of existing Steelcase Health products. Here’s a detailed overview of two key product launches featured in the new Steelcase Health showroom at NeoCon 2010.
Pocket (designed in collaboration with Modo)
Pocket is Steelcase Health’s new family of mobile workstations, designed to support the active work of healthcare professionals by accommodating both the demands of the task at hand as well as supportive technology. Pocket focuses on three key design principles:
1. Less is more

A small footprint to fit into the real world of healthcare
Only the most essential features — creating low cost and high value
Zero noise (really) and less effort to roll with the best wheels in the industry

2. Accommodate changing technology

Pocket easily handles a wide variety of technology — lap tops, tablets, monitors, CPU’s, all-in-ones — even pen & paper

3. People do things differently… let them

Moveable magnetic accessories allow for quick user configuration
Flexibility – non-prescribed surfaces and light storage ready to be transformed to the work process of the user
Healthcare work happens anywhere and everywhere today. Healthcare professionals ARE mobile workers.

Technology such as the Electronic Medical Record (EMR), has emerged as a critical element of virtually every healthcare function, but technology hardware and software are changing rapidly. To support healthcare work — both the technology and how it is supported needs to be “in motion.”
Pocket mobile workstations provide an opportunity to bring together work and the use of technology as a tool: to communicate with a patient, to collaborate with coworkers or to perform personal, focused work.
The statement of line for Pocket includes easy-to-roll workstations that provide: a clean mobile work surface at a fixed standup height, simple support for technology (i.e. a laptop computer), light storage for small medical supplies and an integrated solution for a small CPU with an attached adjustable monitor. Pocket also offers height adjustable models in combination with each of these features to allow even more personalization of the mobile surface.
Key Pocket innovations include:

Elimination of noise during movement (the number one complaint of patient stays)
“Design” first solution – in which design truly meant the elimination of what was not important or critically essential
The ability to personalize work process per workstation, per individual, with moveable magnetic accessories
Adaptable to a wide variety of technology solutions, including just pen and paper
Variety of configurations to meet multiple needs and budgets
Simple, intuitive cable management
Surface finishes, no seams, and construction truly tough enough to take on the cleaning requirements of stringent infection control standards

“Pocket is small, unobtrusive and easy to configure, said Rheault. “It can support laptops, PC’s, tablets and PDA’s. Pocket can be used in a patient room, an exam room, an emergency room or any part of a hospital or clinic. Pocket changes when technology changes and Pocket changes when procedures change. This is exactly the type of product that will make managers with tight budgets very happy.”
Tava
Steelcase Health’s Tava offers a smart, beautiful collection of seating and more, with a statement of line that includes: guest chairs, lounge seating, benches, tables, and complimentary casegood products designed for healthcare environments.
The solutions were driven by observation-based insights, specifically identifying the need for beautiful design with appropriate function, promoting soothing atmospheres and bringing hospitality elements into healthcare spaces helping to reduce stress.
With a high level of fit and finish, Tava features an expressed use of mitered ash wood, carefully designed from all sides and angles. Clean lines with a comfortable and robust construction, the entire collection meets the functional rigors of today’s 24/7 healthcare environment with a refined transitional style.
Tava considers a wide range of requirements in healthcare spaces to meet the needs of a variety of waiting areas: the user’s size, posture, and duration of visit can vary as much as the space itself can fluctuate from a waiting room to hallway, or lobby to patient area.
The breadth of the Tava seating, table, and casegood offerings work together to support these diverse needs.
Tava provides a full range of seating solutions: benches for short term seating, lounge solutions for a comfortable long term stay and guest chairs for everything in between. A highback chair, glider, simple recliner, sleeper sofa, and bariatric versions allow Tava seating to play from the front lobby to the patient room.
Comfort is also a key focus. Springs are used to create a supportive sit for the user and prevent fabric from “puddling” in the seat area due to intense use. The broad arm caps on Tava have been designed to provide a firm structure to assist users when getting in and out of the chairs. All seating solutions feature a crumb sweep.
Waiting is so much more than just sitting, therefore the Tava tables and casegoods are designed to visually complement the seating line while supporting the needs of “active waiting.”
Dressers and wardrobes provide personal storage, a sideboard and buffet with optional sink, bring elements of hospitality to healthcare. Planters make a space feel like home while helping furniture arrangements turn corners in a functional way. The media credenza supports entertainment and tables provide a place for a drink or a magazine. Optional power integration into table and dresser tops provides a place to plug in personal entertainment or work devices.
Tava features a transitional design, allowing different surface material selections to drive the aesthetic from traditional to a more contemporary style. This visual flexibility and the breadth of the Tava statement of line helps this family coordinate with a variety of design schemes and building layouts.
Tava’s seat is comprised of a spring construction which helps to keep its shape and prevent fabrics from puddling from intense use. This feature provides the capability for Tava to accommodate a large variety of COM fabrics, specifically the highly cleanable fabrics which are required (but challenging to upholster) for healthcare environments.
Tava is designed to be beautiful from all sides and angles, with interesting play between the robust visual of the seat and back and the elegant angled ash wood legs.
Since Tava is intentionally designed to be viewed from all sides, any configuration of the product is possible. Seating, benches, and tables can be arranged to support conversations. Lounges can be clustered around a media credenza to create a gathering place with a focal point. Individual products become elements of a greater aesthetic arrangement in the environment.
All materials contribute to the refined aesthetic of Tava. Solid surface materials or powder coated steel create structure for benches, tables, and casegoods — creating a seamless solution.
The key aesthetic element that links the collection together is the legs. The entire product offering features mitered ash wood, the grain line of the ash enhancing the angular lines of the overall design, and floating the products off the ground in way that lightens the scale compared to typical products in the market.
Specific attention was given to the areas of material change, from fabric to powder coated steel to ash wood to solid surface — each material type featured in the Tava offering contributes to the shared design language across the product types.
All of these individual design elements are executed with a heightened attention to detail, working together to create a beautiful solution not typically expected for healthcare.

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death associated with the use of
          thousands of types of consumer products under the agency’s jurisdiction. Deaths, injuries, and property damage from consumer product incidents cost the
          nation more than $1 trillion annually. CPSC is committed to protecting consumers and families from products that pose a fire, electrical, chemical or
          mechanical hazard. CPSC's work to help ensure the safety of consumer products - such as toys, cribs, power tools, cigarette lighters and household
          chemicals -– contributed to a decline in the rate of deaths and injuries associated with consumer products over the past 40 years.
Federal law bars any person from selling products subject to a publicly-announced voluntary recall by a manufacturer or a mandatory recall ordered by the
          Commission.
To report a dangerous product or a product-related injury go online to www.SaferProducts.gov or call CPSC's Hotline at 800-638-2772 or teletypewriter at
          301-595-7054 for the hearing impaired. Consumers can obtain news release and recall information at www.cpsc.gov, on Twitter @USCPSC or by subscribing

Bear of the Day: Steelcase Inc. (SCS)


July 05, 2017, 07:01:00 AM EDT
By Brian Hamilton, Zacks.com

When a management team decides to invest in product development and sale and marketing initiatives it is intended to help overall revenues in the future, but this long term vision at times mutes near term earnings.  This is the situation facing our Zacks Bear of the Day, Steelcase Inc. ( SCS ).  
 This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company is a designer and manufacturer of products used to create high-performance work environments. Its product portfolio includes furniture systems, seating, storage, desks, casegoods, interior architectural products, technology products and related products and services. The company reports two geographic furniture segments: North America and International.Recent Earnings Results
 Management posted Q1 18 earnings on June 21 where they missed both the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates.  In their America's segment, they saw year over year changes in revenues -2.8%, orders -3%, and SG&A as a percentage of sales increased from +24.7% to +26.2%. Management cited "increased investment in product development and sales & marketing" as the cause of the increased costs.  In their EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) segment year over year revenues dropped by -9.7%, and posted a normalized operating loss of -$8.6 million.  Management's Take
 According to Jim Keane, president and CEO, " Our industry is changing as customers begin to adopt dramatically different spaces that support new ways of working," said Jim Keane.  "We expect to increase our investments in new products and partnerships relevant to their emerging needs.  These investments are intended to help us broaden our addressable market and create new growth opportunities for the future.  The success of the products we launched in recent years, and the awards and other recognition we earned at the Neocon trade show give us confidence that customers and influencers agree we are on the right track ."Price and Earnings Consensus Graph
 Due to the poor earnings report, not so strong guidance, and increased expenses the stock price and future earnings estimates have both declined.Steelcase Inc. Price and ConsensusSteelcase Inc. Price and Consensus | Steelcase Inc. QuoteDeclining Earnings Estimates
 After the disappointing Q1 results, earnings estimates for Q2 18, Q3 18, FY 18 and FY 19 all saw reductions; Q2 18 dropped from $0.38 to $0.23, Q3 18 fell from $0.34 to $0.27, FY 18 declined from $1.22 to $0.95, and FY 19 was trimmed from $1.37 to $1.10.Bottom Line
 While management's plans to improve their line of products looks as it will pay off in the long term; the short term out-look for the company is choppy at best.5 Trades Could Profit "Big-League" from Trump Policies
 If the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.
 Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure. See these buy recommendations now >>

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
