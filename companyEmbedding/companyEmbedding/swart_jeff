Jeff is the author of The Church Planting Model, a step-by-step model for planting churches through personal evangelism and discipleship. This model is presently being used in more than 50 countries of the world and has been translated into more than a dozen languages. 
Jeff earned a M.A. degree in Professional Counseling at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia and a M.R.E. degree at the Baptist Theological Seminary in Jacksonville, Texas. Jeff and his wife, Debbie have been married 42 years and have three children: Josh, Andy and his wife Carman, Rachel and her husband Jonathan, and 4 precious grandchildren Laine and Ellie Swart, Copeland and Eisley McCrary  


"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.  
                teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo I am with you always, even to the end of the age."
Matthew 28:19-20
