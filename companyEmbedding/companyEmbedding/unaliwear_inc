About UnaliWear
Focus groups have named our Kanega watch a wearable “OnStar for People” because we provide discreet support for falls, medication reminders, and a guard against wandering in a classically-styled watch featuring an easy-to-use speech interface rather than buttons.
Thanks to our patent-pending battery system in the band, you never have to take your watch off to charge – and unlike Apple watch or Samsung Gear, we don’t require a smart phone (because it’s built in). We combine cellular, Wi-Fi, GPS, BLE (for hearing aids and telemedicine devices), an accelerometer for automatic fall detection, and continuous speech to provide an active medical alert that works anywhere, along with data-driven artificial intelligence that learns the wearer’s lifestyle (think “NEST for people”) to provide predictive, pre-emptive support.
Our naming derives from Cherokee: “Unalii” is “friend”, and “Kanega” is “speak”, so we are the friend that speaks to you.

Stay Active and Independent

 
 
 
Introducing the first all-in-one, voice-controlled device designed to keep you independent, active and safe.
 

 
 
 
 
 
 



Medication RemindersVoice Activated DirectionsFall DetectionEmergency AssistanceGuide Me Home Assistance
 
 
 
 












 

See How it Works
The Kanega watch is a simple and smart addition to your everyday life.
See Our KickStarter Hall of Fame!
 
 
 
 



Goes Anywhere You Do
Waterproof and able to travel with you anywhere you go! The Kanega watch is a self-contained watch and is not dependent on a connection to a home-based system or a smartphone, so you can get assistance at home or on the go in one simple, stylish watch.
 
 

 
 


 
 


 

Voice Controlled for Ease of Use
No buttons to press – speak to it by its name, and it speaks to you. It’s that easy.
 
 
 


 
 


Discreet & Stylish
It looks like a traditional watch, not a medical device. Wear the Kanega watch with confidence wherever you go.
 
 
 

 
 


 
 


 

 
On-call Emergency Assistance – Anytime, Anywhere
Voice activated assistance will connect you directly to an operator who will confirm emergency assistance should be dispatched to your location. If you activate help and don’t respond immediately we will call your emergency contacts first or dispatch local medical assistance immediately, depending on the preferences you have set.
 
 
 
 
 


 
 


Automatic Emergency Assistance – Help Even When You Can’t Ask For It
The Kanega watch can be set up to call emergency contacts and/or dispatch emergency services if it detects that you may be in trouble. UnaliWear relies on a number of factors such as fall detection and long periods of immobility during the day combined with a lack of response from you if it asks if you need help.
 
 

 
 


 
 


 

“Guide Me Home” & Other Location-Based Assistance
The Kanega watch understands where you are, where you’ve been, and some of your habits. This means it can help you find your way home if you become lost or get help for you if you appear to be immobile and unresponsive.
 
 
 
 
 
 


 
 


An End to Medication Frustration
The Kanega watch reminds you when you need to take medication, can remind you of the instructions for taking your medications, and helps you keep track of what medication you have already taken.  This is handled with an electronic connection to your pharmacy – no typing involved!

          Kanega Watch Supports Independent but Vulnerable Populations

AUSTIN, Texas, Feb. 29, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- UnaliWear™ and Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. today announced the initial closing of UnaliWear's $3.4M Series Seed financing, led by a $1M investment from Maxim Ventures.  The majority of Maxim's investment will be dedicated to beta test preparation for UnaliWear's Kanega watch, which is the wearable part of a Personal Emergency Response System (PERS) that delivers independence with dignity for independent but vulnerable populations.  













                UnaliWear's Kanega watch features a classic watch style with an easy-to-read high contrast display
              

 
 










                UnaliWear's Kanega watch provides discreet support in a classic watch style
              

 
 



The companies are working together on the Kanega watch, a go-everywhere unobtrusive wearable that provides discrete support for falls, medication reminders, and a guard against lost-wandering with "guide-me-home" assistance.  Thanks to the patent-pending battery system in the band, wearers don't need to take off the watch to charge it. The waterproof watch can be worn in the shower or bath, as well as during exercise like a water aerobics class.  Featuring a classical watch style, the Kanega watch uses an easy speech interface rather than buttons or touch screens. It learns the wearer's lifestyle to provide predictive, pre-emptive support. For example, it may provide directions home or notify the user of gait or speech changes that may be signs of a medical problem such as a stroke.  It has cellular and Wi-Fi connections for use in and out of the home, as well as built-in GPS tracking.
"My 82-year-old mother wasn't willing to wear today's medical alert products, because she said they were ugly, limited to use in the house unless tethered to a smart phone (which she doesn't have and doesn't want), and the big help buttons marked her as 'old'," said Jean Anne Booth, CEO, UnaliWear. "Like most of today's independent-living seniors, she chose not to use medical monitoring support rather than suffer social stigma. Mom now serves as UnaliWear's Senior User Experience Advisor." 
"We are excited by UnaliWear's vision and their dedication to a purpose-built wearable that provides a solution for vulnerable populations," said Shailendra Mahajan, Managing Director of Maxim Ventures.  
"With Maxim's leadership, UnaliWear is well-poised for future growth and investment," stated Jean Anne Booth, CEO, UnaliWear. "This investment accelerates the delivery of the Kanega watch, and we're excited to be soon delivering on our mission of extending independence with dignity for vulnerable populations." 
"Maxim Ventures continues to strategically invest in healthcare products that align with our goal of expanding the high-end wearable market for our parent Maxim Integrated's semiconductor products," said Chris Neil, Head of Maxim Ventures. "The Kanega watch conveniently links wearers with the support they need and allows people to live more independently and safely." 
Originally developed for seniors, UnaliWear's successful Kickstarter campaign in early 2015 broadened the company's outlook. Today, that includes people with disabilities and people with chronic diseases such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and Lou Gehrig's disease. The Kanega watch is entering beta testing, and should be available in the U.S. in the second half of 2016. For more information about UnaliWear, go to www.UnaliWear.com.

About UnaliWear
UnaliWear's Kanega watch provides discreet support for falls, medication reminders, and a guard against wandering in a classically-styled watch that features an easy-to-use speech interface rather than buttons.  Unlike traditional medical alert products, the Kanega watch works where you are, 24x7 – and doesn't require a smart phone. The Kanega watch combines cellular, Wi-Fi, GPS, BLE (for hearing aids and telemedicine devices), an accelerometer for automatic fall detection, and continuous speech to provide an active medical alert that works anywhere, along with data-driven artificial intelligence that learns the wearer's lifestyle to provide predictive, pre-emptive support.

UnaliWear Secures Strategic Investment From Maxim Ventures

Kanega Watch Supports Independent but Vulnerable Populations




Feb 29, 2016, 9:35am EST














AUSTIN, Texas, Feb. 29, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- UnaliWear™ and Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. today announced the initial closing of UnaliWear's $3.4M Series Seed financing, led by a $1M investment from Maxim Ventures.  The majority of Maxim's investment will be dedicated to beta test preparation for UnaliWear's Kanega watch, which is the wearable part of a Personal Emergency Response System (PERS) that delivers independence with dignity for independent but vulnerable populations.  

The companies are working together on the Kanega watch, a go-everywhere unobtrusive wearable that provides discrete support for falls, medication reminders, and a guard against lost-wandering with "guide-me-home" assistance.  Thanks to the patent-pending battery system in the band, wearers don't need to take off the watch to charge it. The waterproof watch can be worn in the shower or bath, as well as during exercise like a water aerobics class.  Featuring a classical watch style, the Kanega watch uses an easy speech interface rather than buttons or touch screens. It learns the wearer's lifestyle to provide predictive, pre-emptive support. For example, it may provide directions home or notify the user of gait or speech changes that may be signs of a medical problem such as a stroke.  It has cellular and Wi-Fi connections for use in and out of the home, as well as built-in GPS tracking.
"My 82-year-old mother wasn't willing to wear today's medical alert products, because she said they were ugly, limited to use in the house unless tethered to a smart phone (which she doesn't have and doesn't want), and the big help buttons marked her as 'old'," said Jean Anne Booth, CEO, UnaliWear. "Like most of today's independent-living seniors, she chose not to use medical monitoring support rather than suffer social stigma. Mom now serves as UnaliWear's Senior User Experience Advisor." 
"We are excited by UnaliWear's vision and their dedication to a purpose-built wearable that provides a solution for vulnerable populations," said Shailendra Mahajan, Managing Director of Maxim Ventures.  
"With Maxim's leadership, UnaliWear is well-poised for future growth and investment," stated Jean Anne Booth, CEO, UnaliWear. "This investment accelerates the delivery of the Kanega watch, and we're excited to be soon delivering on our mission of extending independence with dignity for vulnerable populations." 
"Maxim Ventures continues to strategically invest in healthcare products that align with our goal of expanding the high-end wearable market for our parent Maxim Integrated's semiconductor products," said Chris Neil, Head of Maxim Ventures. "The Kanega watch conveniently links wearers with the support they need and allows people to live more independently and safely." 
Originally developed for seniors, UnaliWear's successful Kickstarter campaign in early 2015 broadened the company's outlook. Today, that includes people with disabilities and people with chronic diseases such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and Lou Gehrig's disease. The Kanega watch is entering beta testing, and should be available in the U.S. in the second half of 2016. For more information about UnaliWear, go to www.UnaliWear.com.

UnaliWear Launches Wearable "OnStar for People" on KickStarter

Falls, Medication Reminders, and Wandering In A Discreet, Works-Anywhere Watch - No Smartphone




Feb 18, 2015, 8:04am EST














AUSTIN, Texas, Feb. 18, 2015 /PRNewswire-iReach/ -- UnaliWear, Inc. has launched a Kickstarter project (http://bit.ly/Unali-KS-URL) to produce the Kanega watch, the world's first wearable device that extends independence with dignity for seniors.  Focus groups have called the Kanega watch a "wearable OnStar for people" because the watch provides discreet support for falls, medication reminders, and a guard against wandering in a classically-styled watch that features an easy-to-use speech interface rather than buttons.  

Unlike traditional medical alert products, the Kanega watch works wherever you are, 24x7, and unlike today's smart watches, there is no smart phone required.  The Pew Research Center estimates that less than 10% of the US population above the age of 75 has a smart phone, and for those 80 and up, less than 5% have a smart phone.
"The Personal Emergency Response System (PERS) market is upwards of $1.5 billion per year, yet market penetration has been scoped at fewer than 10% of the 75+ population demographic.    Those who do not wear the PERS device worry that a pendant around the neck could make them appear old," said industry analyst Laurie M. Orlov of Aging in Place Technology Watch, author of 2012 research report about the future of PERS – "Next Generation Response Systems". 
 "After my previous startups sold to Texas Instruments and Apple, I started UnaliWear because my mother was 80, and she isn't willing to wear today's emergency alert products because they're ugly, limited outside the home unless tethered to a smart phone (which she doesn't have), and those big help buttons are socially stigmatizing.  My mother has been a model all of her life, and she's still very young at heart, so today's products are just not appropriate for her," says Jean Anne Booth, CEO of UnaliWear.  
Innovative patent-pending features
The Kanega watch's patent-pending innovative product features include: 

Active Mobile Personal Emergency Alert System

Combines cellular, Wi-Fi, and GPS for "works anywhere" support 
Active medical alert uses 9-axis accelerometer to auto-detect falls 
Detected falls trigger a watch-based query, which significantly reduces false alerts - and no need to be near a base station or smart phone
Medication Reminders

No user or care-giver data input required 
Medication data is electronically pulled from major pharmacies 
Medications reminders can be delayed with a speech request or by tapping the display (once for yes, twice for no) if socially inappropriate to get a verbal reminder 
Medication reminders include a follow-up verification
Guard against Wandering

Artificial intelligence learns the wearer's lifestyle to determine likelihood of wandering 
Wearer can obtain directions home or get help if wandering
Kanega Watch is Different

Restores Dignity – Gives Control to the Wearer

Wearer has a conversation with UnaliWear operators to define how the wearer wants the watch to behave; UnaliWear takes care of the set up 
No family or care-giver set up 
No computers or programming required
Always Ready to Help

You can wear it 24x7, so that you don't forget to put it back on 
Patent-pending quick swap battery system means you don't have to take it off to charge 
Because you're wearing it, it can help with issues at night 
It's waterproof (not just water-resistant), so you can wear it in the shower or bath, where a majority of falls happen – and in your water aerobics class 
It works anywhere you go, so you're free to travel and not trapped in your home 
It works standalone, so you don't need to pair it to another device 
It doesn't require a smart phone, so you're wearing all you need to stay safe
Features Discreet Styling

It looks like a traditional watch, so there's no social stigma of visibly "needing" assistance 
It requests permission to speak by buzzing on the wearer's wrist, so there's no visual or audible stigma of wearing an assistive device when socially inappropriate 
It doesn't require buttons to operate, both to reduce social stigma and so it works even if you're unconscious, unable to move, or unable to talk
Utilizes Speech For Ease of Use

Speech provides an easy, intuitive interface 
No buttons to press, so no social stigma of "needing" assistance 
You name your watch, which makes the command word easy to remember
UnaliWear is seeking the help of the Kickstarter community to finalize the design style, engineering, tooling, and waterproof packaging to produce their first manufacturing run of the Kanega watch. These watches will go to their backers as they continue to add features that extend independence with dignity.   The funding goal is $100,000. 
Pricing and Availability 
The Kanega watch has a MSRP of $299 with monitoring services ranging from $35/month to $85/month depending on the service level.  The Kanega watch will be available to the public in June 2016.   UnaliWear's Kickstarter backers can obtain the Kanega watch in January 2016 for a pre-order price of $289, which includes 3 months of medical alert monitoring and a 1-year free upgrade to medication reminder services or a guard against wandering at the wearer's choice (total MSRP of $864).

After my previous startups sold to Texas Instruments and Apple, I started UnaliWear because my mother is 80, and she isn’t willing to wear today’s emergency alert products because they’re ugly, limited outside the home unless they are tethered to a smart phone (which she doesn’t have), and those big help buttons are socially stigmatizing.  Focus groups have named UnaliWear “OnStar for People”… · More because we provide discreet support for falls, medication reminders, and a guard against wandering with guide-me-home assistance in a classically-styled watch that features an easy-to-use speech interface rather than buttons.  Unlike traditional medical alert products, we work wherever you are, 24x7 - and unlike Apple watch or Samsung Gear, we don’t require a smart phone.
