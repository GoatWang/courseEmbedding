 Fact SheetJun 30, 2017







The Fund
The Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing primarily in securities of companies that are located in India or surrounding countries of the Indian subcontinent, possibly including Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The Fund invests in companies with a  broad range of market capitalizations including smaller companies.



The Approach
The Fund's investments are selected using a strong valuation discipline based on industry specific metrics, to purchase what the Fund manager believes are well-positioned, cash-generating businesses run by shareholder-oriented management teams. From a va luation perspective, the Fund manager uses proprietary estimates to determine underappreciated and undervalued companies. Allocation of the Fund's investments is determined by the Fund manager's assessment of a company's upside return potential relative  to downside risk and other fund positions. Impact on sector and industry weightings is also considered.



The Features
The Fund provides investors access to a range of companies with the potential to benefit from India’s competitive advantages in the global economy including its political stability, well-developed banking system, vibrant capital market, tradition o f education, and strong pool of scientific and technical labor. The Fund has the ability to invest in companies with a broad range of market capitalizations.

Portfolio Management




 
Hiren Dasani, CFA


Managed Fund since 2017






Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. Fund invests in an affiliated investment company (Portfolio) with the same objective(s) and policies as the Fund. References to investments are  to the Portfolio's holdings.


About Risk: 
Fund performance is sensitive to stock market volatility. Investments in foreign instruments or currencies can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other con ditions. In emerging countries, these risks may be more significant. The securities markets in the India region are comparatively undeveloped and may be concentrated in certain sectors. Governmental actions in India can have a significant affect on econo mic conditions in the India region. A non-diversified fund may be subject to greater risk by investing in a smaller number of investments than a diversified fund. Smaller companies are generally subject to greater price fluctuations, limited liquidity, h igher transaction costs and higher investment risk than larger, established companies. Because the Fund may invest significantly in a particular geographic region or country, value of Fund shares may fluctuate more than a fund with less exposure to such  areas. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considere d a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding  consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.The Overall Morningstar Rat ing for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns,  60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most  weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.©2017 Morningstar. All  Rights Reserved.

Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. Fund invests in an affiliated investment company (Portfolio) with the same objective(s) and policies as the Fund. References to investments are  to the Portfolio's holdings.


About Risk: 
Fund performance is sensitive to stock market volatility. Investments in foreign instruments or currencies can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other con ditions. In emerging countries, these risks may be more significant. The securities markets in the India region are comparatively undeveloped and may be concentrated in certain sectors. Governmental actions in India can have a significant affect on econo mic conditions in the India region. A non-diversified fund may be subject to greater risk by investing in a smaller number of investments than a diversified fund. Smaller companies are generally subject to greater price fluctuations, limited liquidity, h igher transaction costs and higher investment risk than larger, established companies. Because the Fund may invest significantly in a particular geographic region or country, value of Fund shares may fluctuate more than a fund with less exposure to such  areas. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

About Risk: 
Fund performance is sensitive to stock market volatility. Investments in foreign instruments or currencies can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other con ditions. In emerging countries, these risks may be more significant. Asian economies are export-driven and can be affected by developments in the economies of their major trading partners.  Governmental actions in China can have a significant affect on e conomic conditions in the Asia region. Because the Fund may invest significantly in a particular geographic region or country, value of Fund shares may fluctuate more than a fund with less exposure to such areas. A nondiversified fund may be subject to g reater risk by investing in a smaller number of investments than a diversified fund. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks  and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considere d a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding  consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.The Overall Morningstar Rat ing for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns,  60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most  weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.©2017 Morningstar. All  Rights Reserved.
