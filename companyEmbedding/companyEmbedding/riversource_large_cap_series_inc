To our shareholders                                                 

From the chairman                                                   

      If you're an experienced  investor,  you know that the past few years have
      been unusually strong ones in the many financial markets.  Perhaps just as
      important,  history  shows that bull markets  don't last  forever.  Though
      they're  often   unpredictable,   declines  -  whether  they're  brief  or
      long-lasting,  moderate or substantial - are always a possibility.  We saw
      evidence of that last October,  when  financial  turmoil in Southeast Asia
  sparked a sharp decline in worldwide stock markets, including the U.S.

      The potential for such  volatility  reinforces the need for an investor to
      review  periodically  their  long-term  goals and  examine  whether  their
      investment  program  remains on track to achieving  them.  Your  quarterly
      investment  statements are one part of that monitoring process.  The other
      is a meeting with your American Express  financial  advisor.  That becomes
      even more important if there's a major change in your financial  situation
or in the financial markets.

From the portfolio manager                                          

      The  past  six  months  was  something  of a  roller-coaster  ride for IDS
      Research Opportunities Fund. At the conclusion of the period - August 1997
through January 1998 - the Fund's Class A shares lost 0.9%.         

      After  setting a torrid pace earlier in 1997,  the stock market  struggled
      for much of the past six  months.  The  market  got off to a bad  start in
      August,  as  currency  declines  in  Southeast  Asia and rising  long-term
      interest  rates  here at home  took a toll on U.S.  stocks.  Although  the
      market rallied the following  month, by late October the so-called  "Asian
      flu" was in full force,  weakening  stock markets  throughout  most of the
      world,  including the U.S. The situation improved over the following three
      months,  though, as good corporate profits and falling long-term  interest
     rates eventually overcame investors' fears regarding the turmoil in Asia.

      The Fund's performance basically tracked that of the broad market, but its
      fluctuations  were  greater.  That was a result of two factors:  a smaller
      portfolio (about 70 stocks, versus the 500 in the Standard & Poor's index)
      and a greater  concentration in  technology-related  stocks, which usually
display above-average price volatility.                             

      The second  factor was readily  apparent  late in 1997,  as several of the
      Fund's technology  holdings  experienced severe price declines in the wake
      of the Asian situation.  Some of them rebounded in January, but not enough
to make up for the downturn in previous months.                     

Consistent contributors                                             

      Much more  consistent  contributors  were  holdings  among health care and
      financial services companies,  the other two areas of substantial exposure
      for  the  Fund.  Stocks  in the  consumer  staple  sector,  which  include
      food/beverage  and other consumer product  producers,  were also generally
productive investments.                                             

      In keeping  with the Fund's  strategy,  I kept the  portfolio  essentially
      fully invested - that is, the great majority of assets  remained in stocks
      rather than cash  reserves.  The only notable  shifts in asset mix were an
      increased  exposure  to  energy-related  stocks  late in 1997 and  reduced
      exposure to the  technology  sector,  the latter  resulting from generally
lower stock prices at year-end.                                     

      As for the rest of the  fiscal  year,  I  expect  we'll  see a  tug-of-war
      between  those who believe the Asian  situation  will be an ongoing  major
      problem and those who expect it to be  relatively  minor and  short-lived.
      Ultimately, the strength of corporate earnings will resolve the issue, and
   that matter probably won't be settled before mid-year, at the earliest.

IDS Research Opportunities Fund                                       
(Unaudited as to Jan. 31, 1998)                                       

1                                                                           

Summary of                                                                      
significant                                                                     
accounting policies                                                             

      IDS Research  Opportunities  Fund (a series of IDS Growth  Fund,  Inc.) is
      registered  under the  Investment  Company  Act of 1940 (as  amended) as a
      diversified, open-end management investment company. IDS Growth Fund, Inc.
      has 10 billion  authorized  shares of capital  stock that can be allocated
      among the separate  series as designated  by the board.  On Aug. 16, 1996,
      American Express Financial  Corporation (AEFC) invested $3,000 in the Fund
      that   represented   200  shares  for  Class  A,  Class  B  and  Class  Y,
respectively. Operations commenced on Aug. 19, 1996.                

      The Fund  offers  Class A, Class B and Class Y shares.  Class A shares are
      sold with a  front-end  sales  charge.  Class B shares may be subject to a
      contingent deferred sales charge and such shares automatically  convert to
      Class A shares during the ninth calendar year of ownership. Class Y shares
      have no sales  charge and are  offered  only to  qualifying  institutional
investors.                                                          

      All classes of shares have identical  voting,  dividend,  liquidation  and
      other rights, and the same terms and conditions,  except that the level of
      distribution  fee,  transfer  agency fee and service  fee (class  specific
      expenses)  differs  among  classes.  Income,  expenses  (other  than class
      specific  expenses)  and  realized  and  unrealized  gains  or  losses  on
      investments  are allocated to each class of shares based upon its relative
net assets.                                                         

Investment in Aggressive Growth Portfolio                           

      The Fund invests all of its assets in the Aggressive Growth Portfolio (the
      Portfolio),  a series of Growth Trust, an open-end investment company that
      has the same  objectives as the Fund. The Portfolio  invests  primarily in
equity securities of companies that comprise the S&P 500.           

      The Fund records daily its share of the Portfolio's  income,  expenses and
      realized and unrealized gains and losses. The financial  statements of the
      Portfolio  are  included  elsewhere  in this  report and should be read in
conjunction with the Fund's financial statements.                   

      The Fund records its investment in the Portfolio at value that is equal to
      the  Fund's  proportionate  ownership  interest  in the net  assets of the
      Portfolio.  The percentage of the Portfolio  owned by the Fund at Jan. 31,
1998  was  99.63%.  Valuation  of  securities  held  by the  Portfolio  is
      discussed in Note 1 of the  Portfolio's  "Notes to financial  statements,"
which are included elsewhere in this report.                        

Use of estimates                                                    

      The  preparation  of financial  statements  in conformity  with  generally
      accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates and
      assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
      disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at the  date  of the
      financial  statements and the reported amounts of increase and decrease in
      net assets from operations during the period.  Actual results could differ
from those estimates.                                               

Federal taxes                                                       

      Since the Fund's  policy is to comply with all  sections  of the  Internal
      Revenue  Code  applicable  to  regulated   investment   companies  and  to
      distribute all of its taxable income to the shareholders, no provision for
income or excise taxes is required.                                 

      Net investment  income (loss) and net realized  gains  (losses)  allocated
      from the  Portfolio  may differ for  financial  statement and tax purposes
      primarily because of the deferral of losses on certain futures  contracts,
      the  recognition  of certain  foreign  currency gains (losses) as ordinary
      income  (loss) for tax  purposes,  and losses  deferred due to "wash sale"
      transactions. The character of distributions made during the year from net
      investment  income or net  realized  gains may differ from their  ultimate
      characterization for federal income tax purposes.  Also, due to the timing
      of  dividend   distributions,   the  fiscal  year  in  which  amounts  are
      distributed  may differ  from the year that the income or  realized  gains
(losses) were recorded by the Fund.                                 

Dividends to shareholders                                           

      An annual  dividend from net investment  income,  declared and paid at the
      end of the calendar  year, is reinvested in additional  shares of the Fund
      at net asset value or payable in cash. Capital gains, when available,  are

Aggressive Growth Portfolio

Summary of

accounting policies                                                             

      Aggressive  Growth  Portfolio (the  Portfolio) is a series of Growth Trust
      (the Trust) and is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (as
      amended)  as  a  diversified,   open-end  management  investment  company.
      Aggressive  Growth  Portfolio  invests  primarily in equity  securities of
      companies that comprise the S&P 500. The  Declaration of Trust permits the
      Trustees to issue non-transferable interests in the Portfolio. On Aug. 16,
1996, American Express Financial  Corporation (AEFC) contributed $4,000 to
the Portfolio. Operations commenced on Aug. 19, 1996.               

      Significant  accounting  policies followed by the Portfolio are summarized
below:                                                              

Use of estimates                                                    

      The  preparation  of financial  statements  in conformity  with  generally
      accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates and
      assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
      disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at the  date  of the
      financial  statements and the reported amounts of increase and decrease in
      net assets from operations during the period.  Actual results could differ
from those estimates.                                               

Valuation of securities                                             

      All  securities  are valued at the close of each business day.  Securities
      traded on national  securities  exchanges  or included in national  market
      systems are valued at the last quoted sales  price.  Debt  securities  are
      generally traded in the over-the-counter  market and are valued at a price
      deemed best to reflect fair value as quoted by dealers who make markets in
      these  securities or by an  independent  pricing  service.  Securities for
      which market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value
      according  to methods  selected  in good  faith by the  board.  Short-term
      securities  maturing  in more  than 60 days  from the  valuation  date are
      valued at the market  price or  approximate  market value based on current
      interest rates,  those maturing in 60 days or less are valued at amortized
cost.                                                               

Option transactions                                                 

      In order to produce  incremental  earnings,  protect gains and  facilitate
      buying and selling of securities  for investment  purposes,  the Portfolio
      may buy and write options traded on any U.S. or foreign exchange or in the
      over-the  counter  market  where  the  completion  of  the  obligation  is
      dependent upon the credit standing of the other party.  The Portfolio also
      may buy and sell put and call  options and write  covered  call options on
      portfolio  securities and may write cash-secured put options.  The risk in
      writing a call option is that the Portfolio  gives up the  opportunity  of
      profit if the market price of the security increases.  The risk in writing
      a put option is that the Portfolio may incur a loss if the market price of
      the security decreases and the option is exercised.  The risk in buying an
      option is that the Portfolio  pays a premium  whether or not the option is
      exercised. The Portfolio also has the additional risk of not being able to
      enter into a closing  transaction  if a liquid  secondary  market does not
exist.                                                              

      Option  contracts are valued daily at the closing  prices on their primary
      exchanges and unrealized  appreciation or  depreciation  is recorded.  The
      Portfolio  will realize a gain or loss upon  expiration  or closing of the
      option transaction. When an option is exercised, the proceeds on sales for
      a written call option,  the purchase  cost for a written put option or the
      cost of a security  for a purchased  put or call option is adjusted by the
amount of premium received or paid.                                 

Futures transactions                                                

      In order to gain exposure to or protect itself from changes in the market,
      the Portfolio may buy and sell financial  futures  contracts traded on any
      U.S. or foreign  exchange.  The  Portfolio  also may buy and write put and
      call options on these  futures  contracts.  Risks of entering into futures
      contracts and related options include the possibility that there may be an
      illiquid  market and that a change in the value of the  contract or option
     may not correlate with changes in the value of the underlying securities.

      Upon  entering  into a futures  contract,  the  Portfolio  is  required to
      deposit either cash or securities in an amount (initial margin) equal to a
      certain percentage of the contract value.  Subsequent  payments (variation
      margin) are made or  received by the  Portfolio  each day.  The  variation
      margin  payments are equal to the daily changes in the contract  value and
      are recorded as unrealized  gains and losses.  The Portfolio  recognizes a
realized gain or loss when the contract is closed or expires.       

Foreign currency translations                                       
and foreign currency contracts                                      

      Securities  and  other  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in  foreign
      currencies are translated  daily into U.S.  dollars at the closing rate of
      exchange.  Foreign  currency  amounts  related to the  purchase or sale of
      securities  and income and expenses are translated at the exchange rate on
      the transaction  date. The effect of changes in foreign  exchange rates on
      realized  and  unrealized  security  gains or  losses  is  reflected  as a
      component of such gains or losses.  In the  statement of  operations,  net
      realized gains or losses from foreign currency transactions may arise from
      sales of foreign  currency,  closed forward  contracts,  exchange gains or
      losses realized  between the trade date and settlement dates on securities
      transactions, and other translation gains or losses on dividends, interest
income and foreign withholding taxes.                               

      The Portfolio may enter into forward foreign currency  exchange  contracts
      for  operational  purposes and to protect  against  adverse  exchange rate
      fluctuation.  The net U.S. dollar value of foreign currency underlying all
      contractual commitments held by the Portfolio and the resulting unrealized
      appreciation  or  depreciation   are  determined  using  foreign  currency
      exchange  rates from an  independent  pricing  service.  The  Portfolio is
      subject to the credit  risk that the other  party  will not  complete  the
obligations of the contract.                                        

Federal taxes                                                       

      For federal  income tax purposes the Portfolio  qualifies as a partnership
      and  each  investor  in the  Portfolio  is  treated  as the  owner  of its
      proportionate share of the net assets,  income,  expenses and realized and
      unrealized  gains  and  losses  of  the  Portfolio.   Accordingly,   as  a
      "pass-through"  entity, the Portfolio does not pay any income dividends or
capital gain distributions.                                         

Other                                                               

      Security  transactions  are  accounted  for on  the  date  securities  are
      purchased or sold.  Dividend income is recognized on the ex-dividend  date
      and interest  income,  including  level-yield  amortization of premium and
discount, is accrued daily.                                         

2                                                                           

Fees and                                                                        
expenses                                                                        

      The Trust,  on behalf of the  Portfolio,  has entered  into an  Investment
      Management Services Agreement with AEFC for managing its portfolio.  Under

(a)  Securities are valued by using procedures described in Note 1 to the       
   financial statements, in the most recent Semiannual Report dated Jan. 31,
2008.                                                                 

(b)  Non-income producing.

value of foreign securities represented 1.5% of net assets.

  financial statements in the most recent Semiannual Report dated Jan. 31,
2008.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
