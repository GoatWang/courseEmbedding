The success of the Confidential S-1 filing process is not confidential

Posted on August 16, 2016 | Leave a comment


On July 21, we celebrated the sixth birthday (anniversary?) of Dodd-Frank, and although some of the ruling’s initiatives are less than beloved by many, aka Volcker Rule, the “confidential IPO” bucketed under the JOBS Act has been an undisputed success.

I was reminded of this when reviewing last week’s list of companies who officially became “issuers.” All three were Emerging Growth Companies (EGC) and all three filed as a confidential IPO.

Airgain (wireless telecommunication equipment) filed confidentially as an EGC in Aug 2014, filed publicly in Jul 2016, raised $12m – priced below the range – traded on the NASDAQ on Aug 12


Protagonist Therapeutics (biopharmaceuticals) filed confidentially as an EGC in May 2016, filed publicly in Jul 2016, raised $90m – priced within the range – traded on the NASDAQ on Aug 11 and finished the day down 3%


Medpace (clinical contract research company) filed confidentially as an EGC in Mar 2016, filed publicly in Jun 2016, raised $161m – priced within the range – traded on the NASDAQ on Aug 11 and finished the day up 21%

What is: Emerging Growth Company 
An Emerging Growth Company (EGC) is an issuer that has total annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year. 
What is: Confidential filing process 
An Emerging Growth Company can submit a confidential draft IPO registration to the SEC for review in advance of its initial public offering. This allows the company to hone their message and offering – especially with the SEC.It allows the company to change their mind about going public without anyone knowing. Publicly “pulling their IPO” is often viewed as a failure.
DOWNLOAD THE WORKFLOW WHITEPAPER HERE

The EGC and SEC are prohibited from publicly disclosing the confidential filing, comments, and amendments during this review process. As the EGC moves closer toward its IPO, the JOBS Act requires that these filings be made available to the public.
The EGC would be required to publicly file their draft registration and amendments, with the SEC no later than 15 days before its roadshow. Plus the SEC staff will publicly release its comment letter and responses to staff comment letters on confidential draft submissions after the registration statement for the IPO becomes effective but no sooner than 20 days after the effective date.
As you see in the three companies above, confidential does not equate to simple. Airgain needed two years to get into position.

2016 deals v. dollars for M&A

Posted on August 12, 2016 | Leave a comment


As reported in Mergermarket’s Global and Regional M&A: H1 2016 report, US dealmaking within the first half of 2016 has rebalanced with history – juxtaposed to 2015’s record-breaking values. M&A activity totaled US$ 562.7bn across 2,242 transactions, a 31.5% drop in value and decrease in volume by 342 transactions from H1 2015.

For Vintage, a deal’s dollar value is a moot point: we treat all deals at par, as the services we supply are agnostic. To be exact, a 50 million dollar acquisition demands the same level of virtual data room security as a one billion dollar acquisition. Likewise with the S-4 creation and filing. Accuracy is de rigueur.
Top dealmakers dollars v. deal count
Each week, we track that week’s underwriters (view here). It’s interesting to compare the top twenty dealmakers total (H1) dollar volume with the number of individual deals. As you see, the numbers don’t necessarily align.

Ping-ponging with the SEC as the IPO optimism pipeline grows

Posted on August 11, 2016 | Leave a comment


This past week, we’ve seen some positive pundit-isms towards what has been a sad year for IPOs.
Kathleen Smith, a principal at IPO-focused Renaissance Capital, expects a uptick the remaining of the year, but doesn’t expect 2016 to match the 170 IPOs and $30 billion raised in 2015, which itself was down from the 2014’s big IPO year.
“The enemy of a healthy IPO market is uncertainty and volatility. We’ve had some high volatility in the past year, but that’s moderated back down to normal levels.”
The IPO window is ready to open, “it’s just a matter of when,” said Garvis Toler, global head of capital markets at the New York Stock Exchange. “The enemy of a healthy IPO market is uncertainty and volatility. We’ve had some high volatility in the past year, but that’s moderated back down to normal levels. People need to perceive that it’s a hospitable environment.”
Liz Myers, JPMorgan’s global head of equity capital markets, reported that JPMorgan has 20+ IPOs in their global pipeline in September, and a “full pipeline” for the balance of 2017. Additionally, JP Morgan expects to see more than a dozen tech IPOs before the end of the year. Venture capitalists count more than 150 unicorns (privately held companies valued above $1 billion) in the US. IPOs bring big gains to VC firms and other early investors, allowing them to invest in the next star companies.
What do companies, especially Emerging Growth Companies, do as they prepare for their IPO?
Well… they prepare. One place to start is to understand the actual drafting registration process you’ll experience with the SEC. THIS WHITEPAPER ILLUSTRATES THAT PROCESS.

What you’ll see illustrated in the whitepaper is that the SEC will absolutely PONG back your PING, looking for sharper definition on one, some or all (eek!) of these topics:

Acquisitions
Contingencies
Divestitures
Estimates
Fair value
Goodwill impairment
Income taxes
Internal controls
MD&A
Non-GAAP abuse / reconciliation
Segment reporting
Stock compensation

As your securities lawyers will clearly express, “don’t take it personally.” SEC letters are a part of the process and the back-and-forth can take months, with an average of 8 months.
Lastly, although it is a bit of a ping pong match, its NOT a competition. The SEC wants companies to succeed while simultaneously protecting investors.

The SEC suggests redefining “smaller” to reduce filing burden for some issuers

Posted on August 10, 2016 | Leave a comment


The SEC has proposed an updated change regarding the definition and subsequent qualification of a SRC: smaller reporting company. 
Today, US issuers qualify as a SRC if they either 1.) have a public float of less than $75 million or 2.) for issuers without a public float, annual revenues of less than $50 million.
The benefit of being a SRC company is a lighter disclosure burden under Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X including only having to disclose two years of audited financial statements and zero Compensation Discussion & Analysis reporting responsibility.
The new update would allow issuers to be re-classified as a SRC if they have 1.) a public float of less than $250 million or 2.) for companies without a public float, annual revenues of less than $100 million.
The updates are projected to reduce the work burden and costs for reporting (while still protecting investors) for close to 800 current non-SRC issuers… about 11% of all SEC reporting issuers.
One point: issuers with more than $75 million in public float, even if reclassified as a SRC, are still accelerated filers. Their 10-Q and 10-K filings deadlines do not change nor does their Sarbanes-Oxley 404 auditor verification reporting. Also, a SDC is still required to file XBRL –our team will assist in keep those fees low and accuracy high.
If all that is not confusing enough, a SRC can also be an EGC which may be not have SOX responsibilities. For sure, talk to your SEC lawyer, PDQ. You know… CYA.
Comments on the proposed rules are due August 30, 2016.

Experts for corporate exit execution

Posted on August 9, 2016 | Leave a comment


As of last week, in 2016, only 55 companies have rung the IPO bell on Wall Street (or in Times Square). This is 45%, YOY, of 2015 and 30%, YOY, of 2014. The money raised is the same percentages.
So, with such dramatic reductions in S-1 filings, what has kept our Capital Markets Operations Team so busy? Mergers.

2016’s domestic M&A, although down one-fourth from last years’ tremendous activity, has kept our transactions pros working all three shifts.** SEC form S-4 can be as complicated as an IPO’s S-1 and, absolutely, the production precision needed is equal.
Prior the S-4, our team is onboarding and training the appropriate working groups to manage their virtual data room (VIEW DEMO VIDEO) – assuring the right content gets into the right folders and that the wrongs eyes don’t have access. Security and administrative permissioning is paramount.
Why are companies exiting via M&A rather than an IPO? The Wall Street Journal states several factors, including the soft market performance of many IPOs, buyers’ appetite for great targets and, notably, the underlying patience of Private Equity.
From the WSJ:
“Trader Corp., an online automotive marketplace owned by private-equity firm Apax Partners, was days away from publicly unveiling its IPO plans in early July when it announced a deal to sell itself to Thoma Bravo LLC for about $1.2 billion, according to several people close to the deal. The move surprised many of the company’s IPO bankers, who expected the company to fetch a higher valuation in a public offering, according to people familiar with the matter.”
Regardless of a company’s individual exit strategy, we’re pleased so many are allowing us to help them execute their plan.

**NOTE: By operating three shifts – typesetting, EDGARizing, production – we mitigate rush charges to clients. We KNOW filings are always on deadline. It’s the nature of the business. Charging “rush” charges rarely makes sense.
