Abrasive Blast Finishing
Abrasive blasting is an excellent means of accomplishing several different processes including: Cleaning to remove foreign matter such as scale and rust; peening to stress relieve and improve lubrication characteristics; finishing to deburr, deflash and etch; surface preparation prior to painting, coating, or bonding processes.  Systems are available in both "airblast" using compressed air operated blasting nozzles and "airless" systems with centrifugal blast wheels.  Range of equipment is from manual hand blast cabinets to fully automated high production systems.
