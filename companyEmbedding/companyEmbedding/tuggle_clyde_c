Since 1886, we’ve brought the world the unique, refreshing taste of Coca-Cola. And as the times have changed, so have we. Today, we’re the world’s largest beverage company, offering over 500 brands to people in more than 200 countries. Together with our bottling partners, we depend on over 700,000 Coca-Cola system associates to reach the world.
But even with this storied past, we aren’t standing still. 
As consumers’ tastes and preferences change, we’re rapidly evolving our business to bring them a wide range of new and different drinks, while also reducing sugar and adding more nutrition and benefits wherever we can. As always, we’re firmly committed to creating lasting value for our associates, bottling partners, customers, shareowners, and the communities we call home. 
Led by President and CEO James Quincey, our company’s senior leadership team is investing in a future that promises to be even more exciting than our past.

th 
on Fortune’s Most Admired Companies List, and 
remains a powerhouse in the industry with average servings per day of 1.8 billion globally. 
Coca Cola Co. is a proven powerhouse in the beverage industry. They own a large amount of the market share, 
with their signature drink, Coca Cola, taking 26% of the soft drink market and Diet Coca Cola claiming another 
15%. The global reach of Coca Cola Co., along with continued growth and expansion, has kept them operating 
at significant profits, even through recent years of economic recession. Coca Cola Co.’s 2020 Initiative has also 
been a strength that is helping them to become more environmentally friendly while raising profit margins. 
With the success and resilience Coca Cola Co. has shown, there is little question as to their dominance in the 
beverage industry. The purpose of this report is to [1] express the current state of the Coca Cola brand, [2] 
provide information on recent investments for expansion, [3] discuss challenges facing Coca Cola Co. To 
conclude my report I will offer suggestions on how to set the Coca Cola brand up for continued growth and 
success. 
After 126 Years, Coca Cola Showing No Signs of Aging 
Times are changing, and Coca Cola Co. knows that. Gone are the days when one product was enough to satisfy 
the entire market and keep the company profitable. People have varying tastes and health concerns, and 
therefore various products in multiple categories are needed. The world is also more conscious of environmental 
factors, making how a company runs its operations of upmost concern. Coca Cola Co. understands these factors 
and has used them to their advantage. 
Product Creation, Innovation, and Diversity 
For the first 70 years of its existence, The Coca-Cola Co. 
only produced one product: Coca-Cola. In 1955, 
expansion began. Today, Coca-Cola is experiencing great success in part due to the enormous number of 
product lines offered. 
Regular and low/no calorie sparkling beverages: 
Coca Cola Co. is well known for their soft drink products. 
They have great diversity in this category, with top brands such as:
