Worx America Homepage
Worx America develops automated engineering solutions for industrial, environmental and energy industries. Worx diversified technology platform provides production enhancement solutions to assist energy exploration companies in the development of oil and gas production.  Worx’s innovative automated solutions help to increase oil and gas identification and production to meet increasing energy demands worldwide.
The Worx management team has extensive expertise in developing mechanical designs, spraying technologies, down-hole imaging and motion control automated hydraulic systems.  With unmatched level of experience, sophistication and creative design solutions in the field of oil and gas production and recovery, Worx America is strategically positioned to capitalize on the booming energy market.
Through its partnership with RSSV, Worx has the opportunity to offer its effective technology solutions to China’s booming oil and gas market. This partnership allows Worx to gain immediate market share in China and increase awareness of Worx’s technologies.
The Market
China’s rapidly expanding mainland oil refining industries are under government mandated environmental pressures. This is forcing oil refineries to modernize, clean up and extract more output or face closure.  With China set to become a net oil exporter in 2015, the oil processing and refinery market will have to grow in order to match exportation goals. RSSV has the technologies and partnerships to help meet this demand and secure greater market share.
China’s oil consumption will continue to grow in order to keep up with its industrialization initiatives. Supplying oil to a country of over 3 Billion people requires major investments in refinery and processing facilities. With China’s oil demand set to grow 3 percent year-on-year to 534 million metric tons in 2015, the demand for RSSV technologies will increase as well.
