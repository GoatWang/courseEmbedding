Yingli (Chinese: 英利), formally Yingli Green Energy Holding Company Limited (Chinese: 英利绿色能源控股有限公司; pinyin: Yīnglì Lǜsè Néngyuán Kònggǔ Yǒuxiàn Gōngsī - . Yingli Green Energy Holding Company Limited (NYSE: YGE), known as "Yingli Solar," is one of the world's leading solar panel manufacturers. Yingli Green Energy's manufacturing covers the photovoltaic value chain from ingot casting and wafering through solar cell production and solar panel assembly. Yingli's photovoltaic module capacity is 4 GWs.
Yingli is headquartered in Baoding, China and has more than 30 regional subsidiaries and branch offices and has distributed more than 15 GW solar panels to customers worldwide. Yingli Solar was established in 1997 and was the world’s largest PV module manufacturers in the world in 2012 and 2013. Yingli was founded by Liansheng Miao who was a pioneer in Chinese solar manufacturing. Mao worked to persuade other people to encourage the growth of Chinese solar industry as Miao saw that solar manufacturing is an industry in which China can be competitive.
Yingli expanded production capacity at a time module prices slumped. Yingli recovered slowly and since early 2015 has faced financial difficulties and has been going through a debt restructuring out of court. In 2015 signed a contract with LONGi to cooperate on monocrystalline products.[1] In the first quarter of 2016 Yingli posted a profit first time since 2011. Yingli has cut workforce and decreased R&D spending. Yingli's cost per watt is 41 cents. The company was a sponsor of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, U.S. men’s and women’s national soccer teams, and FC Bayern Munich.[2]
Yingli is a member of the ‘Silicon Module Super League’ (SMSL), a group of big-six c-Si module suppliers in the solar PV industry today. The other five members of the group are Canadian Solar, Hanwha Q CELLS, JA Solar, Trina Solar and Jinko Solar.[3]

History[edit]
Yingli Green Energy was established in 1998 by Liansheng Miao, who remains the company’s chairman and CEO. Yingli Green Energy began module production in 2003, with a capacity of 3 MW. By 2004, Yingli reached 6 MW in ingot/wafer/cell production, and 50 MW in module production.[citation needed] The company also expanded into Germany and achieved certifications from UL, the IEC and TÜV Rheinland.[citation needed] After continued expansion and fundraising efforts, Yingli Green Energy completed its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in June 2007. In 2009, Yingli achieved 1 GW of cumulative output of solar modules since commercial production began in 2003.[citation needed] Today, Yingli Green Energy has a balanced vertically integrated production capacity of 2,450 MW per year.[2]
In 2009, the company acquired Cyber Power, a development stage enterprise with plans to begin production of solar-grade polysilicon. Yingli Solar is expected to start trial polysilicon by the end of 2010. Growing at a fast rate, 2010 first quarter reports indicated that it was Yingli Solar's most profitable quarter to date.
In 2010, Yingli Green Energy became the first Chinese company and the first renewable energy company to sponsor the FIFA World Cup.[4] Yingli is also a sponsor of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. It is supplying modules to 2014 FIFA World Cup stadiums, including the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro.[5] Building on its partnership with FIFA, Yingli is also a sponsor of FC Bayern München and the U.S. Soccer Women’s and Men’s National Teams.
Products[edit]
Over 15 GW of Yingli solar modules are deployed worldwide.[citation needed] In 2012, Yingli Green Energy reached a production capacity of 2,450 MW per year, making it the largest solar module manufacturer in the world in terms of module production capacity.[6] It also became the world’s leading solar module supplier by sales revenue and shipments in Q1 2012.[7] Also in 2012, Ray Lian predicted that Yingli Green Energy was likely to become the world’s largest supplier in terms of full-year module shipments in 2012.[8]
Yingli manufactures crystalline silicon solar PV modules, including both, monocrystalline and multicrystalline. Its two primary solar module product lines are the monocrystalline PANDA Series and the multicrystalline YGE Series.
Yingli Solar’s PANDA product line was developed through an in-house collaboration between the Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands (ECN) and Amtech Systems, Inc. that aimed to create a new, more efficient solar cell. PANDA modules use n-doped silicon instead of the industry’s standard p-type silicon, allowing a more efficient conversion of infrared light into electricity, and lower initial degradation rate.[citation needed] As the PANDA product line is claimed by the company to achieve performance ratings of up to 16.5%, it is best suited to commercial or residential applications where maximum energy output is essential due to space constraints.[9]
Yingli Solar’s YGE Series is its primary product line. The company claims that these multicrystalline modules have efficiencies of up to 15.4%, for use in commercial, residential, and utility-scale projects.[10]
Yingli Solar’s manufacturing facilities are located in Baoding, Haikou, Tianjin, and Hengshui. Yingli Americas, a regional subsidiary of Yingli Green Energy, operates a regional research and development lab, the PV Testing Lab (PVTL), in South San Francisco, California. The PVTL conducts product characterization and quality control testing, and provides customers with system modeling support.[2]
Social responsibility[edit]
Yingli is the largest and first official module supplier to GRID Alternatives, an Oakland, California-based non-profit solar installer that provides low-income families with solar energy systems free of charge. By the end of 2012, Yingli will have helped over 800 families save substantially on their electricity bills through its support of GRID Alternatives. Thousands of job seekers will also receive professional training through this partnership.[11]
Yingli has also sponsored the United States Soccer Federation to launch the Powering Advancement with Solar and Soccer (PASS) program. The PASS program provides schools in disadvantaged communities with solar energy systems and support for their healthy lifestyle programs. The program was launched at the KIPP DC: Will Academy charter school in Washington, DC on June 1, 2012.[12]
As part of its sponsorship of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, Yingli participates in the “Football for Hope. Energy for Hope.” initiative that aims to bring football training and community centers to communities in Africa. Yingli is working with FIFA to provide these twenty football training and community centers with clean solar energy.[4]

Yingli (Chinese: 英利), formally Yingli Green Energy Holding Company Limited (Chinese: 英利绿色能源控股有限公司; pinyin: Yīnglì Lǜsè Néngyuán Kònggǔ Yǒuxiàn Gōngsī - . Yingli Green Energy Holding Company Limited (NYSE: YGE), known as "Yingli Solar," is one of the world's leading solar panel manufacturers. Yingli Green Energy's manufacturing covers the photovoltaic value chain from ingot casting and wafering through solar cell production and solar panel assembly. Yingli's photovoltaic module capacity is 4 GWs.
Yingli is headquartered in Baoding, China and has more than 30 regional subsidiaries and branch offices and has distributed more than 15 GW solar panels to customers worldwide. Yingli Solar was established in 1997 and was the world’s largest PV module manufacturers in the world in 2012 and 2013. Yingli was founded by Liansheng Miao who was a pioneer in Chinese solar manufacturing. Mao worked to persuade other people to encourage the growth of Chinese solar industry as Miao saw that solar manufacturing is an industry in which China can be competitive.
Yingli expanded production capacity at a time module prices slumped. Yingli recovered slowly and since early 2015 has faced financial difficulties and has been going through a debt restructuring out of court. In 2015 signed a contract with LONGi to cooperate on monocrystalline products.[1] In the first quarter of 2016 Yingli posted a profit first time since 2011. Yingli has cut workforce and decreased R&D spending. Yingli's cost per watt is 41 cents. The company was a sponsor of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, U.S. men’s and women’s national soccer teams, and FC Bayern Munich.[2]
Yingli is a member of the ‘Silicon Module Super League’ (SMSL), a group of big-six c-Si module suppliers in the solar PV industry today. The other five members of the group are Canadian Solar, Hanwha Q CELLS, JA Solar, Trina Solar and Jinko Solar.[3]

History[edit]
Yingli Green Energy was established in 1998 by Liansheng Miao, who remains the company’s chairman and CEO. Yingli Green Energy began module production in 2003, with a capacity of 3 MW. By 2004, Yingli reached 6 MW in ingot/wafer/cell production, and 50 MW in module production.[citation needed] The company also expanded into Germany and achieved certifications from UL, the IEC and TÜV Rheinland.[citation needed] After continued expansion and fundraising efforts, Yingli Green Energy completed its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in June 2007. In 2009, Yingli achieved 1 GW of cumulative output of solar modules since commercial production began in 2003.[citation needed] Today, Yingli Green Energy has a balanced vertically integrated production capacity of 2,450 MW per year.[2]
In 2009, the company acquired Cyber Power, a development stage enterprise with plans to begin production of solar-grade polysilicon. Yingli Solar is expected to start trial polysilicon by the end of 2010. Growing at a fast rate, 2010 first quarter reports indicated that it was Yingli Solar's most profitable quarter to date.
In 2010, Yingli Green Energy became the first Chinese company and the first renewable energy company to sponsor the FIFA World Cup.[4] Yingli is also a sponsor of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. It is supplying modules to 2014 FIFA World Cup stadiums, including the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro.[5] Building on its partnership with FIFA, Yingli is also a sponsor of FC Bayern München and the U.S. Soccer Women’s and Men’s National Teams.
Products[edit]
Over 15 GW of Yingli solar modules are deployed worldwide.[citation needed] In 2012, Yingli Green Energy reached a production capacity of 2,450 MW per year, making it the largest solar module manufacturer in the world in terms of module production capacity.[6] It also became the world’s leading solar module supplier by sales revenue and shipments in Q1 2012.[7] Also in 2012, Ray Lian predicted that Yingli Green Energy was likely to become the world’s largest supplier in terms of full-year module shipments in 2012.[8]
Yingli manufactures crystalline silicon solar PV modules, including both, monocrystalline and multicrystalline. Its two primary solar module product lines are the monocrystalline PANDA Series and the multicrystalline YGE Series.
Yingli Solar’s PANDA product line was developed through an in-house collaboration between the Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands (ECN) and Amtech Systems, Inc. that aimed to create a new, more efficient solar cell. PANDA modules use n-doped silicon instead of the industry’s standard p-type silicon, allowing a more efficient conversion of infrared light into electricity, and lower initial degradation rate.[citation needed] As the PANDA product line is claimed by the company to achieve performance ratings of up to 16.5%, it is best suited to commercial or residential applications where maximum energy output is essential due to space constraints.[9]
Yingli Solar’s YGE Series is its primary product line. The company claims that these multicrystalline modules have efficiencies of up to 15.4%, for use in commercial, residential, and utility-scale projects.[10]
Yingli Solar’s manufacturing facilities are located in Baoding, Haikou, Tianjin, and Hengshui. Yingli Americas, a regional subsidiary of Yingli Green Energy, operates a regional research and development lab, the PV Testing Lab (PVTL), in South San Francisco, California. The PVTL conducts product characterization and quality control testing, and provides customers with system modeling support.[2]
Social responsibility[edit]
Yingli is the largest and first official module supplier to GRID Alternatives, an Oakland, California-based non-profit solar installer that provides low-income families with solar energy systems free of charge. By the end of 2012, Yingli will have helped over 800 families save substantially on their electricity bills through its support of GRID Alternatives. Thousands of job seekers will also receive professional training through this partnership.[11]
Yingli has also sponsored the United States Soccer Federation to launch the Powering Advancement with Solar and Soccer (PASS) program. The PASS program provides schools in disadvantaged communities with solar energy systems and support for their healthy lifestyle programs. The program was launched at the KIPP DC: Will Academy charter school in Washington, DC on June 1, 2012.[12]
As part of its sponsorship of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, Yingli participates in the “Football for Hope. Energy for Hope.” initiative that aims to bring football training and community centers to communities in Africa. Yingli is working with FIFA to provide these twenty football training and community centers with clean solar energy.[4]

Yingli (Chinese: 英利), formally Yingli Green Energy Holding Company Limited (Chinese: 英利绿色能源控股有限公司; pinyin: Yīnglì Lǜsè Néngyuán Kònggǔ Yǒuxiàn Gōngsī - . Yingli Green Energy Holding Company Limited (NYSE: YGE), known as "Yingli Solar," is one of the world's leading solar panel manufacturers. Yingli Green Energy's manufacturing covers the photovoltaic value chain from ingot casting and wafering through solar cell production and solar panel assembly. Yingli's photovoltaic module capacity is 4 GWs.
Yingli is headquartered in Baoding, China and has more than 30 regional subsidiaries and branch offices and has distributed more than 15 GW solar panels to customers worldwide. Yingli Solar was established in 1997 and was the world’s largest PV module manufacturers in the world in 2012 and 2013. Yingli was founded by Liansheng Miao who was a pioneer in Chinese solar manufacturing. Mao worked to persuade other people to encourage the growth of Chinese solar industry as Miao saw that solar manufacturing is an industry in which China can be competitive.
Yingli expanded production capacity at a time module prices slumped. Yingli recovered slowly and since early 2015 has faced financial difficulties and has been going through a debt restructuring out of court. In 2015 signed a contract with LONGi to cooperate on monocrystalline products.[1] In the first quarter of 2016 Yingli posted a profit first time since 2011. Yingli has cut workforce and decreased R&D spending. Yingli's cost per watt is 41 cents. The company was a sponsor of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, U.S. men’s and women’s national soccer teams, and FC Bayern Munich.[2]
Yingli is a member of the ‘Silicon Module Super League’ (SMSL), a group of big-six c-Si module suppliers in the solar PV industry today. The other five members of the group are Canadian Solar, Hanwha Q CELLS, JA Solar, Trina Solar and Jinko Solar.[3]

History[edit]
Yingli Green Energy was established in 1998 by Liansheng Miao, who remains the company’s chairman and CEO. Yingli Green Energy began module production in 2003, with a capacity of 3 MW. By 2004, Yingli reached 6 MW in ingot/wafer/cell production, and 50 MW in module production.[citation needed] The company also expanded into Germany and achieved certifications from UL, the IEC and TÜV Rheinland.[citation needed] After continued expansion and fundraising efforts, Yingli Green Energy completed its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in June 2007. In 2009, Yingli achieved 1 GW of cumulative output of solar modules since commercial production began in 2003.[citation needed] Today, Yingli Green Energy has a balanced vertically integrated production capacity of 2,450 MW per year.[2]
In 2009, the company acquired Cyber Power, a development stage enterprise with plans to begin production of solar-grade polysilicon. Yingli Solar is expected to start trial polysilicon by the end of 2010. Growing at a fast rate, 2010 first quarter reports indicated that it was Yingli Solar's most profitable quarter to date.
In 2010, Yingli Green Energy became the first Chinese company and the first renewable energy company to sponsor the FIFA World Cup.[4] Yingli is also a sponsor of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. It is supplying modules to 2014 FIFA World Cup stadiums, including the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro.[5] Building on its partnership with FIFA, Yingli is also a sponsor of FC Bayern München and the U.S. Soccer Women’s and Men’s National Teams.
Products[edit]
Over 15 GW of Yingli solar modules are deployed worldwide.[citation needed] In 2012, Yingli Green Energy reached a production capacity of 2,450 MW per year, making it the largest solar module manufacturer in the world in terms of module production capacity.[6] It also became the world’s leading solar module supplier by sales revenue and shipments in Q1 2012.[7] Also in 2012, Ray Lian predicted that Yingli Green Energy was likely to become the world’s largest supplier in terms of full-year module shipments in 2012.[8]
Yingli manufactures crystalline silicon solar PV modules, including both, monocrystalline and multicrystalline. Its two primary solar module product lines are the monocrystalline PANDA Series and the multicrystalline YGE Series.
Yingli Solar’s PANDA product line was developed through an in-house collaboration between the Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands (ECN) and Amtech Systems, Inc. that aimed to create a new, more efficient solar cell. PANDA modules use n-doped silicon instead of the industry’s standard p-type silicon, allowing a more efficient conversion of infrared light into electricity, and lower initial degradation rate.[citation needed] As the PANDA product line is claimed by the company to achieve performance ratings of up to 16.5%, it is best suited to commercial or residential applications where maximum energy output is essential due to space constraints.[9]
Yingli Solar’s YGE Series is its primary product line. The company claims that these multicrystalline modules have efficiencies of up to 15.4%, for use in commercial, residential, and utility-scale projects.[10]
Yingli Solar’s manufacturing facilities are located in Baoding, Haikou, Tianjin, and Hengshui. Yingli Americas, a regional subsidiary of Yingli Green Energy, operates a regional research and development lab, the PV Testing Lab (PVTL), in South San Francisco, California. The PVTL conducts product characterization and quality control testing, and provides customers with system modeling support.[2]
Social responsibility[edit]
Yingli is the largest and first official module supplier to GRID Alternatives, an Oakland, California-based non-profit solar installer that provides low-income families with solar energy systems free of charge. By the end of 2012, Yingli will have helped over 800 families save substantially on their electricity bills through its support of GRID Alternatives. Thousands of job seekers will also receive professional training through this partnership.[11]
Yingli has also sponsored the United States Soccer Federation to launch the Powering Advancement with Solar and Soccer (PASS) program. The PASS program provides schools in disadvantaged communities with solar energy systems and support for their healthy lifestyle programs. The program was launched at the KIPP DC: Will Academy charter school in Washington, DC on June 1, 2012.[12]
As part of its sponsorship of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, Yingli participates in the “Football for Hope. Energy for Hope.” initiative that aims to bring football training and community centers to communities in Africa. Yingli is working with FIFA to provide these twenty football training and community centers with clean solar energy.[4]

Yingli (Chinese: 英利), formally Yingli Green Energy Holding Company Limited (Chinese: 英利绿色能源控股有限公司; pinyin: Yīnglì Lǜsè Néngyuán Kònggǔ Yǒuxiàn Gōngsī - . Yingli Green Energy Holding Company Limited (NYSE: YGE), known as "Yingli Solar," is one of the world's leading solar panel manufacturers. Yingli Green Energy's manufacturing covers the photovoltaic value chain from ingot casting and wafering through solar cell production and solar panel assembly. Yingli's photovoltaic module capacity is 4 GWs.
Yingli is headquartered in Baoding, China and has more than 30 regional subsidiaries and branch offices and has distributed more than 15 GW solar panels to customers worldwide. Yingli Solar was established in 1997 and was the world’s largest PV module manufacturers in the world in 2012 and 2013. Yingli was founded by Liansheng Miao who was a pioneer in Chinese solar manufacturing. Mao worked to persuade other people to encourage the growth of Chinese solar industry as Miao saw that solar manufacturing is an industry in which China can be competitive.
Yingli expanded production capacity at a time module prices slumped. Yingli recovered slowly and since early 2015 has faced financial difficulties and has been going through a debt restructuring out of court. In 2015 signed a contract with LONGi to cooperate on monocrystalline products.[1] In the first quarter of 2016 Yingli posted a profit first time since 2011. Yingli has cut workforce and decreased R&D spending. Yingli's cost per watt is 41 cents. The company was a sponsor of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, U.S. men’s and women’s national soccer teams, and FC Bayern Munich.[2]
Yingli is a member of the ‘Silicon Module Super League’ (SMSL), a group of big-six c-Si module suppliers in the solar PV industry today. The other five members of the group are Canadian Solar, Hanwha Q CELLS, JA Solar, Trina Solar and Jinko Solar.[3]

History[edit]
Yingli Green Energy was established in 1998 by Liansheng Miao, who remains the company’s chairman and CEO. Yingli Green Energy began module production in 2003, with a capacity of 3 MW. By 2004, Yingli reached 6 MW in ingot/wafer/cell production, and 50 MW in module production.[citation needed] The company also expanded into Germany and achieved certifications from UL, the IEC and TÜV Rheinland.[citation needed] After continued expansion and fundraising efforts, Yingli Green Energy completed its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in June 2007. In 2009, Yingli achieved 1 GW of cumulative output of solar modules since commercial production began in 2003.[citation needed] Today, Yingli Green Energy has a balanced vertically integrated production capacity of 2,450 MW per year.[2]
In 2009, the company acquired Cyber Power, a development stage enterprise with plans to begin production of solar-grade polysilicon. Yingli Solar is expected to start trial polysilicon by the end of 2010. Growing at a fast rate, 2010 first quarter reports indicated that it was Yingli Solar's most profitable quarter to date.
In 2010, Yingli Green Energy became the first Chinese company and the first renewable energy company to sponsor the FIFA World Cup.[4] Yingli is also a sponsor of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. It is supplying modules to 2014 FIFA World Cup stadiums, including the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro.[5] Building on its partnership with FIFA, Yingli is also a sponsor of FC Bayern München and the U.S. Soccer Women’s and Men’s National Teams.
Products[edit]
Over 15 GW of Yingli solar modules are deployed worldwide.[citation needed] In 2012, Yingli Green Energy reached a production capacity of 2,450 MW per year, making it the largest solar module manufacturer in the world in terms of module production capacity.[6] It also became the world’s leading solar module supplier by sales revenue and shipments in Q1 2012.[7] Also in 2012, Ray Lian predicted that Yingli Green Energy was likely to become the world’s largest supplier in terms of full-year module shipments in 2012.[8]
Yingli manufactures crystalline silicon solar PV modules, including both, monocrystalline and multicrystalline. Its two primary solar module product lines are the monocrystalline PANDA Series and the multicrystalline YGE Series.
Yingli Solar’s PANDA product line was developed through an in-house collaboration between the Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands (ECN) and Amtech Systems, Inc. that aimed to create a new, more efficient solar cell. PANDA modules use n-doped silicon instead of the industry’s standard p-type silicon, allowing a more efficient conversion of infrared light into electricity, and lower initial degradation rate.[citation needed] As the PANDA product line is claimed by the company to achieve performance ratings of up to 16.5%, it is best suited to commercial or residential applications where maximum energy output is essential due to space constraints.[9]
Yingli Solar’s YGE Series is its primary product line. The company claims that these multicrystalline modules have efficiencies of up to 15.4%, for use in commercial, residential, and utility-scale projects.[10]
Yingli Solar’s manufacturing facilities are located in Baoding, Haikou, Tianjin, and Hengshui. Yingli Americas, a regional subsidiary of Yingli Green Energy, operates a regional research and development lab, the PV Testing Lab (PVTL), in South San Francisco, California. The PVTL conducts product characterization and quality control testing, and provides customers with system modeling support.[2]
Social responsibility[edit]
Yingli is the largest and first official module supplier to GRID Alternatives, an Oakland, California-based non-profit solar installer that provides low-income families with solar energy systems free of charge. By the end of 2012, Yingli will have helped over 800 families save substantially on their electricity bills through its support of GRID Alternatives. Thousands of job seekers will also receive professional training through this partnership.[11]
Yingli has also sponsored the United States Soccer Federation to launch the Powering Advancement with Solar and Soccer (PASS) program. The PASS program provides schools in disadvantaged communities with solar energy systems and support for their healthy lifestyle programs. The program was launched at the KIPP DC: Will Academy charter school in Washington, DC on June 1, 2012.[12]
As part of its sponsorship of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, Yingli participates in the “Football for Hope. Energy for Hope.” initiative that aims to bring football training and community centers to communities in Africa. Yingli is working with FIFA to provide these twenty football training and community centers with clean solar energy.[4]

Yingli (Chinese: 英利), formally Yingli Green Energy Holding Company Limited (Chinese: 英利绿色能源控股有限公司; pinyin: Yīnglì Lǜsè Néngyuán Kònggǔ Yǒuxiàn Gōngsī - . Yingli Green Energy Holding Company Limited (NYSE: YGE), known as "Yingli Solar," is one of the world's leading solar panel manufacturers. Yingli Green Energy's manufacturing covers the photovoltaic value chain from ingot casting and wafering through solar cell production and solar panel assembly. Yingli's photovoltaic module capacity is 4 GWs.
Yingli is headquartered in Baoding, China and has more than 30 regional subsidiaries and branch offices and has distributed more than 15 GW solar panels to customers worldwide. Yingli Solar was established in 1997 and was the world’s largest PV module manufacturers in the world in 2012 and 2013. Yingli was founded by Liansheng Miao who was a pioneer in Chinese solar manufacturing. Mao worked to persuade other people to encourage the growth of Chinese solar industry as Miao saw that solar manufacturing is an industry in which China can be competitive.
Yingli expanded production capacity at a time module prices slumped. Yingli recovered slowly and since early 2015 has faced financial difficulties and has been going through a debt restructuring out of court. In 2015 signed a contract with LONGi to cooperate on monocrystalline products.[1] In the first quarter of 2016 Yingli posted a profit first time since 2011. Yingli has cut workforce and decreased R&D spending. Yingli's cost per watt is 41 cents. The company was a sponsor of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, U.S. men’s and women’s national soccer teams, and FC Bayern Munich.[2]
Yingli is a member of the ‘Silicon Module Super League’ (SMSL), a group of big-six c-Si module suppliers in the solar PV industry today. The other five members of the group are Canadian Solar, Hanwha Q CELLS, JA Solar, Trina Solar and Jinko Solar.[3]

History[edit]
Yingli Green Energy was established in 1998 by Liansheng Miao, who remains the company’s chairman and CEO. Yingli Green Energy began module production in 2003, with a capacity of 3 MW. By 2004, Yingli reached 6 MW in ingot/wafer/cell production, and 50 MW in module production.[citation needed] The company also expanded into Germany and achieved certifications from UL, the IEC and TÜV Rheinland.[citation needed] After continued expansion and fundraising efforts, Yingli Green Energy completed its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in June 2007. In 2009, Yingli achieved 1 GW of cumulative output of solar modules since commercial production began in 2003.[citation needed] Today, Yingli Green Energy has a balanced vertically integrated production capacity of 2,450 MW per year.[2]
In 2009, the company acquired Cyber Power, a development stage enterprise with plans to begin production of solar-grade polysilicon. Yingli Solar is expected to start trial polysilicon by the end of 2010. Growing at a fast rate, 2010 first quarter reports indicated that it was Yingli Solar's most profitable quarter to date.
In 2010, Yingli Green Energy became the first Chinese company and the first renewable energy company to sponsor the FIFA World Cup.[4] Yingli is also a sponsor of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. It is supplying modules to 2014 FIFA World Cup stadiums, including the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro.[5] Building on its partnership with FIFA, Yingli is also a sponsor of FC Bayern München and the U.S. Soccer Women’s and Men’s National Teams.
Products[edit]
Over 15 GW of Yingli solar modules are deployed worldwide.[citation needed] In 2012, Yingli Green Energy reached a production capacity of 2,450 MW per year, making it the largest solar module manufacturer in the world in terms of module production capacity.[6] It also became the world’s leading solar module supplier by sales revenue and shipments in Q1 2012.[7] Also in 2012, Ray Lian predicted that Yingli Green Energy was likely to become the world’s largest supplier in terms of full-year module shipments in 2012.[8]
Yingli manufactures crystalline silicon solar PV modules, including both, monocrystalline and multicrystalline. Its two primary solar module product lines are the monocrystalline PANDA Series and the multicrystalline YGE Series.
Yingli Solar’s PANDA product line was developed through an in-house collaboration between the Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands (ECN) and Amtech Systems, Inc. that aimed to create a new, more efficient solar cell. PANDA modules use n-doped silicon instead of the industry’s standard p-type silicon, allowing a more efficient conversion of infrared light into electricity, and lower initial degradation rate.[citation needed] As the PANDA product line is claimed by the company to achieve performance ratings of up to 16.5%, it is best suited to commercial or residential applications where maximum energy output is essential due to space constraints.[9]
Yingli Solar’s YGE Series is its primary product line. The company claims that these multicrystalline modules have efficiencies of up to 15.4%, for use in commercial, residential, and utility-scale projects.[10]
Yingli Solar’s manufacturing facilities are located in Baoding, Haikou, Tianjin, and Hengshui. Yingli Americas, a regional subsidiary of Yingli Green Energy, operates a regional research and development lab, the PV Testing Lab (PVTL), in South San Francisco, California. The PVTL conducts product characterization and quality control testing, and provides customers with system modeling support.[2]
Social responsibility[edit]
Yingli is the largest and first official module supplier to GRID Alternatives, an Oakland, California-based non-profit solar installer that provides low-income families with solar energy systems free of charge. By the end of 2012, Yingli will have helped over 800 families save substantially on their electricity bills through its support of GRID Alternatives. Thousands of job seekers will also receive professional training through this partnership.[11]
Yingli has also sponsored the United States Soccer Federation to launch the Powering Advancement with Solar and Soccer (PASS) program. The PASS program provides schools in disadvantaged communities with solar energy systems and support for their healthy lifestyle programs. The program was launched at the KIPP DC: Will Academy charter school in Washington, DC on June 1, 2012.[12]
As part of its sponsorship of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, Yingli participates in the “Football for Hope. Energy for Hope.” initiative that aims to bring football training and community centers to communities in Africa. Yingli is working with FIFA to provide these twenty football training and community centers with clean solar energy.[4]

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM) N/A     EPS (TTM)  $-18.49      Market Cap $42.35 M     Shares Outstanding 18.18 M     Public Float N/A     Yield YGE has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 4    2.08      Net Money Flow ($)  6,861    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
