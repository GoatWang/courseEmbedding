        Wyoming Board of Medicine suspends Cody doctor 
    


Associated Press

Jan 31, 2012


















































































CHEYENNE, Wyo. - The Wyoming Board of Medicine has temporarily
suspended the license of a Cody doctor, alleging he falsely
certified that a patient needed emergency surgery just days before
the man died from an overdose of pain medication.
The board took the action Saturday against Dr. John H.
Schneider, Jr., a neurosurgeon with practices in Cody and Billings,
Mont.
Attempts to reach Schneider for comment were unsuccessful
Tuesday. A Cody lawyer who represents him in other matters declined
comment.

Schneider performed back surgery Nov. 28 on a Montana man,
identified by the board only as John Doe, who checked in that day
at West Park Hospital in Cody, the board's order states.
A board investigation determined that Schneider looked at an MRI
on Nov. 28 that the patient's Montana doctors had prepared on Nov.
20 and stated he determined that emergency surgery was required.
The order states that Schneider didn't order a new MRI.
Schneider stated in his dictated notes that he attempted to
reach the man's Montana doctors before the surgery but his calls
weren't returned. The board's order states that the man's medical
facility in Montana was unable to confirm that Schneider tried to
contact doctors there.
The order states that the patient was discharged from the Cody
hospital on Dec. 1 with prescriptions from Schneider for pain
medication. The man and his wife returned to their Montana home,
where she found him dead the next morning.
A pathologist determined the man died from an overdose of four
pain medications. The board's order states that all had been
prescribed by Schneider.
"It is believed that Dr. Schneider violated the Wyoming Medical
Practice Act by making a false, fraudulent or deceptive statement
in the medical records regarding the emergent nature of Mr. Doe's
condition and the need for immediate surgery," the order
states.

The order also alleges Schneider violated the Wyoming Medical
Practice Act through his prescription of painkillers and by
discharging the man from the hospital without adequate provisions
to make sure he was receiving adequate oxygen given his medical
condition.
The board alleges that Schneider's office had asked the man's
health insurance provider in mid-November whether his policy would
cover surgery. The company responded that it could not cover
surgery by Schneider because coverage was limited to specific
providers. The board's order states the insurance provider would
cover emergency surgery wherever it was necessary.
Kevin D. Bohnenblust, executive director of the Wyoming Board of
Medicine, said Tuesday the board could hold a hearing on the matter
as soon as mid-April.

"Nothing has been finally adjudicated, but there's evidence that
suggests that's what happened, so we're moving forward with it,"
Bohnenblust said.
Schneider was named last month as a defendant in a federal
lawsuit filed by Jimmie G. Biles, another Cody doctor. Biles claims
that Schneider and his wife got an Indiana woman to send a mass
mailing to more than 14,000 residents of north central Wyoming in
2010 disparaging Biles' medical practice.
The lawsuit claims that Schneider hoped the mailing would
persuade people to seek medical attention from another doctor who
would refer neurosurgical patients to Schneider, who has not yet
filed a response to the lawsuit.
Biles also is pressing a lawsuit against the Indiana woman,
alleging she took money from Schneider to distribute the
fliers.
U.S. District Judge Alan B. Johnson on Jan. 6 denied a request
from Schneider and his wife to dismiss subpoenas seeking records of
any payments or communications between them and the Indiana
woman.
Lawyer Laurence Stinson of Cody represents Schneider in the
federal litigation and declined comment on Tuesday. He said he did
not represent Schneider before the medical board.

Healthgrades also receives sanction and malpractice data throughout the year, depending on how frequently the state medical boards release updates. We remove a newly sanctioned doctor from the Recognized Doctor list as soon as we receive the information. However, it is important to note that malpractice information is publically available in only 14 states.Media & PublicationsDr. Schneider has no media or publications listed.Background Check n/a Malpractice Claims not availableHealthgrades does not collect malpractice information for Wisconsin.What is medical malpracticeWhat is medical malpractice?Medical malpractice is issued when negligence by a doctor causes injury to a patient. For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.Board CertificationsWhy It Matters: Dr. Schneider's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor.

More Why It Matters: Dr. Schneider's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor. Board certification is an official recognition given to doctors who have met specific requirements set by national medical specialty boards in the United States.Board certification indicates that a doctor is highly qualified in the medical field in which he or she practices. A board-certified doctor is more likely than a non-board-certified doctor to have the most current skills and knowledge about how to treat your medical condition.Dr. Schneider is Board Certified in:Hand SurgeryAccrediting Board: American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery *Orthopedic SurgeryAccrediting Board: American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery ** This information is proprietary data maintained in a copyrighted database compilation owned by the American Board of Medical Specialties.
