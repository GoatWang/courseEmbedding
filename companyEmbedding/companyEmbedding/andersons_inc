A full explanation of our values and commitment to our employees can be found in The Andersons’ Statement of Principles. Written by our founders, these principles are still followed today and are keys to our success as individuals and as a company.











"My internship at The Andersons has taught me more than I could have imagined. My duties as a human resources intern were diverse and ever-changing. I gained transferable job skills, worked with cross-functional groups and networked with other employees. This exposure gave me the opportunity to grow my career in human resources."Andrea Ferguson





"What I like about The Andersons is the level of involvement we get in the planning process every year. We look at expenses, expected flows, budgets, etc., and communicate any changes or concerns to make the best decisions possible from a financial, quality and safety perspective. It’s great to see how our work helps provide direction for the company."Sergio Hernandez





"I like that The Andersons really seeks out the philanthropic part of its mission. They do this by not just donating money, but by also encouraging and providing opportunities for employees to get involved with different community organizations. "Ashly Bower





"When I interviewed at the Andersons and read the mission statement that stated, “serving God by serving others,” I knew that this was the place I wanted to be. I notice this service not only with our customers, but also with employees. The staff here are always willing to help each other, and the company is a huge advocate for career development, which shows how much they value their employees. There’s certainly no shortage of education and training."Andre Page

FAQs

General Questions

 
How do I choose the right Andersons Cob product?
Choosing the right product is all about your particular application. Our applications page is a good place to start. 
 
What is your manufacturing process?
For more information on our manufacturing process, click here to download a brochure.
 
Are Andersons Cob Products safe?
Yes. Our products are all-natural, environmentally-friendly products made from corncobs, and are a renewable biomass resource.
 
Do Andersons Cob Products produce a lot of dust?
Our products are virtually dust-free and are very resistant to attrition or breakdown on use.
 
Do Andersons Cob Products contain any silica?
No. Our products are silica-free. In fact, our products all carry the USDA bio-preferred label.
 
Do Andersons Cob Products products require special storage?
No, but they should be stored in a clean dry place, as excessive moisture could affect performance.
 
Are Andersons Cob Products likely to ignite?
No. Our products are non-sparking, but will burn when exposed to flame or very high temperatures.
 
Blasting and Restoration Questions

 
How much Grit-O’Cobs product will I need for blast cleaning?
The volume needed will depend on the specific application, but in general consumption rates are about 350 lbs/hour with a 1/4″ nozzle and up to 650 lbs/hour with a 3/8″ nozzle for blast cleaning. Blast cleaning of log homes can require usage of ½ pound to 1 pound per square foot.
 
Are Grit-O’Cobs products more expensive than others for blasting applications?
Grit-O’Cobs is economical, providing more cubic feet per pound of material. No organic solvents, masking or steam washing required.
 
Will Grit-O’Cobs damage the surface of my historic building or log home while blasting?
No. Grit-O’Cobs has proven to be the finest abrasive possible in terms of removing old finishes without gouging the wood. What used to take weeks can usually be accomplished in less than a day.
 
Can I use my sandblaster with Grit-O’Cobs products?
Standard sandblasting equipment can be used, including pressure pots, gravity pots and cabinets.
 
Can I use a mixture of sand, glass beads, or aluminum oxide & Grit-O’Cobs when I sandblast?
Yes, Grit-O’Cobs is often used to extend the life of a more expensive abrasive or provide a specific mixture for a special application.
 
Will I need to mask off glass areas using Grit-O’Cobs for blast cleaning?
With a Mohs hardness of about 4.5, Grit-O’Cobs should not harm or etch glass, so no masking of glass areas is necessarily required. Caution: We recommend testing a small area to determine if masking may be required.
 
If I use Grit-O’Cobs products to blast-clean my deck, what should I do with the expended material?
Since Grit-O’Cobs is 100% biodegradable, you don’t have to do anything with it. If you plan to paint or re-seal your deck immediately after cleaning, you may want to use an air hose or blower to remove any excess material.

Andersons Humic Solutions











































Start With Your Soil
Humic DG  |  Black Gypsum DG
UltraMate LQ  |  K-Mate SG






Humic DG
The benefits of all three humic fractions - humic acid, fulvic acid, and humin - in an easy to use, dispersing granule.






Black Gypsum DG
A unique bio-amendment combining natural gypsum and humate in one, homogenous dispersing granule. 






UltraMate LQ
Sulfonated potassium humate liquid that completely mixes when added directly to liquid fertilizer, micronutrient or pesticide formulations over a wide range of pH values.






K-Mate SG
Concentrated, soluble granule formulation of potassium humate providing maximum efficiency in solutions ranging from 6-12 pH.



























Products
The Andersons Humate Products - Humic DG, Black Gypsum DG, UltraMate LQ and K-Mate SG - represent the next generation of soil health. These humic acid-based soil amendments are designed to reduce the effect of the environmental stresses of water, temperature and soil conditions on crops. With two technology platforms and two humic acid delivery methods, these products work in a program approach to provide the crop access to humic substances throughout the growing season. Read More...



Applications
As the major organic component of soil, humates are used in many applications, from specialty agriculture and horticulture to professional turf and large-scale farming. Acting as a natural soil conditioner, organic chelator and microbial stimulator, humic acid has a unique carbon matrix which includes a high concentration of trace minerals and organic acids. Humics work to enhance the plant’s ability to take in essential nutrients and to improve soil structure. Read More...



Technology
At The Andersons, we pride ourselves on bringing to market some of the highest quality and most technologically-advanced products available. Our line of humic acid-based soil amendments utilize two technology platforms - Dispersing Granule Technology (Humic DG & Black Gypsum DG) and Soluble Granule Technology (K-Mate SG) - delivering humic substances to the plant with some of the most efficient and biologically-advanced humic acid delivery systems on the market today.
