About Us




Criteria



We ourselves and through our affiliates invest in small, medium and large-sized companies, typically with revenues from $50 million up to $10 billion (depending on the specific industry sector) with high-quality, value-added products, favorable growth prospects and proven, motivated management teams who take notable equity ownership positions in their companies.
Focus selected types of investments
Control private equity investments:
We buy companies which possess leading market share positions, proven technologies, proprietary concepts and/or strong brand names; in short, companies with a sustainable competitive advantage. Moreover, we seek to participate in industries that have positive growth characteristics or stable competitive dynamics, and are not highly cyclical or capital intensive.
Distressed assets and special situations:
We buy companies with sound fundamentals but which are now under-performing or the companies are facing strategic or operational challenges, liquidity crisis, geopolitical insanity, economic flux or complex structural issues. In short, we are looking for distressed companies with the potential to turnaround.
Growth / Development capital
We seek partnerships with publicly quoted companies to provide the capital, expertise and relationships necessary to build market-leading companies. We are especially looking for companies in their early and late stage development with proven technologies, products and services and the same must have their shares traded on a stock exchange or a regulated trading platform and have minimal or no revenue.





Our Approach



Driving Value
We assist entrepreneur managers of promising companies to build and to sustain a significant leadership position in their industry. Milost’s partners, investors, advisors and associates have the depth of professional expertise and experience necessary to identify, nurture and drive select small, medium- to large-size companies around the globe. Milost is uniquely placed, with its experience and investors’ networks, to help innovative growth companies realize their full potential.
Operational Discipline
As your company grows you need operational processes in place to withstand growth, including regular financial and operating reporting, and enhanced management information systems. Milost helps you have confidence in your systems and management so that you have more time to focus on profitable growth.
Network
Do you want to reach leading experts in your business to get their opinion? Milost has a global network of business contacts in a wide range of sectors who will share their business and industry insights and their networks.
Funding
Milost invests its own capital alongside yours in order to accelerate your company’s growth. We also invest our time and intellectual capital derived from years of experience.
Marketing
Do you know who your customers are? Why do they buy your products? What are your most profitable products? Who else could be your potential customers and how can you reach them? How much should you spend on marketing? Milost helps you understand your markets so that sales efforts are most efficient.
Hands-On
We take an active role on the Board of Directors and conduct operating reviews with management on a regular basis. We are committed to making substantial contributions to the success of our investments. We invest both intellectual and financial capital into our portfolio companies.
Management
How many people should run the business? Are the tasks properly delegated? Are the managers motivated to stay on for the medium to long-term? What type of professionals should you hire for top and middle-management, as the company grows? We know how to get the best out of people.
Acquisitions
Do you want to acquire competing or complementary companies but are limited by transactional experience? Milost’s professionals have collectively bought and sold well over a hundred companies and have first-hand experience in helping you pick the right targets, as well as execute the transaction.





Global Presence



Our global teams are the epitome of the global private equity market, they work together as a collaborative across different industries, economies and political climates to apply groundbreaking acquisition and investment strategies in order to spark cutting-edge thinking and deliver out of this world returns. With presence in all global financial centres and offices in 20 countries across the world, we are surely in the forefront of the M&A Market.






Our Businesses



We are a buyout firm and our unique approach aligns incentives through equity ownership and preserves the entrepreneurial orientation that distinguishes the most successful buyout firm.
Each transaction has been negotiated individually within a proven framework based on the specific characteristics of the firm and the goals of its Board. Although the specific structure of each transaction is tailored to meet the needs of a particular company, in all cases, we establish a meaningful equity interest in the company, with the remaining equity interests retained by the management of the companies we buy. Typically, as a result of an LBO/MBO by Milost, a company's equity is more broadly distributed among the management partners, providing both senior and junior managers the motivation to increase the value of their equity through ongoing out of this world performance and client service.
Our buyout structure provides company managers with continued operational autonomy and the ability to leverage our scale in a number of areas, including product distribution, operations, technology and marketing. Our broad experience in partnering our investment banking firm has enabled us to successfully identify and develop these cross-company initiatives to enhance revenue growth and strengthen the business operations of our companies.
