Puffer-Sweiven HistoryBefore Puffer-Sweiven
While fighting a disastrous fire in Marshalltown, Iowa, a young water works engineer was forced to hand-throttle the city’s steam-driven pumps throughout the night.
That engineer was William Fisher, and the year was 1876. Exhausted from that experience, he decided there must be a better way to maintain water pressure as downstream conditions changed. And there was a better way – thanks to this young engineer’s inventive mind – it was called the type 1 Pump Governor. Records indicate that manufacture of this new device began in 1880.
Eight years later, the company was reorganized and incorporated as the Fisher Governor Company. From 1905 through 1962, the Fisher sales representative network was established and began to expand throughout North America. 
Puffer-Sweiven’s Beginning
Puffer-Sweiven was founded as the Fisher sales representative for the Texas Gulf Coast region on November 11, 1945 by former Fisher employees Ken Puffer and Bud Sweiven.
