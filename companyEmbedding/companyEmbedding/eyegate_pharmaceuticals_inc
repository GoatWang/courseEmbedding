Eyegate Pharma stock surges 11% after receiving Valeant milestone payment
Eyegate Pharmaceuticals Inc.  stock surged 11% in premarket trade Monday after the company said it had received its first milestone payment from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.  resulting from a February licensing deal for Eyegate's EyeGate II Delivery System and its EGP-437 combination product. The delivery system is an alternative to eye drops and ocular injections, and EGP-437 is being developed for post-operative pain and inflammation in patients who have had ocular surgery. Valeant shares surged 1.6% in premarket trade. The companies did not specify the amount of the milestone payment or what it was paid specifically for. Under the agreement, Valeant paid Eyegate $4 million, with up to about $34 million for certain development and regulatory milestones and up to $65 million for certain sales-based milestones and royalties. Eyegate shares have plummeted 28.1% over the last three months and Valeant shares have dropped 17.3%, compared with a 0.8% rise in the S&P 500 .

Eyegate Pharmaceuticals Inc.


            
            EyeGate Pharma is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company that is focused on developing and commercializing therapeutics and drug delivery systems for treating diseases of the eye. Its products include EGP-437 and EyeGate II Delivery System. EGP-437 for the treatment of non-infectious anterior uveitis, a debilitating form of intraocular inflammation of the anterior portion of the uvea, such as the iris or ciliary body. The EyeGate II Delivery System features a compact, elegant, and easy-to-use device that delivers drugs non-invasively and quickly into the ocular tissues through the use of iontophoresis, which can accelerate the onset of action, dramatically reduce treatment frequency versus eye drops and sustain therapeutic effect. The company was founded in 1998 and is headquartered in Waltham, MA.

                EyeGate Pharma is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company that is focused on developing and commercializing therapeutics and drug delivery systems for treating diseases of the eye. Its products include EGP-437 and EyeGate II Delivery System. EGP-437 for the treatment of non-infectious anterior uveitis, a debilitating form of intraocular inflammation of the anterior portion of the uvea, such as the iris or ciliary body. The EyeGate II Delivery System features a compact, elegant, and easy-to-use device that delivers drugs non-invasively and quickly into the ocular tissues through the use of iontophoresis, which can accelerate the onset of action, dramatically reduce treatment frequency versus eye drops and sustain therapeutic effect. The company was founded in 1998 and is headquartered in Waltham, MA.

Eyegate Pharma stock surges 11% after receiving Valeant milestone payment
Eyegate Pharmaceuticals Inc.  stock surged 11% in premarket trade Monday after the company said it had received its first milestone payment from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.  resulting from a February licensing deal for Eyegate's EyeGate II Delivery System and its EGP-437 combination product. The delivery system is an alternative to eye drops and ocular injections, and EGP-437 is being developed for post-operative pain and inflammation in patients who have had ocular surgery. Valeant shares surged 1.6% in premarket trade. The companies did not specify the amount of the milestone payment or what it was paid specifically for. Under the agreement, Valeant paid Eyegate $4 million, with up to about $34 million for certain development and regulatory milestones and up to $65 million for certain sales-based milestones and royalties. Eyegate shares have plummeted 28.1% over the last three months and Valeant shares have dropped 17.3%, compared with a 0.8% rise in the S&P 500 .

Eyegate Pharmaceuticals Inc.


            
            EyeGate Pharma is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company that is focused on developing and commercializing therapeutics and drug delivery systems for treating diseases of the eye. Its products include EGP-437 and EyeGate II Delivery System. EGP-437 for the treatment of non-infectious anterior uveitis, a debilitating form of intraocular inflammation of the anterior portion of the uvea, such as the iris or ciliary body. The EyeGate II Delivery System features a compact, elegant, and easy-to-use device that delivers drugs non-invasively and quickly into the ocular tissues through the use of iontophoresis, which can accelerate the onset of action, dramatically reduce treatment frequency versus eye drops and sustain therapeutic effect. The company was founded in 1998 and is headquartered in Waltham, MA.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

CMHA-S Platform



 


Home > Technology > CMHA-S Platform 

CMHA-S Platform

The CMHA-S platform is based on hyaluronic acid (HA), a naturally occurring polymer that is important in many physiological processes, including development, wound healing, tissue homeostasis, and joint lubrication. To create hydrogels, the HA is modified to create thiolated carboxymethyl HA (CMHA-S) that is then crosslinked together through the thiol groups. Some products are disulfide crosslinked while others utilize a crosslinker. The crosslinking slows degradation of the HA backbone and provides a matrix for incorporating therapeutic agents. Variations in the number of thiols per molecule, the molecular weight of the polymer, the concentration of the polymer, type of crosslinking, and incorporation of other molecules provides a highly versatile platform that can be tailored to a specific application. Products can be formatted as gels, films, sponges, or powders, and crosslinking can be done in situ.

Repeating molecular units of thiolated, cross-linked hyaluronic acid.
©Glenn Prestwich, Ph.D., University of Utah.
EyeGate’s first product from the CMHA-S platform is an eye drop formulation, the EyeGate Ocular Bandage Gel, that is applied topically. It provides a thin coating to the surface of the eye, serving as a protectant to facilitate and accelerate corneal re-epithelization. It is intended for the management of corneal epithelial defects and for the acceleration of re-epithelization of the ocular surface following surgery, injection, traumatic, and non-traumatic conditions.
Additionally, cross-linking allows the product’s viscosity to be modified to meet optimum ocular needs. The increased viscosity and non-covalent muco-adhesive interfacial forces improve residence time in the tear film, thus providing a coating that aids and promotes re-epithelization of the ocular surface via physical protection. The EyeGate Ocular Bandage provides significant mechanical improvement over non-cross-linked hyaluronic acid products and other hydrogels by forming a degradation-resistant coating.  Pilot preclinical studies suggest that this chemical modification will prolong dwell time on the ocular surface, thus providing a smooth continuous clear barrier without blur, minimizing mechanical lid friction, and reducing repeat injury, which can mechanically protect the ocular surface and accelerate corneal re-epithelization (Burdick and Prestwich 2011).
The Ocular Bandage is presently available commercially as a veterinary device, manufactured by SentrX Animal Care and sold in the U.S. by Bayer Animal Health as Remend® Corneal Repair, indicated for use in the management of superficial corneal ulcers. The product has been used for 5 years in dogs, cats and horses, with an excellent safely. The composition of the veterinary product is identical to that of the EyeGate Ocular Bandage Gel.

About

EyeGate Pharma (NASDAQ: EYEG) is a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company that is focused on developing and commercializing products for treating diseases and disorders of the eye. EGP-437, the Company’s first and only product in clinical trials, incorporates a reformulated topically active corticosteroid, Dexamethasone Phosphate that is delivered into the ocular tissues through EyeGate’s proprietary innovative drug delivery system, the EyeGate® II Delivery System. In addition, EyeGate is developing, through its wholly-owned Jade subsidiary, products using cross-linked thiolated carboxymethyl hyaluronic acid (“CMHA-S”), a modified form of the natural polymer hyaluronic acid (HA), which possesses unique physical and chemical properties such as hydration and healing properties. The ability of CMHA-S to adhere longer to the ocular surface, resist degradation and protect the ocular surface makes it well-suited for treating various ocular surface injuries. EyeGate intends to initiate a clinical study for Jade’s lead product candidate for corneal epithelial defects by the end of the year 2016.

Ocular Bandage Gel (CMHA-S platform)

Photorefractive keratectomy
Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) is an efficacious alternative to patients seeking surgical correction of refractive errors who are not suitable candidates for laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) due to inadequate corneal thickness, larger pupil size, history of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), or anterior basement membrane disease. 
PRK involves controlled mechanical removal of corneal epithelium with subsequent excimer laser photoablation of the underlying Bowman’s layer and anterior stroma, including the subepithelial nerve plexus. The military prefers PRK as a refractive surgery due to the stability of the PRK incision and the absence of risk for flap dislocation during military active duty. Although this procedure yields desirable visual acuity results, common complications of the procedure include post-operative pain secondary to the epithelial defects, risk of corneal infection prior to re-epithelization of the large epithelial defect, corneal haze formation, decreased contrast sensitivity, and slower visual recovery (Alio et al. 1998, Ben-Sira et al. 1997, Lohmann et al. 1991, Loewenstein et al. 1997).
Corneal wounds created while performing PRK are an excellent model for other epithelial defects, as these patients undergo the creation of large 8 to 9 mm epithelial defects following a standardized protocol to perform refractive laser surgery. The corneal wounds are expected, based on historical data, to heal within 3-5 days, although in some cases these defects can take longer. Pain is a significant side effect, as is a risk of infection, while the defects have not healed, thus creating a need for a device that can accelerate time to wound closure. Furthermore, given the pain and risk of corneal haze from delayed healing, a product that can help accelerate corneal re-epithelization could also improve time to best visual acuity outcomes. In preclinical models using a PRK wound created in healthy rabbits, these large epithelial defects were observed to have accelerated corneal wound closure by at least one day after treatment with CMHA-S applied QID versus PBS (Yang et al. 2010). This amount of accelerated closure is clinically significant and fulfills an unmet need as discussed above.
The EyeGate Ocular Bandage has been shown to provide a mechanical barrier that aids in the management of corneal epithelial defects and accelerates re-epithelization in both preclinical studies and in clinical ophthalmic veterinary use (Chen and Abatangelo 1999, Wirostko et al. 2014, Yang et al. 2010).

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

(NYSE: VRX and TSX: VRX) ("Valeant") and EyeGate Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (EYEG) ("EyeGate"), a specialty pharmaceutical company that focuses on developing and commercializing products for treating diseases and disorders of the eye, today announced that they have entered into an exclusive, worldwide licensing agreement through which EyeGate has granted a subsidiary of Valeant exclusive, worldwide commercial and manufacturing rights to the EyeGate® II Delivery System and EGP-437 combination product candidate for the treatment of post-operative pain and inflammation in ocular surgery patients.This partnership follows a 2015 agreement in which Valeant secured an exclusive worldwide license for its subsidiary to this product for uveitis. Valeant has maintained its right of last negotiation to license the product for other indications."We are pleased to extend our relationship with EyeGate, and to obtain the global commercial and manufacturing rights to the EyeGate II Delivery System for the indication of post-operative inflammation and pain in ocular surgery patients. We believe that the product has significant potential in the market as part of our Bausch + Lomb business and applaud EyeGate for a remarkable job in advancing the product's development in both uveitis and cataract surgery," said Joseph C. Papa , Chairman and CEO of Valeant. "We look forward to further supporting EyeGate as they continue their progress in bringing this product to market to meet the needs of our customers and their patients.""This second licensing agreement with Valeant provides an important validation of both the clinical and commercial potential of iontophoretic EGP-437 . We believe that Bausch + Lomb's sales, marketing and commercial capabilities in ophthalmology are unrivalled, making them the optimal partner to bring this unique product to market," said Stephen From , President and Chief Executive Officer of EyeGate. "For the approximately 3 million cataract surgery patients in the U.S. each year, adherence to the post-operative therapeutic regimen is imperative. As many of these patients are older and may struggle with self-administration of corticosteroid eye drops, we believe that iontophoretic EGP-437 administered by the eye care practitioner will provide a promising new treatment in addressing the needs of this large patient population."Under the license agreement, EyeGate received an upfront cash payment and has the potential to receive certain development-based milestone payments, as well as additional milestone payments based on the achievement of certain cumulative and annual sales milestones. Additionally, EyeGate will receive royalties on Valeant's net sales of the product.EyeGate will be responsible for the continued development of the EyeGate II delivery system in the U.S. for the treatment of post-operative pain and inflammation in ocular surgery patients, and all associated costs. Valeant has the right to further develop the product outside of the U.S., at its cost. In December 2016 , EyeGate reported positive top-line data from a Phase 1b/2a trial assessing iontophoretic EGP-437 in the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain in post-surgical cataract patients.About Valeant Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.
