Early history[edit]
The company was created by Percy Norman Furber, an Englishman, who moved to the United States in October 1918, after a time spent drilling for oil and mining quicksilver in Mexico. Furber was interested in developing a projection system that could be used in a lighted room, and enlisted the aid of a friend, Arthur Payne, a former employee of Thomas Edison. Payne hit upon the idea of rear projection; projecting an image through a screen rather than on it. However, this concept required a finer and more translucent material for the screen than any that currently existed.
Moving light[edit]
In 1920, Furber formed American Lux (Latin for "light") Products, and three years later, using a fine high-quality natural silk, it created its first successful screen, with initial sales going mostly to schools and churches. It was only after a visit to the New York Stock Exchange that Furber saw a truly profitable application for rear projection. At the time, brokers obtained the latest stock quotes, provided by Western Union's telegraph, or wire service, from a glass dome-topped ticker. The machine printed the results onto a long thin piece of paper known as a ticker tape, with the brokers closest to the printer having the advantage. Prior to this invention, any stock information was hand-written, usually on a chalk board; although the results were less immediate, they were better displayed. Furber combined the best aspects of both methods: by enlarging the stock quotations from the running ticker tape and displaying them onto a rear projection screen. In 1923, the company installed the first "Movie ticker" ticker tape projection system at the New York Stock Exchange. Like every ticker of the time it was a mechanical format, but by using yellow dots on a black background it gave the illusion of electronically generated green letters and numbers.
It is this stock ticker that provided the company's name: "Trans-Lux" meaning "moving light".
Financing this new operation required more capital, so Furber took his company public on August 26, 1925. It was listed on the New York Curb Exchange, which later became the American Stock Exchange. Until being delisted in 2011[1] Trans-Lux stock was the oldest company to be listed on the American Stock Exchange.[2] In 1925, the company had 41 installations on stock exchange floors and brokerage house boardrooms throughout the country.
Moving pictures[edit]
By 1927 the company had created a much larger, commercial-sized theater screen and took it, along with its rear projector system and a new wide-angle lens, to the motion picture industry. To further penetrate the market, the Trans-Lux Movies Corporation, in partnership with RKO (Radio-Keith-Orpheum) Studios, was created. Using Trans-Lux as its trade name, it began a theater-building program. The first Trans-Lux theater at 58th Street and Madison Avenue in New York City was actually converted from retail space, and featured larger seats, more leg room, and wider aisles than the average theater of the day. Seating only 158, it was much too small for the crowd it attracted. The rear projection technology allowed the house lights to remain low so patrons could read their programs and easily locate their seats, and also eliminated the distraction of a beam of light slicing down through the crowd from an overhead projection booth. In accordance with its news "heritage" the theatre featured a program made up exclusively of "shorts" (usually comedy routines or musical numbers) and newsreels. When the company's third theater opened two blocks away on 60th and Madison on November 10, 1933, it was turned back into retail space.[3]
In 1931, Percy Furber turned over company operations to his son, Percy. By this time, Trans-Lux had 4,000 stockholders, over 100 employees, and was valued at $2 million. In 1934, the company opened two more newsreel theaters in Brooklyn, New York and one in Philadelphia. Three more locations were added over the next three years, with architect Thomas W. Lamb designing the theater in Washington, D.C.. Offering 600 seats covered in blue leather, its lobby decorated with sports murals by New York artist Andre Hudiakoff, it was one of the first public buildings in the city to have air conditioning.[4] Located one block away from the White House, it was considered to be the most elegant Art Deco theater in the capital, up until its untimely demolition in 1975.[5]
In 1937 the company shortened its name to the Trans-Lux Corporation. Along with other theater-related businesses, it initially suffered during the postwar movie slump. Returning veterans were attending college on the GI Bill, marrying, and starting families. Newlyweds and young families with babies were usually on a budget and put the purchase of a home, a car, and new appliances ahead of going to the movies. The company's declining newsreel movie business quickly recovered when it switched to showing first-run feature films in 1949,[3] but weekly theater attendance still experienced a dramatic drop: from 78.2 million in 1946 to 58 million by 1950, when the American public chose to sit at home in front of their new television sets rather than go out to the movies.
As this postwar middle-class began moving from the cities to the suburbs, shopping complexes to support them proliferated, and theaters followed. In 1964 Trans-Lux built its first shopping center theater, an 850-seat facility in Reisterstown Road Plaza Mall in Baltimore. By 1969, the company had brought large, modern theaters to five more suburban shopping centers, nearly doubling the size of its theater holdings, and by 1965 had 37 theaters in ten states.
By the end of the 1960s, the theater building boom was over as well. In 1973 Trans-Lux lost money on its theaters for the first time in years. The boom had aggravated the newly independent industry's problem of a shortage of quality movies. Bidding on films became fierce, and many companies split their single theaters into twins. Three screen and four screen theaters began appearing, and when Richard Brandt replaced Percy Furber as chairman of the board in 1974, the multiplex trend (with as many as 12 screens) was in full swing. Some of the company's theaters were split into two and three screen houses, and others were sold off entirely.
In the midst of this, Trans-Lux went into the business of multimedia shows. The 1970 premiere of the "San Francisco Experience", a 29-projector, seven-screen spectacular with 30 special effects inspired the company to hire its creators to develop a nearly $1 million budget multimedia entertainment film about New York City. The September 28, 1973 opening of the 45-projector, 16-screen film was called "bedazzling and breathtaking" by The New York Times. "The New York Experience", which was housed in a sub-basement of the McGraw-Hill Building in Rockefeller Center, became the longest-running commercial multimedia show in history, until its demise in 1989. Despite its popularity, the show—which featured panoramic movie screens, slide projections, extensive light and sound systems, and a mannequin that dropped out of the ceiling to recreate the hanging of Nathan Hale—was forced to close due to escalating rent costs.[6]
By 1981, Trans-Lux's theater holdings were reduced to 28 screens, concentrated in the Northeast, particularly Connecticut. By the mid-1990s, the theater division invested in building new theaters in the western US, bringing the company's total to 65 screens. In 2000, the firm opened its own Los Angeles-based film booking office.
Television[edit]
By 1950, television had become America's most popular form of entertainment. In 1940, there were only 3,785 television sets in the US. Two decades later, nine out of ten homes had at least one set.[7]
Trans-Lux soon began developing specialized rear-projection equipment for television studios, greatly expanded its engineering capacity and started supplying the studios with "Teleprocess" screens and projectors. When closed circuit television (CCTV) appeared in the late 1940s, Trans-Lux adapted that technology for viewing stock market information, and formed an electronics division to develop and sell CCTV systems in 1959. They also developed a television program syndication service, and in association with Adventure Cartoon Productions produced the popular animated children's series: Felix the Cat[8] and The Mighty Hercules.[9] The expanded business required Trans-Lux to move from its Brooklyn headquarters to a larger, five-story building in Long Island City.
In 1967, they commissioned Titra Studios, a New York City recording company that provided English translations for foreign movies, to "Americanize" the new Japanese animated series, Speed Racer,[10] for domestic television. Trans-Lux retained the series until 1969, when it sold off its animated television holdings in order to concentrate on manufacturing illuminated stock market tickers. Trans-Lux's film catalog was purchased by independent distributor Alan Gleitsman, whose Alan Enterprises[11] continued to syndicate Speed Racer to independent TV stations throughout the 1970s.[12] That same year the company moved its headquarters again, this time relocating to Norwalk, Connecticut.
As for the Trans-Lux library, Gleitsman left the syndication business in 1986 and sold his assets to a colorization company called Color Systems Technology, which in turn sold the library (which includes the Alan Enterprises/Trans-Lux library, the rights to Speed Racer, and the Adventure Cartoon Productions series) to Broadway Video in 1989 due to bankruptcy.[13][14]
Stock quotes and signage[edit]
In 1940, Trans-Lux purchased a patent for a remote-control signaling system that enabled small rounded pellets to form letters and numbers and travel around outdoor message signs. It also joined forces with the Artkraft Strauss Sign Corporation, which was the first signage corporation to first illuminate the "Great White Way" of Broadway. By 1948 it was supplying electrical traveling message signs to advertisers, radio stations, and publishers throughout the country. At the same time, Trans-Lux had 1,400 stock-ticker projectors and 80 news projectors in the United States, plus another 200 in Canada.
By the early '60's, Trans-Lux began to see a need for greater investment in electronics as stock exchanges and brokerage firms were inundated with new, advanced techniques for gathering and projecting information. The company's fortunes were tied to its old system's two-step process: the information it relied on began with prices from the ticker tape, then a delay was required as the ticker tape shifted away from the print head to a viewing position for projecting or televising. With an electronic ticker display, Trans-Lux could bypass the printing stage, creating a real-time, immediate information system.
In 1965, the company was shocked by the introduction of a new 45-foot (14 m)-long electronic display installed on the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange by a competitor, Recognition Equipment Inc. (REI), of Dallas. Even though the Ultronic Letrascan electronic wall device had been steadily replacing Trans-Lux tickers for several years, the New York Stock Exchange installation was cause for concern, as Trans-Lux had enjoyed a long-standing business relationship with the exchange. The company made a deal with REI: since Trans-Lux needed Recognition's technology, and they needed Trans-Lux's knowledge of how to market stock-ticker equipment, they formed a joint venture to create a much smaller version of the Recognition system.
Two years later, they announced the Trans-Lux Jet, named for the jets of air that controlled character formation in the sign. It was the highest quality, real-time, continuous flow wall display yet produced, and a new method of viewing up-to-the-minute stock market sales information. Its ten-foot size made it perfect for brokerage offices, but perhaps the best news for Trans-Lux was that it no longer needed to rely on the Western Union ticker. U.S. and Canadian brokerage houses ordered more than 1,000 Trans-Lux Jets in the first six months, and Trans-Lux opened an international office in Zurich, Switzerland to deal with overseas orders. By mid-1969, about 3,000 Jets were in use. Shortly after introducing the Jet, Trans-Lux applied the same innovations to closed-circuit television.
The Jet's popularity required Trans-Lux to find a larger production facility. In 1970, the company moved to Norwalk, Connecticut. Demand for Jets continued to grow. Longer versions of 15, 25, and 43 feet (13 m) were produced. In 1969, Trans-Lux had succeeded in reducing the size of the Jet to one-fifth of the original. Ten years later, by developing a powerful miniature microprocessor chip, the company reduced the Jet to one-twenty-fifth of its original size.
As successful as the Jet was, it failed to address one important segment of the stock market: large portfolio holders and active traders had no way to automatically focus on their market objectives and private individual stock holdings. When a Chicago-based company, Quotemaster (later Extel) developed an experimental prototype for a selective read-out device, Trans-Lux approached them. The company soon began to develop and then manufacturing the device, now called the Personal Ticker,[15] which could be programmed to monitor up to 40 stocks on a single exchange. By 1969, Trans-Lux began installing the product for private investors, portfolio managers, pension fund administrators, investment advisors, and individual brokers. That same year the strong bull market abruptly ended, drastically impacting installations of all types of Trans-Lux equipment.
Following the market decline, Trans-Lux management learned that their electronic display sales should not be overly dependent on a single industry, and decided to diversify. The company formed an industrial sales department in 1970 under the leadership of Louis Credidio, who went after the commodity market and in 1971 sold an adaptation of the Personal Ticker, the T-900, to the Chicago Board of Trade. Soon Trans-Lux completed sales to many other commodity exchanges, capturing a small but significant new market. When Extel's teleprinter terminal sales boomed, it contracted Trans-Lux to manufacture keyboards and way-station selectors, which led to Trans-Lux's entry into the teleprinter market. Credidio studied the telex terminal field and by 1974 Trans-Lux began marketing a telex terminal, the Trans-Lux Teleprinter (TLT), to several industries. More than 700 terminals were installed by 1975.
Diversification[edit]
Early in 1995, Trans-Lux acquired Integrated Systems Engineering, Inc., a full service electronic sign manufacturing company, to broaden its outdoor signage capabilities, such as those found on billboards, or outside truck stops, banks, and sports arenas. The company's capacity to produce electronic displays increased in 2000 when it opened a modern outdoor display manufacturing facility in Utah. The indoor display division remained a major supplier of communications tools for the banking and financial community, but now theaters, museums, hotels, corporations, and military hospitals were customers. The division experienced a growth spurt in 2000 when the Australian Gaming Control Board approved Trans-Lux's serial slot controller for sale in their country. That decision also boosted sales of the LED jackpot meter displays that work hand in hand with the slot controllers. Trans-Lux also entered the health care industry with products designed for hospitals, pharmacies, and outpatient clinics by offering critical information displays.
In 2001, the Cincinnati Reds installed the company's new RainbowRibbon™ fascia displays as well as a baseball scoreboard, pitcher's board and out-of-town game board in their new 42,000-seat stadium, Great American Ball Park, at an estimated cost of over $3 million. The RainbowRibbon™ uses Trans-Lux' unique XFS scaling, which allows precise control of video images and improves image quality at the lower resolutions typical of LED displays. The three hundred feet of display in the Reds' installation featured over 273,500 pixels in an 8.6 billion color LED matrix, and ihas caught the attention of many professional sports teams due to its ability to optimize advertising space on arena and stadium tier fascias. The displays smoothly transition between video, advertising, animations, scoring/statistic layouts, and up to six lines of text around the interior of the facility. The system also featured a 3.5' x 33.5' SpectraLens™ pitch count board and a giant 24' x 164' SpectraLens scoreboard, which in 2003, when the park opened, was possibly the largest incandescent scoreboard ever constructed for a professional sports facility to date. The scoreboard, located in the left outfield, is capable of displaying game scores, graphics, animations, player statistics, advertising and general information.[2]
Trans-Lux continued to supply LED/incandescent displays and scoring systems to major and minor league baseball teams, such as the San Francisco Giants. In addition to professional baseball, Trans-Lux has provided displays and equipment to other professional sports teams, such as the NBA's Charlotte Hornets and Detroit Pistons.[16]
By 2002, annual revenues had reached $70.1 million in three divisions: outdoor displays, indoor displays, and entertainment/real estate. While the company headquarters still remain in Norwalk, manufacturing operations were moved to Stratford, Connecticut in 2008. Trans-Lux now has major U.S. sales and service centers in Norwalk; New York; Atlanta; Chicago; and Torrance, California, in addition to their satellite offices throughout the U.S. and Canada. Subsidiary companies are located in Iowa, Utah, Canada, and Australia. Trans-Lux's International Division maintains a distributor network throughout the world, including most major financial centers as well as in many newly developing countries.[16] In recent years, company headquarters have returned to New York, with the Norwalk and Atlanta sales and services centers merged into the New York office. As a further consequence, the Chicago office closed, while the Torrance, California office moved to Camarillo, California.
Company divisions[edit]
Trans-Lux also has three subsidiaries:

Fair Play Scoreboards, a scoreboard and sports equipment manufacturer.
TL Energy, a leading provider of LED lighting and related solutions.
PrismaTronic, a dedicated provider of Digital LED solutions for the OOH marketplace

Public documents[edit]
As stated in SEC paperwork, on March 28, 2003, a wholly owned subsidiary, Trans-Lux Corporation, sold its custom sports division, including licensing of intellectual property and its facility located in Logan, Utah to Barco, Inc., for a cash price of approximately $3.7 million, plus assumption of two Industrial Revenue Bonds totaling approximately $4.2 million, for an approximate total sale price of $7.9 million.
Trans-Lux also announced that it received a letter dated November 10, 2010 from NYSE Amex informing it that the Listings Qualifications Panel of the Exchange's Committee on Securities has affirmed the determination to delist Trans-Lux's Common Stock as of November 17, 2010.

	NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	March 31, 2017




	(unaudited)



	 


	Note 1

	

	Basis of Presentation


	 


	As used in this report, Trans-Lux, the Company, we, us, and our refer to Trans-Lux Corporation and its subsidiaries.


	 


	Financial information included herein is unaudited, however, such information reflects all adjustments (of a normal and recurring nature), which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for the fair presentation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the interim periods.  The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.  The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) and therefore do not include all information and footnote disclosures required under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).  The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.  The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016 is derived from the December 31, 2016 audited financial statements.


	 


	There have been no material changes in our significant accounting policies during the three months ended March 31, 2017 from the significant accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.


	 



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements: 

	In March 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2017-07,

	Compensation  Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)

	.  ASU 2017-07 improves the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost.  Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2017-07 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years (i.e., January 1, 2018), early application is permitted.  The Company has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this standard on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations.


	 


	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04,

	Intangibles  Goodwill and Other (Topic 350)

	.  ASU 2017-04 simplifies the test for goodwill impairment.  Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2017-04 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years (i.e., January 1, 2020), early application is permitted.  The Company has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this standard on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations.

	Table of Contents




	 


	In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18,

	Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)

	.  ASU 2016-18 modifies the presentation of Restricted Cash on the Statement of Cash Flows.  Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-18 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years (i.e., January 1, 2018), early application is permitted.  The Company has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this standard on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations.


	 


	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,

	Leases (Topic 842)

	.  ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from operating leases.  A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.  For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach.  Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years (i.e., January 1, 2019), early application is permitted.  The Company is in the process of evaluating this pronouncement but has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this standard on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations.


	 


	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09,

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)

	by one year.  As a result, the ASU is now effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, which for the Company is the first quarter of 2018.  Earlier application is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within those years, which for the Company is the first quarter of 2017.  The Company is in the process of evaluating this pronouncement but has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this standard on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations.


	 



	Note 2

	

	Going Concern



	 


	A fundamental principle of the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP is the assumption that an entity will continue in existence as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations and the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities occurring in the ordinary course of business.  This principle is applicable to all entities except for entities in liquidation or entities for which liquidation appears imminent.  In accordance with this requirement, the Company has prepared its accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements assuming the Company will continue as a going concern.

	We do not have adequate liquidity, including access to the debt and equity capital markets, to operate our business.  The Company incurred a net loss of $1.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017 and had a working capital deficiency of $4.8 million as of March 31, 2017.  As a result, our short-term business focus continues to be to preserve our liquidity position.  Unless we are successful in obtaining additional liquidity, we believe that we will not have sufficient cash and liquid assets to fund normal operations for the next 12 months.  In addition, the Companys obligations under its pension plan exceeded plan assets by $4.4 million at March 31, 2017 and the Company has a significant amount due to its pension plan over the next 12 months.  The Company is in default on its 8¼% Limited convertible senior subordinated notes due 2012 (the Notes) and 9½% Subordinated debentures due 2012 (the Debentures), which have remaining principal balances of $387,000 and $220,000, respectively.  Also,

	as of March 31, 2017, the Company was not in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant related to its Credit Agreement (hereinafter defined), which non-compliance was waived by the Lender. 

	As a result, if the Company is unable to (i) obtain additional liquidity for working capital, (ii) make the minimum required contributions to the defined benefit pension plan, (iii) make the required principal and interest payments on the Notes and the Debentures and/or (iv) attain and maintain compliance with all debt covenants, there would be a significant adverse impact on the financial position and operating results of the Company.  The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  See Note 6  Long-Term Debt for further details.


	 


	The Company is seeking additional financing in order to provide enough cash to cover our remaining current fixed cash obligations as well as providing working capital.  However, there can be no assurance as to the amounts, if any, the Company will receive in any additional financings or the terms thereof and the Company has no agreements, commitments or understandings with respect to any such additional financing.  To the extent the Company issues additional equity securities, it could be dilutive to existing shareholders.  In addition, the Companys current outstanding debt and other obligations could limit its ability to incur more debt.

	On July 12, 2016, the Company entered into a Credit and Security Agreement, as subsequently amended on September 8, 2016, February 14, 2017 and March 28, 2017 (collectively, the Credit Agreement), with its wholly-owned subsidiaries Trans-Lux Display Corporation, Trans-Lux Midwest Corporation and Trans-Lux Energy Corporation as borrowers (the Borrowers) and SCM Specialty Finance Opportunities Fund, L.P. (the Lender) as lender.  Under the Credit Agreement, the Company is able to borrow up to an aggregate of $4.0 million, which includes (i) up to $3.0 million of a revolving loan, at an interest rate of prime plus 4.00% (8.00% and 7.75% at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively), for an equipment purchase, repayment of certain outstanding obligations, including payments to the Companys pension plan, the purchase of inventory/product and general working capital purposes, and (ii) a $1.0 million term loan, at an interest rate of prime plus 6.00% (10.00% and 9.75% at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively), for the purchase of equipment.  The availability under the revolving loan is calculated based on certain percentages of eligible receivables and inventory.  Due to limited availability at the inception of the Credit Agreement, the Company capped the revolving loan at $2.0 million, while reserving the option to remove the cap when needed.  During 2017, the Company paid down $604,000 of the revolving loan and borrowed the remaining $600,000 on the term loan, of which $1.2 million and $940,000, respectively, were outstanding as of March 31, 2017.  Interest under the Credit Agreement is payable monthly in arrears.  The Credit Agreement also requires the payment of certain fees, including, but not limited to a facility fee, an unused line fee and a collateral management fee.

	The Credit Agreement contains financial and other covenant requirements, including, but not limited to, financial covenants that require the Borrowers to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.1 to 1.0 and a loan turnover rate of no more than 35 days (or 45 days for certain periods).  The Credit Agreement allows the Company to continue to pay dividends on all its Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the Preferred Stock) or any other new preferred stock, if any, which dividends will be excluded as fixed charges until January 12, 2018.  As of March 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants except the fixed charge coverage ratio, for which the Companys ratio was 0.9 to 1.0 for the testing period; the non-compliance was waived by the Lender.



	 



	The Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of the Borrowers assets and expires July 12, 2019, unless earlier terminated by the parties in accordance with the termination provisions of the Credit Agreement.  The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement is included to provide information regarding its terms.  It does not purport to be a complete description and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreement.



	 



	The Company has outstanding $387,000 of Notes which are no longer convertible into common shares.  The Notes matured as of March 1, 2012 and are currently in default.  As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company had accrued $242,000 and $234,000, respectively, of interest related to the Notes, which is included in Accrued liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The trustee, by notice to the Company, or the holders of 25% of the principal amount of the Notes outstanding, by notice to the Company and the trustee, may declare the outstanding principal plus interest due and payable immediately.



	 



	The Company has outstanding $220,000 of Debentures.  The Debentures matured as of December 1, 2012 and are currently in default.  As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company had accrued $153,000 and $148,000, respectively, of interest related to the Debentures, which is included in Accrued liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The trustee, by notice to the Company, or the holders of 25% of the principal amount of the Debentures outstanding, by notice to the Company and the trustee, may declare the outstanding principal plus interest due and payable immediately.

	Basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common shares by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common shares, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, adjusted for shares that would be assumed outstanding after warrants and stock options vested under the treasury stock method.



	 



	At March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had accumulated unpaid dividends of $93,000 and $72,000, respectively, related to the Preferred Stock.



	 



	On April 18, 2017, the Company declared a semi-annual dividend of $6.00 per share of Preferred Stock aggregating $99,000, which was paid on April 21, 2017.



	 



	As of March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had warrants to purchase 52,000 and 85,300 shares of Common Stock, respectively, outstanding, none of which were used in the calculation of diluted loss per share because their exercise price was greater than the average stock price for the period and their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.  These warrants could be dilutive in the future if the average share price increases and is greater than the exercise price of these warrants.



	 



	As of March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had 16,512 shares of Preferred Stock outstanding, which were convertible into 330,240 shares of Common Stock, none of which were used in the calculation of diluted loss per share because their conversion price was greater than the average stock price for the period and their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.  These shares of Preferred Stock could be dilutive in the future if the average share price increases and is greater than the purchase price of these shares of Preferred Stock.

	Yaozhong Shi, a director of the Company, is the Chairman of Transtech LED Company Limited (Transtech), which is our primary LED supplier.  The Company purchased $328,000 and $403,000 of product from Transtech in the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

	Business Segment Data


	 



	Operating segments are based on the Companys business components about which separate financial information is available and are evaluated regularly by the Companys chief operating decision makers in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance of the business.



	 



	The Company evaluates segment performance and allocates resources based upon operating income (loss). The Companys operations are managed in two reportable business segments: Digital product sales and Digital product lease and maintenance.  Both design and produce large-scale, multi-color, real-time digital displays and LED lighting, which has a line of energy-saving lighting solutions that provide facilities and public infrastructure with green lighting solutions that emit less heat, save energy and enable creative designs.  Both operating segments are conducted on a global basis, primarily through operations in the United States.  The Company also has operations in Canada.  The Digital product sales segment sells equipment and the Digital product lease and maintenance segment leases and maintains equipment.  Corporate general and administrative items relate to costs that are not directly identifiable with a segment.  There are no intersegment sales.



	 



	Foreign revenues represent less than 10% of the Companys revenues in 2017 and 2016.  The foreign operation does not manufacture its own equipment; the domestic operation provides the equipment that the foreign operation leases or sells.  The foreign operation operates similarly to the domestic operation and has similar profit margins.  Foreign assets are immaterial.

	Item 2.            

	Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations




	 


	Overview


	 



	Trans-Lux is a leading supplier of LED technology for displays and lighting applications.  The essential elements of these systems are the real-time, programmable digital displays and lighting fixtures that we design, manufacture, distribute and service.  Designed to meet the digital signage solutions for any size venues indoor and outdoor needs, these displays are used primarily in applications for the financial, banking, gaming, corporate, advertising, transportation, entertainment and sports markets.  The Companys LED lighting fixtures offer energy-saving lighting solutions that feature a comprehensive offering of the latest LED lighting technologies that provide facilities and public infrastructure with green lighting solutions that emit less heat, save energy and enable creative designs.  The Company operates in two reportable segments: Digital product sales and Digital product lease and maintenance.



	 



	12











	 




	Table of Contents




	 


	The Digital product sales segment includes worldwide revenues and related expenses from the sales of both indoor and outdoor digital display signage and LED lighting solutions.  This segment includes the financial, government/private, gaming, scoreboards and outdoor advertising markets.  The Digital product lease and maintenance segment includes worldwide revenues and related expenses from the lease and maintenance of both indoor and outdoor digital display signage.  This segment includes the lease and maintenance of digital display signage across all markets.


	 



	Going Concern



	 



	We do not have adequate liquidity, including access to the debt and equity capital markets, to operate our business.  As a result, our short-term business focus has been to preserve our liquidity position.  Unless we are successful in obtaining additional liquidity, we believe that we will not have sufficient cash and liquid assets to fund normal operations for the next 12 months.  In addition, the Companys obligations under its defined benefit pension plan exceeded plan assets by $4.4 million at March 31, 2017, including $880,000 of minimum required contributions due over the next 12 months.  The Company is in default on its Notes and Debentures, which have remaining principal balances of $387,000 and $220,000, respectively.  As a result, if the Company is unable to (i) obtain additional liquidity for working capital, (ii) make the minimum required contributions to the defined benefit pension plan, (iii) make the required principal and interest payments on the Notes and the Debentures and/or (iv) attain and maintain compliance with all debt covenants, there would be a significant adverse impact on the financial position and operating results of the Company.



	 


	Moreover, because of the uncertainty surrounding our ability to obtain additional liquidity and the potential of the noteholders and/or trustees to give notice to the Company of a default on either the Debentures or the Notes, our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an opinion on our December 31, 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements that states that the Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern and further states that the uncertainty regarding the ability to make the required principal and interest payments on the Notes and the Debentures, in addition to the significant amount due to the Companys defined benefit pension plan over the next 12 months, net losses and working capital deficiencies, raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  See Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  Going Concern.

	Total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 decreased $760,000 or 19.8% to $3.1 million from $3.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, primarily due to decreases in Digital product sales and in Digital product lease and maintenance.


	 


	Digital product sales revenues decreased $420,000 or 14.0%, primarily due to a reduction in the scoreboard and lighting markets.


	 



	Digital product lease and maintenance revenues decreased $340,000 or 40.6%, primarily due to the continued expected revenue decline in the older outdoor display equipment rental and maintenance bases acquired in the early 1990s. 


	The financial services market continues to be negatively impacted by the current investment climate resulting in consolidation within that industry and the wider use of flat-panel screens for smaller applications.



	 



	Total operating loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased $124,000 or 12.9% to $1.1 million from $963,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, principally due to the reduction in revenues, offset by a reduction in general and administrative expenses.



	 


	Digital product sales operating loss increased $116,000 or 32.2% to $476,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $360,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, primarily due to the decrease in revenues and a disproportionate decrease in the cost of revenues, offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses.  The cost of Digital product sales decreased $70,000 or 2.9%, primarily due to the decrease in revenues.  The cost of Digital product sales represented 91.7% of related revenues in 2017 compared to 81.2% in 2016.  The cost of Digital product sales in 2017 includes additional expenses and depreciation related to our new manufacturing facility and equipment which are not being fully absorbed since the facility and equipment are not yet being utilized to full capacity.  Digital product sales general and administrative expenses decreased $234,000 or 25.3%, primarily due to a decrease in payroll and benefits.

	Digital product lease and maintenance operating income decreased $198,000 or 73.6%, primarily as a result of the decrease in revenues, offset by a decrease in the cost of Digital product lease and maintenance.  The cost of Digital product lease and maintenance decreased $164,000 or 31.2%, primarily due to a decrease in depreciation expense.  The cost of Digital product lease and maintenance revenues represented 72.8% of related revenues in 2017 compared to 62.8% in 2016.  The cost of Digital product lease and maintenance includes field service expenses, plant repair costs, maintenance and depreciation.  Digital product lease and maintenance general and administrative expenses increased $22,000, primarily due to an increase in the allowance for bad debts and an increase in payroll and benefits.


	 


	Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased $190,000 or 21.8%, primarily due to a decrease in insurance expenses.


	 



	Net interest expense increased $139,000, primarily due to an increase in the average outstanding long-term debt, primarily due to the Credit Agreement.



	 



	Warrant expense is attributable to the amortization of equity warrants granted to directors in 2013.



	 



	The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was 0.0%.  Both the 2017 and 2016 tax rates are being affected by the valuation allowance on the Companys deferred tax assets as a result of reporting pre-tax losses.  The income tax expense relates to the Companys Canadian subsidiary.



	 




	Liquidity and Capital Resources




	 




	Current Liquidity




	 



	The Company has incurred significant recurring losses and continues to have a significant working capital deficiency.  The Company incurred a net loss of $1.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017 and had a working capital deficiency of $4.8 million as of March 31, 2017.  As of December 31, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficiency of $4.0 million.  The increase in the working capital deficiency is primarily due to an increase in the deferred portion of annual billings of lease and maintenance contracts, a reduction in accounts receivable, and an increase in accounts payable, offset by a decrease in the current portion of long-term debt and an increase in inventory.

	The Company is dependent on future operating performance in order to generate sufficient cash flows in order to continue to run its businesses.  Future operating performance is dependent on general economic conditions, as well as financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control.  As a result, we have experienced a decline in our lease and maintenance bases.  The cash flows of the Company are constrained, and in order to more effectively manage its cash resources, the Company has, from time to time, increased the timetable of its payment of some of its payables.  There can be no assurance that we will meet our anticipated current and near term cash requirements.  Management believes that its current cash resources and cash provided by operations would not be sufficient to fund its anticipated current and near term cash requirements and is seeking additional financing in order to execute our operating plan.  We cannot predict whether future financing, if any, will be in the form of equity, debt or a combination of both. We may not be able to obtain additional funds on a timely basis, on acceptable terms or at all.  The Company has no agreements, commitments or understandings with respect to any such additional financing.  The Company continually evaluates the need and availability of long-term capital in order to meet its cash requirements and fund potential new opportunities.



	 



	The Company generated cash of $504,000 from operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and used cash of $575,000 for the three months ended March 31

	, 2016

	. 

	The Company has implemented several initiatives to improve operational results and cash flows over future periods, including reducing head count, reorganizing its sales department, outsourcing certain administrative functions and expanding its sales and marketing efforts in the LED lighting market.  The Company continues to explore ways to reduce operational and overhead costs.  The Company periodically takes steps to reduce the cost to maintain the digital products on lease and maintenance agreements.




	 



	Cash and cash equivalents decreased $180,000 in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to $426,000 at March 31, 2017 from $606,000 at December 31, 2016.  The decrease is primarily attributable to payments on the revolving loan of $604,000, the payoff of the BFI Agreement of $492,000, scheduled payments of long-term debt of $40,000 and investment in property and equipment of $118,000, offset by cash provided by operating activities of $504,000 and proceeds of $600,000 received from borrowing on the term loan.  The current economic environment has increased the Companys trade receivables collection cycle, and its allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable, but collections continue to be favorable.



	 



	Under various agreements, the Company is obligated to make future cash payments in fixed amounts.  These include payments under the Companys current and long-term debt agreements, pension plan minimum required contributions, employment agreement payments and rent payments required under operating lease agreements.  The Company has both variable and fixed interest rate debt.  Interest payments are projected based on actual interest payments incurred in 2017 until the underlying debts mature.

	Of the fixed cash obligations for debt for the remainder of 2017, $1.0 million, including interest, of Notes and Debentures remained outstanding as of March 31, 2017 with consideration of an offer by the Company to settle for $121,000 in accordance with the Companys offer to exchange that closed in July 2016


	. The Company has no agreements, commitments or understandings with respect to any further such exchanges


	.  Subsequent to March 31, 2017, the Company made $220,000 of contributions to its pension plan.  The Company is seeking additional financing in order to provide enough cash to cover our remaining current fixed cash obligations as well as providing working capital.  However, there can be no assurance as to the amounts, if any, the Company will receive in any such financing or the terms thereof.  To the extent the Company issues additional equity securities, it could be dilutive to shareholders.  In addition, the Companys current outstanding debt and other obligations could limit its ability to incur more debt.



	 



	Subsequent to March 31, 2017, the Company declared a semi-annual dividend of $6.00 per share of Preferred Stock aggregating $99,000, which was paid on April 21, 2017.



	 




	Pension Plan Contributions




	 



	In March 2010, 2011 and 2013, the Company submitted to the Internal Revenue Service requests for waivers of the 2009, 2010 and 2012 minimum funding standards for its defined benefit pension plan.  As of March 31, 2017, the Company had fully repaid the amounts deferred for the 2009 and 2010 plan years and has repaid $520,000 of the 2012 plan year waiver, leaving a balance due related to the waivers of $149,000, which is scheduled to be repaid in 2017.  In 2017, the Company made $220,000 of contributions to its pension plan.  At this time, we expect to make our minimum required contributions in 2017 of $660,000; however, there is no assurance that we will be able to make any or all of such remaining payments.  See Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements  Pension Plan for further details.

	The Company may, from time to time, provide estimates as to future performance.  These forward-looking statements will be estimates and may or may not be realized by the Company.  The Company undertakes no duty to update such forward-looking statements.  Many factors could cause actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements, including loss of market share through competition, introduction of competing products by others, pressure on prices from competition or purchasers of the Companys products, interest rate and foreign exchange fluctuations, terrorist acts and war.

	Item 3.            

	Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk




	 


	The Company is subject to interest rate risk on its long-term debt.  The Company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by the use of variable and fixed interest rate debt.  At March 31, 2017, the Company did not have any variable interest rate debt.  In addition, the Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk mainly as a result of its investment in its Canadian subsidiary. A 10% change in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar would result in a currency remeasurement expense fluctuation of approximately $259,000, based on dealer quotes, considering current exchange rates.  The Company does not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and did not hold any derivative financial instruments at March 31, 2017.

	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

	  As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this report, we have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer (our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.  Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management (including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer) to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.  Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer has concluded that these disclosure controls are effective as of March 31, 2017.


	 




	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.



	  There has been no change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting that occurred in the quarter ended March 31, 2017 and that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

	CERTIFICATION OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF ACCOUNTING OFFICER




	PURSUANT TO RULE 13a-14(a) UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT



	 



	I, Jean-Marc Allain, certify that:




	1.

	                



	I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Trans-Lux Corporation for the quarter ended March 31, 2017;




	2.

	                



	Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;



	3.

	                

	Not applicable;



	4.

	                



	I am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 (f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:




	a)

	                



	designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under my supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to me by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;




	b)

	                



	designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under my supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;




	c)

	                



	evaluated the effectiveness of the registrants disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report my conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and




	d)

	                



	disclosed in this report any change in the registrants internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrants most recent fiscal quarter (the registrants fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrants internal control over financial reporting; and




	5.

	                



	I have disclosed, based on my most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrants auditors and the audit committee of the registrants board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):




	a)

	                



	all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrants ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and




	b)

	                



	any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrants internal control over financial reporting.

Early history[edit]
The company was created by Percy Norman Furber, an Englishman, who moved to the United States in October 1918, after a time spent drilling for oil and mining quicksilver in Mexico. Furber was interested in developing a projection system that could be used in a lighted room, and enlisted the aid of a friend, Arthur Payne, a former employee of Thomas Edison. Payne hit upon the idea of rear projection; projecting an image through a screen rather than on it. However, this concept required a finer and more translucent material for the screen than any that currently existed.
Moving light[edit]
In 1920, Furber formed American Lux (Latin for "light") Products, and three years later, using a fine high-quality natural silk, it created its first successful screen, with initial sales going mostly to schools and churches. It was only after a visit to the New York Stock Exchange that Furber saw a truly profitable application for rear projection. At the time, brokers obtained the latest stock quotes, provided by Western Union's telegraph, or wire service, from a glass dome-topped ticker. The machine printed the results onto a long thin piece of paper known as a ticker tape, with the brokers closest to the printer having the advantage. Prior to this invention, any stock information was hand-written, usually on a chalk board; although the results were less immediate, they were better displayed. Furber combined the best aspects of both methods: by enlarging the stock quotations from the running ticker tape and displaying them onto a rear projection screen. In 1923, the company installed the first "Movie ticker" ticker tape projection system at the New York Stock Exchange. Like every ticker of the time it was a mechanical format, but by using yellow dots on a black background it gave the illusion of electronically generated green letters and numbers.
It is this stock ticker that provided the company's name: "Trans-Lux" meaning "moving light".
Financing this new operation required more capital, so Furber took his company public on August 26, 1925. It was listed on the New York Curb Exchange, which later became the American Stock Exchange. Until being delisted in 2011[1] Trans-Lux stock was the oldest company to be listed on the American Stock Exchange.[2] In 1925, the company had 41 installations on stock exchange floors and brokerage house boardrooms throughout the country.
Moving pictures[edit]
By 1927 the company had created a much larger, commercial-sized theater screen and took it, along with its rear projector system and a new wide-angle lens, to the motion picture industry. To further penetrate the market, the Trans-Lux Movies Corporation, in partnership with RKO (Radio-Keith-Orpheum) Studios, was created. Using Trans-Lux as its trade name, it began a theater-building program. The first Trans-Lux theater at 58th Street and Madison Avenue in New York City was actually converted from retail space, and featured larger seats, more leg room, and wider aisles than the average theater of the day. Seating only 158, it was much too small for the crowd it attracted. The rear projection technology allowed the house lights to remain low so patrons could read their programs and easily locate their seats, and also eliminated the distraction of a beam of light slicing down through the crowd from an overhead projection booth. In accordance with its news "heritage" the theatre featured a program made up exclusively of "shorts" (usually comedy routines or musical numbers) and newsreels. When the company's third theater opened two blocks away on 60th and Madison on November 10, 1933, it was turned back into retail space.[3]
In 1931, Percy Furber turned over company operations to his son, Percy. By this time, Trans-Lux had 4,000 stockholders, over 100 employees, and was valued at $2 million. In 1934, the company opened two more newsreel theaters in Brooklyn, New York and one in Philadelphia. Three more locations were added over the next three years, with architect Thomas W. Lamb designing the theater in Washington, D.C.. Offering 600 seats covered in blue leather, its lobby decorated with sports murals by New York artist Andre Hudiakoff, it was one of the first public buildings in the city to have air conditioning.[4] Located one block away from the White House, it was considered to be the most elegant Art Deco theater in the capital, up until its untimely demolition in 1975.[5]
In 1937 the company shortened its name to the Trans-Lux Corporation. Along with other theater-related businesses, it initially suffered during the postwar movie slump. Returning veterans were attending college on the GI Bill, marrying, and starting families. Newlyweds and young families with babies were usually on a budget and put the purchase of a home, a car, and new appliances ahead of going to the movies. The company's declining newsreel movie business quickly recovered when it switched to showing first-run feature films in 1949,[3] but weekly theater attendance still experienced a dramatic drop: from 78.2 million in 1946 to 58 million by 1950, when the American public chose to sit at home in front of their new television sets rather than go out to the movies.
As this postwar middle-class began moving from the cities to the suburbs, shopping complexes to support them proliferated, and theaters followed. In 1964 Trans-Lux built its first shopping center theater, an 850-seat facility in Reisterstown Road Plaza Mall in Baltimore. By 1969, the company had brought large, modern theaters to five more suburban shopping centers, nearly doubling the size of its theater holdings, and by 1965 had 37 theaters in ten states.
By the end of the 1960s, the theater building boom was over as well. In 1973 Trans-Lux lost money on its theaters for the first time in years. The boom had aggravated the newly independent industry's problem of a shortage of quality movies. Bidding on films became fierce, and many companies split their single theaters into twins. Three screen and four screen theaters began appearing, and when Richard Brandt replaced Percy Furber as chairman of the board in 1974, the multiplex trend (with as many as 12 screens) was in full swing. Some of the company's theaters were split into two and three screen houses, and others were sold off entirely.
In the midst of this, Trans-Lux went into the business of multimedia shows. The 1970 premiere of the "San Francisco Experience", a 29-projector, seven-screen spectacular with 30 special effects inspired the company to hire its creators to develop a nearly $1 million budget multimedia entertainment film about New York City. The September 28, 1973 opening of the 45-projector, 16-screen film was called "bedazzling and breathtaking" by The New York Times. "The New York Experience", which was housed in a sub-basement of the McGraw-Hill Building in Rockefeller Center, became the longest-running commercial multimedia show in history, until its demise in 1989. Despite its popularity, the show—which featured panoramic movie screens, slide projections, extensive light and sound systems, and a mannequin that dropped out of the ceiling to recreate the hanging of Nathan Hale—was forced to close due to escalating rent costs.[6]
By 1981, Trans-Lux's theater holdings were reduced to 28 screens, concentrated in the Northeast, particularly Connecticut. By the mid-1990s, the theater division invested in building new theaters in the western US, bringing the company's total to 65 screens. In 2000, the firm opened its own Los Angeles-based film booking office.
Television[edit]
By 1950, television had become America's most popular form of entertainment. In 1940, there were only 3,785 television sets in the US. Two decades later, nine out of ten homes had at least one set.[7]
Trans-Lux soon began developing specialized rear-projection equipment for television studios, greatly expanded its engineering capacity and started supplying the studios with "Teleprocess" screens and projectors. When closed circuit television (CCTV) appeared in the late 1940s, Trans-Lux adapted that technology for viewing stock market information, and formed an electronics division to develop and sell CCTV systems in 1959. They also developed a television program syndication service, and in association with Adventure Cartoon Productions produced the popular animated children's series: Felix the Cat[8] and The Mighty Hercules.[9] The expanded business required Trans-Lux to move from its Brooklyn headquarters to a larger, five-story building in Long Island City.
In 1967, they commissioned Titra Studios, a New York City recording company that provided English translations for foreign movies, to "Americanize" the new Japanese animated series, Speed Racer,[10] for domestic television. Trans-Lux retained the series until 1969, when it sold off its animated television holdings in order to concentrate on manufacturing illuminated stock market tickers. Trans-Lux's film catalog was purchased by independent distributor Alan Gleitsman, whose Alan Enterprises[11] continued to syndicate Speed Racer to independent TV stations throughout the 1970s.[12] That same year the company moved its headquarters again, this time relocating to Norwalk, Connecticut.
As for the Trans-Lux library, Gleitsman left the syndication business in 1986 and sold his assets to a colorization company called Color Systems Technology, which in turn sold the library (which includes the Alan Enterprises/Trans-Lux library, the rights to Speed Racer, and the Adventure Cartoon Productions series) to Broadway Video in 1989 due to bankruptcy.[13][14]
Stock quotes and signage[edit]
In 1940, Trans-Lux purchased a patent for a remote-control signaling system that enabled small rounded pellets to form letters and numbers and travel around outdoor message signs. It also joined forces with the Artkraft Strauss Sign Corporation, which was the first signage corporation to first illuminate the "Great White Way" of Broadway. By 1948 it was supplying electrical traveling message signs to advertisers, radio stations, and publishers throughout the country. At the same time, Trans-Lux had 1,400 stock-ticker projectors and 80 news projectors in the United States, plus another 200 in Canada.
By the early '60's, Trans-Lux began to see a need for greater investment in electronics as stock exchanges and brokerage firms were inundated with new, advanced techniques for gathering and projecting information. The company's fortunes were tied to its old system's two-step process: the information it relied on began with prices from the ticker tape, then a delay was required as the ticker tape shifted away from the print head to a viewing position for projecting or televising. With an electronic ticker display, Trans-Lux could bypass the printing stage, creating a real-time, immediate information system.
In 1965, the company was shocked by the introduction of a new 45-foot (14 m)-long electronic display installed on the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange by a competitor, Recognition Equipment Inc. (REI), of Dallas. Even though the Ultronic Letrascan electronic wall device had been steadily replacing Trans-Lux tickers for several years, the New York Stock Exchange installation was cause for concern, as Trans-Lux had enjoyed a long-standing business relationship with the exchange. The company made a deal with REI: since Trans-Lux needed Recognition's technology, and they needed Trans-Lux's knowledge of how to market stock-ticker equipment, they formed a joint venture to create a much smaller version of the Recognition system.
Two years later, they announced the Trans-Lux Jet, named for the jets of air that controlled character formation in the sign. It was the highest quality, real-time, continuous flow wall display yet produced, and a new method of viewing up-to-the-minute stock market sales information. Its ten-foot size made it perfect for brokerage offices, but perhaps the best news for Trans-Lux was that it no longer needed to rely on the Western Union ticker. U.S. and Canadian brokerage houses ordered more than 1,000 Trans-Lux Jets in the first six months, and Trans-Lux opened an international office in Zurich, Switzerland to deal with overseas orders. By mid-1969, about 3,000 Jets were in use. Shortly after introducing the Jet, Trans-Lux applied the same innovations to closed-circuit television.
The Jet's popularity required Trans-Lux to find a larger production facility. In 1970, the company moved to Norwalk, Connecticut. Demand for Jets continued to grow. Longer versions of 15, 25, and 43 feet (13 m) were produced. In 1969, Trans-Lux had succeeded in reducing the size of the Jet to one-fifth of the original. Ten years later, by developing a powerful miniature microprocessor chip, the company reduced the Jet to one-twenty-fifth of its original size.
As successful as the Jet was, it failed to address one important segment of the stock market: large portfolio holders and active traders had no way to automatically focus on their market objectives and private individual stock holdings. When a Chicago-based company, Quotemaster (later Extel) developed an experimental prototype for a selective read-out device, Trans-Lux approached them. The company soon began to develop and then manufacturing the device, now called the Personal Ticker,[15] which could be programmed to monitor up to 40 stocks on a single exchange. By 1969, Trans-Lux began installing the product for private investors, portfolio managers, pension fund administrators, investment advisors, and individual brokers. That same year the strong bull market abruptly ended, drastically impacting installations of all types of Trans-Lux equipment.
Following the market decline, Trans-Lux management learned that their electronic display sales should not be overly dependent on a single industry, and decided to diversify. The company formed an industrial sales department in 1970 under the leadership of Louis Credidio, who went after the commodity market and in 1971 sold an adaptation of the Personal Ticker, the T-900, to the Chicago Board of Trade. Soon Trans-Lux completed sales to many other commodity exchanges, capturing a small but significant new market. When Extel's teleprinter terminal sales boomed, it contracted Trans-Lux to manufacture keyboards and way-station selectors, which led to Trans-Lux's entry into the teleprinter market. Credidio studied the telex terminal field and by 1974 Trans-Lux began marketing a telex terminal, the Trans-Lux Teleprinter (TLT), to several industries. More than 700 terminals were installed by 1975.
Diversification[edit]
Early in 1995, Trans-Lux acquired Integrated Systems Engineering, Inc., a full service electronic sign manufacturing company, to broaden its outdoor signage capabilities, such as those found on billboards, or outside truck stops, banks, and sports arenas. The company's capacity to produce electronic displays increased in 2000 when it opened a modern outdoor display manufacturing facility in Utah. The indoor display division remained a major supplier of communications tools for the banking and financial community, but now theaters, museums, hotels, corporations, and military hospitals were customers. The division experienced a growth spurt in 2000 when the Australian Gaming Control Board approved Trans-Lux's serial slot controller for sale in their country. That decision also boosted sales of the LED jackpot meter displays that work hand in hand with the slot controllers. Trans-Lux also entered the health care industry with products designed for hospitals, pharmacies, and outpatient clinics by offering critical information displays.
In 2001, the Cincinnati Reds installed the company's new RainbowRibbon™ fascia displays as well as a baseball scoreboard, pitcher's board and out-of-town game board in their new 42,000-seat stadium, Great American Ball Park, at an estimated cost of over $3 million. The RainbowRibbon™ uses Trans-Lux' unique XFS scaling, which allows precise control of video images and improves image quality at the lower resolutions typical of LED displays. The three hundred feet of display in the Reds' installation featured over 273,500 pixels in an 8.6 billion color LED matrix, and ihas caught the attention of many professional sports teams due to its ability to optimize advertising space on arena and stadium tier fascias. The displays smoothly transition between video, advertising, animations, scoring/statistic layouts, and up to six lines of text around the interior of the facility. The system also featured a 3.5' x 33.5' SpectraLens™ pitch count board and a giant 24' x 164' SpectraLens scoreboard, which in 2003, when the park opened, was possibly the largest incandescent scoreboard ever constructed for a professional sports facility to date. The scoreboard, located in the left outfield, is capable of displaying game scores, graphics, animations, player statistics, advertising and general information.[2]
Trans-Lux continued to supply LED/incandescent displays and scoring systems to major and minor league baseball teams, such as the San Francisco Giants. In addition to professional baseball, Trans-Lux has provided displays and equipment to other professional sports teams, such as the NBA's Charlotte Hornets and Detroit Pistons.[16]
By 2002, annual revenues had reached $70.1 million in three divisions: outdoor displays, indoor displays, and entertainment/real estate. While the company headquarters still remain in Norwalk, manufacturing operations were moved to Stratford, Connecticut in 2008. Trans-Lux now has major U.S. sales and service centers in Norwalk; New York; Atlanta; Chicago; and Torrance, California, in addition to their satellite offices throughout the U.S. and Canada. Subsidiary companies are located in Iowa, Utah, Canada, and Australia. Trans-Lux's International Division maintains a distributor network throughout the world, including most major financial centers as well as in many newly developing countries.[16] In recent years, company headquarters have returned to New York, with the Norwalk and Atlanta sales and services centers merged into the New York office. As a further consequence, the Chicago office closed, while the Torrance, California office moved to Camarillo, California.
Company divisions[edit]
Trans-Lux also has three subsidiaries:

Fair Play Scoreboards, a scoreboard and sports equipment manufacturer.
TL Energy, a leading provider of LED lighting and related solutions.
PrismaTronic, a dedicated provider of Digital LED solutions for the OOH marketplace

Public documents[edit]
As stated in SEC paperwork, on March 28, 2003, a wholly owned subsidiary, Trans-Lux Corporation, sold its custom sports division, including licensing of intellectual property and its facility located in Logan, Utah to Barco, Inc., for a cash price of approximately $3.7 million, plus assumption of two Industrial Revenue Bonds totaling approximately $4.2 million, for an approximate total sale price of $7.9 million.
Trans-Lux also announced that it received a letter dated November 10, 2010 from NYSE Amex informing it that the Listings Qualifications Panel of the Exchange's Committee on Securities has affirmed the determination to delist Trans-Lux's Common Stock as of November 17, 2010.

The boom had aggravated the newly independent industry's problem of a shortage of quality movies. Bidding on films became fierce, and many companies split their single theaters into twins. Three screen and four screen theaters began appearing, and when Richard Brandt replaced Percy Furber as chairman of the board in 1974, the multiplex trend (with as many as 12 screens) was in full swing. Some of the company's theaters were split into two and three screen houses, and others were sold off entirely.
In the midst of this, Trans-Lux went into the business of multimedia shows. The 1970 premiere of the "San Francisco Experience", a 29-projector, seven-screen spectacular with 30 special effects inspired the company to hire its creators to develop a nearly $1 million budget multimedia entertainment film about New York City. The September 28, 1973 opening of the 45-projector, 16-screen film was called "bedazzling and breathtaking" by The New York Times. "The New York Experience", which was housed in a sub-basement of the McGraw-Hill Building in Rockefeller Center, became the longest-running commercial multimedia show in history, until its demise in 1989. Despite its popularity, the show—which featured panoramic movie screens, slide projections, extensive light and sound systems, and a mannequin that dropped out of the ceiling to recreate the hanging of Nathan Hale—was forced to close due to escalating rent costs.[6]
By 1981, Trans-Lux's theater holdings were reduced to 28 screens, concentrated in the Northeast, particularly Connecticut. By the mid-1990s, the theater division invested in building new theaters in the western US, bringing the company's total to 65 screens. In 2000, the firm opened its own Los Angeles-based film booking office.
Television[edit]
By 1950, television had become America's most popular form of entertainment. In 1940, there were only 3,785 television sets in the US. Two decades later, nine out of ten homes had at least one set.[7]
Trans-Lux soon began developing specialized rear-projection equipment for television studios, greatly expanded its engineering capacity and started supplying the studios with "Teleprocess" screens and projectors. When closed circuit television (CCTV) appeared in the late 1940s, Trans-Lux adapted that technology for viewing stock market information, and formed an electronics division to develop and sell CCTV systems in 1959. They also developed a television program syndication service, and in association with Adventure Cartoon Productions produced the popular animated children's series: Felix the Cat[8] and The Mighty Hercules.[9] The expanded business required Trans-Lux to move from its Brooklyn headquarters to a larger, five-story building in Long Island City.
In 1967, they commissioned Titra Studios, a New York City recording company that provided English translations for foreign movies, to "Americanize" the new Japanese animated series, Speed Racer,[10] for domestic television. Trans-Lux retained the series until 1969, when it sold off its animated television holdings in order to concentrate on manufacturing illuminated stock market tickers. Trans-Lux's film catalog was purchased by independent distributor Alan Gleitsman, whose Alan Enterprises[11] continued to syndicate Speed Racer to independent TV stations throughout the 1970s.[12] That same year the company moved its headquarters again, this time relocating to Norwalk, Connecticut.
As for the Trans-Lux library, Gleitsman left the syndication business in 1986 and sold his assets to a colorization company called Color Systems Technology, which in turn sold the library (which includes the Alan Enterprises/Trans-Lux library, the rights to Speed Racer, and the Adventure Cartoon Productions series) to Broadway Video in 1989 due to bankruptcy.[13][14]
Stock quotes and signage[edit]
In 1940, Trans-Lux purchased a patent for a remote-control signaling system that enabled small rounded pellets to form letters and numbers and travel around outdoor message signs. It also joined forces with the Artkraft Strauss Sign Corporation, which was the first signage corporation to first illuminate the "Great White Way" of Broadway. By 1948 it was supplying electrical traveling message signs to advertisers, radio stations, and publishers throughout the country. At the same time, Trans-Lux had 1,400 stock-ticker projectors and 80 news projectors in the United States, plus another 200 in Canada.
By the early '60's, Trans-Lux began to see a need for greater investment in electronics as stock exchanges and brokerage firms were inundated with new, advanced techniques for gathering and projecting information. The company's fortunes were tied to its old system's two-step process: the information it relied on began with prices from the ticker tape, then a delay was required as the ticker tape shifted away from the print head to a viewing position for projecting or televising. With an electronic ticker display, Trans-Lux could bypass the printing stage, creating a real-time, immediate information system.
In 1965, the company was shocked by the introduction of a new 45-foot (14 m)-long electronic display installed on the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange by a competitor, Recognition Equipment Inc. (REI), of Dallas. Even though the Ultronic Letrascan electronic wall device had been steadily replacing Trans-Lux tickers for several years, the New York Stock Exchange installation was cause for concern, as Trans-Lux had enjoyed a long-standing business relationship with the exchange. The company made a deal with REI: since Trans-Lux needed Recognition's technology, and they needed Trans-Lux's knowledge of how to market stock-ticker equipment, they formed a joint venture to create a much smaller version of the Recognition system.
Two years later, they announced the Trans-Lux Jet, named for the jets of air that controlled character formation in the sign. It was the highest quality, real-time, continuous flow wall display yet produced, and a new method of viewing up-to-the-minute stock market sales information. Its ten-foot size made it perfect for brokerage offices, but perhaps the best news for Trans-Lux was that it no longer needed to rely on the Western Union ticker. U.S. and Canadian brokerage houses ordered more than 1,000 Trans-Lux Jets in the first six months, and Trans-Lux opened an international office in Zurich, Switzerland to deal with overseas orders. By mid-1969, about 3,000 Jets were in use. Shortly after introducing the Jet, Trans-Lux applied the same innovations to closed-circuit television.
The Jet's popularity required Trans-Lux to find a larger production facility. In 1970, the company moved to Norwalk, Connecticut. Demand for Jets continued to grow. Longer versions of 15, 25, and 43 feet (13 m) were produced. In 1969, Trans-Lux had succeeded in reducing the size of the Jet to one-fifth of the original. Ten years later, by developing a powerful miniature microprocessor chip, the company reduced the Jet to one-twenty-fifth of its original size.
As successful as the Jet was, it failed to address one important segment of the stock market: large portfolio holders and active traders had no way to automatically focus on their market objectives and private individual stock holdings. When a Chicago-based company, Quotemaster (later Extel) developed an experimental prototype for a selective read-out device, Trans-Lux approached them. The company soon began to develop and then manufacturing the device, now called the Personal Ticker,[15] which could be programmed to monitor up to 40 stocks on a single exchange. By 1969, Trans-Lux began installing the product for private investors, portfolio managers, pension fund administrators, investment advisors, and individual brokers. That same year the strong bull market abruptly ended, drastically impacting installations of all types of Trans-Lux equipment.
Following the market decline, Trans-Lux management learned that their electronic display sales should not be overly dependent on a single industry, and decided to diversify. The company formed an industrial sales department in 1970 under the leadership of Louis Credidio, who went after the commodity market and in 1971 sold an adaptation of the Personal Ticker, the T-900, to the Chicago Board of Trade. Soon Trans-Lux completed sales to many other commodity exchanges, capturing a small but significant new market. When Extel's teleprinter terminal sales boomed, it contracted Trans-Lux to manufacture keyboards and way-station selectors, which led to Trans-Lux's entry into the teleprinter market. Credidio studied the telex terminal field and by 1974 Trans-Lux began marketing a telex terminal, the Trans-Lux Teleprinter (TLT), to several industries. More than 700 terminals were installed by 1975.
Diversification[edit]
Early in 1995, Trans-Lux acquired Integrated Systems Engineering, Inc., a full service electronic sign manufacturing company, to broaden its outdoor signage capabilities, such as those found on billboards, or outside truck stops, banks, and sports arenas. The company's capacity to produce electronic displays increased in 2000 when it opened a modern outdoor display manufacturing facility in Utah. The indoor display division remained a major supplier of communications tools for the banking and financial community, but now theaters, museums, hotels, corporations, and military hospitals were customers. The division experienced a growth spurt in 2000 when the Australian Gaming Control Board approved Trans-Lux's serial slot controller for sale in their country. That decision also boosted sales of the LED jackpot meter displays that work hand in hand with the slot controllers. Trans-Lux also entered the health care industry with products designed for hospitals, pharmacies, and outpatient clinics by offering critical information displays.
In 2001, the Cincinnati Reds installed the company's new RainbowRibbon™ fascia displays as well as a baseball scoreboard, pitcher's board and out-of-town game board in their new 42,000-seat stadium, Great American Ball Park, at an estimated cost of over $3 million. The RainbowRibbon™ uses Trans-Lux' unique XFS scaling, which allows precise control of video images and improves image quality at the lower resolutions typical of LED displays. The three hundred feet of display in the Reds' installation featured over 273,500 pixels in an 8.6 billion color LED matrix, and ihas caught the attention of many professional sports teams due to its ability to optimize advertising space on arena and stadium tier fascias. The displays smoothly transition between video, advertising, animations, scoring/statistic layouts, and up to six lines of text around the interior of the facility. The system also featured a 3.5' x 33.5' SpectraLens™ pitch count board and a giant 24' x 164' SpectraLens scoreboard, which in 2003, when the park opened, was possibly the largest incandescent scoreboard ever constructed for a professional sports facility to date. The scoreboard, located in the left outfield, is capable of displaying game scores, graphics, animations, player statistics, advertising and general information.[2]
Trans-Lux continued to supply LED/incandescent displays and scoring systems to major and minor league baseball teams, such as the San Francisco Giants. In addition to professional baseball, Trans-Lux has provided displays and equipment to other professional sports teams, such as the NBA's Charlotte Hornets and Detroit Pistons.[16]
By 2002, annual revenues had reached $70.1 million in three divisions: outdoor displays, indoor displays, and entertainment/real estate. While the company headquarters still remain in Norwalk, manufacturing operations were moved to Stratford, Connecticut in 2008. Trans-Lux now has major U.S. sales and service centers in Norwalk; New York; Atlanta; Chicago; and Torrance, California, in addition to their satellite offices throughout the U.S. and Canada. Subsidiary companies are located in Iowa, Utah, Canada, and Australia. Trans-Lux's International Division maintains a distributor network throughout the world, including most major financial centers as well as in many newly developing countries.[16] In recent years, company headquarters have returned to New York, with the Norwalk and Atlanta sales and services centers merged into the New York office. As a further consequence, the Chicago office closed, while the Torrance, California office moved to Camarillo, California.
Company divisions[edit]
Trans-Lux also has three subsidiaries:

Fair Play Scoreboards, a scoreboard and sports equipment manufacturer.
TL Energy, a leading provider of LED lighting and related solutions.
PrismaTronic, a dedicated provider of Digital LED solutions for the OOH marketplace

Public documents[edit]
As stated in SEC paperwork, on March 28, 2003, a wholly owned subsidiary, Trans-Lux Corporation, sold its custom sports division, including licensing of intellectual property and its facility located in Logan, Utah to Barco, Inc., for a cash price of approximately $3.7 million, plus assumption of two Industrial Revenue Bonds totaling approximately $4.2 million, for an approximate total sale price of $7.9 million.
Trans-Lux also announced that it received a letter dated November 10, 2010 from NYSE Amex informing it that the Listings Qualifications Panel of the Exchange's Committee on Securities has affirmed the determination to delist Trans-Lux's Common Stock as of November 17, 2010.

Early history[edit]
The company was created by Percy Norman Furber, an Englishman, who moved to the United States in October 1918, after a time spent drilling for oil and mining quicksilver in Mexico. Furber was interested in developing a projection system that could be used in a lighted room, and enlisted the aid of a friend, Arthur Payne, a former employee of Thomas Edison. Payne hit upon the idea of rear projection; projecting an image through a screen rather than on it. However, this concept required a finer and more translucent material for the screen than any that currently existed.
Moving light[edit]
In 1920, Furber formed American Lux (Latin for "light") Products, and three years later, using a fine high-quality natural silk, it created its first successful screen, with initial sales going mostly to schools and churches. It was only after a visit to the New York Stock Exchange that Furber saw a truly profitable application for rear projection. At the time, brokers obtained the latest stock quotes, provided by Western Union's telegraph, or wire service, from a glass dome-topped ticker. The machine printed the results onto a long thin piece of paper known as a ticker tape, with the brokers closest to the printer having the advantage. Prior to this invention, any stock information was hand-written, usually on a chalk board; although the results were less immediate, they were better displayed. Furber combined the best aspects of both methods: by enlarging the stock quotations from the running ticker tape and displaying them onto a rear projection screen. In 1923, the company installed the first "Movie ticker" ticker tape projection system at the New York Stock Exchange. Like every ticker of the time it was a mechanical format, but by using yellow dots on a black background it gave the illusion of electronically generated green letters and numbers.
It is this stock ticker that provided the company's name: "Trans-Lux" meaning "moving light".
Financing this new operation required more capital, so Furber took his company public on August 26, 1925. It was listed on the New York Curb Exchange, which later became the American Stock Exchange. Until being delisted in 2011[1] Trans-Lux stock was the oldest company to be listed on the American Stock Exchange.[2] In 1925, the company had 41 installations on stock exchange floors and brokerage house boardrooms throughout the country.
Moving pictures[edit]
By 1927 the company had created a much larger, commercial-sized theater screen and took it, along with its rear projector system and a new wide-angle lens, to the motion picture industry. To further penetrate the market, the Trans-Lux Movies Corporation, in partnership with RKO (Radio-Keith-Orpheum) Studios, was created. Using Trans-Lux as its trade name, it began a theater-building program. The first Trans-Lux theater at 58th Street and Madison Avenue in New York City was actually converted from retail space, and featured larger seats, more leg room, and wider aisles than the average theater of the day. Seating only 158, it was much too small for the crowd it attracted. The rear projection technology allowed the house lights to remain low so patrons could read their programs and easily locate their seats, and also eliminated the distraction of a beam of light slicing down through the crowd from an overhead projection booth. In accordance with its news "heritage" the theatre featured a program made up exclusively of "shorts" (usually comedy routines or musical numbers) and newsreels. When the company's third theater opened two blocks away on 60th and Madison on November 10, 1933, it was turned back into retail space.[3]
In 1931, Percy Furber turned over company operations to his son, Percy. By this time, Trans-Lux had 4,000 stockholders, over 100 employees, and was valued at $2 million. In 1934, the company opened two more newsreel theaters in Brooklyn, New York and one in Philadelphia. Three more locations were added over the next three years, with architect Thomas W. Lamb designing the theater in Washington, D.C.. Offering 600 seats covered in blue leather, its lobby decorated with sports murals by New York artist Andre Hudiakoff, it was one of the first public buildings in the city to have air conditioning.[4] Located one block away from the White House, it was considered to be the most elegant Art Deco theater in the capital, up until its untimely demolition in 1975.[5]
In 1937 the company shortened its name to the Trans-Lux Corporation. Along with other theater-related businesses, it initially suffered during the postwar movie slump. Returning veterans were attending college on the GI Bill, marrying, and starting families. Newlyweds and young families with babies were usually on a budget and put the purchase of a home, a car, and new appliances ahead of going to the movies. The company's declining newsreel movie business quickly recovered when it switched to showing first-run feature films in 1949,[3] but weekly theater attendance still experienced a dramatic drop: from 78.2 million in 1946 to 58 million by 1950, when the American public chose to sit at home in front of their new television sets rather than go out to the movies.
As this postwar middle-class began moving from the cities to the suburbs, shopping complexes to support them proliferated, and theaters followed. In 1964 Trans-Lux built its first shopping center theater, an 850-seat facility in Reisterstown Road Plaza Mall in Baltimore. By 1969, the company had brought large, modern theaters to five more suburban shopping centers, nearly doubling the size of its theater holdings, and by 1965 had 37 theaters in ten states.
By the end of the 1960s, the theater building boom was over as well. In 1973 Trans-Lux lost money on its theaters for the first time in years. The boom had aggravated the newly independent industry's problem of a shortage of quality movies. Bidding on films became fierce, and many companies split their single theaters into twins. Three screen and four screen theaters began appearing, and when Richard Brandt replaced Percy Furber as chairman of the board in 1974, the multiplex trend (with as many as 12 screens) was in full swing. Some of the company's theaters were split into two and three screen houses, and others were sold off entirely.
In the midst of this, Trans-Lux went into the business of multimedia shows. The 1970 premiere of the "San Francisco Experience", a 29-projector, seven-screen spectacular with 30 special effects inspired the company to hire its creators to develop a nearly $1 million budget multimedia entertainment film about New York City. The September 28, 1973 opening of the 45-projector, 16-screen film was called "bedazzling and breathtaking" by The New York Times. "The New York Experience", which was housed in a sub-basement of the McGraw-Hill Building in Rockefeller Center, became the longest-running commercial multimedia show in history, until its demise in 1989. Despite its popularity, the show—which featured panoramic movie screens, slide projections, extensive light and sound systems, and a mannequin that dropped out of the ceiling to recreate the hanging of Nathan Hale—was forced to close due to escalating rent costs.[6]

Trans-Lux also entered the health care industry with products designed for hospitals, pharmacies, and outpatient clinics by offering critical information displays.
In 2001, the Cincinnati Reds installed the company's new RainbowRibbon™ fascia displays as well as a baseball scoreboard, pitcher's board and out-of-town game board in their new 42,000-seat stadium, Great American Ball Park, at an estimated cost of over $3 million. The RainbowRibbon™ uses Trans-Lux' unique XFS scaling, which allows precise control of video images and improves image quality at the lower resolutions typical of LED displays. The three hundred feet of display in the Reds' installation featured over 273,500 pixels in an 8.6 billion color LED matrix, and ihas caught the attention of many professional sports teams due to its ability to optimize advertising space on arena and stadium tier fascias. The displays smoothly transition between video, advertising, animations, scoring/statistic layouts, and up to six lines of text around the interior of the facility. The system also featured a 3.5' x 33.5' SpectraLens™ pitch count board and a giant 24' x 164' SpectraLens scoreboard, which in 2003, when the park opened, was possibly the largest incandescent scoreboard ever constructed for a professional sports facility to date. The scoreboard, located in the left outfield, is capable of displaying game scores, graphics, animations, player statistics, advertising and general information.[2]
Trans-Lux continued to supply LED/incandescent displays and scoring systems to major and minor league baseball teams, such as the San Francisco Giants. In addition to professional baseball, Trans-Lux has provided displays and equipment to other professional sports teams, such as the NBA's Charlotte Hornets and Detroit Pistons.[16]
By 2002, annual revenues had reached $70.1 million in three divisions: outdoor displays, indoor displays, and entertainment/real estate. While the company headquarters still remain in Norwalk, manufacturing operations were moved to Stratford, Connecticut in 2008. Trans-Lux now has major U.S. sales and service centers in Norwalk; New York; Atlanta; Chicago; and Torrance, California, in addition to their satellite offices throughout the U.S. and Canada. Subsidiary companies are located in Iowa, Utah, Canada, and Australia. Trans-Lux's International Division maintains a distributor network throughout the world, including most major financial centers as well as in many newly developing countries.[16] In recent years, company headquarters have returned to New York, with the Norwalk and Atlanta sales and services centers merged into the New York office. As a further consequence, the Chicago office closed, while the Torrance, California office moved to Camarillo, California.
Company divisions[edit]
Trans-Lux also has three subsidiaries:

Fair Play Scoreboards, a scoreboard and sports equipment manufacturer.
TL Energy, a leading provider of LED lighting and related solutions.
PrismaTronic, a dedicated provider of Digital LED solutions for the OOH marketplace

Public documents[edit]
As stated in SEC paperwork, on March 28, 2003, a wholly owned subsidiary, Trans-Lux Corporation, sold its custom sports division, including licensing of intellectual property and its facility located in Logan, Utah to Barco, Inc., for a cash price of approximately $3.7 million, plus assumption of two Industrial Revenue Bonds totaling approximately $4.2 million, for an approximate total sale price of $7.9 million.
Trans-Lux also announced that it received a letter dated November 10, 2010 from NYSE Amex informing it that the Listings Qualifications Panel of the Exchange's Committee on Securities has affirmed the determination to delist Trans-Lux's Common Stock as of November 17, 2010.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Early history[edit]
The company was created by Percy Norman Furber, an Englishman, who moved to the United States in October 1918, after a time spent drilling for oil and mining quicksilver in Mexico. Furber was interested in developing a projection system that could be used in a lighted room, and enlisted the aid of a friend, Arthur Payne, a former employee of Thomas Edison. Payne hit upon the idea of rear projection; projecting an image through a screen rather than on it. However, this concept required a finer and more translucent material for the screen than any that currently existed.
Moving light[edit]
In 1920, Furber formed American Lux (Latin for "light") Products, and three years later, using a fine high-quality natural silk, it created its first successful screen, with initial sales going mostly to schools and churches. It was only after a visit to the New York Stock Exchange that Furber saw a truly profitable application for rear projection. At the time, brokers obtained the latest stock quotes, provided by Western Union's telegraph, or wire service, from a glass dome-topped ticker. The machine printed the results onto a long thin piece of paper known as a ticker tape, with the brokers closest to the printer having the advantage. Prior to this invention, any stock information was hand-written, usually on a chalk board; although the results were less immediate, they were better displayed. Furber combined the best aspects of both methods: by enlarging the stock quotations from the running ticker tape and displaying them onto a rear projection screen. In 1923, the company installed the first "Movie ticker" ticker tape projection system at the New York Stock Exchange. Like every ticker of the time it was a mechanical format, but by using yellow dots on a black background it gave the illusion of electronically generated green letters and numbers.
It is this stock ticker that provided the company's name: "Trans-Lux" meaning "moving light".
Financing this new operation required more capital, so Furber took his company public on August 26, 1925. It was listed on the New York Curb Exchange, which later became the American Stock Exchange. Until being delisted in 2011[1] Trans-Lux stock was the oldest company to be listed on the American Stock Exchange.[2] In 1925, the company had 41 installations on stock exchange floors and brokerage house boardrooms throughout the country.
Moving pictures[edit]
By 1927 the company had created a much larger, commercial-sized theater screen and took it, along with its rear projector system and a new wide-angle lens, to the motion picture industry. To further penetrate the market, the Trans-Lux Movies Corporation, in partnership with RKO (Radio-Keith-Orpheum) Studios, was created. Using Trans-Lux as its trade name, it began a theater-building program. The first Trans-Lux theater at 58th Street and Madison Avenue in New York City was actually converted from retail space, and featured larger seats, more leg room, and wider aisles than the average theater of the day. Seating only 158, it was much too small for the crowd it attracted. The rear projection technology allowed the house lights to remain low so patrons could read their programs and easily locate their seats, and also eliminated the distraction of a beam of light slicing down through the crowd from an overhead projection booth. In accordance with its news "heritage" the theatre featured a program made up exclusively of "shorts" (usually comedy routines or musical numbers) and newsreels. When the company's third theater opened two blocks away on 60th and Madison on November 10, 1933, it was turned back into retail space.[3]
In 1931, Percy Furber turned over company operations to his son, Percy. By this time, Trans-Lux had 4,000 stockholders, over 100 employees, and was valued at $2 million. In 1934, the company opened two more newsreel theaters in Brooklyn, New York and one in Philadelphia. Three more locations were added over the next three years, with architect Thomas W. Lamb designing the theater in Washington, D.C.. Offering 600 seats covered in blue leather, its lobby decorated with sports murals by New York artist Andre Hudiakoff, it was one of the first public buildings in the city to have air conditioning.[4] Located one block away from the White House, it was considered to be the most elegant Art Deco theater in the capital, up until its untimely demolition in 1975.[5]
In 1937 the company shortened its name to the Trans-Lux Corporation. Along with other theater-related businesses, it initially suffered during the postwar movie slump. Returning veterans were attending college on the GI Bill, marrying, and starting families. Newlyweds and young families with babies were usually on a budget and put the purchase of a home, a car, and new appliances ahead of going to the movies. The company's declining newsreel movie business quickly recovered when it switched to showing first-run feature films in 1949,[3] but weekly theater attendance still experienced a dramatic drop: from 78.2 million in 1946 to 58 million by 1950, when the American public chose to sit at home in front of their new television sets rather than go out to the movies.
As this postwar middle-class began moving from the cities to the suburbs, shopping complexes to support them proliferated, and theaters followed. In 1964 Trans-Lux built its first shopping center theater, an 850-seat facility in Reisterstown Road Plaza Mall in Baltimore. By 1969, the company had brought large, modern theaters to five more suburban shopping centers, nearly doubling the size of its theater holdings, and by 1965 had 37 theaters in ten states.
By the end of the 1960s, the theater building boom was over as well. In 1973 Trans-Lux lost money on its theaters for the first time in years. The boom had aggravated the newly independent industry's problem of a shortage of quality movies. Bidding on films became fierce, and many companies split their single theaters into twins. Three screen and four screen theaters began appearing, and when Richard Brandt replaced Percy Furber as chairman of the board in 1974, the multiplex trend (with as many as 12 screens) was in full swing. Some of the company's theaters were split into two and three screen houses, and others were sold off entirely.
In the midst of this, Trans-Lux went into the business of multimedia shows. The 1970 premiere of the "San Francisco Experience", a 29-projector, seven-screen spectacular with 30 special effects inspired the company to hire its creators to develop a nearly $1 million budget multimedia entertainment film about New York City. The September 28, 1973 opening of the 45-projector, 16-screen film was called "bedazzling and breathtaking" by The New York Times. "The New York Experience", which was housed in a sub-basement of the McGraw-Hill Building in Rockefeller Center, became the longest-running commercial multimedia show in history, until its demise in 1989. Despite its popularity, the show—which featured panoramic movie screens, slide projections, extensive light and sound systems, and a mannequin that dropped out of the ceiling to recreate the hanging of Nathan Hale—was forced to close due to escalating rent costs.[6]
By 1981, Trans-Lux's theater holdings were reduced to 28 screens, concentrated in the Northeast, particularly Connecticut. By the mid-1990s, the theater division invested in building new theaters in the western US, bringing the company's total to 65 screens. In 2000, the firm opened its own Los Angeles-based film booking office.
Television[edit]
By 1950, television had become America's most popular form of entertainment. In 1940, there were only 3,785 television sets in the US. Two decades later, nine out of ten homes had at least one set.[7]
Trans-Lux soon began developing specialized rear-projection equipment for television studios, greatly expanded its engineering capacity and started supplying the studios with "Teleprocess" screens and projectors. When closed circuit television (CCTV) appeared in the late 1940s, Trans-Lux adapted that technology for viewing stock market information, and formed an electronics division to develop and sell CCTV systems in 1959. They also developed a television program syndication service, and in association with Adventure Cartoon Productions produced the popular animated children's series: Felix the Cat[8] and The Mighty Hercules.[9] The expanded business required Trans-Lux to move from its Brooklyn headquarters to a larger, five-story building in Long Island City.
In 1967, they commissioned Titra Studios, a New York City recording company that provided English translations for foreign movies, to "Americanize" the new Japanese animated series, Speed Racer,[10] for domestic television. Trans-Lux retained the series until 1969, when it sold off its animated television holdings in order to concentrate on manufacturing illuminated stock market tickers. Trans-Lux's film catalog was purchased by independent distributor Alan Gleitsman, whose Alan Enterprises[11] continued to syndicate Speed Racer to independent TV stations throughout the 1970s.[12] That same year the company moved its headquarters again, this time relocating to Norwalk, Connecticut.
As for the Trans-Lux library, Gleitsman left the syndication business in 1986 and sold his assets to a colorization company called Color Systems Technology, which in turn sold the library (which includes the Alan Enterprises/Trans-Lux library, the rights to Speed Racer, and the Adventure Cartoon Productions series) to Broadway Video in 1989 due to bankruptcy.[13][14]
Stock quotes and signage[edit]
In 1940, Trans-Lux purchased a patent for a remote-control signaling system that enabled small rounded pellets to form letters and numbers and travel around outdoor message signs. It also joined forces with the Artkraft Strauss Sign Corporation, which was the first signage corporation to first illuminate the "Great White Way" of Broadway. By 1948 it was supplying electrical traveling message signs to advertisers, radio stations, and publishers throughout the country. At the same time, Trans-Lux had 1,400 stock-ticker projectors and 80 news projectors in the United States, plus another 200 in Canada.
By the early '60's, Trans-Lux began to see a need for greater investment in electronics as stock exchanges and brokerage firms were inundated with new, advanced techniques for gathering and projecting information. The company's fortunes were tied to its old system's two-step process: the information it relied on began with prices from the ticker tape, then a delay was required as the ticker tape shifted away from the print head to a viewing position for projecting or televising. With an electronic ticker display, Trans-Lux could bypass the printing stage, creating a real-time, immediate information system.
In 1965, the company was shocked by the introduction of a new 45-foot (14 m)-long electronic display installed on the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange by a competitor, Recognition Equipment Inc. (REI), of Dallas. Even though the Ultronic Letrascan electronic wall device had been steadily replacing Trans-Lux tickers for several years, the New York Stock Exchange installation was cause for concern, as Trans-Lux had enjoyed a long-standing business relationship with the exchange. The company made a deal with REI: since Trans-Lux needed Recognition's technology, and they needed Trans-Lux's knowledge of how to market stock-ticker equipment, they formed a joint venture to create a much smaller version of the Recognition system.
Two years later, they announced the Trans-Lux Jet, named for the jets of air that controlled character formation in the sign. It was the highest quality, real-time, continuous flow wall display yet produced, and a new method of viewing up-to-the-minute stock market sales information. Its ten-foot size made it perfect for brokerage offices, but perhaps the best news for Trans-Lux was that it no longer needed to rely on the Western Union ticker. U.S. and Canadian brokerage houses ordered more than 1,000 Trans-Lux Jets in the first six months, and Trans-Lux opened an international office in Zurich, Switzerland to deal with overseas orders. By mid-1969, about 3,000 Jets were in use. Shortly after introducing the Jet, Trans-Lux applied the same innovations to closed-circuit television.
The Jet's popularity required Trans-Lux to find a larger production facility. In 1970, the company moved to Norwalk, Connecticut. Demand for Jets continued to grow. Longer versions of 15, 25, and 43 feet (13 m) were produced. In 1969, Trans-Lux had succeeded in reducing the size of the Jet to one-fifth of the original. Ten years later, by developing a powerful miniature microprocessor chip, the company reduced the Jet to one-twenty-fifth of its original size.
As successful as the Jet was, it failed to address one important segment of the stock market: large portfolio holders and active traders had no way to automatically focus on their market objectives and private individual stock holdings. When a Chicago-based company, Quotemaster (later Extel) developed an experimental prototype for a selective read-out device, Trans-Lux approached them. The company soon began to develop and then manufacturing the device, now called the Personal Ticker,[15] which could be programmed to monitor up to 40 stocks on a single exchange. By 1969, Trans-Lux began installing the product for private investors, portfolio managers, pension fund administrators, investment advisors, and individual brokers. That same year the strong bull market abruptly ended, drastically impacting installations of all types of Trans-Lux equipment.
Following the market decline, Trans-Lux management learned that their electronic display sales should not be overly dependent on a single industry, and decided to diversify. The company formed an industrial sales department in 1970 under the leadership of Louis Credidio, who went after the commodity market and in 1971 sold an adaptation of the Personal Ticker, the T-900, to the Chicago Board of Trade. Soon Trans-Lux completed sales to many other commodity exchanges, capturing a small but significant new market. When Extel's teleprinter terminal sales boomed, it contracted Trans-Lux to manufacture keyboards and way-station selectors, which led to Trans-Lux's entry into the teleprinter market. Credidio studied the telex terminal field and by 1974 Trans-Lux began marketing a telex terminal, the Trans-Lux Teleprinter (TLT), to several industries. More than 700 terminals were installed by 1975.
Diversification[edit]
Early in 1995, Trans-Lux acquired Integrated Systems Engineering, Inc., a full service electronic sign manufacturing company, to broaden its outdoor signage capabilities, such as those found on billboards, or outside truck stops, banks, and sports arenas. The company's capacity to produce electronic displays increased in 2000 when it opened a modern outdoor display manufacturing facility in Utah. The indoor display division remained a major supplier of communications tools for the banking and financial community, but now theaters, museums, hotels, corporations, and military hospitals were customers. The division experienced a growth spurt in 2000 when the Australian Gaming Control Board approved Trans-Lux's serial slot controller for sale in their country. That decision also boosted sales of the LED jackpot meter displays that work hand in hand with the slot controllers. Trans-Lux also entered the health care industry with products designed for hospitals, pharmacies, and outpatient clinics by offering critical information displays.
In 2001, the Cincinnati Reds installed the company's new RainbowRibbon™ fascia displays as well as a baseball scoreboard, pitcher's board and out-of-town game board in their new 42,000-seat stadium, Great American Ball Park, at an estimated cost of over $3 million. The RainbowRibbon™ uses Trans-Lux' unique XFS scaling, which allows precise control of video images and improves image quality at the lower resolutions typical of LED displays. The three hundred feet of display in the Reds' installation featured over 273,500 pixels in an 8.6 billion color LED matrix, and ihas caught the attention of many professional sports teams due to its ability to optimize advertising space on arena and stadium tier fascias. The displays smoothly transition between video, advertising, animations, scoring/statistic layouts, and up to six lines of text around the interior of the facility. The system also featured a 3.5' x 33.5' SpectraLens™ pitch count board and a giant 24' x 164' SpectraLens scoreboard, which in 2003, when the park opened, was possibly the largest incandescent scoreboard ever constructed for a professional sports facility to date. The scoreboard, located in the left outfield, is capable of displaying game scores, graphics, animations, player statistics, advertising and general information.[2]
Trans-Lux continued to supply LED/incandescent displays and scoring systems to major and minor league baseball teams, such as the San Francisco Giants. In addition to professional baseball, Trans-Lux has provided displays and equipment to other professional sports teams, such as the NBA's Charlotte Hornets and Detroit Pistons.[16]
By 2002, annual revenues had reached $70.1 million in three divisions: outdoor displays, indoor displays, and entertainment/real estate. While the company headquarters still remain in Norwalk, manufacturing operations were moved to Stratford, Connecticut in 2008. Trans-Lux now has major U.S. sales and service centers in Norwalk; New York; Atlanta; Chicago; and Torrance, California, in addition to their satellite offices throughout the U.S. and Canada. Subsidiary companies are located in Iowa, Utah, Canada, and Australia. Trans-Lux's International Division maintains a distributor network throughout the world, including most major financial centers as well as in many newly developing countries.[16] In recent years, company headquarters have returned to New York, with the Norwalk and Atlanta sales and services centers merged into the New York office. As a further consequence, the Chicago office closed, while the Torrance, California office moved to Camarillo, California.
Company divisions[edit]
Trans-Lux also has three subsidiaries:

Fair Play Scoreboards, a scoreboard and sports equipment manufacturer.
TL Energy, a leading provider of LED lighting and related solutions.
PrismaTronic, a dedicated provider of Digital LED solutions for the OOH marketplace

Public documents[edit]
As stated in SEC paperwork, on March 28, 2003, a wholly owned subsidiary, Trans-Lux Corporation, sold its custom sports division, including licensing of intellectual property and its facility located in Logan, Utah to Barco, Inc., for a cash price of approximately $3.7 million, plus assumption of two Industrial Revenue Bonds totaling approximately $4.2 million, for an approximate total sale price of $7.9 million.
Trans-Lux also announced that it received a letter dated November 10, 2010 from NYSE Amex informing it that the Listings Qualifications Panel of the Exchange's Committee on Securities has affirmed the determination to delist Trans-Lux's Common Stock as of November 17, 2010.

Early history[edit]
The company was created by Percy Norman Furber, an Englishman, who moved to the United States in October 1918, after a time spent drilling for oil and mining quicksilver in Mexico. Furber was interested in developing a projection system that could be used in a lighted room, and enlisted the aid of a friend, Arthur Payne, a former employee of Thomas Edison. Payne hit upon the idea of rear projection; projecting an image through a screen rather than on it. However, this concept required a finer and more translucent material for the screen than any that currently existed.
Moving light[edit]
In 1920, Furber formed American Lux (Latin for "light") Products, and three years later, using a fine high-quality natural silk, it created its first successful screen, with initial sales going mostly to schools and churches. It was only after a visit to the New York Stock Exchange that Furber saw a truly profitable application for rear projection. At the time, brokers obtained the latest stock quotes, provided by Western Union's telegraph, or wire service, from a glass dome-topped ticker. The machine printed the results onto a long thin piece of paper known as a ticker tape, with the brokers closest to the printer having the advantage. Prior to this invention, any stock information was hand-written, usually on a chalk board; although the results were less immediate, they were better displayed. Furber combined the best aspects of both methods: by enlarging the stock quotations from the running ticker tape and displaying them onto a rear projection screen. In 1923, the company installed the first "Movie ticker" ticker tape projection system at the New York Stock Exchange. Like every ticker of the time it was a mechanical format, but by using yellow dots on a black background it gave the illusion of electronically generated green letters and numbers.
It is this stock ticker that provided the company's name: "Trans-Lux" meaning "moving light".
Financing this new operation required more capital, so Furber took his company public on August 26, 1925. It was listed on the New York Curb Exchange, which later became the American Stock Exchange. Until being delisted in 2011[1] Trans-Lux stock was the oldest company to be listed on the American Stock Exchange.[2] In 1925, the company had 41 installations on stock exchange floors and brokerage house boardrooms throughout the country.
Moving pictures[edit]
By 1927 the company had created a much larger, commercial-sized theater screen and took it, along with its rear projector system and a new wide-angle lens, to the motion picture industry. To further penetrate the market, the Trans-Lux Movies Corporation, in partnership with RKO (Radio-Keith-Orpheum) Studios, was created. Using Trans-Lux as its trade name, it began a theater-building program. The first Trans-Lux theater at 58th Street and Madison Avenue in New York City was actually converted from retail space, and featured larger seats, more leg room, and wider aisles than the average theater of the day. Seating only 158, it was much too small for the crowd it attracted. The rear projection technology allowed the house lights to remain low so patrons could read their programs and easily locate their seats, and also eliminated the distraction of a beam of light slicing down through the crowd from an overhead projection booth. In accordance with its news "heritage" the theatre featured a program made up exclusively of "shorts" (usually comedy routines or musical numbers) and newsreels. When the company's third theater opened two blocks away on 60th and Madison on November 10, 1933, it was turned back into retail space.[3]
In 1931, Percy Furber turned over company operations to his son, Percy. By this time, Trans-Lux had 4,000 stockholders, over 100 employees, and was valued at $2 million. In 1934, the company opened two more newsreel theaters in Brooklyn, New York and one in Philadelphia. Three more locations were added over the next three years, with architect Thomas W. Lamb designing the theater in Washington, D.C.. Offering 600 seats covered in blue leather, its lobby decorated with sports murals by New York artist Andre Hudiakoff, it was one of the first public buildings in the city to have air conditioning.[4] Located one block away from the White House, it was considered to be the most elegant Art Deco theater in the capital, up until its untimely demolition in 1975.[5]
In 1937 the company shortened its name to the Trans-Lux Corporation. Along with other theater-related businesses, it initially suffered during the postwar movie slump. Returning veterans were attending college on the GI Bill, marrying, and starting families. Newlyweds and young families with babies were usually on a budget and put the purchase of a home, a car, and new appliances ahead of going to the movies. The company's declining newsreel movie business quickly recovered when it switched to showing first-run feature films in 1949,[3] but weekly theater attendance still experienced a dramatic drop: from 78.2 million in 1946 to 58 million by 1950, when the American public chose to sit at home in front of their new television sets rather than go out to the movies.
As this postwar middle-class began moving from the cities to the suburbs, shopping complexes to support them proliferated, and theaters followed. In 1964 Trans-Lux built its first shopping center theater, an 850-seat facility in Reisterstown Road Plaza Mall in Baltimore. By 1969, the company had brought large, modern theaters to five more suburban shopping centers, nearly doubling the size of its theater holdings, and by 1965 had 37 theaters in ten states.
By the end of the 1960s, the theater building boom was over as well. In 1973 Trans-Lux lost money on its theaters for the first time in years. The boom had aggravated the newly independent industry's problem of a shortage of quality movies. Bidding on films became fierce, and many companies split their single theaters into twins. Three screen and four screen theaters began appearing, and when Richard Brandt replaced Percy Furber as chairman of the board in 1974, the multiplex trend (with as many as 12 screens) was in full swing. Some of the company's theaters were split into two and three screen houses, and others were sold off entirely.
In the midst of this, Trans-Lux went into the business of multimedia shows. The 1970 premiere of the "San Francisco Experience", a 29-projector, seven-screen spectacular with 30 special effects inspired the company to hire its creators to develop a nearly $1 million budget multimedia entertainment film about New York City. The September 28, 1973 opening of the 45-projector, 16-screen film was called "bedazzling and breathtaking" by The New York Times. "The New York Experience", which was housed in a sub-basement of the McGraw-Hill Building in Rockefeller Center, became the longest-running commercial multimedia show in history, until its demise in 1989. Despite its popularity, the show—which featured panoramic movie screens, slide projections, extensive light and sound systems, and a mannequin that dropped out of the ceiling to recreate the hanging of Nathan Hale—was forced to close due to escalating rent costs.[6]
By 1981, Trans-Lux's theater holdings were reduced to 28 screens, concentrated in the Northeast, particularly Connecticut. By the mid-1990s, the theater division invested in building new theaters in the western US, bringing the company's total to 65 screens. In 2000, the firm opened its own Los Angeles-based film booking office.
Television[edit]
By 1950, television had become America's most popular form of entertainment. In 1940, there were only 3,785 television sets in the US. Two decades later, nine out of ten homes had at least one set.[7]
Trans-Lux soon began developing specialized rear-projection equipment for television studios, greatly expanded its engineering capacity and started supplying the studios with "Teleprocess" screens and projectors. When closed circuit television (CCTV) appeared in the late 1940s, Trans-Lux adapted that technology for viewing stock market information, and formed an electronics division to develop and sell CCTV systems in 1959. They also developed a television program syndication service, and in association with Adventure Cartoon Productions produced the popular animated children's series: Felix the Cat[8] and The Mighty Hercules.[9] The expanded business required Trans-Lux to move from its Brooklyn headquarters to a larger, five-story building in Long Island City.
In 1967, they commissioned Titra Studios, a New York City recording company that provided English translations for foreign movies, to "Americanize" the new Japanese animated series, Speed Racer,[10] for domestic television. Trans-Lux retained the series until 1969, when it sold off its animated television holdings in order to concentrate on manufacturing illuminated stock market tickers. Trans-Lux's film catalog was purchased by independent distributor Alan Gleitsman, whose Alan Enterprises[11] continued to syndicate Speed Racer to independent TV stations throughout the 1970s.[12] That same year the company moved its headquarters again, this time relocating to Norwalk, Connecticut.
As for the Trans-Lux library, Gleitsman left the syndication business in 1986 and sold his assets to a colorization company called Color Systems Technology, which in turn sold the library (which includes the Alan Enterprises/Trans-Lux library, the rights to Speed Racer, and the Adventure Cartoon Productions series) to Broadway Video in 1989 due to bankruptcy.[13][14]
Stock quotes and signage[edit]
In 1940, Trans-Lux purchased a patent for a remote-control signaling system that enabled small rounded pellets to form letters and numbers and travel around outdoor message signs. It also joined forces with the Artkraft Strauss Sign Corporation, which was the first signage corporation to first illuminate the "Great White Way" of Broadway. By 1948 it was supplying electrical traveling message signs to advertisers, radio stations, and publishers throughout the country. At the same time, Trans-Lux had 1,400 stock-ticker projectors and 80 news projectors in the United States, plus another 200 in Canada.
By the early '60's, Trans-Lux began to see a need for greater investment in electronics as stock exchanges and brokerage firms were inundated with new, advanced techniques for gathering and projecting information. The company's fortunes were tied to its old system's two-step process: the information it relied on began with prices from the ticker tape, then a delay was required as the ticker tape shifted away from the print head to a viewing position for projecting or televising. With an electronic ticker display, Trans-Lux could bypass the printing stage, creating a real-time, immediate information system.
In 1965, the company was shocked by the introduction of a new 45-foot (14 m)-long electronic display installed on the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange by a competitor, Recognition Equipment Inc. (REI), of Dallas. Even though the Ultronic Letrascan electronic wall device had been steadily replacing Trans-Lux tickers for several years, the New York Stock Exchange installation was cause for concern, as Trans-Lux had enjoyed a long-standing business relationship with the exchange. The company made a deal with REI: since Trans-Lux needed Recognition's technology, and they needed Trans-Lux's knowledge of how to market stock-ticker equipment, they formed a joint venture to create a much smaller version of the Recognition system.
Two years later, they announced the Trans-Lux Jet, named for the jets of air that controlled character formation in the sign. It was the highest quality, real-time, continuous flow wall display yet produced, and a new method of viewing up-to-the-minute stock market sales information. Its ten-foot size made it perfect for brokerage offices, but perhaps the best news for Trans-Lux was that it no longer needed to rely on the Western Union ticker. U.S. and Canadian brokerage houses ordered more than 1,000 Trans-Lux Jets in the first six months, and Trans-Lux opened an international office in Zurich, Switzerland to deal with overseas orders. By mid-1969, about 3,000 Jets were in use. Shortly after introducing the Jet, Trans-Lux applied the same innovations to closed-circuit television.
The Jet's popularity required Trans-Lux to find a larger production facility. In 1970, the company moved to Norwalk, Connecticut. Demand for Jets continued to grow. Longer versions of 15, 25, and 43 feet (13 m) were produced. In 1969, Trans-Lux had succeeded in reducing the size of the Jet to one-fifth of the original. Ten years later, by developing a powerful miniature microprocessor chip, the company reduced the Jet to one-twenty-fifth of its original size.
As successful as the Jet was, it failed to address one important segment of the stock market: large portfolio holders and active traders had no way to automatically focus on their market objectives and private individual stock holdings. When a Chicago-based company, Quotemaster (later Extel) developed an experimental prototype for a selective read-out device, Trans-Lux approached them. The company soon began to develop and then manufacturing the device, now called the Personal Ticker,[15] which could be programmed to monitor up to 40 stocks on a single exchange. By 1969, Trans-Lux began installing the product for private investors, portfolio managers, pension fund administrators, investment advisors, and individual brokers. That same year the strong bull market abruptly ended, drastically impacting installations of all types of Trans-Lux equipment.
Following the market decline, Trans-Lux management learned that their electronic display sales should not be overly dependent on a single industry, and decided to diversify. The company formed an industrial sales department in 1970 under the leadership of Louis Credidio, who went after the commodity market and in 1971 sold an adaptation of the Personal Ticker, the T-900, to the Chicago Board of Trade. Soon Trans-Lux completed sales to many other commodity exchanges, capturing a small but significant new market. When Extel's teleprinter terminal sales boomed, it contracted Trans-Lux to manufacture keyboards and way-station selectors, which led to Trans-Lux's entry into the teleprinter market. Credidio studied the telex terminal field and by 1974 Trans-Lux began marketing a telex terminal, the Trans-Lux Teleprinter (TLT), to several industries. More than 700 terminals were installed by 1975.
Diversification[edit]
Early in 1995, Trans-Lux acquired Integrated Systems Engineering, Inc., a full service electronic sign manufacturing company, to broaden its outdoor signage capabilities, such as those found on billboards, or outside truck stops, banks, and sports arenas. The company's capacity to produce electronic displays increased in 2000 when it opened a modern outdoor display manufacturing facility in Utah. The indoor display division remained a major supplier of communications tools for the banking and financial community, but now theaters, museums, hotels, corporations, and military hospitals were customers. The division experienced a growth spurt in 2000 when the Australian Gaming Control Board approved Trans-Lux's serial slot controller for sale in their country. That decision also boosted sales of the LED jackpot meter displays that work hand in hand with the slot controllers. Trans-Lux also entered the health care industry with products designed for hospitals, pharmacies, and outpatient clinics by offering critical information displays.
In 2001, the Cincinnati Reds installed the company's new RainbowRibbon™ fascia displays as well as a baseball scoreboard, pitcher's board and out-of-town game board in their new 42,000-seat stadium, Great American Ball Park, at an estimated cost of over $3 million. The RainbowRibbon™ uses Trans-Lux' unique XFS scaling, which allows precise control of video images and improves image quality at the lower resolutions typical of LED displays. The three hundred feet of display in the Reds' installation featured over 273,500 pixels in an 8.6 billion color LED matrix, and ihas caught the attention of many professional sports teams due to its ability to optimize advertising space on arena and stadium tier fascias. The displays smoothly transition between video, advertising, animations, scoring/statistic layouts, and up to six lines of text around the interior of the facility. The system also featured a 3.5' x 33.5' SpectraLens™ pitch count board and a giant 24' x 164' SpectraLens scoreboard, which in 2003, when the park opened, was possibly the largest incandescent scoreboard ever constructed for a professional sports facility to date. The scoreboard, located in the left outfield, is capable of displaying game scores, graphics, animations, player statistics, advertising and general information.[2]
Trans-Lux continued to supply LED/incandescent displays and scoring systems to major and minor league baseball teams, such as the San Francisco Giants. In addition to professional baseball, Trans-Lux has provided displays and equipment to other professional sports teams, such as the NBA's Charlotte Hornets and Detroit Pistons.[16]
By 2002, annual revenues had reached $70.1 million in three divisions: outdoor displays, indoor displays, and entertainment/real estate. While the company headquarters still remain in Norwalk, manufacturing operations were moved to Stratford, Connecticut in 2008. Trans-Lux now has major U.S. sales and service centers in Norwalk; New York; Atlanta; Chicago; and Torrance, California, in addition to their satellite offices throughout the U.S. and Canada. Subsidiary companies are located in Iowa, Utah, Canada, and Australia. Trans-Lux's International Division maintains a distributor network throughout the world, including most major financial centers as well as in many newly developing countries.[16] In recent years, company headquarters have returned to New York, with the Norwalk and Atlanta sales and services centers merged into the New York office. As a further consequence, the Chicago office closed, while the Torrance, California office moved to Camarillo, California.
Company divisions[edit]
Trans-Lux also has three subsidiaries:

Fair Play Scoreboards, a scoreboard and sports equipment manufacturer.
TL Energy, a leading provider of LED lighting and related solutions.
PrismaTronic, a dedicated provider of Digital LED solutions for the OOH marketplace

Public documents[edit]
As stated in SEC paperwork, on March 28, 2003, a wholly owned subsidiary, Trans-Lux Corporation, sold its custom sports division, including licensing of intellectual property and its facility located in Logan, Utah to Barco, Inc., for a cash price of approximately $3.7 million, plus assumption of two Industrial Revenue Bonds totaling approximately $4.2 million, for an approximate total sale price of $7.9 million.
Trans-Lux also announced that it received a letter dated November 10, 2010 from NYSE Amex informing it that the Listings Qualifications Panel of the Exchange's Committee on Securities has affirmed the determination to delist Trans-Lux's Common Stock as of November 17, 2010.

Early history[edit]
The company was created by Percy Norman Furber, an Englishman, who moved to the United States in October 1918, after a time spent drilling for oil and mining quicksilver in Mexico. Furber was interested in developing a projection system that could be used in a lighted room, and enlisted the aid of a friend, Arthur Payne, a former employee of Thomas Edison. Payne hit upon the idea of rear projection; projecting an image through a screen rather than on it. However, this concept required a finer and more translucent material for the screen than any that currently existed.
Moving light[edit]
In 1920, Furber formed American Lux (Latin for "light") Products, and three years later, using a fine high-quality natural silk, it created its first successful screen, with initial sales going mostly to schools and churches. It was only after a visit to the New York Stock Exchange that Furber saw a truly profitable application for rear projection. At the time, brokers obtained the latest stock quotes, provided by Western Union's telegraph, or wire service, from a glass dome-topped ticker. The machine printed the results onto a long thin piece of paper known as a ticker tape, with the brokers closest to the printer having the advantage. Prior to this invention, any stock information was hand-written, usually on a chalk board; although the results were less immediate, they were better displayed. Furber combined the best aspects of both methods: by enlarging the stock quotations from the running ticker tape and displaying them onto a rear projection screen. In 1923, the company installed the first "Movie ticker" ticker tape projection system at the New York Stock Exchange. Like every ticker of the time it was a mechanical format, but by using yellow dots on a black background it gave the illusion of electronically generated green letters and numbers.
It is this stock ticker that provided the company's name: "Trans-Lux" meaning "moving light".
Financing this new operation required more capital, so Furber took his company public on August 26, 1925. It was listed on the New York Curb Exchange, which later became the American Stock Exchange. Until being delisted in 2011[1] Trans-Lux stock was the oldest company to be listed on the American Stock Exchange.[2] In 1925, the company had 41 installations on stock exchange floors and brokerage house boardrooms throughout the country.
Moving pictures[edit]
By 1927 the company had created a much larger, commercial-sized theater screen and took it, along with its rear projector system and a new wide-angle lens, to the motion picture industry. To further penetrate the market, the Trans-Lux Movies Corporation, in partnership with RKO (Radio-Keith-Orpheum) Studios, was created. Using Trans-Lux as its trade name, it began a theater-building program. The first Trans-Lux theater at 58th Street and Madison Avenue in New York City was actually converted from retail space, and featured larger seats, more leg room, and wider aisles than the average theater of the day. Seating only 158, it was much too small for the crowd it attracted. The rear projection technology allowed the house lights to remain low so patrons could read their programs and easily locate their seats, and also eliminated the distraction of a beam of light slicing down through the crowd from an overhead projection booth. In accordance with its news "heritage" the theatre featured a program made up exclusively of "shorts" (usually comedy routines or musical numbers) and newsreels. When the company's third theater opened two blocks away on 60th and Madison on November 10, 1933, it was turned back into retail space.[3]
In 1931, Percy Furber turned over company operations to his son, Percy. By this time, Trans-Lux had 4,000 stockholders, over 100 employees, and was valued at $2 million. In 1934, the company opened two more newsreel theaters in Brooklyn, New York and one in Philadelphia. Three more locations were added over the next three years, with architect Thomas W. Lamb designing the theater in Washington, D.C.. Offering 600 seats covered in blue leather, its lobby decorated with sports murals by New York artist Andre Hudiakoff, it was one of the first public buildings in the city to have air conditioning.[4] Located one block away from the White House, it was considered to be the most elegant Art Deco theater in the capital, up until its untimely demolition in 1975.[5]
In 1937 the company shortened its name to the Trans-Lux Corporation. Along with other theater-related businesses, it initially suffered during the postwar movie slump. Returning veterans were attending college on the GI Bill, marrying, and starting families. Newlyweds and young families with babies were usually on a budget and put the purchase of a home, a car, and new appliances ahead of going to the movies. The company's declining newsreel movie business quickly recovered when it switched to showing first-run feature films in 1949,[3] but weekly theater attendance still experienced a dramatic drop: from 78.2 million in 1946 to 58 million by 1950, when the American public chose to sit at home in front of their new television sets rather than go out to the movies.
As this postwar middle-class began moving from the cities to the suburbs, shopping complexes to support them proliferated, and theaters followed. In 1964 Trans-Lux built its first shopping center theater, an 850-seat facility in Reisterstown Road Plaza Mall in Baltimore. By 1969, the company had brought large, modern theaters to five more suburban shopping centers, nearly doubling the size of its theater holdings, and by 1965 had 37 theaters in ten states.
By the end of the 1960s, the theater building boom was over as well. In 1973 Trans-Lux lost money on its theaters for the first time in years. The boom had aggravated the newly independent industry's problem of a shortage of quality movies. Bidding on films became fierce, and many companies split their single theaters into twins. Three screen and four screen theaters began appearing, and when Richard Brandt replaced Percy Furber as chairman of the board in 1974, the multiplex trend (with as many as 12 screens) was in full swing. Some of the company's theaters were split into two and three screen houses, and others were sold off entirely.
In the midst of this, Trans-Lux went into the business of multimedia shows. The 1970 premiere of the "San Francisco Experience", a 29-projector, seven-screen spectacular with 30 special effects inspired the company to hire its creators to develop a nearly $1 million budget multimedia entertainment film about New York City. The September 28, 1973 opening of the 45-projector, 16-screen film was called "bedazzling and breathtaking" by The New York Times. "The New York Experience", which was housed in a sub-basement of the McGraw-Hill Building in Rockefeller Center, became the longest-running commercial multimedia show in history, until its demise in 1989. Despite its popularity, the show—which featured panoramic movie screens, slide projections, extensive light and sound systems, and a mannequin that dropped out of the ceiling to recreate the hanging of Nathan Hale—was forced to close due to escalating rent costs.[6]
By 1981, Trans-Lux's theater holdings were reduced to 28 screens, concentrated in the Northeast, particularly Connecticut. By the mid-1990s, the theater division invested in building new theaters in the western US, bringing the company's total to 65 screens. In 2000, the firm opened its own Los Angeles-based film booking office.
Television[edit]
By 1950, television had become America's most popular form of entertainment. In 1940, there were only 3,785 television sets in the US. Two decades later, nine out of ten homes had at least one set.[7]
Trans-Lux soon began developing specialized rear-projection equipment for television studios, greatly expanded its engineering capacity and started supplying the studios with "Teleprocess" screens and projectors. When closed circuit television (CCTV) appeared in the late 1940s, Trans-Lux adapted that technology for viewing stock market information, and formed an electronics division to develop and sell CCTV systems in 1959. They also developed a television program syndication service, and in association with Adventure Cartoon Productions produced the popular animated children's series: Felix the Cat[8] and The Mighty Hercules.[9] The expanded business required Trans-Lux to move from its Brooklyn headquarters to a larger, five-story building in Long Island City.
In 1967, they commissioned Titra Studios, a New York City recording company that provided English translations for foreign movies, to "Americanize" the new Japanese animated series, Speed Racer,[10] for domestic television. Trans-Lux retained the series until 1969, when it sold off its animated television holdings in order to concentrate on manufacturing illuminated stock market tickers. Trans-Lux's film catalog was purchased by independent distributor Alan Gleitsman, whose Alan Enterprises[11] continued to syndicate Speed Racer to independent TV stations throughout the 1970s.[12] That same year the company moved its headquarters again, this time relocating to Norwalk, Connecticut.
As for the Trans-Lux library, Gleitsman left the syndication business in 1986 and sold his assets to a colorization company called Color Systems Technology, which in turn sold the library (which includes the Alan Enterprises/Trans-Lux library, the rights to Speed Racer, and the Adventure Cartoon Productions series) to Broadway Video in 1989 due to bankruptcy.[13][14]
Stock quotes and signage[edit]
In 1940, Trans-Lux purchased a patent for a remote-control signaling system that enabled small rounded pellets to form letters and numbers and travel around outdoor message signs. It also joined forces with the Artkraft Strauss Sign Corporation, which was the first signage corporation to first illuminate the "Great White Way" of Broadway. By 1948 it was supplying electrical traveling message signs to advertisers, radio stations, and publishers throughout the country. At the same time, Trans-Lux had 1,400 stock-ticker projectors and 80 news projectors in the United States, plus another 200 in Canada.
By the early '60's, Trans-Lux began to see a need for greater investment in electronics as stock exchanges and brokerage firms were inundated with new, advanced techniques for gathering and projecting information. The company's fortunes were tied to its old system's two-step process: the information it relied on began with prices from the ticker tape, then a delay was required as the ticker tape shifted away from the print head to a viewing position for projecting or televising. With an electronic ticker display, Trans-Lux could bypass the printing stage, creating a real-time, immediate information system.
In 1965, the company was shocked by the introduction of a new 45-foot (14 m)-long electronic display installed on the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange by a competitor, Recognition Equipment Inc. (REI), of Dallas. Even though the Ultronic Letrascan electronic wall device had been steadily replacing Trans-Lux tickers for several years, the New York Stock Exchange installation was cause for concern, as Trans-Lux had enjoyed a long-standing business relationship with the exchange. The company made a deal with REI: since Trans-Lux needed Recognition's technology, and they needed Trans-Lux's knowledge of how to market stock-ticker equipment, they formed a joint venture to create a much smaller version of the Recognition system.
Two years later, they announced the Trans-Lux Jet, named for the jets of air that controlled character formation in the sign. It was the highest quality, real-time, continuous flow wall display yet produced, and a new method of viewing up-to-the-minute stock market sales information. Its ten-foot size made it perfect for brokerage offices, but perhaps the best news for Trans-Lux was that it no longer needed to rely on the Western Union ticker. U.S. and Canadian brokerage houses ordered more than 1,000 Trans-Lux Jets in the first six months, and Trans-Lux opened an international office in Zurich, Switzerland to deal with overseas orders. By mid-1969, about 3,000 Jets were in use. Shortly after introducing the Jet, Trans-Lux applied the same innovations to closed-circuit television.
The Jet's popularity required Trans-Lux to find a larger production facility. In 1970, the company moved to Norwalk, Connecticut. Demand for Jets continued to grow. Longer versions of 15, 25, and 43 feet (13 m) were produced. In 1969, Trans-Lux had succeeded in reducing the size of the Jet to one-fifth of the original. Ten years later, by developing a powerful miniature microprocessor chip, the company reduced the Jet to one-twenty-fifth of its original size.
As successful as the Jet was, it failed to address one important segment of the stock market: large portfolio holders and active traders had no way to automatically focus on their market objectives and private individual stock holdings. When a Chicago-based company, Quotemaster (later Extel) developed an experimental prototype for a selective read-out device, Trans-Lux approached them. The company soon began to develop and then manufacturing the device, now called the Personal Ticker,[15] which could be programmed to monitor up to 40 stocks on a single exchange. By 1969, Trans-Lux began installing the product for private investors, portfolio managers, pension fund administrators, investment advisors, and individual brokers. That same year the strong bull market abruptly ended, drastically impacting installations of all types of Trans-Lux equipment.
Following the market decline, Trans-Lux management learned that their electronic display sales should not be overly dependent on a single industry, and decided to diversify. The company formed an industrial sales department in 1970 under the leadership of Louis Credidio, who went after the commodity market and in 1971 sold an adaptation of the Personal Ticker, the T-900, to the Chicago Board of Trade. Soon Trans-Lux completed sales to many other commodity exchanges, capturing a small but significant new market. When Extel's teleprinter terminal sales boomed, it contracted Trans-Lux to manufacture keyboards and way-station selectors, which led to Trans-Lux's entry into the teleprinter market. Credidio studied the telex terminal field and by 1974 Trans-Lux began marketing a telex terminal, the Trans-Lux Teleprinter (TLT), to several industries. More than 700 terminals were installed by 1975.
Diversification[edit]
Early in 1995, Trans-Lux acquired Integrated Systems Engineering, Inc., a full service electronic sign manufacturing company, to broaden its outdoor signage capabilities, such as those found on billboards, or outside truck stops, banks, and sports arenas. The company's capacity to produce electronic displays increased in 2000 when it opened a modern outdoor display manufacturing facility in Utah. The indoor display division remained a major supplier of communications tools for the banking and financial community, but now theaters, museums, hotels, corporations, and military hospitals were customers. The division experienced a growth spurt in 2000 when the Australian Gaming Control Board approved Trans-Lux's serial slot controller for sale in their country. That decision also boosted sales of the LED jackpot meter displays that work hand in hand with the slot controllers. Trans-Lux also entered the health care industry with products designed for hospitals, pharmacies, and outpatient clinics by offering critical information displays.
In 2001, the Cincinnati Reds installed the company's new RainbowRibbon™ fascia displays as well as a baseball scoreboard, pitcher's board and out-of-town game board in their new 42,000-seat stadium, Great American Ball Park, at an estimated cost of over $3 million. The RainbowRibbon™ uses Trans-Lux' unique XFS scaling, which allows precise control of video images and improves image quality at the lower resolutions typical of LED displays. The three hundred feet of display in the Reds' installation featured over 273,500 pixels in an 8.6 billion color LED matrix, and ihas caught the attention of many professional sports teams due to its ability to optimize advertising space on arena and stadium tier fascias. The displays smoothly transition between video, advertising, animations, scoring/statistic layouts, and up to six lines of text around the interior of the facility. The system also featured a 3.5' x 33.5' SpectraLens™ pitch count board and a giant 24' x 164' SpectraLens scoreboard, which in 2003, when the park opened, was possibly the largest incandescent scoreboard ever constructed for a professional sports facility to date. The scoreboard, located in the left outfield, is capable of displaying game scores, graphics, animations, player statistics, advertising and general information.[2]
Trans-Lux continued to supply LED/incandescent displays and scoring systems to major and minor league baseball teams, such as the San Francisco Giants. In addition to professional baseball, Trans-Lux has provided displays and equipment to other professional sports teams, such as the NBA's Charlotte Hornets and Detroit Pistons.[16]
By 2002, annual revenues had reached $70.1 million in three divisions: outdoor displays, indoor displays, and entertainment/real estate. While the company headquarters still remain in Norwalk, manufacturing operations were moved to Stratford, Connecticut in 2008. Trans-Lux now has major U.S. sales and service centers in Norwalk; New York; Atlanta; Chicago; and Torrance, California, in addition to their satellite offices throughout the U.S. and Canada. Subsidiary companies are located in Iowa, Utah, Canada, and Australia. Trans-Lux's International Division maintains a distributor network throughout the world, including most major financial centers as well as in many newly developing countries.[16] In recent years, company headquarters have returned to New York, with the Norwalk and Atlanta sales and services centers merged into the New York office. As a further consequence, the Chicago office closed, while the Torrance, California office moved to Camarillo, California.
Company divisions[edit]
Trans-Lux also has three subsidiaries:

Fair Play Scoreboards, a scoreboard and sports equipment manufacturer.
TL Energy, a leading provider of LED lighting and related solutions.
PrismaTronic, a dedicated provider of Digital LED solutions for the OOH marketplace

Public documents[edit]
As stated in SEC paperwork, on March 28, 2003, a wholly owned subsidiary, Trans-Lux Corporation, sold its custom sports division, including licensing of intellectual property and its facility located in Logan, Utah to Barco, Inc., for a cash price of approximately $3.7 million, plus assumption of two Industrial Revenue Bonds totaling approximately $4.2 million, for an approximate total sale price of $7.9 million.
Trans-Lux also announced that it received a letter dated November 10, 2010 from NYSE Amex informing it that the Listings Qualifications Panel of the Exchange's Committee on Securities has affirmed the determination to delist Trans-Lux's Common Stock as of November 17, 2010.

In 1920, Furber formed American Lux (Latin for "light") Products, and three years later, using a fine high-quality natural silk, it created its first successful screen, with initial sales going mostly to schools and churches. It was only after a visit to the New York Stock Exchange that Furber saw a truly profitable application for rear projection. At the time, brokers obtained the latest stock quotes, provided by Western Union's telegraph, or wire service, from a glass dome-topped ticker. The machine printed the results onto a long thin piece of paper known as a ticker tape, with the brokers closest to the printer having the advantage. Prior to this invention, any stock information was hand-written, usually on a chalk board; although the results were less immediate, they were better displayed. Furber combined the best aspects of both methods: by enlarging the stock quotations from the running ticker tape and displaying them onto a rear projection screen. In 1923, the company installed the first "Movie ticker" ticker tape projection system at the New York Stock Exchange. Like every ticker of the time it was a mechanical format, but by using yellow dots on a black background it gave the illusion of electronically generated green letters and numbers.
It is this stock ticker that provided the company's name: "Trans-Lux" meaning "moving light".
Financing this new operation required more capital, so Furber took his company public on August 26, 1925. It was listed on the New York Curb Exchange, which later became the American Stock Exchange. Until being delisted in 2011[1] Trans-Lux stock was the oldest company to be listed on the American Stock Exchange.[2] In 1925, the company had 41 installations on stock exchange floors and brokerage house boardrooms throughout the country.
Moving pictures[edit]
By 1927 the company had created a much larger, commercial-sized theater screen and took it, along with its rear projector system and a new wide-angle lens, to the motion picture industry. To further penetrate the market, the Trans-Lux Movies Corporation, in partnership with RKO (Radio-Keith-Orpheum) Studios, was created. Using Trans-Lux as its trade name, it began a theater-building program. The first Trans-Lux theater at 58th Street and Madison Avenue in New York City was actually converted from retail space, and featured larger seats, more leg room, and wider aisles than the average theater of the day. Seating only 158, it was much too small for the crowd it attracted. The rear projection technology allowed the house lights to remain low so patrons could read their programs and easily locate their seats, and also eliminated the distraction of a beam of light slicing down through the crowd from an overhead projection booth. In accordance with its news "heritage" the theatre featured a program made up exclusively of "shorts" (usually comedy routines or musical numbers) and newsreels. When the company's third theater opened two blocks away on 60th and Madison on November 10, 1933, it was turned back into retail space.[3]
In 1931, Percy Furber turned over company operations to his son, Percy. By this time, Trans-Lux had 4,000 stockholders, over 100 employees, and was valued at $2 million. In 1934, the company opened two more newsreel theaters in Brooklyn, New York and one in Philadelphia. Three more locations were added over the next three years, with architect Thomas W. Lamb designing the theater in Washington, D.C.. Offering 600 seats covered in blue leather, its lobby decorated with sports murals by New York artist Andre Hudiakoff, it was one of the first public buildings in the city to have air conditioning.[4] Located one block away from the White House, it was considered to be the most elegant Art Deco theater in the capital, up until its untimely demolition in 1975.[5]
In 1937 the company shortened its name to the Trans-Lux Corporation. Along with other theater-related businesses, it initially suffered during the postwar movie slump. Returning veterans were attending college on the GI Bill, marrying, and starting families. Newlyweds and young families with babies were usually on a budget and put the purchase of a home, a car, and new appliances ahead of going to the movies. The company's declining newsreel movie business quickly recovered when it switched to showing first-run feature films in 1949,[3] but weekly theater attendance still experienced a dramatic drop: from 78.2 million in 1946 to 58 million by 1950, when the American public chose to sit at home in front of their new television sets rather than go out to the movies.
As this postwar middle-class began moving from the cities to the suburbs, shopping complexes to support them proliferated, and theaters followed. In 1964 Trans-Lux built its first shopping center theater, an 850-seat facility in Reisterstown Road Plaza Mall in Baltimore. By 1969, the company had brought large, modern theaters to five more suburban shopping centers, nearly doubling the size of its theater holdings, and by 1965 had 37 theaters in ten states.
By the end of the 1960s, the theater building boom was over as well. In 1973 Trans-Lux lost money on its theaters for the first time in years. The boom had aggravated the newly independent industry's problem of a shortage of quality movies. Bidding on films became fierce, and many companies split their single theaters into twins. Three screen and four screen theaters began appearing, and when Richard Brandt replaced Percy Furber as chairman of the board in 1974, the multiplex trend (with as many as 12 screens) was in full swing. Some of the company's theaters were split into two and three screen houses, and others were sold off entirely.
In the midst of this, Trans-Lux went into the business of multimedia shows. The 1970 premiere of the "San Francisco Experience", a 29-projector, seven-screen spectacular with 30 special effects inspired the company to hire its creators to develop a nearly $1 million budget multimedia entertainment film about New York City. The September 28, 1973 opening of the 45-projector, 16-screen film was called "bedazzling and breathtaking" by The New York Times. "The New York Experience", which was housed in a sub-basement of the McGraw-Hill Building in Rockefeller Center, became the longest-running commercial multimedia show in history, until its demise in 1989. Despite its popularity, the show—which featured panoramic movie screens, slide projections, extensive light and sound systems, and a mannequin that dropped out of the ceiling to recreate the hanging of Nathan Hale—was forced to close due to escalating rent costs.[6]
By 1981, Trans-Lux's theater holdings were reduced to 28 screens, concentrated in the Northeast, particularly Connecticut. By the mid-1990s, the theater division invested in building new theaters in the western US, bringing the company's total to 65 screens. In 2000, the firm opened its own Los Angeles-based film booking office.
Television[edit]
By 1950, television had become America's most popular form of entertainment. In 1940, there were only 3,785 television sets in the US. Two decades later, nine out of ten homes had at least one set.[7]
Trans-Lux soon began developing specialized rear-projection equipment for television studios, greatly expanded its engineering capacity and started supplying the studios with "Teleprocess" screens and projectors. When closed circuit television (CCTV) appeared in the late 1940s, Trans-Lux adapted that technology for viewing stock market information, and formed an electronics division to develop and sell CCTV systems in 1959. They also developed a television program syndication service, and in association with Adventure Cartoon Productions produced the popular animated children's series: Felix the Cat[8] and The Mighty Hercules.[9] The expanded business required Trans-Lux to move from its Brooklyn headquarters to a larger, five-story building in Long Island City.
In 1967, they commissioned Titra Studios, a New York City recording company that provided English translations for foreign movies, to "Americanize" the new Japanese animated series, Speed Racer,[10] for domestic television. Trans-Lux retained the series until 1969, when it sold off its animated television holdings in order to concentrate on manufacturing illuminated stock market tickers. Trans-Lux's film catalog was purchased by independent distributor Alan Gleitsman, whose Alan Enterprises[11] continued to syndicate Speed Racer to independent TV stations throughout the 1970s.[12] That same year the company moved its headquarters again, this time relocating to Norwalk, Connecticut.
As for the Trans-Lux library, Gleitsman left the syndication business in 1986 and sold his assets to a colorization company called Color Systems Technology, which in turn sold the library (which includes the Alan Enterprises/Trans-Lux library, the rights to Speed Racer, and the Adventure Cartoon Productions series) to Broadway Video in 1989 due to bankruptcy.[13][14]
Stock quotes and signage[edit]
In 1940, Trans-Lux purchased a patent for a remote-control signaling system that enabled small rounded pellets to form letters and numbers and travel around outdoor message signs. It also joined forces with the Artkraft Strauss Sign Corporation, which was the first signage corporation to first illuminate the "Great White Way" of Broadway. By 1948 it was supplying electrical traveling message signs to advertisers, radio stations, and publishers throughout the country. At the same time, Trans-Lux had 1,400 stock-ticker projectors and 80 news projectors in the United States, plus another 200 in Canada.
By the early '60's, Trans-Lux began to see a need for greater investment in electronics as stock exchanges and brokerage firms were inundated with new, advanced techniques for gathering and projecting information. The company's fortunes were tied to its old system's two-step process: the information it relied on began with prices from the ticker tape, then a delay was required as the ticker tape shifted away from the print head to a viewing position for projecting or televising. With an electronic ticker display, Trans-Lux could bypass the printing stage, creating a real-time, immediate information system.
In 1965, the company was shocked by the introduction of a new 45-foot (14 m)-long electronic display installed on the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange by a competitor, Recognition Equipment Inc. (REI), of Dallas. Even though the Ultronic Letrascan electronic wall device had been steadily replacing Trans-Lux tickers for several years, the New York Stock Exchange installation was cause for concern, as Trans-Lux had enjoyed a long-standing business relationship with the exchange. The company made a deal with REI: since Trans-Lux needed Recognition's technology, and they needed Trans-Lux's knowledge of how to market stock-ticker equipment, they formed a joint venture to create a much smaller version of the Recognition system.
Two years later, they announced the Trans-Lux Jet, named for the jets of air that controlled character formation in the sign. It was the highest quality, real-time, continuous flow wall display yet produced, and a new method of viewing up-to-the-minute stock market sales information. Its ten-foot size made it perfect for brokerage offices, but perhaps the best news for Trans-Lux was that it no longer needed to rely on the Western Union ticker. U.S. and Canadian brokerage houses ordered more than 1,000 Trans-Lux Jets in the first six months, and Trans-Lux opened an international office in Zurich, Switzerland to deal with overseas orders. By mid-1969, about 3,000 Jets were in use. Shortly after introducing the Jet, Trans-Lux applied the same innovations to closed-circuit television.
The Jet's popularity required Trans-Lux to find a larger production facility. In 1970, the company moved to Norwalk, Connecticut. Demand for Jets continued to grow. Longer versions of 15, 25, and 43 feet (13 m) were produced. In 1969, Trans-Lux had succeeded in reducing the size of the Jet to one-fifth of the original. Ten years later, by developing a powerful miniature microprocessor chip, the company reduced the Jet to one-twenty-fifth of its original size.
As successful as the Jet was, it failed to address one important segment of the stock market: large portfolio holders and active traders had no way to automatically focus on their market objectives and private individual stock holdings. When a Chicago-based company, Quotemaster (later Extel) developed an experimental prototype for a selective read-out device, Trans-Lux approached them. The company soon began to develop and then manufacturing the device, now called the Personal Ticker,[15] which could be programmed to monitor up to 40 stocks on a single exchange. By 1969, Trans-Lux began installing the product for private investors, portfolio managers, pension fund administrators, investment advisors, and individual brokers. That same year the strong bull market abruptly ended, drastically impacting installations of all types of Trans-Lux equipment.
Following the market decline, Trans-Lux management learned that their electronic display sales should not be overly dependent on a single industry, and decided to diversify. The company formed an industrial sales department in 1970 under the leadership of Louis Credidio, who went after the commodity market and in 1971 sold an adaptation of the Personal Ticker, the T-900, to the Chicago Board of Trade. Soon Trans-Lux completed sales to many other commodity exchanges, capturing a small but significant new market. When Extel's teleprinter terminal sales boomed, it contracted Trans-Lux to manufacture keyboards and way-station selectors, which led to Trans-Lux's entry into the teleprinter market. Credidio studied the telex terminal field and by 1974 Trans-Lux began marketing a telex terminal, the Trans-Lux Teleprinter (TLT), to several industries. More than 700 terminals were installed by 1975.
Diversification[edit]
Early in 1995, Trans-Lux acquired Integrated Systems Engineering, Inc., a full service electronic sign manufacturing company, to broaden its outdoor signage capabilities, such as those found on billboards, or outside truck stops, banks, and sports arenas. The company's capacity to produce electronic displays increased in 2000 when it opened a modern outdoor display manufacturing facility in Utah. The indoor display division remained a major supplier of communications tools for the banking and financial community, but now theaters, museums, hotels, corporations, and military hospitals were customers. The division experienced a growth spurt in 2000 when the Australian Gaming Control Board approved Trans-Lux's serial slot controller for sale in their country. That decision also boosted sales of the LED jackpot meter displays that work hand in hand with the slot controllers. Trans-Lux also entered the health care industry with products designed for hospitals, pharmacies, and outpatient clinics by offering critical information displays.
In 2001, the Cincinnati Reds installed the company's new RainbowRibbon™ fascia displays as well as a baseball scoreboard, pitcher's board and out-of-town game board in their new 42,000-seat stadium, Great American Ball Park, at an estimated cost of over $3 million. The RainbowRibbon™ uses Trans-Lux' unique XFS scaling, which allows precise control of video images and improves image quality at the lower resolutions typical of LED displays. The three hundred feet of display in the Reds' installation featured over 273,500 pixels in an 8.6 billion color LED matrix, and ihas caught the attention of many professional sports teams due to its ability to optimize advertising space on arena and stadium tier fascias. The displays smoothly transition between video, advertising, animations, scoring/statistic layouts, and up to six lines of text around the interior of the facility. The system also featured a 3.5' x 33.5' SpectraLens™ pitch count board and a giant 24' x 164' SpectraLens scoreboard, which in 2003, when the park opened, was possibly the largest incandescent scoreboard ever constructed for a professional sports facility to date. The scoreboard, located in the left outfield, is capable of displaying game scores, graphics, animations, player statistics, advertising and general information.[2]
Trans-Lux continued to supply LED/incandescent displays and scoring systems to major and minor league baseball teams, such as the San Francisco Giants. In addition to professional baseball, Trans-Lux has provided displays and equipment to other professional sports teams, such as the NBA's Charlotte Hornets and Detroit Pistons.[16]
By 2002, annual revenues had reached $70.1 million in three divisions: outdoor displays, indoor displays, and entertainment/real estate. While the company headquarters still remain in Norwalk, manufacturing operations were moved to Stratford, Connecticut in 2008. Trans-Lux now has major U.S. sales and service centers in Norwalk; New York; Atlanta; Chicago; and Torrance, California, in addition to their satellite offices throughout the U.S. and Canada. Subsidiary companies are located in Iowa, Utah, Canada, and Australia. Trans-Lux's International Division maintains a distributor network throughout the world, including most major financial centers as well as in many newly developing countries.[16] In recent years, company headquarters have returned to New York, with the Norwalk and Atlanta sales and services centers merged into the New York office. As a further consequence, the Chicago office closed, while the Torrance, California office moved to Camarillo, California.
Company divisions[edit]
Trans-Lux also has three subsidiaries:

Fair Play Scoreboards, a scoreboard and sports equipment manufacturer.
TL Energy, a leading provider of LED lighting and related solutions.
PrismaTronic, a dedicated provider of Digital LED solutions for the OOH marketplace

Public documents[edit]
As stated in SEC paperwork, on March 28, 2003, a wholly owned subsidiary, Trans-Lux Corporation, sold its custom sports division, including licensing of intellectual property and its facility located in Logan, Utah to Barco, Inc., for a cash price of approximately $3.7 million, plus assumption of two Industrial Revenue Bonds totaling approximately $4.2 million, for an approximate total sale price of $7.9 million.
Trans-Lux also announced that it received a letter dated November 10, 2010 from NYSE Amex informing it that the Listings Qualifications Panel of the Exchange's Committee on Securities has affirmed the determination to delist Trans-Lux's Common Stock as of November 17, 2010.

Early history[edit]
The company was created by Percy Norman Furber, an Englishman, who moved to the United States in October 1918, after a time spent drilling for oil and mining quicksilver in Mexico. Furber was interested in developing a projection system that could be used in a lighted room, and enlisted the aid of a friend, Arthur Payne, a former employee of Thomas Edison. Payne hit upon the idea of rear projection; projecting an image through a screen rather than on it. However, this concept required a finer and more translucent material for the screen than any that currently existed.
Moving light[edit]
In 1920, Furber formed American Lux (Latin for "light") Products, and three years later, using a fine high-quality natural silk, it created its first successful screen, with initial sales going mostly to schools and churches. It was only after a visit to the New York Stock Exchange that Furber saw a truly profitable application for rear projection. At the time, brokers obtained the latest stock quotes, provided by Western Union's telegraph, or wire service, from a glass dome-topped ticker. The machine printed the results onto a long thin piece of paper known as a ticker tape, with the brokers closest to the printer having the advantage. Prior to this invention, any stock information was hand-written, usually on a chalk board; although the results were less immediate, they were better displayed. Furber combined the best aspects of both methods: by enlarging the stock quotations from the running ticker tape and displaying them onto a rear projection screen. In 1923, the company installed the first "Movie ticker" ticker tape projection system at the New York Stock Exchange. Like every ticker of the time it was a mechanical format, but by using yellow dots on a black background it gave the illusion of electronically generated green letters and numbers.
It is this stock ticker that provided the company's name: "Trans-Lux" meaning "moving light".
Financing this new operation required more capital, so Furber took his company public on August 26, 1925. It was listed on the New York Curb Exchange, which later became the American Stock Exchange. Until being delisted in 2011[1] Trans-Lux stock was the oldest company to be listed on the American Stock Exchange.[2] In 1925, the company had 41 installations on stock exchange floors and brokerage house boardrooms throughout the country.
Moving pictures[edit]
By 1927 the company had created a much larger, commercial-sized theater screen and took it, along with its rear projector system and a new wide-angle lens, to the motion picture industry. To further penetrate the market, the Trans-Lux Movies Corporation, in partnership with RKO (Radio-Keith-Orpheum) Studios, was created. Using Trans-Lux as its trade name, it began a theater-building program. The first Trans-Lux theater at 58th Street and Madison Avenue in New York City was actually converted from retail space, and featured larger seats, more leg room, and wider aisles than the average theater of the day. Seating only 158, it was much too small for the crowd it attracted. The rear projection technology allowed the house lights to remain low so patrons could read their programs and easily locate their seats, and also eliminated the distraction of a beam of light slicing down through the crowd from an overhead projection booth. In accordance with its news "heritage" the theatre featured a program made up exclusively of "shorts" (usually comedy routines or musical numbers) and newsreels. When the company's third theater opened two blocks away on 60th and Madison on November 10, 1933, it was turned back into retail space.[3]
In 1931, Percy Furber turned over company operations to his son, Percy. By this time, Trans-Lux had 4,000 stockholders, over 100 employees, and was valued at $2 million. In 1934, the company opened two more newsreel theaters in Brooklyn, New York and one in Philadelphia. Three more locations were added over the next three years, with architect Thomas W. Lamb designing the theater in Washington, D.C.. Offering 600 seats covered in blue leather, its lobby decorated with sports murals by New York artist Andre Hudiakoff, it was one of the first public buildings in the city to have air conditioning.[4] Located one block away from the White House, it was considered to be the most elegant Art Deco theater in the capital, up until its untimely demolition in 1975.[5]
In 1937 the company shortened its name to the Trans-Lux Corporation. Along with other theater-related businesses, it initially suffered during the postwar movie slump. Returning veterans were attending college on the GI Bill, marrying, and starting families. Newlyweds and young families with babies were usually on a budget and put the purchase of a home, a car, and new appliances ahead of going to the movies. The company's declining newsreel movie business quickly recovered when it switched to showing first-run feature films in 1949,[3] but weekly theater attendance still experienced a dramatic drop: from 78.2 million in 1946 to 58 million by 1950, when the American public chose to sit at home in front of their new television sets rather than go out to the movies.
As this postwar middle-class began moving from the cities to the suburbs, shopping complexes to support them proliferated, and theaters followed. In 1964 Trans-Lux built its first shopping center theater, an 850-seat facility in Reisterstown Road Plaza Mall in Baltimore. By 1969, the company had brought large, modern theaters to five more suburban shopping centers, nearly doubling the size of its theater holdings, and by 1965 had 37 theaters in ten states.
By the end of the 1960s, the theater building boom was over as well. In 1973 Trans-Lux lost money on its theaters for the first time in years. The boom had aggravated the newly independent industry's problem of a shortage of quality movies. Bidding on films became fierce, and many companies split their single theaters into twins. Three screen and four screen theaters began appearing, and when Richard Brandt replaced Percy Furber as chairman of the board in 1974, the multiplex trend (with as many as 12 screens) was in full swing. Some of the company's theaters were split into two and three screen houses, and others were sold off entirely.
In the midst of this, Trans-Lux went into the business of multimedia shows. The 1970 premiere of the "San Francisco Experience", a 29-projector, seven-screen spectacular with 30 special effects inspired the company to hire its creators to develop a nearly $1 million budget multimedia entertainment film about New York City. The September 28, 1973 opening of the 45-projector, 16-screen film was called "bedazzling and breathtaking" by The New York Times. "The New York Experience", which was housed in a sub-basement of the McGraw-Hill Building in Rockefeller Center, became the longest-running commercial multimedia show in history, until its demise in 1989. Despite its popularity, the show—which featured panoramic movie screens, slide projections, extensive light and sound systems, and a mannequin that dropped out of the ceiling to recreate the hanging of Nathan Hale—was forced to close due to escalating rent costs.[6]
By 1981, Trans-Lux's theater holdings were reduced to 28 screens, concentrated in the Northeast, particularly Connecticut. By the mid-1990s, the theater division invested in building new theaters in the western US, bringing the company's total to 65 screens. In 2000, the firm opened its own Los Angeles-based film booking office.
Television[edit]
By 1950, television had become America's most popular form of entertainment. In 1940, there were only 3,785 television sets in the US. Two decades later, nine out of ten homes had at least one set.[7]
Trans-Lux soon began developing specialized rear-projection equipment for television studios, greatly expanded its engineering capacity and started supplying the studios with "Teleprocess" screens and projectors. When closed circuit television (CCTV) appeared in the late 1940s, Trans-Lux adapted that technology for viewing stock market information, and formed an electronics division to develop and sell CCTV systems in 1959. They also developed a television program syndication service, and in association with Adventure Cartoon Productions produced the popular animated children's series: Felix the Cat[8] and The Mighty Hercules.[9] The expanded business required Trans-Lux to move from its Brooklyn headquarters to a larger, five-story building in Long Island City.
In 1967, they commissioned Titra Studios, a New York City recording company that provided English translations for foreign movies, to "Americanize" the new Japanese animated series, Speed Racer,[10] for domestic television. Trans-Lux retained the series until 1969, when it sold off its animated television holdings in order to concentrate on manufacturing illuminated stock market tickers. Trans-Lux's film catalog was purchased by independent distributor Alan Gleitsman, whose Alan Enterprises[11] continued to syndicate Speed Racer to independent TV stations throughout the 1970s.[12] That same year the company moved its headquarters again, this time relocating to Norwalk, Connecticut.
As for the Trans-Lux library, Gleitsman left the syndication business in 1986 and sold his assets to a colorization company called Color Systems Technology, which in turn sold the library (which includes the Alan Enterprises/Trans-Lux library, the rights to Speed Racer, and the Adventure Cartoon Productions series) to Broadway Video in 1989 due to bankruptcy.[13][14]
Stock quotes and signage[edit]
In 1940, Trans-Lux purchased a patent for a remote-control signaling system that enabled small rounded pellets to form letters and numbers and travel around outdoor message signs. It also joined forces with the Artkraft Strauss Sign Corporation, which was the first signage corporation to first illuminate the "Great White Way" of Broadway. By 1948 it was supplying electrical traveling message signs to advertisers, radio stations, and publishers throughout the country. At the same time, Trans-Lux had 1,400 stock-ticker projectors and 80 news projectors in the United States, plus another 200 in Canada.
By the early '60's, Trans-Lux began to see a need for greater investment in electronics as stock exchanges and brokerage firms were inundated with new, advanced techniques for gathering and projecting information. The company's fortunes were tied to its old system's two-step process: the information it relied on began with prices from the ticker tape, then a delay was required as the ticker tape shifted away from the print head to a viewing position for projecting or televising. With an electronic ticker display, Trans-Lux could bypass the printing stage, creating a real-time, immediate information system.
In 1965, the company was shocked by the introduction of a new 45-foot (14 m)-long electronic display installed on the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange by a competitor, Recognition Equipment Inc. (REI), of Dallas. Even though the Ultronic Letrascan electronic wall device had been steadily replacing Trans-Lux tickers for several years, the New York Stock Exchange installation was cause for concern, as Trans-Lux had enjoyed a long-standing business relationship with the exchange. The company made a deal with REI: since Trans-Lux needed Recognition's technology, and they needed Trans-Lux's knowledge of how to market stock-ticker equipment, they formed a joint venture to create a much smaller version of the Recognition system.
Two years later, they announced the Trans-Lux Jet, named for the jets of air that controlled character formation in the sign. It was the highest quality, real-time, continuous flow wall display yet produced, and a new method of viewing up-to-the-minute stock market sales information. Its ten-foot size made it perfect for brokerage offices, but perhaps the best news for Trans-Lux was that it no longer needed to rely on the Western Union ticker. U.S. and Canadian brokerage houses ordered more than 1,000 Trans-Lux Jets in the first six months, and Trans-Lux opened an international office in Zurich, Switzerland to deal with overseas orders. By mid-1969, about 3,000 Jets were in use. Shortly after introducing the Jet, Trans-Lux applied the same innovations to closed-circuit television.
The Jet's popularity required Trans-Lux to find a larger production facility. In 1970, the company moved to Norwalk, Connecticut. Demand for Jets continued to grow. Longer versions of 15, 25, and 43 feet (13 m) were produced. In 1969, Trans-Lux had succeeded in reducing the size of the Jet to one-fifth of the original. Ten years later, by developing a powerful miniature microprocessor chip, the company reduced the Jet to one-twenty-fifth of its original size.
As successful as the Jet was, it failed to address one important segment of the stock market: large portfolio holders and active traders had no way to automatically focus on their market objectives and private individual stock holdings. When a Chicago-based company, Quotemaster (later Extel) developed an experimental prototype for a selective read-out device, Trans-Lux approached them. The company soon began to develop and then manufacturing the device, now called the Personal Ticker,[15] which could be programmed to monitor up to 40 stocks on a single exchange. By 1969, Trans-Lux began installing the product for private investors, portfolio managers, pension fund administrators, investment advisors, and individual brokers. That same year the strong bull market abruptly ended, drastically impacting installations of all types of Trans-Lux equipment.
Following the market decline, Trans-Lux management learned that their electronic display sales should not be overly dependent on a single industry, and decided to diversify. The company formed an industrial sales department in 1970 under the leadership of Louis Credidio, who went after the commodity market and in 1971 sold an adaptation of the Personal Ticker, the T-900, to the Chicago Board of Trade. Soon Trans-Lux completed sales to many other commodity exchanges, capturing a small but significant new market. When Extel's teleprinter terminal sales boomed, it contracted Trans-Lux to manufacture keyboards and way-station selectors, which led to Trans-Lux's entry into the teleprinter market. Credidio studied the telex terminal field and by 1974 Trans-Lux began marketing a telex terminal, the Trans-Lux Teleprinter (TLT), to several industries. More than 700 terminals were installed by 1975.
Diversification[edit]
Early in 1995, Trans-Lux acquired Integrated Systems Engineering, Inc., a full service electronic sign manufacturing company, to broaden its outdoor signage capabilities, such as those found on billboards, or outside truck stops, banks, and sports arenas. The company's capacity to produce electronic displays increased in 2000 when it opened a modern outdoor display manufacturing facility in Utah. The indoor display division remained a major supplier of communications tools for the banking and financial community, but now theaters, museums, hotels, corporations, and military hospitals were customers. The division experienced a growth spurt in 2000 when the Australian Gaming Control Board approved Trans-Lux's serial slot controller for sale in their country. That decision also boosted sales of the LED jackpot meter displays that work hand in hand with the slot controllers. Trans-Lux also entered the health care industry with products designed for hospitals, pharmacies, and outpatient clinics by offering critical information displays.
In 2001, the Cincinnati Reds installed the company's new RainbowRibbon™ fascia displays as well as a baseball scoreboard, pitcher's board and out-of-town game board in their new 42,000-seat stadium, Great American Ball Park, at an estimated cost of over $3 million. The RainbowRibbon™ uses Trans-Lux' unique XFS scaling, which allows precise control of video images and improves image quality at the lower resolutions typical of LED displays. The three hundred feet of display in the Reds' installation featured over 273,500 pixels in an 8.6 billion color LED matrix, and ihas caught the attention of many professional sports teams due to its ability to optimize advertising space on arena and stadium tier fascias. The displays smoothly transition between video, advertising, animations, scoring/statistic layouts, and up to six lines of text around the interior of the facility. The system also featured a 3.5' x 33.5' SpectraLens™ pitch count board and a giant 24' x 164' SpectraLens scoreboard, which in 2003, when the park opened, was possibly the largest incandescent scoreboard ever constructed for a professional sports facility to date. The scoreboard, located in the left outfield, is capable of displaying game scores, graphics, animations, player statistics, advertising and general information.[2]
Trans-Lux continued to supply LED/incandescent displays and scoring systems to major and minor league baseball teams, such as the San Francisco Giants. In addition to professional baseball, Trans-Lux has provided displays and equipment to other professional sports teams, such as the NBA's Charlotte Hornets and Detroit Pistons.[16]
By 2002, annual revenues had reached $70.1 million in three divisions: outdoor displays, indoor displays, and entertainment/real estate. While the company headquarters still remain in Norwalk, manufacturing operations were moved to Stratford, Connecticut in 2008. Trans-Lux now has major U.S. sales and service centers in Norwalk; New York; Atlanta; Chicago; and Torrance, California, in addition to their satellite offices throughout the U.S. and Canada. Subsidiary companies are located in Iowa, Utah, Canada, and Australia. Trans-Lux's International Division maintains a distributor network throughout the world, including most major financial centers as well as in many newly developing countries.[16] In recent years, company headquarters have returned to New York, with the Norwalk and Atlanta sales and services centers merged into the New York office. As a further consequence, the Chicago office closed, while the Torrance, California office moved to Camarillo, California.
Company divisions[edit]
Trans-Lux also has three subsidiaries:

Fair Play Scoreboards, a scoreboard and sports equipment manufacturer.
TL Energy, a leading provider of LED lighting and related solutions.
PrismaTronic, a dedicated provider of Digital LED solutions for the OOH marketplace

Public documents[edit]
As stated in SEC paperwork, on March 28, 2003, a wholly owned subsidiary, Trans-Lux Corporation, sold its custom sports division, including licensing of intellectual property and its facility located in Logan, Utah to Barco, Inc., for a cash price of approximately $3.7 million, plus assumption of two Industrial Revenue Bonds totaling approximately $4.2 million, for an approximate total sale price of $7.9 million.
Trans-Lux also announced that it received a letter dated November 10, 2010 from NYSE Amex informing it that the Listings Qualifications Panel of the Exchange's Committee on Securities has affirmed the determination to delist Trans-Lux's Common Stock as of November 17, 2010.
