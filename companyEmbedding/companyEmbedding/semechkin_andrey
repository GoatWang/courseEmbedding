About
International Stem Cell Corporation

International Stem Cell Corporation
is focused on the therapeutic applications of human parthenogenetic stem cells
(hpSCs) and the development and commercialization of cell-based research and
cosmetic products.  ISCO's core
technology, parthenogenesis, results in the creation of pluripotent human stem
cells from unfertilized oocytes (eggs). 
hpSCs avoid ethical issues associated with the use or destruction of
viable human embryos.  ISCO scientists
have created the first parthenogenetic, homozygous stem cell line that can be a
source of therapeutic cells for hundreds of millions of individuals of
differing genders, ages and racial background with minimal immune rejection
after transplantation. hpSCs offer the potential to create the first true stem
cell bank, UniStemCell™. ISCO also produces and markets specialized cells and
growth media for therapeutic research worldwide through its subsidiary Lifeline
Cell Technology (www.lifelinecelltech.com), and stem cell-based skin care
products through its subsidiary Lifeline Skin Care (www.lifelineskincare.com). More
information is available at www.internationalstemcell.com.

harbor statement 

Statements pertaining to anticipated
developments, expected clinical studies (including timing and results), progress
of research and development, and other opportunities for the company and its
subsidiaries, along with other statements about the future expectations,
beliefs, goals, plans, or prospects expressed by management constitute
forward-looking statements. Any statements that are not historical fact

the many uncertainties that affect the company's business, particularly those
mentioned in the cautionary statements found in the company's Securities and
Exchange Commission filings. The company disclaims any intent or obligation to
update forward-looking statements.

The Parkinson's disease program uses human parthenogenetic neural stem cells (hPNSC) a novel therapeutic cellular product derived from the company's proprietary histocompatible human pluripotent stem cells. hPNSC are self-renewing mulitpotent cells that are precursors for the major cells of the central nervous system. The ability of hPNSC to (i) differentiate into dopaminergic (DA) neurons and (ii) express neurotrophic factors such as glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to protect the nigrostriatal system, offers a new opportunity for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, especially in cases where current small molecule approaches fail to adequately control the symptoms.International Stem Cell Corporation is focused on the therapeutic applications of human parthenogenetic stem cells (hpSCs) and the development and commercialization of cell-based research and cosmetic products. ISCO's core technology, parthenogenesis, results in the creation of pluripotent human stem cells from unfertilized oocytes (eggs) hence avoiding ethical issues associated with the use or destruction of viable human embryos. ISCO scientists have created the first parthenogenetic, homozygous stem cell line that can be a source of therapeutic cells for hundreds of millions of individuals of differing genders, ages and racial background with minimal immune rejection after transplantation. hpSCs offer the potential to create the first true stem cell bank, UniStemCellTM. ISCO also produces and markets specialized cells and growth media for therapeutic research worldwide through its subsidiary Lifeline Cell Technology (www.lifelinecelltech.com), and stem cell-based skin care products through its subsidiary Lifeline Skin Care (www.lifelineskincare.com).

Any statements that are not historical fact (including, but not limited to statements that contain words such as "will," "believes," "plans," "anticipates," "expects," "estimates,") should also be considered to be forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, risks inherent in the development and/or commercialization of potential products, regulatory approvals, need and ability to obtain future capital, application of capital resources among competing uses, and maintenance of intellectual property rights. Actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements and as such should be evaluated together with the many uncertainties that affect the company's business, particularly those mentioned in the cautionary statements found in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. The company disclaims any intent or obligation to update forward-looking statements.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextThe 'two pizza rule' is a secret to productive meetings that helped Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos become one of the world's richest menBusiness InsiderThis Will Be In Everyone's Household By 2020Banyan HillSponsoredThe real reason overseas manufacturing is coming to AmericaYahoo FinanceTax cuts just got more likelyYahoo FinanceChevron and Exxon Mobil have a tough path ahead: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredFast food restaurants work face rising wage pressuresYahoo FinanceTODAY'S CHARTS: Don't get blindsided by Tesla's shiny new Model 3Yahoo FinanceTrump’s unwitting legacy could be universal health coverageYahoo FinanceZuckerberg Wife's Ambitious Secret Finally ExposedUNewz.MeSponsored9 ways to break free from your credit card debtYahoo FinanceMy bullish view on stocks hasn't changed one iota: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoHow a one-of-a-kind business has kept 5,000 kitchens out of landfillsYahoo FinanceDiscover it: 4.8 out of 5 avg. by 24K+ customersDiscover CardSponsoredThe 37 Most Profitable Markets for Home SellersCredit.comThe government can't help people from making the single-biggest investing mistakeYahoo FinanceThe real reason overseas manufacturing is coming to AmericaEd B: How come we never heard about manufacturing jobs coming back to the US when Obama was President?
