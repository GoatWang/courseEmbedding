He's also a good friend.

We have worked on many projects together, where he was the PM and I was the UX lead. I have seen him capture complex client needs and feedback and guide projects to successful completion. I have also seen his career transform from a project management role to a UX role, which is not easy switch. He has always been deeply committed to understanding the point-of-view of the user, but to go deeper into the mechanics of designing and delivering UX projects is something that has won deep respect from me, as a fellow UX professional. 

UX is a patient art, and understanding users requires a deep insights user behavior and motivations. Combined with his knowledge of strategy and business, Tim brings a unique and informed perspective to his UX leadership.See moreSee lessIt was a pleasure working with Tim and I was always impressed by his ability to deliver clear and eloquent solutions across a complex organization.  His ability to achieve this is a testament to his leadership and professionalism by constantly understanding the big picture and providing strategic solutions to all levels of a project.  I observed this best through the calm, positive and attentive attitude he brought to group discussions.  I have a high regard for Tim and recommend him without reservations.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended Timothy T.GroupsBates College Alumni and FriendsEducation Community Managers NetworkInteraction Design AssociationLehman Brothers AlumniIvy Exec - IvyExec.comWeb Content MavensExecutive SuiteSee 3 moreContent StrategyCoSN (Consortium for School Networking)St. Mark's School (Southborough, MA)See lessView Timothy T.’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact Timothy T. directlyView Timothy T.’s Full ProfileNot the Timothy T. you’re looking for?
