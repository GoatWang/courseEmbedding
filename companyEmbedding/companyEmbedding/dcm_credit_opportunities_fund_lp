I'm thinking places like Golden Gate, Angelo Gordon, TPG, Blackstone, etc. that have PE practices but also invest in credit through separate funds. What types of models would you need to be able to build or understand in order to get through interviews (for someone who's in IBD and is recruiting right now). It seems like these are essentially distressed debt hedge funds. Any color is appreciated as are links to informative resources.

You should also be able to model/project inventory/AR for any asset backed loan.Then you need to be able to really think about how to protect your firm in the event of a default. how can you design covenants that get you back to the table before you are over-exposed as a lender.If they are doing distressed stuff, you should also have an understanding of liquidation order in bankruptcy, as that is the backdrop against which you will be operating. You will also be doing your projections on a much more detailed basis -- weekly instead of monthly. Modeling Training - Special for WSO Members ×Want to Vote on this Content?! No WSO Credits ?

LoginSign up    3/9/12 - 9:11am  Kenny_Powers_CFAHF |2,715    | Rank: Neanderthal I work for a credit fund that does a grab-bag of strategies and could fairly be called "credit opportunities. Big picture, "credit opportunities" is usually used by debt managers who don't want to pigeonhole themselves into one thing and can mean distressed, loan-to-own, mid-market, private placements and mezz, long/short and relative value, convertible/special situations credit arb, etc.In practice, particularly when you're dealing with the credit arm of a big sponsor, it's going to depend heavily on organization how a) the funds themselves are organized and b) how the teams are organized. Some sponsors (BX, GSO, Apollo, Ares) have huge credit arms that do everything under the sun, while others are more focused on distressed, loan-to-own, or mezzanine.To me, the natural flow is PE>Mezz, DIP and loan-to-own and private mid-market debt>Public Distressed (since you may end up with the keys)>Senior debt and CLO management (since a lot of the debt is LBO financing and the funds have a PE-style life cycle)>General public market credit strategies. There start to be natural conflicts and grey areas and organizational challenges in terms of separating the investment process. Gala Coral is a good example where various "smart-money" stakeholders shade back and forth between mezz, distressed, and PE.Here's an example: BX's credit arm, GSO, has the following strategies listed:Leveraged Loans (basically CLO management)Customized Credit Strategies (essentially separate accounts for their CLO platform)Mezzanine Strategies (duh)Distressed Strategies (duh)Secondary Markets (basically a HY fund)Rescue Financing (basically DIP or loan-to-own)And lastly, Special Situations Credit Strategies (basically credit opportunities): "GSO's credit strategy is focused on investing in the leveraged finance marketplace. It invests in long/short credit, event driven opportunities and liquid stressed and distressed securities. GSO may invest in both public and private non-investment grade and non-rated securities, including leveraged loans, high yield bonds, distressed securities, second lien loans, mezzanine securities, common and preferred equity securities, and credit derivatives."So as you see, the SSCS is basically a grab-bag of every other strategy (they say liquid, but liquidity is a term of art in this universe). How this is organized from a legal structure standpoint can vary, but let's pretend it's like this:GSO manages GSO Leveraged Loan LP, Mezz Strategies LP, Secondary Markets LP, Rescue Financing LP, and Special Situations LP. Each of these has their own set of investor commitments/capital (though there is likely overlap.) On the investment team side, you might have a different desk for each "product" (distressed, senior debt, mezz, mid-market, synthetics, relative value) or by industry, or what have you and each contributes to the credit opportunities fund as sort of a "best ideas" sleeve. Alternatively you may have separate teams for each fund but in my experience that's not the case because it's just not good division of labor.(To be continued)There have been many great comebacks throughout history. Jesus was dead but then came back as an all-powerful God-Zombie. ×Want to Vote on this Content?! No WSO Credits ?

LoginSign up    3/9/12 - 9:22am  Kenny_Powers_CFAHF |2,715    | Rank: Neanderthal The kinds of models you build will depend on how it's organized as discussed above. Heeb and Newguy had good posts on some of the key elements of credit modeling. Because we're a small fund I end up doing some of everything but you were at a GSO for example you'd likely be more focused. Models I've done in the recent past:1) Operating or LBO models for both new debt issuance and existing HY credits: Sometimes with mezz and mid-market you will get confi'd and have management projections for this, otherwise it's a lot like any equity or credit research model. This isn't that different than building any operating model though we have a lot of emphasis on leverage, debt service, and liquidity metrics versus EPS-type metrics. Sometimes we'll do a full LBO model if the deal is still being negotiated or if we need it for enterprise valuation reasons (warrants with a mezz piece, stressed financing, etc).3) Distressed modeling on both going concern and liquidation/break-up basis4) Relative value models which can be between companies or intra-company, and can be cash/synthetic. These are usually based on at least a rudimentary version of #1.5) Structured credit models: basically you use intex to look at portfolio data for a CLO and analyze NAV coverage and/or cash flow distribution to the tranche you're considering under different scenarios.There have been many great comebacks throughout history.

If I wanted to move into a credit fund from my current position, what kind of path would you recommend following? Do you feel there are any skills I would be lacking after doing this for a few years, that I would NEED to develop elsewhere before making the ultimate switch?I have a pretty atypical background (Big 4 valuation, got my role via luck/network) plus I work for a small/atypical fund so I don't think it's helpful to focus on that.Tough to give too much advice without perfect knowledge of your role such as how involved in pricing are you, do you syndicate/to who, how familiar are you with the "sister products" like junior debt, mezz, interest rate products. As a rule, the bank debt universe is viewed as a fairly "lazy" market-you have a shorter duration (or even zero duration b/c of the floating rate element), senior or super-senior position, big appetite from investors who are forced to stay in the asset class like banks, CLOs, and prime funds, etc.One thing that might be a good fit is mid-market/specialty lending groups; many sponsor credit arms have these groups as do other hedge fund/alternative credit providers like Golub, the various business development companies, etc.There have been many great comebacks throughout history.

I've heard it's mostly discussing your deals, maybe coming up with an investment idea, and talking about the markets. Any modeling tests to speak of or other means of prep? Any links to helpful websites are welcome. I feel like there's tons of info around traditional PE prep but the process for credit funds seems more opaque.People tend to think life is a race with other people. They don't realize that every moment they spend sprinting towards the finish line is a moment they lose permanently, and a moment closer to their death. ×Want to Vote on this Content?!

I'm in WF's Corporate Banking group, which basically means I'm a cross between a credit analyst and a pitchbook monkey that focuses only on syndicated/pro rata facilities. We deal only with Senior debt products, so exposure to junior debt is minimal.Does that help?I do not have exposure to many of the models you stated that you use in your previous post. On the quantitative side, my work is limited to DCF, valuation comps, covenant comps, operating/cashflow models, LBOs, and typical credit analyses.

Best way to describe "credit opportunities" generally is the excerpt Kenny posted regarding GSO's special situations fund. Interview process very similar to what Ricqles mentioned from the case study perspective. I don't think the softer questions are that different from a PE interview except there's obviously a much greater focus on debt.i.e. presenting a good investment from the credit perspective, knowing what specific metrics debt investors look at, being able to describe what contributes to differences in spread across companies / cap structures, explaining why you're interested in debt versus equity (surprisingly a question that most candidates do not have a good answer to) Private Equity Interview Questions ×Want to Vote on this Content?!
