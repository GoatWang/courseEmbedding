The Division of Adult Institutions is responsible for management of the state's 21 correctional centers. The Division of Adult Institutions has developed an inmate classification system to enhance safety and security for all staff, offenders, and visitors at an institution. The classification system is based on several factors including: length of sentence, type of crime, and an offender's individual needs for specialized programs and services.
