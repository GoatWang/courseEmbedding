North America’s largest producer of  iron ore pellets


As the largest iron ore producer in North America, Cliffs is well-positioned to serve the region’s steel producers. With the unique advantage of being the low-cost producer of pellets in this market, the fluctuations of the commoditized price of seaborne iron ore have a limited impact on us.
The structure of our U.S. Iron Ore contracts, our geographical position in the Great Lakes and the value-added products we supply to our North American customers make our U.S. pellet plants very unique and valuable when compared to any other iron ore assets in the entire world.





U.S. Iron Ore
Asia Pacific Iron Ore 
Hot Briquetted Iron (HBI)





Five iron ore mines located in Michigan and Minnesota produce various grades of iron ore pellets,
including standard and fluxed, for use in blast furnaces. As the mines are located near the Great Lakes,
the majority of the pellets are transported by rail to loading ports for shipments via vessel.
EAF steel producers (‘mini-mills’) require a reliable and quality source of iron-based metallic. In 2015,
Cliffs developed at its Northshore Mining operation a new product, DR-grade pellets, for feedstock in DRI
production. Cliffs is well positioned to enter the market for ferrous scrap substitutes and sell to leading
mini mills in the United States. We are pursuing this opportunity to further capitalize on the growing
potential of electric arc furnace (EAF) steel production in North America and become a supplier of DR-grade
pellets, pig iron and other alternative iron units (HBI).




2016 Production volume: 23.4 million tons
Remaining Proven and Probable mineral reserves: 1,945 million long tons





Our Western Australia iron ore operations consist of the wholly-owned Koolyanobbing complex, a
collective term for the operating deposits at Koolyanobbing, Windarling and Mount Jackson. The
Koolyanobbing operations serve the Asian iron ore markets with direct-shipped fines and lump ore. Ore is
crushed and blended at a plant located at the Koolyanobbing operation, and then transported by rail for
shipment from the port of Esperance.




2016 Production volume: 11.8 million tons
Remaining Proven and Probable mineral reserves: 49 million metric tons





In June 2017, Cliffs announced that Toledo, Ohio would be the location for the development of our first hot briquetted iron (HBI) production plant. The announcement marked an important strategic milestone for Cliffs, as we implement our plans to be the sole producer of high-quality HBI for the EAF steel market in the Great Lakes region, our preferred place of business.
Much like Cliffs supplies blast furnaces with customized pellets, the Toledo facility will produce HBI customized to our customers’ specifications, allowing EAF customers to produce high-end steel specs in the execution of their own product strategy.  In addition, the easy handling, transportation and storing of HBI makes it a good alternative raw material source for EAF steelmaking.

Products customized to steelmakers' specifications


As a differentiated mining company, Cliffs is uniquely positioned to satisfy the requirements of our North American steelmaking customers. Our high-grade, premium pellets are customized for and fed directly to our customers’ blast furnaces and are produced under perhaps the most stringent environmental regulatory framework in the world. While other mining companies continue to suffer the consequences of an oversupplied seaborne iron ore market, Cliffs is focused on its core business in the United States. Thanks to our long-term partnerships with North American steelmakers, we operate under stable contracts. We serve growing end-markets for steel, such as automotive, construction, white goods and manufacturing.





Iron Ore Pellets
Iron Ore Lump and Fines
DR-grade Pellets and HBI








U.S. Iron Ore Operations
Blast Furnace Pellets
We produce various grades of iron ore pellets, including standard and fluxed, for use in our customers’ blast furnaces as part of the steelmaking process. The variation in grades results from the specific chemical and metallurgical properties of the ores at each mine and whether or not fluxstone is added in the process. In many cases our iron ore pellets can be used interchangeably.
Industry demand for the various grades of iron ore pellets depends on each customer’s preferences and changes from time to time. In the event that a given mine is operating at full capacity, the terms of most of our pellet supply agreements allow some flexibility in providing our customers iron ore pellets from different mines, if feasible.
Standard pellets require less processing, are generally the least costly pellets to produce and are called “standard” because no ground fluxstone, such as limestone or dolomite, is added to the iron ore concentrate before turning the concentrate into pellets. In the case of fluxed pellets, fluxstone is added to the concentrate, which produces pellets that can perform at higher productivity levels in the customer’s specific blast furnace and will minimize the amount of fluxstone the customer may be required to add to the blast furnace.
Product Quality
While most iron ore producers mine, market and sell a commoditized product that is effectively fungible across most blast furnaces, our production of custom-made pellets is the true differentiating factor when comparing Cliffs to its peers in the iron ore space. During the 1950’s, Cliffs pioneered a process that beneficiated the lower-grade ore into high quality, custom made pellets. Since that time, Cliffs has remained on the cutting edge of this technology. While iron ore pellets are made in other parts of the world, it can be said that competitive pellet producers are still “catching up” to the improvements Cliffs continues to make in its unrivaled product quality.
Mainly, our iron ore pellets perform superior to other products in the market due to the productivity it helps to drive in the customer’s blast furnace. As Cliffs pellets are homogenous in size, they rank at the top versus other comparable pellets with regard to consistency in size. This consistency allows air to flow through the furnace efficiently, and thus, drive the most optimal yield possible. The other superior quality of the Cliffs product is that it minimizes pollution in the steelmaking process. Compared to a fines or sinter product, iron ore pellets have the advantageous homogenous qualities as well as much higher iron content. As a result, emissions from the blast furnaces are diminished. We believe that as pollution becomes more of an issue in China, more iron ore producers will continue to attempt to emulate the quality of Cliffs pellets while the market begins to shift in that direction.







Asia Pacific Iron Ore Operations
Cliffs’ Koolyanobbing operations serve the Asian iron ore markets with direct-shipped fines and lump ore. The lump products are fed directly to blast furnaces, while the fines products are used as sinter feed. The variation in the two export product grades reflects the inherent chemical and physical characteristics of the ore bodies mined as well as the supply requirements of our customers.
Banded iron formations host the mineralization, which is predominately hematite and goethite. Each deposit is characterized with different chemical and physical attributes and, in order to achieve customer product quality, ore in varying quantities from each deposit must be blended together. Crushing and blending are undertaken at Koolyanobbing, where the crushing and screening plant is located.
Once the blended ore has been crushed and screened into a direct lump and fines shipping product, it is transported by rail approximately 360 miles south to the Port of Esperance, via Kalgoorlie, for shipment to our customers in Asia.









DR-GRADE PELLETS 
Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) is a high quality metallic product (~90 percent pure iron) produced by the direct reduction of iron oxide at a temperature below the fusion point of iron. It is primarily used is in electric arc furnaces (EAF), but can also be used by blast furnaces and other iron and steelmaking applications.
Both iron oxide pellets and lump ores can be used in the production of DRI. DRI is a valuable supplement to scrap in the EAF process, helping dilute the impurities and residual metals that come along with the scrap charge.
Using its technical expertise to increase product offerings, Cliffs developed a new product line, DR-grade pellets, for feedstock in DRI production. We reached a significant milestone with very positive results from the successful operational trial of our DR-grade pellets. Full-scale production testing has been successful with third parties consuming pellets. We are well-positioned to produce DR-grade pellets that achieve DRI-targeted specifications and to feed our Toledo HBI plant.
HOT-BRIQUETTED IRON (HBI)
The Hot-briquetted Iron (HBI) that will be produced by Cliffs from our plant in Toledo, Ohio, is a compacted form of DRI, designed for ease of shipping, handling, and feeding into an electric arc furnace. HBI is transported and fed similarly to scrap and pig iron, and does not require the same special handling as Cold DRI. HBI can also be consumed into blast furnaces, helping to boost their productivity.

Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. Reports Second-Quarter 2017 Results





        Net Income from Continuing Operations of $77 million
      

        Earnings from Continuing Operations of $0.26 per diluted share
      




                    	July 27, 2017 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time 
                    	



CLEVELAND--(EON: Enhanced Online News)--Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (NYSE: CLF) today reported 
      second-quarter results for the period ended June 30, 2017. The Company 
      reported consolidated revenues of $569 million, an increase of 15 
      percent compared to the prior year's second-quarter revenues of $496 
      million. Cost of goods sold increased by 5 percent to $424 million 
      compared to $405 million reported in the second quarter of 2016.
    

      The Company recorded net income from continuing operations of $77 
      million in the second quarter, including a $5 million, or $0.02 per 
      share, loss on extinguishment of debt. This compares to net income from 
      continuing operations of $30 million recorded in the prior-year quarter, 
      which included a $4 million gain on extinguishment of debt. 
      Second-quarter 2017 net income of $30 million included a $46 million 
      non-cash loss from discontinued operations.
    

      For the second quarter of 2017, adjusted EBITDA1 was $137 
      million, a 35 percent increase compared to $102 million reported in the 
      second quarter of 2016.

      Lourenco Goncalves, Cliffs' Chairman, President and Chief Executive 
      Officer, said, "Our second quarter results clearly demonstrate the true 
      power of our U.S. Iron Ore business, in which we have unrivaled 
      operational, commercial, logistical, and quality advantages. Even as 
      iron ore prices in Asia dropped substantially during the second quarter, 
      these unique advantages enabled us to achieve EBITDA margins that are at 
      the peak of the industry in the United States." Mr. Goncalves added, 
      "Going forward, we will further expand on our unquestionable strength as 
      a supplier of customized iron units in the Great Lakes, with the 
      development of our HBI production plant in Toledo, Ohio. The new plant 
      will enable Cliffs to supply high-quality, customized HBI as feedstock 
      to select Electric Arc Furnace steelmakers. As EAF's become Cliffs’ 
      clients, we expect the earnings power of U.S. Iron Ore will carry over 
      to this new business."

      U.S. Iron Ore pellet sales volume in the second quarter of 2017 was 4.3 
      million long tons, a 4 percent increase when compared to the second 
      quarter of 2016 as a result of increased customer demand.
    

      Cash cost of goods sold and operating expense rate2 in U.S. 
      Iron Ore was $59.47 per long ton, a 6 percent increase from $56.25 per 
      long ton in the prior year's second quarter. The increase was primarily 
      driven by higher employee-related expenses, as well as increased energy, 
      repair and royalty costs. This was partially offset by reduced idle 
      costs.

      Second-quarter 2017 Asia Pacific Iron Ore sales volume decreased 20 
      percent to 2.5 million metric tons, from 3.1 million metric tons in the 
      second quarter of 2016. The decrease was driven by the timing of 
      shipments and market conditions, which resulted in the termination of 
      certain spot sales.
    

      Cash cost of goods sold and operating expense rate2 in Asia 
      Pacific Iron Ore was $36.52 per metric ton in the second quarter of 
      2017, a 10 percent increase from the prior-year quarter. The increase 
      was attributable to increased mining costs, driven by a change in the 
      overall operating plan resulting in a higher strip ratio.
    

Other Income Statement Items


      Cliffs' second-quarter 2017 SG&A expenses were $28 million compared to 
      second-quarter 2016 expenses of $23 million. The increase was driven 
      primarily by higher spend related to incentive compensation accruals, as 
      well as prefeasibility spend on the development of the HBI production 
      plant.
    

      Cliffs' net interest expense during the second quarter was $31 million, 
      a 38 percent decrease when compared to the second-quarter 2016 expense 
      of $51 million, as a result of approximately $930 million in principal 
      amount of debt reduced over the previous 12 months.
    

      Miscellaneous-net expense of $3 million included, among other items, $6 
      million in charges related to the indefinite idle at Empire mine.
    

      During the quarter, Cliffs reported a $46 million non-cash loss from 
      discontinued operations, as a liability was recorded related to a 
      probable preference claim against Cliffs as part of the CCAA 
      proceedings. The estimated liability is approximately equal to the value 
      of the Company’s related-party claims against the CCAA estate.
    

Debt and Cash Flow


      Total debt at the end of the second quarter of 2017 was $1.6 billion, 
      approximately $900 million lower than the $2.5 billion total debt at the 
      end of the prior-year quarter. Cliffs had net debt3 of $1.3 
      billion at the end of the second quarter of 2017, compared to $2.3 
      billion of net debt3 at the end of the second quarter of 
      2016. The Company had no borrowings under its asset-based lending 
      facility at the end of the second quarter of 2017 or 2016.
    

      Capital expenditures during the quarter were $22 million, compared to 
      $10 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase was driven primarily 
      by spending related to the Mustang Project at the United Taconite mine.
    

Outlook


      Based on the assumption that iron ore and steel prices will average for 
      the remainder of 2017 their respective year-to-date averages, Cliffs 
      would generate approximately $310 million of net income and $650 million 
      of adjusted EBITDA1 for the full-year 2017.

U.S. Iron Ore Outlook (Long Tons)
    

      Cliffs full-year sales and production volumes expectation is unchanged 
      at approximately 19 million long tons.
    

      Cliffs' full-year 2017 U.S. Iron Ore cash cost of goods sold and 
      operating expense2 expectation is unchanged at $55 - $60 per 
      long ton.
    

Asia Pacific Iron Ore Outlook (Metric Tons, F.O.B. the port)
    

      Cliffs' full-year 2017 Asia Pacific Iron Ore expected production volume 
      is unchanged at approximately 11.5 million metric tons. Due to market 
      conditions, sales volume outlook has been reduced by 500,000 metric tons 
      to 11 million metric tons. The product mix is expected to contain 52 
      percent lump ore and 48 percent fines.
    

      Based on a full-year average exchange rate of $0.76 U.S. Dollar to 
      Australian Dollar, Cliffs' full-year 2017 cash cost of goods sold and 
      operating expense2 expectation is unchanged at $34 - $39 per 
      metric ton.
    

SG&A Expenses and Other Expectations


      Cliffs increased its full-year SG&A expense expectation by $10 million 
      to $110 million to incorporate HBI prefeasibility spend and 
      higher-than-anticipated incentive compensation accruals. Cliffs also 
      notes that of the $110 million expectation, approximately $25 million is 
      considered non-cash.
    

      The Company's full-year 2017 interest expense is expected to be 
      approximately $135 million. Of this $135 million, approximately $20 
      million is expected to be non-cash.
    

Capital Budget Update


      Cliffs' full-year 2017 capital expenditures budget was increased by $10 
      million to $115 million, with the increase attributable to early 
      spending related to the HBI production plant.

      In addition to the consolidated financial statements presented in 
      accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company has presented adjusted EBITDA on 
      a segment basis, and both EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated 
      basis. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures that 
      management uses in evaluating operating performance. The presentation of 
      these measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a 
      substitute for, or as superior to, the financial information prepared 
      and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The presentation of these 
      measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other 
      companies. A reconciliation of these consolidated measures to their most 
      directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in the table below.

2 CLIFFS NATURAL RESOURCES INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNON-GAAP 
      RECONCILIATION EXPLANATIONS


      The Company presents cash cost of goods sold and operating expense rate 
      per long/metric ton, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that 
      management uses in evaluating operating performance. Cliffs believes the 
      presentation of non-GAAP cash cost of goods sold and operating expenses 
      is useful to investors because it excludes depreciation, depletion and 
      amortization, which are non-cash, and freight and venture partners' cost 
      reimbursements, which have no impact on sales margin, thus providing a 
      more accurate view of the cash outflows related to the sale of iron ore. 
      The presentation of this measure is not intended to be considered in 
      isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to, the financial 
      information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The 
      presentation of this measure may be different from non-GAAP financial 
      measures used by other companies.

3 NET DEBT RECONCILIATION


      Net debt is a non-GAAP financial measure that management uses in 
      evaluating financial position. The presentation of this measure is not 
      intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as 
      superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in 
      accordance with U.S. GAAP. The presentation of this measure may be 
      different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Net 
      debt is defined as long-term debt plus the current portion of short term 
      debt, less cash and cash equivalents and undiscounted interest. A 
      reconciliation of this measure to its most directly comparable GAAP 
      measure is provided in the table below.

CLEVELAND, Ohio - Cleveland-based Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. will build the Midwest's first-ever plant producing hot briquetted iron, which is used in steelmaking, the company announced Thursday.
The $700 million project, which received $30 million in grants and other financial incentives, is expected to break ground in early 2018 on the Ironville site in East Toledo, a former brownfield.
The plant is anticipated to begin production in mid-2020, the company said. The project is scheduled to create 1,200 construction jobs and 130 permanent jobs. Hourly jobs at the plant will pay about $100,000, said Lourenco Goncalves, chairman, president and chief executive officer of the 170-year-old mining and natural resources company. The plant will be Cliffs' first facility in Ohio.
He said Toledo was uniquely situated for the project.
"We got a site in the Port of Toledo that is extremely convenient," he said. "It is close to the clients and has easy access. Logistically, it is an extremely positive site for us receiving iron pellets from Minnesota to produce the HBI, or hot briquetted iron."
U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur, Democrat of Toledo, expressed similar sentiments.
"The confluence of a job-ready site and Toledo's excellent distribution and transportation network helped to put the Toledo Port site over the top, attracting major investment and the jobs that will come with it," she said in a news release.
Goncalves said a lot of the plant's back office operations will be done in Cleveland, creating additional jobs.
"We don't have a number to give you, but that is a very fair conclusion that there will be more jobs in Cleveland," he said.
Goncalves said the plant would meet a strong demand in the Midwest and the Great Lakes region for HBI, which is used in an electric arc furnace as part of the steelmaking process. He said partly because HBI isn't produced in the region, steelmakers primarily rely on scrap metal with some pig iron mixed in. The pig iron comes from places such as Russia and Venezuela.
Cliffs is relying on local production having an advantage in serving a customer base concentrated in Ohio and neighboring states.
"It will be the first HBI facility in the Midwest and the first one in the Great Lakes," Goncalves said. "We think of this as a great market opportunity that has been present for a long, long time, and now we can do it because in order to produce hot briquetted iron you need two things: iron ore, which we have plenty of, and affordable natural gas, which is something relatively new in the Midwest since the shale boom made natural gas affordable in the Great Lakes."
He said HBI allows for the production of a higher grade of steel.
"Scrap carries trace elements that are completely unacceptable for the high-end applications," Goncalves said.
"We will produce a customized product -- not a one size fits all -- for each one of our clients," he said.

Announces its First HBI Production Plant in the Great Lakes RegionBusiness WireJune 15, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareCLEVELAND--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (CLF) announced today that it has selected a site in Toledo, Ohio for the development of its first hot briquetted iron (HBI) production plant. Midrex Technologies was selected to design, engineer and procure equipment for the new plant, which will have the nominal capacity to produce 1.6 million tons of HBI per year.Lourenco Goncalves, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Today’s announcement marks a very important strategic milestone for Cliffs as we begin to implement our plans to be the sole producer of high-quality HBI for the EAF steel market in the Great Lakes region. We look forward to the strong margin and earnings potential this new product will generate for Cliffs shareholders.” Mr. Goncalves added: “We thank Governor John Kasich, JobsOhio and a number of local partners in the Toledo community for their efforts to help advance this project, including an offer of approximately $30 million in grants and other financial incentives. We will continue to work closely with the State of Ohio through the environmental permitting process, and are excited to bring a significant number of high-paying jobs to Ohio.”Ohio Governor John R. Kasich stated, “This is great news for Toledo and we’re pleased that Cliffs chose Ohio for their new investment. In addition to our strategic location and strong business climate, our low-cost natural gas resources give job creators in this industry a competitive advantage, something Cliffs recognized when considering sites for this new technology.”JobsOhio President and Chief Investment Officer John Minor said he was thrilled Cliffs chose Ohio for this investment. “The Toledo Ironville Terminal site is a great location for this first direct reduced iron project in the Great Lakes Region,” said Minor. “JobsOhio, along with our regional partner RGP, the Toledo-Lucas County Port Authority and the City of Toledo are looking forward to supporting Cliffs as they construct this landmark facility that will create 130 permanent jobs and more than 1,200 construction jobs over the next two years."The estimated investment in the entire project is approximately $700 million, and Cliffs is currently in discussions with several passive financial partners. Cliffs anticipates breaking ground for the construction of the HBI production plant in early 2018, with the production of commercial tonnage of HBI beginning in mid-2020. Cliffs considers the brownfield site at the Port of Toledo a premier location for development due to its relative proximity to several future customers, as well as its logistics advantages, including affordable gas availability and access by multiple rail carriers.About Cliffs Natural Resources Inc.Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. is a leading mining and natural resources company.

Operations overview[edit]
U.S. iron ore[edit]
Cliffs manages and operates five iron ore mines located in Michigan and Minnesota. These mines produce various grades of iron ore pellets, including standard and fluxed, for use in blast furnaces as part of the steelmaking process. As the mines are located near the Great Lakes, the majority of the pellets are transported by rail to loading ports for shipments via vessel to steelmakers in North America.
The U.S.-based mines currently have an annual rated capacity of 32.9 million gross tons of iron ore pellet production, representing 56 percent of total U.S. pellet production capacity.[2] Based on equity ownership in these mines, Cliffs’ share of the annual rated production capacity is currently 25.5 million gross tons, representing 44 percent of total U.S. annual pellet capacity.[2]
During 2014, 2013 and 2012, Cliffs sold 21.8 million, 21.3 million and 21.6 million tons of iron ore pellets, respectively, from its share of the production from its U.S. Iron Ore mines.[2]
Eastern Canada iron ore[edit]
Cliffs had operated two iron ore mines located in Eastern Canada. On February 11, 2014 it was announced that one of the mines, in Wabush, Labrador, would lay off 500 workers due to falling global demand.[3] Subsequently, both mines were idled and closed in 2014 and early 2015 due to unsustainable high cost structures, representing a complete curtailment of the company’s Eastern Canadian iron ore operations.[2] In December 2015, Champion Iron Ltd announced its intention to purchase Bloom Lake's Mine and rail assets.[4]
The mines had produced concentrate and iron ore pellet products marketed towards Asian steelmakers with sintering capabilities at their operations. Located near the St. Lawrence River estuary, the products had been transported by railroads to loading ports for shipment via vessel to steelmakers in North America, or the international seaborne market.
During 2014, 2013 and 2012, Cliffs sold 7.2 million, 8.6 million and 8.9 million metric tons of iron ore pellets and concentrate, respectively, from its Eastern Canadian iron ore mines.[2]
Asia Pacific iron ore[edit]
Cliffs’ Asia Pacific iron ore operations are located in Western Australia and consist solely of the wholly owned Koolyanobbing complex, a collective term for the operating deposits at Koolyanobbing, Windarling and Mount Jackson. Approximately 70 miles separate the three mining areas.
The Koolyanobbing operations serve the Asian iron ore markets with direct-shipped fines and lump ore, and have a production capacity of 11.0 million metric tons annually.[2] The lump products are fed directly to blast furnaces, while the fines products are used as sinter feed. Ore is crushed and blended at a plant located at the Koolyanobbing operation, and then transported by rail for shipment from the port of Esperance.
During 2014, 2013 and 2012, Cliffs sold 11.4 million, 11.1 million and 10.7 million metric tons of iron ore, respectively, from its Western Australia mines.[2]
North American coal[edit]
Cliffs had operated two low-volatile metallurgical coal mines located in West Virginia and Alabama with a rated capacity of 6.5 million tons of production annually.[2] Each coal mine is positioned near rail or barge lines for access to international shipping ports, which exports the product to global integrated steel and coke producers in North America, Europe, China, India and South America. In December 2015, Cliffs announced that it had sold its West Virginia and Alabama operations to Seneca Coal Resources, LLC, marking its exit from the coal business.[5]
During 2014, 2013 and 2012, Cliffs sold 7.4 million, 7.3 million and 6.5 million tons of coal, respectively, from its North American Coal mines.[2]
History[edit]
19th century[edit]
The firm's earliest predecessor was the Cleveland Iron Mining Company, founded in 1847 and chartered as a company by Michigan in 1850.[6] Samuel Mather and six Ohio-based associates had learned of rich iron-ore deposits recently discovered in the highlands of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Soon afterwards, the first Soo Locks opened in 1855, allowing iron ore to be shipped from Lake Superior to Lake Erie.
Technological improvements, such as the Bessemer furnace, made it possible for the North American Great Lakes to produce steel on an industrial scale. The south shore of Lake Erie was close to a supply of coal, making that region an efficient point for the construction of steel mills.
The final decades of the 19th century were a period of business consolidation from the partnership-sized businesses of an earlier generation to a new type of business firm, the stock-market-traded corporation intent on maximizing market share. The former Cleveland Iron Mining Co. was a survivor of this shakeout, purchasing many of its competitors. One key merger in 1890, with Jeptha Wade's Cliffs Iron Company led the combined firm to change its name to the Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company.
The consolidated Cleveland-Cliffs invested substantial sums in operations to improve the logistics of iron-ore transport. In 1892, the firm built the Lake Superior and Ishpeming Railroad to carry iron ore from the mines directly to company-owned docks on Lake Superior.
20th century[edit]
William G. Mather, the son of Samuel, guided Cleveland-Cliffs as president and later as chairman of the board during the period of 1890–1947, participating in the transition from the hard-rock iron ore of Upper Michigan to the soft hematite of Minnesota's Mesabi Range and adjacent lodes.
Under Mather, Cleveland-Cliffs was a leader in the development of the classic-type lake freighter, a bulk-cargo vessel especially designed to carry Great Lakes commodities. The 618-foot-long (188 m) William G. Mather, launched in 1925, is a surviving example of this ship type. For almost a century, the black-hulled Cleveland-Cliffs ships were familiar sights on the upper lakes.
Demand for American iron ore hit peaks during World War I, World War II, and the post-WWII consumer boom. In 1933, Edward Greene (the son-in-law of Jeptha Homer Wade II) replaced William G. Mather as the head of the company. The Mather A Mine opened in the early 1940s and the Mather B shaft in the 1950s. As the Cold War continued, reserves of mineable hematite dwindled in northern Minnesota and Cleveland-Cliffs returned some of its focus to its traditional areas of interest around Marquette, Michigan, where new deposits of magnetite were opened. The first pellet plant was built at Eagle Mills in 1954, followed by the first grate/kiln plant at the Humboldt Mine in 1960. The Republic Mine was converted from a shaft mine to an open pit and concentrator in 1956 and a two-kiln pellet plant was added in 1962. The Empire Mine opened in 1963 and was expanded in the mid- and late-1970s; the Pioneer Pellet Plant was opened in 1965 to pelletize the underground ore from the Mather B Mine in Negaunee. In 1974 the Tilden Mine opened in Ishpeming. This mine was and is the only mine in the world with the ability to produce both hematite and magnetite pellets.
In 1970, a high-grade iron-ore mine was opened at Pannawonica in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, with a 200-kilometre (120 mi) rail line to processing facilities at Cape Lambert for which the residential township of Wickham was built. A pellet plant was built but ceased operation before 1980, following a sharp increase in the cost of diesel fuel.
During the 1970s, Cleveland-Cliffs had sizeable interests in uranium and shale oil fields, as well as the oil and gas drilling industries. It also had holdings in the forest products industry. This interests were disposed of in the 1980s when the company refocused its efforts on its core iron ore business.[7]
The periods following the recessions of 1974–75 and 1981–83 were harsh ones for the iron ore industry. Cleveland-Cliffs shrank its operations, closing the Mather B Mine and the Pioneer Pellet Plant and associated Ore Improvement Plant in 1979. The Humboldt Pellet Plant closed in 1981 and the Republic Mine was idled in 1981 and closed for good in 1996, when Cliffs began turning the associated tailings ponds into compensatory wetlands for its other properties. Over half of the Marquette Iron Range employees were laid off and, in 1984, Cliffs withdrew from the Great Lakes shipping industry.
21st century[edit]
In 2002, LTV Steel, a partner in the Empire Mine managed by CCI, closed and the Empire was idled for six months. Cleveland-Cliffs stock plummeted. President George W. Bush enacted steel tariffs that helped domestically produced steel rebound.
In 2003 Cleveland-Cliffs, in a joint venture with Laiwu Steel Group of China, purchased the assets of bankrupt Eveleth Mines LLC and formed United Taconite. [8]
In the years following the introduction of steel tariffs, a sharp increase in steel production in China and other developing countries led to a significant upswing in the price of global iron ore. This trend benefited Cleveland-Cliffs after the two lean decades that had preceded it. To remain competitive, Cleveland-Cliffs decided to expand globally and to diversify into other minerals, leading to the acquisition of iron-ore properties in Brazil and Australia and coal properties in Australia and the US.[9]
In June 2007, Cleveland-Cliffs purchased its first domestic coal property. The coal company, called PinnOak, mines coal in Alabama and West Virginia and once belonged to U.S. Steel.[10] In line with its venture into coal, the company changed its name from Cleveland-Cliffs to Cliffs Natural Resources in October 2008.[11]
On January 11, 2011 it was reported that Consolidated Thompson Iron Mines Limited agreed to a US$4.9 billion takeover by Cliffs Natural Resources ($200 million of that was already owned, the cost includes debt (In September 2011 Thompson reported $230.56 million in long term with $566.07 million in total liabilities).[12] The deal saved both companies a combined US$75 million in operating expense (partly due to many of their facilities being adjacent to one another).[13] The deal gives Cliffs the large Bloom Lake iron ore mine in the province of Quebec, very close to Labrador.
On May 5, 2011, Cliffs Natural Resources was added to the Fortune 500 list of companies. Its ranking of 477 was based on the company's performance in 2010.[14]
The firm’s CEO Joseph Carrabba announced in July 2013 that he would retire by December 31 of that year. Lead director James Kirsch was elected nonexecutive chairperson in his stead.[15] Gary Halverson, formerly interim chief operating officer of Barrick Gold Corporation Inc., was appointed president and chief operating officer in October 2013,[16] and president and chief executive officer in February 2014.[17]
2014 marked a significant shift in Cliffs’ executive leadership and business strategy. Shareholders elected six new directors during its 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, who appointed former Metals USA executive Lourenco Goncalves as Chairman, President & CEO of Cliffs.[18] The reconstituted Board moved to shift the company’s strategic objectives from global diversification to a renewed focus on strengthening its U.S. iron ore business.[2]
Cliffs announced plans in early 2016 to close one of its five U.S. iron ore mines, the Empire Mine near Marquette, Michigan. The closure, which will terminate the jobs of approximately 400 workers, was expected to take place before the end of the year.[19]

Operations overview[edit]
U.S. iron ore[edit]
Cliffs manages and operates five iron ore mines located in Michigan and Minnesota. These mines produce various grades of iron ore pellets, including standard and fluxed, for use in blast furnaces as part of the steelmaking process. As the mines are located near the Great Lakes, the majority of the pellets are transported by rail to loading ports for shipments via vessel to steelmakers in North America.
The U.S.-based mines currently have an annual rated capacity of 32.9 million gross tons of iron ore pellet production, representing 56 percent of total U.S. pellet production capacity.[2] Based on equity ownership in these mines, Cliffs’ share of the annual rated production capacity is currently 25.5 million gross tons, representing 44 percent of total U.S. annual pellet capacity.[2]
During 2014, 2013 and 2012, Cliffs sold 21.8 million, 21.3 million and 21.6 million tons of iron ore pellets, respectively, from its share of the production from its U.S. Iron Ore mines.[2]
Eastern Canada iron ore[edit]
Cliffs had operated two iron ore mines located in Eastern Canada. On February 11, 2014 it was announced that one of the mines, in Wabush, Labrador, would lay off 500 workers due to falling global demand.[3] Subsequently, both mines were idled and closed in 2014 and early 2015 due to unsustainable high cost structures, representing a complete curtailment of the company’s Eastern Canadian iron ore operations.[2] In December 2015, Champion Iron Ltd announced its intention to purchase Bloom Lake's Mine and rail assets.[4]
The mines had produced concentrate and iron ore pellet products marketed towards Asian steelmakers with sintering capabilities at their operations. Located near the St. Lawrence River estuary, the products had been transported by railroads to loading ports for shipment via vessel to steelmakers in North America, or the international seaborne market.
During 2014, 2013 and 2012, Cliffs sold 7.2 million, 8.6 million and 8.9 million metric tons of iron ore pellets and concentrate, respectively, from its Eastern Canadian iron ore mines.[2]
Asia Pacific iron ore[edit]
Cliffs’ Asia Pacific iron ore operations are located in Western Australia and consist solely of the wholly owned Koolyanobbing complex, a collective term for the operating deposits at Koolyanobbing, Windarling and Mount Jackson. Approximately 70 miles separate the three mining areas.
The Koolyanobbing operations serve the Asian iron ore markets with direct-shipped fines and lump ore, and have a production capacity of 11.0 million metric tons annually.[2] The lump products are fed directly to blast furnaces, while the fines products are used as sinter feed. Ore is crushed and blended at a plant located at the Koolyanobbing operation, and then transported by rail for shipment from the port of Esperance.
During 2014, 2013 and 2012, Cliffs sold 11.4 million, 11.1 million and 10.7 million metric tons of iron ore, respectively, from its Western Australia mines.[2]
North American coal[edit]
Cliffs had operated two low-volatile metallurgical coal mines located in West Virginia and Alabama with a rated capacity of 6.5 million tons of production annually.[2] Each coal mine is positioned near rail or barge lines for access to international shipping ports, which exports the product to global integrated steel and coke producers in North America, Europe, China, India and South America. In December 2015, Cliffs announced that it had sold its West Virginia and Alabama operations to Seneca Coal Resources, LLC, marking its exit from the coal business.[5]
During 2014, 2013 and 2012, Cliffs sold 7.4 million, 7.3 million and 6.5 million tons of coal, respectively, from its North American Coal mines.[2]
History[edit]
19th century[edit]
The firm's earliest predecessor was the Cleveland Iron Mining Company, founded in 1847 and chartered as a company by Michigan in 1850.[6] Samuel Mather and six Ohio-based associates had learned of rich iron-ore deposits recently discovered in the highlands of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Soon afterwards, the first Soo Locks opened in 1855, allowing iron ore to be shipped from Lake Superior to Lake Erie.
Technological improvements, such as the Bessemer furnace, made it possible for the North American Great Lakes to produce steel on an industrial scale. The south shore of Lake Erie was close to a supply of coal, making that region an efficient point for the construction of steel mills.
The final decades of the 19th century were a period of business consolidation from the partnership-sized businesses of an earlier generation to a new type of business firm, the stock-market-traded corporation intent on maximizing market share. The former Cleveland Iron Mining Co. was a survivor of this shakeout, purchasing many of its competitors. One key merger in 1890, with Jeptha Wade's Cliffs Iron Company led the combined firm to change its name to the Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company.
The consolidated Cleveland-Cliffs invested substantial sums in operations to improve the logistics of iron-ore transport. In 1892, the firm built the Lake Superior and Ishpeming Railroad to carry iron ore from the mines directly to company-owned docks on Lake Superior.
20th century[edit]
William G. Mather, the son of Samuel, guided Cleveland-Cliffs as president and later as chairman of the board during the period of 1890–1947, participating in the transition from the hard-rock iron ore of Upper Michigan to the soft hematite of Minnesota's Mesabi Range and adjacent lodes.
Under Mather, Cleveland-Cliffs was a leader in the development of the classic-type lake freighter, a bulk-cargo vessel especially designed to carry Great Lakes commodities. The 618-foot-long (188 m) William G. Mather, launched in 1925, is a surviving example of this ship type. For almost a century, the black-hulled Cleveland-Cliffs ships were familiar sights on the upper lakes.
Demand for American iron ore hit peaks during World War I, World War II, and the post-WWII consumer boom. In 1933, Edward Greene (the son-in-law of Jeptha Homer Wade II) replaced William G. Mather as the head of the company. The Mather A Mine opened in the early 1940s and the Mather B shaft in the 1950s. As the Cold War continued, reserves of mineable hematite dwindled in northern Minnesota and Cleveland-Cliffs returned some of its focus to its traditional areas of interest around Marquette, Michigan, where new deposits of magnetite were opened. The first pellet plant was built at Eagle Mills in 1954, followed by the first grate/kiln plant at the Humboldt Mine in 1960. The Republic Mine was converted from a shaft mine to an open pit and concentrator in 1956 and a two-kiln pellet plant was added in 1962. The Empire Mine opened in 1963 and was expanded in the mid- and late-1970s; the Pioneer Pellet Plant was opened in 1965 to pelletize the underground ore from the Mather B Mine in Negaunee. In 1974 the Tilden Mine opened in Ishpeming. This mine was and is the only mine in the world with the ability to produce both hematite and magnetite pellets.
In 1970, a high-grade iron-ore mine was opened at Pannawonica in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, with a 200-kilometre (120 mi) rail line to processing facilities at Cape Lambert for which the residential township of Wickham was built. A pellet plant was built but ceased operation before 1980, following a sharp increase in the cost of diesel fuel.
During the 1970s, Cleveland-Cliffs had sizeable interests in uranium and shale oil fields, as well as the oil and gas drilling industries. It also had holdings in the forest products industry. This interests were disposed of in the 1980s when the company refocused its efforts on its core iron ore business.[7]
The periods following the recessions of 1974–75 and 1981–83 were harsh ones for the iron ore industry. Cleveland-Cliffs shrank its operations, closing the Mather B Mine and the Pioneer Pellet Plant and associated Ore Improvement Plant in 1979. The Humboldt Pellet Plant closed in 1981 and the Republic Mine was idled in 1981 and closed for good in 1996, when Cliffs began turning the associated tailings ponds into compensatory wetlands for its other properties. Over half of the Marquette Iron Range employees were laid off and, in 1984, Cliffs withdrew from the Great Lakes shipping industry.
21st century[edit]
In 2002, LTV Steel, a partner in the Empire Mine managed by CCI, closed and the Empire was idled for six months. Cleveland-Cliffs stock plummeted. President George W. Bush enacted steel tariffs that helped domestically produced steel rebound.
In 2003 Cleveland-Cliffs, in a joint venture with Laiwu Steel Group of China, purchased the assets of bankrupt Eveleth Mines LLC and formed United Taconite. [8]
In the years following the introduction of steel tariffs, a sharp increase in steel production in China and other developing countries led to a significant upswing in the price of global iron ore. This trend benefited Cleveland-Cliffs after the two lean decades that had preceded it. To remain competitive, Cleveland-Cliffs decided to expand globally and to diversify into other minerals, leading to the acquisition of iron-ore properties in Brazil and Australia and coal properties in Australia and the US.[9]
In June 2007, Cleveland-Cliffs purchased its first domestic coal property. The coal company, called PinnOak, mines coal in Alabama and West Virginia and once belonged to U.S. Steel.[10] In line with its venture into coal, the company changed its name from Cleveland-Cliffs to Cliffs Natural Resources in October 2008.[11]
On January 11, 2011 it was reported that Consolidated Thompson Iron Mines Limited agreed to a US$4.9 billion takeover by Cliffs Natural Resources ($200 million of that was already owned, the cost includes debt (In September 2011 Thompson reported $230.56 million in long term with $566.07 million in total liabilities).[12] The deal saved both companies a combined US$75 million in operating expense (partly due to many of their facilities being adjacent to one another).[13] The deal gives Cliffs the large Bloom Lake iron ore mine in the province of Quebec, very close to Labrador.
On May 5, 2011, Cliffs Natural Resources was added to the Fortune 500 list of companies. Its ranking of 477 was based on the company's performance in 2010.[14]
The firm’s CEO Joseph Carrabba announced in July 2013 that he would retire by December 31 of that year. Lead director James Kirsch was elected nonexecutive chairperson in his stead.[15] Gary Halverson, formerly interim chief operating officer of Barrick Gold Corporation Inc., was appointed president and chief operating officer in October 2013,[16] and president and chief executive officer in February 2014.[17]
2014 marked a significant shift in Cliffs’ executive leadership and business strategy. Shareholders elected six new directors during its 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, who appointed former Metals USA executive Lourenco Goncalves as Chairman, President & CEO of Cliffs.[18] The reconstituted Board moved to shift the company’s strategic objectives from global diversification to a renewed focus on strengthening its U.S. iron ore business.[2]
Cliffs announced plans in early 2016 to close one of its five U.S. iron ore mines, the Empire Mine near Marquette, Michigan. The closure, which will terminate the jobs of approximately 400 workers, was expected to take place before the end of the year.[19]

Operations overview[edit]
U.S. iron ore[edit]
Cliffs manages and operates five iron ore mines located in Michigan and Minnesota. These mines produce various grades of iron ore pellets, including standard and fluxed, for use in blast furnaces as part of the steelmaking process. As the mines are located near the Great Lakes, the majority of the pellets are transported by rail to loading ports for shipments via vessel to steelmakers in North America.
The U.S.-based mines currently have an annual rated capacity of 32.9 million gross tons of iron ore pellet production, representing 56 percent of total U.S. pellet production capacity.[2] Based on equity ownership in these mines, Cliffs’ share of the annual rated production capacity is currently 25.5 million gross tons, representing 44 percent of total U.S. annual pellet capacity.[2]
During 2014, 2013 and 2012, Cliffs sold 21.8 million, 21.3 million and 21.6 million tons of iron ore pellets, respectively, from its share of the production from its U.S. Iron Ore mines.[2]
Eastern Canada iron ore[edit]
Cliffs had operated two iron ore mines located in Eastern Canada. On February 11, 2014 it was announced that one of the mines, in Wabush, Labrador, would lay off 500 workers due to falling global demand.[3] Subsequently, both mines were idled and closed in 2014 and early 2015 due to unsustainable high cost structures, representing a complete curtailment of the company’s Eastern Canadian iron ore operations.[2] In December 2015, Champion Iron Ltd announced its intention to purchase Bloom Lake's Mine and rail assets.[4]
The mines had produced concentrate and iron ore pellet products marketed towards Asian steelmakers with sintering capabilities at their operations. Located near the St. Lawrence River estuary, the products had been transported by railroads to loading ports for shipment via vessel to steelmakers in North America, or the international seaborne market.
During 2014, 2013 and 2012, Cliffs sold 7.2 million, 8.6 million and 8.9 million metric tons of iron ore pellets and concentrate, respectively, from its Eastern Canadian iron ore mines.[2]
Asia Pacific iron ore[edit]
Cliffs’ Asia Pacific iron ore operations are located in Western Australia and consist solely of the wholly owned Koolyanobbing complex, a collective term for the operating deposits at Koolyanobbing, Windarling and Mount Jackson. Approximately 70 miles separate the three mining areas.
The Koolyanobbing operations serve the Asian iron ore markets with direct-shipped fines and lump ore, and have a production capacity of 11.0 million metric tons annually.[2] The lump products are fed directly to blast furnaces, while the fines products are used as sinter feed. Ore is crushed and blended at a plant located at the Koolyanobbing operation, and then transported by rail for shipment from the port of Esperance.
During 2014, 2013 and 2012, Cliffs sold 11.4 million, 11.1 million and 10.7 million metric tons of iron ore, respectively, from its Western Australia mines.[2]
North American coal[edit]
Cliffs had operated two low-volatile metallurgical coal mines located in West Virginia and Alabama with a rated capacity of 6.5 million tons of production annually.[2] Each coal mine is positioned near rail or barge lines for access to international shipping ports, which exports the product to global integrated steel and coke producers in North America, Europe, China, India and South America. In December 2015, Cliffs announced that it had sold its West Virginia and Alabama operations to Seneca Coal Resources, LLC, marking its exit from the coal business.[5]
During 2014, 2013 and 2012, Cliffs sold 7.4 million, 7.3 million and 6.5 million tons of coal, respectively, from its North American Coal mines.[2]
History[edit]
19th century[edit]
The firm's earliest predecessor was the Cleveland Iron Mining Company, founded in 1847 and chartered as a company by Michigan in 1850.[6] Samuel Mather and six Ohio-based associates had learned of rich iron-ore deposits recently discovered in the highlands of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Soon afterwards, the first Soo Locks opened in 1855, allowing iron ore to be shipped from Lake Superior to Lake Erie.
Technological improvements, such as the Bessemer furnace, made it possible for the North American Great Lakes to produce steel on an industrial scale. The south shore of Lake Erie was close to a supply of coal, making that region an efficient point for the construction of steel mills.
The final decades of the 19th century were a period of business consolidation from the partnership-sized businesses of an earlier generation to a new type of business firm, the stock-market-traded corporation intent on maximizing market share. The former Cleveland Iron Mining Co. was a survivor of this shakeout, purchasing many of its competitors. One key merger in 1890, with Jeptha Wade's Cliffs Iron Company led the combined firm to change its name to the Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company.
The consolidated Cleveland-Cliffs invested substantial sums in operations to improve the logistics of iron-ore transport. In 1892, the firm built the Lake Superior and Ishpeming Railroad to carry iron ore from the mines directly to company-owned docks on Lake Superior.
20th century[edit]
William G. Mather, the son of Samuel, guided Cleveland-Cliffs as president and later as chairman of the board during the period of 1890–1947, participating in the transition from the hard-rock iron ore of Upper Michigan to the soft hematite of Minnesota's Mesabi Range and adjacent lodes.
Under Mather, Cleveland-Cliffs was a leader in the development of the classic-type lake freighter, a bulk-cargo vessel especially designed to carry Great Lakes commodities. The 618-foot-long (188 m) William G. Mather, launched in 1925, is a surviving example of this ship type. For almost a century, the black-hulled Cleveland-Cliffs ships were familiar sights on the upper lakes.
Demand for American iron ore hit peaks during World War I, World War II, and the post-WWII consumer boom. In 1933, Edward Greene (the son-in-law of Jeptha Homer Wade II) replaced William G. Mather as the head of the company. The Mather A Mine opened in the early 1940s and the Mather B shaft in the 1950s. As the Cold War continued, reserves of mineable hematite dwindled in northern Minnesota and Cleveland-Cliffs returned some of its focus to its traditional areas of interest around Marquette, Michigan, where new deposits of magnetite were opened. The first pellet plant was built at Eagle Mills in 1954, followed by the first grate/kiln plant at the Humboldt Mine in 1960. The Republic Mine was converted from a shaft mine to an open pit and concentrator in 1956 and a two-kiln pellet plant was added in 1962. The Empire Mine opened in 1963 and was expanded in the mid- and late-1970s; the Pioneer Pellet Plant was opened in 1965 to pelletize the underground ore from the Mather B Mine in Negaunee. In 1974 the Tilden Mine opened in Ishpeming. This mine was and is the only mine in the world with the ability to produce both hematite and magnetite pellets.
In 1970, a high-grade iron-ore mine was opened at Pannawonica in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, with a 200-kilometre (120 mi) rail line to processing facilities at Cape Lambert for which the residential township of Wickham was built. A pellet plant was built but ceased operation before 1980, following a sharp increase in the cost of diesel fuel.
During the 1970s, Cleveland-Cliffs had sizeable interests in uranium and shale oil fields, as well as the oil and gas drilling industries. It also had holdings in the forest products industry. This interests were disposed of in the 1980s when the company refocused its efforts on its core iron ore business.[7]
The periods following the recessions of 1974–75 and 1981–83 were harsh ones for the iron ore industry. Cleveland-Cliffs shrank its operations, closing the Mather B Mine and the Pioneer Pellet Plant and associated Ore Improvement Plant in 1979. The Humboldt Pellet Plant closed in 1981 and the Republic Mine was idled in 1981 and closed for good in 1996, when Cliffs began turning the associated tailings ponds into compensatory wetlands for its other properties. Over half of the Marquette Iron Range employees were laid off and, in 1984, Cliffs withdrew from the Great Lakes shipping industry.
21st century[edit]
In 2002, LTV Steel, a partner in the Empire Mine managed by CCI, closed and the Empire was idled for six months. Cleveland-Cliffs stock plummeted. President George W. Bush enacted steel tariffs that helped domestically produced steel rebound.
In 2003 Cleveland-Cliffs, in a joint venture with Laiwu Steel Group of China, purchased the assets of bankrupt Eveleth Mines LLC and formed United Taconite. [8]
In the years following the introduction of steel tariffs, a sharp increase in steel production in China and other developing countries led to a significant upswing in the price of global iron ore. This trend benefited Cleveland-Cliffs after the two lean decades that had preceded it. To remain competitive, Cleveland-Cliffs decided to expand globally and to diversify into other minerals, leading to the acquisition of iron-ore properties in Brazil and Australia and coal properties in Australia and the US.[9]
In June 2007, Cleveland-Cliffs purchased its first domestic coal property. The coal company, called PinnOak, mines coal in Alabama and West Virginia and once belonged to U.S. Steel.[10] In line with its venture into coal, the company changed its name from Cleveland-Cliffs to Cliffs Natural Resources in October 2008.[11]
On January 11, 2011 it was reported that Consolidated Thompson Iron Mines Limited agreed to a US$4.9 billion takeover by Cliffs Natural Resources ($200 million of that was already owned, the cost includes debt (In September 2011 Thompson reported $230.56 million in long term with $566.07 million in total liabilities).[12] The deal saved both companies a combined US$75 million in operating expense (partly due to many of their facilities being adjacent to one another).[13] The deal gives Cliffs the large Bloom Lake iron ore mine in the province of Quebec, very close to Labrador.
On May 5, 2011, Cliffs Natural Resources was added to the Fortune 500 list of companies. Its ranking of 477 was based on the company's performance in 2010.[14]
The firm’s CEO Joseph Carrabba announced in July 2013 that he would retire by December 31 of that year. Lead director James Kirsch was elected nonexecutive chairperson in his stead.[15] Gary Halverson, formerly interim chief operating officer of Barrick Gold Corporation Inc., was appointed president and chief operating officer in October 2013,[16] and president and chief executive officer in February 2014.[17]
2014 marked a significant shift in Cliffs’ executive leadership and business strategy. Shareholders elected six new directors during its 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, who appointed former Metals USA executive Lourenco Goncalves as Chairman, President & CEO of Cliffs.[18] The reconstituted Board moved to shift the company’s strategic objectives from global diversification to a renewed focus on strengthening its U.S. iron ore business.[2]
Cliffs announced plans in early 2016 to close one of its five U.S. iron ore mines, the Empire Mine near Marquette, Michigan. The closure, which will terminate the jobs of approximately 400 workers, was expected to take place before the end of the year.[19]

Operations overview[edit]
U.S. iron ore[edit]
Cliffs manages and operates five iron ore mines located in Michigan and Minnesota. These mines produce various grades of iron ore pellets, including standard and fluxed, for use in blast furnaces as part of the steelmaking process. As the mines are located near the Great Lakes, the majority of the pellets are transported by rail to loading ports for shipments via vessel to steelmakers in North America.
The U.S.-based mines currently have an annual rated capacity of 32.9 million gross tons of iron ore pellet production, representing 56 percent of total U.S. pellet production capacity.[2] Based on equity ownership in these mines, Cliffs’ share of the annual rated production capacity is currently 25.5 million gross tons, representing 44 percent of total U.S. annual pellet capacity.[2]
During 2014, 2013 and 2012, Cliffs sold 21.8 million, 21.3 million and 21.6 million tons of iron ore pellets, respectively, from its share of the production from its U.S. Iron Ore mines.[2]
Eastern Canada iron ore[edit]
Cliffs had operated two iron ore mines located in Eastern Canada. On February 11, 2014 it was announced that one of the mines, in Wabush, Labrador, would lay off 500 workers due to falling global demand.[3] Subsequently, both mines were idled and closed in 2014 and early 2015 due to unsustainable high cost structures, representing a complete curtailment of the company’s Eastern Canadian iron ore operations.[2] In December 2015, Champion Iron Ltd announced its intention to purchase Bloom Lake's Mine and rail assets.[4]
The mines had produced concentrate and iron ore pellet products marketed towards Asian steelmakers with sintering capabilities at their operations. Located near the St. Lawrence River estuary, the products had been transported by railroads to loading ports for shipment via vessel to steelmakers in North America, or the international seaborne market.
During 2014, 2013 and 2012, Cliffs sold 7.2 million, 8.6 million and 8.9 million metric tons of iron ore pellets and concentrate, respectively, from its Eastern Canadian iron ore mines.[2]
Asia Pacific iron ore[edit]
Cliffs’ Asia Pacific iron ore operations are located in Western Australia and consist solely of the wholly owned Koolyanobbing complex, a collective term for the operating deposits at Koolyanobbing, Windarling and Mount Jackson. Approximately 70 miles separate the three mining areas.
The Koolyanobbing operations serve the Asian iron ore markets with direct-shipped fines and lump ore, and have a production capacity of 11.0 million metric tons annually.[2] The lump products are fed directly to blast furnaces, while the fines products are used as sinter feed. Ore is crushed and blended at a plant located at the Koolyanobbing operation, and then transported by rail for shipment from the port of Esperance.
During 2014, 2013 and 2012, Cliffs sold 11.4 million, 11.1 million and 10.7 million metric tons of iron ore, respectively, from its Western Australia mines.[2]
North American coal[edit]
Cliffs had operated two low-volatile metallurgical coal mines located in West Virginia and Alabama with a rated capacity of 6.5 million tons of production annually.[2] Each coal mine is positioned near rail or barge lines for access to international shipping ports, which exports the product to global integrated steel and coke producers in North America, Europe, China, India and South America. In December 2015, Cliffs announced that it had sold its West Virginia and Alabama operations to Seneca Coal Resources, LLC, marking its exit from the coal business.[5]
During 2014, 2013 and 2012, Cliffs sold 7.4 million, 7.3 million and 6.5 million tons of coal, respectively, from its North American Coal mines.[2]

The company has approximately 5,700 employees globally and 4,000 in North America, with a 28 percent share of the iron-ore pellet market. Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. changed to its current name from Cleveland-Cliffs in October 2008.

The IT department for Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (CNR) is led by the Chief Information Officer from the corporate headquarters in Cleveland, OH. The CIO works closely with the Director of Enterprise Systems to develop and implement the Mincom Ellipse ERP systems throughout the operations and mining facilities in North America. Additionally, this group focuses on business process management (BPM) practices. A separate director manages financial systems handled by Oracle's Hyperion products. 

The IT Infrastructure group is accountable for the company's IT enterprise platform to support the business operations and divisions. This group oversees the network services agreement with AT&T, which provides global networking technologies such as wireless networking. Additionally, CNR signed a five-year agreement in late 2009 for Infocrossing to handle data center services, storage, and architecture services. An IT operations manager focuses on the management of these teams. 

The Project Management Office (PMO) division is responsible for the strategic planning of the IT department. This group primarily handles IT governance initiatives, which includes compliance, IT integration and IT auditing. A key leader in the department specializes in enterprise content management, with a 2010 rollout of OnBase CAD Services across several business units. Other leaders are responsible for Web services and database administration.

Cliffs Natural Resources Inc.'s IT budget is typically finalized in Q3.
