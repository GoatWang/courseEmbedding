The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Oddup Announces Expansion Into India









PR Newswire




Jul 23, 2017 11:00 PM EDT













 


















































 The India city launches enable investors to gain more insights and data, thus helping them make more informed investment decisions faster, quicker and more accurately. With a strong research and advisory team formerly from Goldman Sachs, Oddup's platform transforms unstructured startup research to an environment with benchmarks and more transparency via a data-driven approach. The Oddup Score, a rating which serves as a health barometer of a startup at any given time, has become many investors' go-to indicator.  This is also an opportunity for startups in India to gain international exposure and media coverage on Oddup's network and partners. The platform enables startups to reach potential investors from around the world. Jackie concludes, " India has a very competitive startup landscape so it is crucial for startups in India to gain that competitive advantage, and they can do so by being rated on our platform".  About Oddup Oddup is a data-driven research platform that focuses on startups. Known as The Startup Rating System, it provides data and valuations of startups. The company's vision is to bring insight and transparency across the startup landscape to enable smart startup investing. Oddup rates startups with a rating score from 1-100. It is based on the combination of analyst view points and the computed algorithm, the Oddup Score. The startup rating scores are then offered as views: Buy, Hold, Sell with expectation metrics and valuations.

Oddup Announces Expansion Into India









PR Newswire




Jul 23, 2017 11:00 PM EDT













 




























































  HONG KONG, July 23, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Oddup, the world's leading startup rating and research platform announced today the expansion of its startup rating to India. Launching in the major startup hubs Mumbai, Bangalore and New Delhi, Oddup extends its coverage on startups to over 16 cities globally. Oddup fills the information gap for startups with core interest from angel investors and venture capitalists and following on from its recent Series A funding announcement, led by India's largest media conglomerate The Times Group, Oddup enters the Indian market with a mission to help global investors with visibility to potentially high reward and high return Indian startup investment options. " India has one of largest startup ecosystems in the world. Our core aim is to help investors find the right startup to invest in and at the same time, startups in India now have the chance to be seen by international investors who are using Oddup to assist them in their due diligence", says Jackie Lam, co-founder of Oddup. Investors are increasingly in need of reliable sources of data and expertise on startups. "The sheer size of the number of startups in India and China alone makes it difficult to determine which startups may succeed. Oddup gives investors visibility and clarity in the large and somewhat fragmented startup markets of India", continues Jackie.
