Oil Stocks: Is Energy XXI Ltd. a Value or Value Trap?
Energy XXI Ltd’s stock has been beaten down this year. But here’s one number that could make the stock worth a look. 











                Matthew DiLallo
            

                (TMFmd19)



            
            Dec 2, 2014 at 9:00AM
            
            





It has been a truly awful year for investors in Energy XXI's (NASDAQ:EXXI) stock, which is down 76% over the past year:

EXXI data by YCharts
While those owning the stock are probably cursing the day they bought, those without a position might be a bit tempted by the massive price cut. As humans we tend to be drawn to things on sale, with the hope that a real bargain might be had. However, the problem with perceived bargains is that there's usually a reason why an item has been steeply discounted, such as a crack or other deformity. So, let's take a look to see if there's actually some value at Energy XXI or if it's just another trap for our investment dollars.
The value of oil in the groundOne way to look at the underlying value of an energy company is to look at the oil and gas reserves it holds. These reserves hold varying degrees of value based on the certainty of future production as well as commodity prices. The more certain investors are that a company's reserves will be produced, the higher the value. We see this certainty scale in the following chart, which shows that proved reserves are by far the most certain resource category.  

Source: EIA





The farther away we go from proved reserves (also known as 1P) the less certain we are that the reserves will be produced so these have less value to investors. However, in some cases investors can grow so bearish on a company that they ascribe absolutely no value to these reserves. So, it's quite possible that a company is sitting on a lot more oil and gas in the ground than the value of a company would indicate.
A look at what Energy XXI has in the groundWhen we look at Energy XXI we see that investors are valuing the entire business, as measured by enterprise value, at about $5 billion. However, as of the end of the company's fiscal year in June it held proved reserves, or 1P, totaling 246 million barrels of oil equivalent, or BOE. Those reserves had PV-10 value, or a present value discounted by 10%, of $7.6 billion at the then current oil price of $103.63 per barrel.
In addition to that, the company held another 70 million BOE of probable reserves, 2P, with a PV-10 value of $3.6 billion and 65 million BOE of possible reserves, 3P, with a PV-10 value of $3.4 billion. Add it all up and the company was estimated to have been sitting on upward of $14.6 billion worth of oil and gas in the ground, which is noted on the following chart. 

Source: Energy XXI Ltd. Investor Presentation





What this slide is suggesting is that Energy XXI is sitting on as much as three times more oil and gas in the ground than its current value would indicate. That's of course if we ascribed full value for possible and probable reserves, which are less certain than proved reserves. Further, it also assumes a much higher oil price than what we're seeing just a few months later. Still, factor all of that into the equation and we're still looking at a company sitting on substantially more oil and gas reserves than the current stock price would suggest, which would seem to scream value. 
The weight pulling everything downThere is, however, one big blemish and that's the company's massive debt load. The company is weighed down by $3.6 billion in debt. This is a big burden as it leaves Energy XXI with little wiggle room. We saw this last quarter as the company generated $204 million in operating cash flow. However, its interest burden was $65 million in the quarter so 32% of its cash flow went just to pay the interest on its debt. Meanwhile, the rest of its cash flow, and then some, was used to fund the company's capex plan. Last quarter alone the company spent $280 million in capex, so that leaves the company to look to outside sources, like issuing more debt or equity, to fund capex. The worry here is that as oil prices keep sliding it will make it much harder for Energy XXI to maintain production while also keeping up with its interest payments. So, in the future it might have no choice but to sell its oil and gas assets at fire sale prices just to keep from going under if oil prices keep sliding. 
Investor takeawayThere is a case to be made that Energy XXI is a bargain as we can buy oil and gas in the ground for a discount to present value. However, the trap here is the company's debt as it sucks up way too much of the cash flow, which could have been used to profitably develop its oil and gas assets. This debt trap has turned too many value stocks into value traps, so until the company improves that picture I'd stay away from this sale item.

History
Energy XXI was formed in 2005 with a successful $300 million IPO on the London Stock Exchange Alternative Investment Market (AIM). Since then, the company has implemented an “acquire and exploit” growth strategy to build a geographically focused portfolio with some of the highest per-unit margins in the industry. It began with an agreement in March 2006 to purchase Marlin Energy Offshore for $421 million. Soon after the purchase closed, the company agreed to acquire some South Louisiana properties for a total of $308 million. By August 2006, the South Louisiana acquisition had closed and the company was able to raise $86.5 million through a warrant exercise.
Energy XXI continued its geographically focused “acquire and exploit” strategy the following year. In April 2007, the company agreed to acquire POGO’s Gulf of Mexico assets for $419.5 million. This acquisition closed in June 2007 and by August, the company was dual listed on the NASDAQ exchange under the EXXI ticker symbol.
The company continued to grow even during the economic downturn of 2008 and 2009. Energy XXI raised $237 million through a warrant tender in 2008 to clean up its capital structure. By November 2009, the company announced an acceptance of debt exchange for $347 million in senior notes. This coincided with the company’s $283 million acquisition of MitEnergy, which consolidated interests with the POGO fields acquired in 2007.
In January 2010, Energy XXI announced a major discovery at the Davy Jones ultra-deep well on the Gulf of Mexico Shelf. In addition, the company announced a 1-for-5 share consolidation to make the stock more attractive to a broader range of institutional investors. Five years after the company’s formation, Energy XXI became the third-largest producer on the Gulf of Mexico shelf with the $1.01 billion acquisition of properties from ExxonMobil. This strategy culminated with the $1.01 billion acquisition of some Gulf of Mexico Shelf properties from ExxonMobil, making it one of the largest acquisitions in recent history.
Since then, the company has added two high-potential exploration joint ventures targeting untapped oil around salt domes on the Shelf. In September 2012, Energy XXI announced a joint venture exploration deal with ExxonMobil. This was soon followed by another joint venture announcement with Apache in March 2013.
2014 proved to be a major milestone in the company’s history.  In March 2014, Energy XXI announced the acquisition of EPL Oil & Gas for $2.3 billion.  As a result of the merger, Energy XXI has become the largest publicly traded independent producer on the Gulf of Mexico Shelf.
Energy XXI is focused on developing core properties while ramping up a complementary exploration program designed to provide organic growth for the future.
