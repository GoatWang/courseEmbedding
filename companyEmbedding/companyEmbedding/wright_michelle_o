Michelle Obama’s Hair Care Secrets Unclassified 
By Karen Brailsford














 Topping off every polished look Michelle Obama sports is a gleaming crown of carefully coifed, healthy hair. Because textured hair tends to be dry, it’s imperative that African-American women follow these healthy hair care guidelines, says Michelle O’Connor, an ethnic-hair specialist from Hollywood, Fla.
Quench your hair with moisturizing shampoos and conditioners during weekly washings. Use hairstyling products on a daily basis to keep hair hydrated.Wrap hair nightly with a satin scarf to prevent breakage. The friction created when your hair rubs up against your pillowcase is damaging to your locks.Refrain from using hot styling tools on a daily basis and apply a heat-protectant product to tresses when you do use a flat iron or curling iron. To maintain waves between sessions with irons, loosely pin curls at night instead.Trim hair every six weeks to avoid split ends.
Here’s how you can get four of the first lady’s favorite looks:
Bob It: Michelle’s signature go-to look
Why it works: Exudes no-nonsense elegance. Adds body because every strand is one length.Do the ’do: Start with an even or a blunt haircut that is chin-length or slightly longer. Wash hair and towel-dry. Apply setting lotion to small sections of hair and set in large plastic rollers. Sit under bonnet hair-dryer or allow to air-dry. Remove rollers and apply a dab of hair oil. Gently hold hair dryer over locks with one hand while moving a large round brush underneath curls until only large, uniform waves remain. Los Angeles hairstylist Rosalind Williams likes to finish with a light mist of a high-shine flexible-hold hairspray, like Sebastian Laminates.
Pony Up: The first lady keeps her mane casual when she’s hanging with daughters Sasha and Malia
Why it works: “A ponytail highlights the beauty of a woman’s face,” according to Johnny Wright, Obama’s hairstylist, “and it can be taken from day to night if it’s done properly.”Do the ’do: Gather dry hair, smooth with a hair gloss -- try Oscar Blandi Pronto Gloss Instant Glossing Cream -- and secure with an elastic holder at the nape of the neck. Wrap a strand of hair around the elastic to give the look nighttime elegance.
Whirl the Curls: Michelle’s special-occasion loose and lively wavy bob
Why it works: “This imparts sex appeal,” says Williams, but it still looks “very classy.”Do the ’do: Wash hair. Section, braid and let air-dry. Apply a protectant, like Mizani Thermasmooth Smooth Guard Smoothing Serum. Using a ceramic or tourmaline 1-inch curling iron (gentler, more controlled heat), hold the iron parallel to your head. Starting a couple of inches from your scalp, wrap a 1 1/2-inch section of hair around the barrel (away from your face). Continue wrapping up the barrel until you are holding the ends up against the iron. After curling the entire head, separate the curls in twos and threes with your fingers for even more volume.
 Chignon Chic: Michelle’s classically elegant ’do
Why it works: “This hairdo will never let you down,” says Williams. “It will always stay nice and neat, no matter what you’re doing.”Do the ’do: Moisturize freshly washed hair with a daily hair creme like Pantene Relaxed & Natural Daily Oil Cream Moisturizer. Follow instructions for the ponytail (above). Divide ponytail into two parts, then twist them together tightly into a spiral. For a more ornate look, braid the ponytail. Wrap all of the hair in a circular rotation around the ponytail holder and tuck inside holder. For a fuller look, add a weft or hairpiece. Spritz with hairspray.Photo: Getty Images

From Relaxed to All Natural: Johnny Wright, the Man Behind Michelle Obama’s HairFrom Relaxed to All Natural: Johnny Wright, the Man Behind Michelle Obama’s HairDanielle C. Belton5/21/15 3:00amFiled to: Culture12EditPromoteShare to KinjaToggle Conversation toolsGo to permalinkCelebrity stylist Johnny Wright talks with The Root Associate Editor Danielle Belton about his work with first lady Michelle Obama.Nicole L. Cvetnic/The RootMichelle Obama with an Afro? Michelle Obama with an Afro!It could happen!AdvertisementAnd celebrity stylist Johnny Wright—the stylist to the first lady—is the man who would make that happen if it did. Wright, who says Michelle Obama has been completely natural for years now (he straightens her hair with a flat iron), says it is a possibility that maybe the world’s most famous bob could go naturally curly.Anything could happen, really.Advertisement“I don’t know. Maybe on vacation she will,” says Wright, raising the hopes of natural-hair fans everywhere. “She is 100 percent natural now. It is a possibility.”AdvertisementWatch below as Johnny Wright discusses some of the signature hair looks he’s done over the years for first lady Michelle Obama in this exclusive video:Chicago born and raised, Wright initially styled Michelle Obama for an Essence magazine shoot when she was the wife of then-Sen. Barack Obama. That editorial shoot, when Wright knew little about the senator or his wife, turned into a blossoming relationship between the future first lady and stylist.“To be honest, I wasn’t too optimistic, [I wasn’t thinking,] ‘Oh, they’re going to be the first family.’ I was just doing a job,” Wright says, who went on to style Michelle Obama for a few more magazine shoots while he was moving to Los Angeles to work for Frederic Fekkai to craft red-carpet-ready looks for celebrity clients.Advertisement“I remember telling her, ‘I’m moving to L.A. Good luck, I hope you all win,’” Wright says matter-of-factly.But then Wright got the call to spend a week doing Michelle Obama’s hair for the Democratic National Convention in Denver in 2008. Fekkai gave Wright the week off as Michelle Obama was set to give a big speech and be formally presented to the world. She was putting her trust in Wright. Prior to him, the only person who’d done her hair professionally was stylist Ronnie Flowers, who’d done her hair since she was a child.AdvertisementWright, realizing the gravity of the moment, asked the soon-to-be first lady, “Do you mind shampooing your hair when you get ready for the night?”“And she was a little reluctant because she’d just had a relaxer a couple days before,” Wright says. “I think she knew that I wanted to put my stamp on it. She agreed, a little reluctantly, but she agreed. But I remember the next morning after the speech. The speech was widely popular, but everybody talked about her hair.” Blessed with his flat iron of God (and “a round brush. Some sheers … I did a little bit of everything that day,” he says), Wright took himself from sometimes-stylist to full-time. When the Obamas moved to the White House, so did he.AdvertisementAdvertisementIt’s all been a whirlwind ever since for Wright, as he spoke with The Root from the bustling Lauriol Plaza restaurant in the Adam’s Morgan section of Washington, D.C., on Friday.With a big smile, Wright admits that when Michelle Obama leaves the White House in 2016, his other celebrity clients will be thrilled—particularly NBC anchor Tamron Hall.“She’s always battling with my schedule with the first lady,” Wright says, mockingly adding, “Dang it, she’s got you again!” to Hall’s being bumped.AdvertisementWhile it may not always be fun for his other clients (poor Tamron Hall), Wright has it pretty good doing the hair of one of the most famous heads in America, possibly the world. Who wouldn’t want the first African-American first lady for a muse? It’s not every day a stylist gets to make front-page news for a hairdo.Wright has no overarching hair philosophy (“I’m not that deep”) but proudly believes "that hair is a language. If it’s not moving, it has no voice.” He was inspired to do hair by his grandmother Minnie Brown, who started doing hair at age 13 and continued to work as a stylist until she was 91 years old.AdvertisementSomething of a hair child prodigy, Wright was told by his grandmother that he was able to put hair into “a clean ponytail” by age 3. By age 12 he started developing his own hair clientele, gaining a full roster of clients by age 14. His father then built a salon in the basement for Wright to work out of, which he did, until he was about 20.AdvertisementWright doesn’t believe in those old schisms of “good” and “bad” hair. (“Hair is hair. It’s all beautiful.”) Instead, he believes the current move toward going natural—one even the first lady got caught up in—is one part trend, one part revolution.“I think a lot of women are starting to see what type of damage chemicals has caused their hair over the years, and they’re really starting to embrace their curls and really embrace the fact that they can be versatile,” Wright says. “They can wear it curly. They can wear it straight. They don’t have to really conform to any particular look. They can do it all, and that’s one thing that is going to stick. That’s the revolution part of it. … The revolution part will stick. All about curl power.”As the Obamas wind down their stay in the White House, Wright is considering what his next moves may be. He’ll definitely do television, maybe a product line, maybe put his name on a salon, but he may also write a book. (“A memoir maybe; a beauty book as well.”)AdvertisementBut as for his relationship with his most famous client, that’s one that Wright hopes will not change.Advertisement“I do plan on continuing to working with the first lady in some capacity,” Wright says. “If she’ll have me, I’ll be with her.”You may also likeLifehackerM.A.C. is Giving Away Free Lipstick TomorrowYesterday 5:30pmThe GrapevineDiddy Showed Black Women Some Twitter Love and White Women Started WhitewomaningThursday 3:03pmThe MuseDouble Dick Dude's Memoir Reads Like a 'Letters to Penthouse' Reject1/19/15 9:20amRecent from Danielle C.

                            Tips from Mrs. Obama's Hairstylist
            


Michelle Obama has been in the White House for an entire year-and while the rest of the world has been lusting after her impeccable sense of style, the beauty editors among us have been marveling at her incredible range of hairstyles. Who's responsible for those tresses? Johnny Wright, the First Lady's exclusive hairstylist and artistic style director for SoftSheen-Carson. Not surprisingly, the Chicago native is similarly fashion-minded. "The hair is just like any other accessory," he told us. "You've really got to make it go with what you're wearing." We dished with Wright and got tips for pulling off styles that are downright presidential.

2. 
                            Get a Curly Cut
            


According to Wright, pulling off a curly look is all about having a cut that accentuates your natural texture. "Some styles are made for hair only when it's blown-out straight. You want a cut that's made for both curly and straight looks," he says. "If you're concerned with how your hair will look wavy, ask your stylist to cut it when it's curly, and then blow it out and fine tune when it's straight."

3. 
                            Invest in the Right Tools
            


"When it comes to textured hair, a ceramic round brush is key for keeping strands healthy and shiny, no matter how much you style it," says Wright. For finer hair, Wright likes a rubber-based Denman Brush. "It grips the hair a little and smooths the cuticle out," he says.

4. 
                            Try a Fake-Out Style
            


"I'm a big fan of what I call the up-tuck," says Wright. "It works very well with face-framing layers, which most people have. You pin-up all the hair in the back, and then let the front fall naturally. It's like you've gotten a haircut. You kind of fake them out a little bit, and it's a great way to add versatility to your look."

5. 
                            Deep Condition...Frequently
            


One upside to being constantly barraged by flashbulbs and photographers? The First Lady gets to show off her shiny, healthy hair. "People always think glossy hair is topical, but true luminous shine is achieved at the root," says Wright. "You should be deep conditioning to soften and nourish the hair shaft every time you shampoo. There is no such thing as too much deep conditioning." His favorite pick? SoftSheen-Carson Roots of Nature Reconstructing Deep Treatment, which strengthens hair with a blend of shea butter and green tea. 







 




              Olivier Douliery/Abaca            



6. 
                            Give Your Hair a Day Off
            


"Even women with the healthiest hair need to minimize how often they style," says Wright. A general rule of thumb? "If your hair is heavily styled and loaded with product four times a week, keep it down on the fifth day." That one day will give your cuticles a chance to flatten and rebond to the hair shaft, resulting in stronger, shinier looks when you return to styling. 







 




              Olivier Douliery /Abaca            



7. 
                            Rediscover the Ponytail
            


Call Wright old-fashioned, but the ponytail is one of his favorite looks. "I've always been a huge fan. It highlights the beauty of a woman's face," he says. And no, the ponytail is not just for the gym. "A ponytail can honestly be taken from day to night if it's done properly," says Wright. In the morning, make sure it's smooth and has a nice curve to it. "For the cocktail party, simply wrap a strand around the elastic and you've got an elegant look." Or, dress up the entire style by parting your hair on the side before gathering it at the base of your neck. 







 




              Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images            



8. 
                            Protect Your Hair from Overstyling
            


Flat-irons, daily blow-outs, curling irons-most women can't make it through the day without at least one heated styling tool. Wright sees nothing wrong with that, as long as you use the right reinforcements. "Be sure you're using protective guards on your hair. Thermal protecting sprays create a barrier on the hair shaft, and keep the heat from penetrating into that inner core, which is what causes permanent damage," he says. 







 




              Olivier Douliery /Abaca            



9. 
                            Choose the Right Elastic
            


Shh...Wright's got a little secret and it's nothing fancy. "I carry a range of Goody colored elastics in my kit," he says. "I always make sure that the band matches the hair color of the person I'm working with. It's an easy way to make a style look elegant." The stylist also prefers matching hair pins, too.

10. 
                            2009
            


"I like updos that look very simple and natural," Wright said. "People try to make their hair a little too perfect with updos, and that's where it goes wrong. Honestly, the messier the better." The First Lady looked stunning in a half-updo with loose curls at the nape of her neck.

Michelle Obama hit the stage of the Democratic National Convention earlier this month to make a case to the American people for her husband’s re-election. Along with a speech, which won rave reviews from political pundits and commentators, the always-fashionable first lady made a statement with her look. Details from her dress’ designer to her nail polish color have since been revealed, but only Michelle Obama’s hair stylist, Johnny Wright, has the secret to her lovely locks.

“I tell people a woman’s hair is the first thing you hear before she speaks,” Wright said over the summer in an interview with theGrio before the convention. “Whether a woman is taking care of home or running a Fortune 500 company, her hair should be a unique expression of her personality.”
Mrs. Obama’s look for the DNC speech proved just that. From the very beginning, viewers at home were commenting on the first lady’s appearance, and her hair was the crowning glory of Michelle’s iconic style. On Twitter, comments averaged more than 28,000 tweets per minute for the 25 minutes that she appeared on stage with many wondering what designer she was wearing — Tracy Reese — and the shade and manufacturer of her nail polish (“Vogue” by Artistic Nail Design).
Gospel singer Vicki Winans also tweeted a question about the first lady’s hairdo that was probably on many minds: “Ok who flat-ironed Michelle Obama’s HAIR? Sheesh! It’s gorgeous!”
It is likely that the person responsible for her loose curls that evening was Johnny Wright. (TheGrio reached out to Wright for confirmation, but with the election in full swing, the Obama insider is keeping mum in keeping with White House protocol.)
Wright has been styling the first lady’s tresses since Barack Obama was a presidential candidate. From Chicago and a family of hairdressers, he has been in the business since he was a child. At 12, Wright says he had over 100 regular clients that would come to the makeshift parlor his parents built in their basement for his signature updos and finger waves. In 2008, he got a call from his agent to style a senator’s wife for an Essence magazine shoot. Wright said that he and Mrs. Obama hit it off immediately and after Barack Obama became president, she asked him to move to D.C. permanently to style her hair.
Wight told theGrio that styling Michelle Obama’s hair involves the application of both his conservative and edgy approaches. In preparation for the job, he also looked to examples of first ladies past for inspiration. “A lot of articles written about [Hillary Clinton] talked about how indecisive she was,” he said. “And they thought that because she changed her hair frequently in office… I immediately understood the value of having a silhouette that people recognize.”
Thus, for four years Wright’s bob design for Michelle Obama’s hair, with slight variations in style, has garnered attention at state dinners, trips abroad and other appearances since it first debuted at the Democratic National Convention in 2008.

Michelle Obama hit the stage of the Democratic National Convention earlier this month to make a case to the American people for her husband’s re-election. Along with a speech, which won rave reviews from political pundits and commentators, the always-fashionable first lady made a statement with her look. Details from her dress’ designer to her nail polish color have since been revealed, but only Michelle Obama’s hair stylist, Johnny Wright, has the secret to her lovely locks.
RELATED: President Obama and the first lady visit ‘The View’
“I tell people a woman’s hair is the first thing you hear before she speaks,” Wright said over the summer in an interview with theGrio before the convention. “Whether a woman is taking care of home or running a Fortune 500 company, her hair should be a unique expression of her personality.”
Mrs. Obama’s look for the DNC speech proved just that. From the very beginning, viewers at home were commenting on the first lady’s appearance, and her hair was the crowning glory of Michelle’s iconic style. On Twitter, comments averaged more than 28,000 tweets per minute for the 25 minutes that she appeared on stage with many wondering what designer she was wearing — Tracy Reese — and the shade and manufacturer of her nail polish (“Vogue” by Artistic Nail Design).
Gospel singer Vicki Winans also tweeted a question about the first lady’s hairdo that was probably on many minds: “Ok who flat-ironed Michelle Obama’s HAIR? Sheesh! It’s gorgeous!”
It is likely that the person responsible for her loose curls that evening was Johnny Wright. (TheGrio reached out to Wright for confirmation, but with the election in full swing, the Obama insider is keeping mum in keeping with White House protocol.)
Wright has been styling the first lady’s tresses since Barack Obama was a presidential candidate. From Chicago and a family of hairdressers, he has been in the business since he was a child. At 12, Wright says he had over 100 regular clients that would come to the makeshift parlor his parents built in their basement for his signature updos and finger waves. In 2008, he got a call from his agent to style a senator’s wife for an Essence magazine shoot. Wright said that he and Mrs. Obama hit it off immediately and after Barack Obama became president, she asked him to move to D.C. permanently to style her hair.
Wight told theGrio that styling Michelle Obama’s hair involves the application of both his conservative and edgy approaches. In preparation for the job, he also looked to examples of first ladies past for inspiration. “A lot of articles written about [Hillary Clinton] talked about how indecisive she was,” he said. “And they thought that because she changed her hair frequently in office… I immediately understood the value of having a silhouette that people recognize.”
Thus, for four years Wright’s bob design for Michelle Obama’s hair, with slight variations in style, has garnered attention at state dinners, trips abroad and other appearances since it first debuted at the Democratic National Convention in 2008.

But we can follow some of her hair stylist's free advice. Johnny Wright, stylist to the First Lady, shared these tips with InStyle: 1. Use the right tools. Use a ceramic round brush for textured hair and a rubber-based brush for fine hair. 2. Deep condition. True shine starts at the root. Deep condition to soften and nourish the hair shaft every time you shampoo. There's no such thing as too much deep conditioning.

 3. Give your hair a rest. If you style it a lot and use lots of products, keep your hair down and natural one day to give your cuticles a chance to flatten and rebond to the hair shaft. Your hair will be stronger and shinier. 4. Ponytails are posh. A ponytail can go from day to night if it's done right. Make it more elegant by wrapping a strand of hair around the elastic or part your hair on the side before gathering it all at the base of your neck. 5. Use the right elastic. Wright likes Goody colored elastics. Match the band to your hair color—it's an easy way to make a style look elegant. For more tips, see Michelle Obama's Style.

StyleBlazer Exclusive: Michelle Obama’s Hairstylist Johnny Wright Talks Natural Hair And The ‘Bangs Heard Round the World’ 

February 28, 2014 by Crystal Tate 







PreviousNextEven if you are unfamiliar with celebrity hairstylist Johnny Wright, you are certainly familiar with his most famous client, Michelle Obama. Wright began exclusively styling the First Lady’s hair right after President Barack Obama took office and the rest is history! We recently chatted with the SoftSheen-Carson spokesperson to find out how he got his start, his thoughts on the natural hair phenomenon and who he thinks has the best hair, besides FLOTUS of course. Keep reading to see what he had to share!


StyleBlazer: We hear you’ve been styling hair since you were a teenager! What made you initially want to enter the hair industry?
Johnny Wright: My grandmother. My grandmother started doing hair when she was 19 years old and she was doing hair until she was 91 years old and she passed at 93 so I was pulled under her wing. She was doing hair at the house and had salons. She had a client that was coming to her before my mother was born so she’s had clients for over 70 years. She was taught under Madam C. J. Walker. She inspired what I’m doing today and the majority of the reason why I love the industry so much is because of my grandmother, Minnie Brown. I started out in Chicago when I was 12 years old and then moved to LA in 2007.


SB: Were you already doing Michelle Obama’s hair in Chicago or did you meet her after?
JW: She had a hairstylist she was going to since she was 17 and his name is Ronnie Flowers so he was the one who was her hairstylist but I was supposed to do her several times throughout the year for different reasons. Initially I did her hair for an Essence magazine photo shoot, this was during the campaign right when they first announced they were running. Two months later, I did it for O magazine and you would see articles inside about her because of her being a senator’s wife, and at that time I had moved to Los Angeles. We continued the relationship because she was in Los Angeles pretty often with the campaign. When she was in town, she called me so she could be camera ready. It all really changed for the 2008 Democratic National Convention. It was in Denver but I was in Los Angeles and I don’t think Ronnie was available for the whole week so they called and asked me to be with her in Denver. The night of her speech was the first time I did her hair from start to finish. Prior to that, I would only keep her camera ready, her hair was always shampooed, it was always dried, and it already had a cut but I was just keeping her camera ready and keeping her fresh for the camera. But that night I did her hair from start to finish, and then the next morning, everybody was talking about her hair.
SB: That is such a cool story! And that was the night of the Democratic National Convention?
JW: Yes, of course her speech was powerful, I don’t want to take away from that at all but at the same time, people did notice a shift in her hair. I called it a different stroke of the brush.
SB: That’s an amazing and inspiring story. So since then you have been her main stylist?
JW: I didn’t actually become her main stylist until President Obama took office. Not too far after they won the election, I got a call from her staff that I should come down to her for a Vogue shoot in D.C. I was in L.A. at the time so I ended up doing it and at that shoot, that’s when she asked me would I be willing to work with her full time and that was January 2009.
SB: Nice! So Michelle Obama’s hair makes headlines every year. In 2013, it was all about the bangs. What has been her favorite hairstyle so far?
  JW: I can’t answer that question, that’s personal.
SB: OK! Moving on, 2013 was all about the bangs, people across America were taking her picture to their hairstylists to recreate the look.
JW: Yeah I know. It was crazy.
SB: It was crazy, I really think the bangs was the hairstyle heard around the world.
  JW: I always tell people it was the bang heard ’round the world.
SB: Exactly! It literally was, I love that. So she retired the bangs, what can we expect from her for 2014?
JW: I don’t know. (Laughs) I never ask and I never answer any of those questions because those are all personal to the First Lady. All of those type of things would have to be a surprise. I have no idea, we don’t plan things out, that’s just not the process. Even the bangs, it was like a thing that we just did and we didn’t know there was going to be such an impact.
SB: Right now I feel like natural hair has become the premiere thing as far as hair is concerned. What do you think of the natural hair movement? Is it here to stay or is it a fad?
JW: I think it’s amazing, and I hope it’s here to stay. I mean, you never know if it’s just a fad. The thing about it is new products are being developed every year and people like to try things out with their hair and if there’s an amazing product that straightens the hair and it’s not damaging and has no chemicals, then that may become a trend too. What I think about natural hair, I think it’s awesome. I mean the thing that Curly Nikki is doing and the blog Rock Yo Rizos is great. It’s something people are really starting to embrace and what I think is so great about it is you’re able to have that versatility. You can wear your hair straight sometimes, you can wear your hair curly sometimes but you can only get the curly aspect if your hair is natural. I think that’s what’s so good about it, I think products sell more, companies developing products that are for natural hair…like with me, I’ve been working with SoftSheen-Carson for the past 11 years, we have a new product line called Au Naturale which is amazing for those women who are trying to adapt and understand their natural hair texture and highly textured hair and we have products that are helping them keep their hair moisturized, because people don’t understand that natural hair can be very dry if it isn’t conditioned and treated properly with the right products. So that’s what Au Naturale is all about.
It’s all about versatility and women use their hair as an accessory and to be able to change it up just as much as they change their jewelry or their shoes. I think that’s what women with natural hair are also doing. The thing about it is we really have to dig deep and really try to figure out what is the issue that we have with our natural hair, you know, a lot of this, stems from way back in the day when we were told that texture is not proper, it’s not professional, you need to look this way or try straight hair, it’s unacceptable. So I think women have just started to embrace their hair texture and embrace who they really are as a part of their movement.


SB: I feel like natural hair products are something women are much more interested in as of lately. Can you share tips on using the right hair care products?
  JW: There are products out there that are made, like Au Naturale, for natural hair care. I think that’s the best option because it’s going to keep the natural texture in mind. I think as long as the product is moisturizing and conditioning your highly textured hair, that’s what’s most important. A lot of times those natural hair care products will cater to ingredients that will keep that curl moisturized. You want to lengthen the curls that are there but still maintain the shape, or help define the curls and natural hair care products are going to do that. They’re the best choice for natural hair care.

SB: What about styling tools? What are the do’s and don’ts?
JW: The only tool that I use is Corioliss. It’s a product that I’ve been using for the past five years now and the reason I love this tool so much is because the plates are made of titanium and the titanium plates are much gentler on the hair. First, it’s really because of the temperature control you have with this iron. Most flat irons or curling irons can either be turned on or off. When you do straighten your hair, you don’t want to have the temperature on the highest level offered. You want to bring it down a little bit, just enough to get it straight but not to the point where it’s damaging your hair. What people don’t understand is heat does the same thing to your hair that chemicals do to your hair but it’s over time. So if you constantly keep styling your hair and if you keep using the highest temperature that that iron offers, you are going to be straightening the hair out and you’ll lose your curl pattern. 


SB: What’s the benchmark?
JW: I think you should start as low as possible, and see if you’re able to get your hair straight with that. If not, gradually go up and see if you can get your hair straight. You should never have to get to 450 degrees which is too high. 
SB: That makes sense. So we’re in a new year and spring will be here before we know it! What do you predict will be the big hair trends for 2014?
JW: One thing I am noticing is that a lot of women are going darker for spring this year. Normally they tend to go lighter, but they’re going darker, think warm reds, and deeper blondes so that’s one of the trends and people don’t want their hair perfectly coifed, they want approachable hair. That is definitely in now, not too structured, not too perfectly combed, just a little tousled, just kind of like you did it yourself. Even with natural hair texture, wearing it big and curly, afros are definitely coming back in a different way. You see a lot of highly textured hair and a lot of curly hair, highly textured hair that’s styled and it really makes that impression, it’s getting a lot of attention. You’re starting to see it in the workplace now so people aren’t seeing it as unprofessional now.
SB: I think that people love the whole big, curly afro look. Let’s say your hair isn’t long enough to get the fro so you have to resort to adding a piece or a wig. Do you approve?
JW: Absolutely. I love extensions and adding things to your hair to change up your hairstyle. Another thing you can do are straw sets. They give you that texture, they make your hair thicker and they last a long time. It takes a while to actually do one so once it’s done you’re going to be happy and it’s going to last a long time. I do think if it’s a wig, it’s all fun. What’s wrong with sew-ins and some highly textured hair? You could rock an afro for a couple of weeks and then you can take it out and you’re back to yourself. There is nothing wrong with that.
SB: Besides Michelle, if you had to pick one person who has the best hair who would you choose?
JW:  I can’t say best hair because that’s wrong. Everyone’s hair is good. 
SB: OK, best hairstyle?
JW: There’s nobody who’s my favorite right now honestly.
SB: Best hair color or best hair cut?
JW: I’m loving Tamron Hall from the “Today” show, I love those short hair cuts. I also love anything that Rihanna does. She’s a trendsetter with anything she does.
SB: Is there anything you have coming up for 2014 that we should be on the look out for?
JW: Always be on the look out for stuff from me, I always have my hands and feet into something. There will be a lot of surprises coming from me in 2014.

He called natural hair a fad because he sewed a few tracks in the FLOTUS’ hair. I’m from chicago and I remember the before. Her hair is thick but weak. The old stylist tried to do her natural hair and this guy gave her a weave. The bangs were a full sewin weave with a bang. She had the same weave as Nikki Minaj but styled professionally and cut at the shoulder. She’s a nice lady and all. This is nothing against Michelle LaVergne but a weave is a weave. That’s a classic Chicago weave.

I so appreciate everything which all members of the First Lady’s style and design team do to create such BEAUTIFUL image of a black woman on an international stage.  Two thumbs up to them all, and this guy sounds super-classy and professional.  Great job all around.

Michelle Obama's Hairstylist Dishes On Her Highlights And Vacation Hair

Johnny Wright has been tight-lipped about Michelle Obama since becoming her official hairstylist back in 2009. But now he's finally opening up about what it's really like to style the first lady.
Wright joined HuffPost Live host Nancy Redd and Essence magazine editor-in-chief Vanessa Bush for a segment on Monday where they reminisced about his first encounter with FLOTUS (which happened to be for an Essence photo shoot) and how their relationship has "groomed him as a man and professional."
While Wright has styled Obama's hair in a variety of looks over the years, including blunt bangs and face-framing layers, one of his favorite styles are her highlights. 
Together with Frederic Fekkai colorist Daniel Villano, they've created a look that Wright says complements Obama's features. We couldn't agree more, as the caramel hue brightens up her complexion and brown eyes. 
Wright also answered the question that we've been yearning to know: Is FLOTUS natural or does she chemically straighten her hair? According to her mane man, she's "100 percent natural and it's all about using great products."
And now that the Obamas are on vacation in Martha's Vineyard, Wright revealed that the first lady will simply use conditioner and pull her hair back into a ponytail. "It's no fuss. She doesn't want to glam up in August," he said.
Watch the clip above for more hair secrets from Michelle Obama's hairstylist and to find out who's taking care of Malia and Sasha's locks.

 Michelle recently dished to the Loose Women that her wedding preparations have been going smoothly so far despite having to table plan for 200 people. When asked if Mark was interfering and annoying Michelle, she said: "No I'm not getting the hump, I'm saying thank you very much! "I'm the most disorganised person you'll ever meet and Mark's the opposite. So it's balancing quite well."

 Andrea Mclean said that it's often the bride's prerogative to want to control the wedding plans but Michelle joked: "I'm like 'thank god he's involved', I need help. "So you know what it's been working really well, and there hasn't been any arguments yet. Well there is the table planning tonight..."

Q & A With Michelle Wright








I recently sat down with Michelle Wright and had a Q and A session for OTL.  Michelle, in my opinion, is one of the best cigar reps in the business and is extremely well versed in the business and pleasure of cigars.  

How did you get involved in the cigar business?

I started in the cigar industry over 12 years ago.  I had a friend who owned a shop on Hilton Head Island, SC.  

He had a trip planned to go to Nicaragua and asked me to run his shop for the 2 weeks as a favor. It was a great 2 weeks... The shop had record setting sales and I had the best 2 weeks working. After he came back he asked me to stay on and work...I ended up working my way up to managing the shop and then became a part owner.   After 6 years there I moved back to Texas and worked retail at a Cigar shop on the North side of Houston, and ran the shop in the evenings. 

I had gone to IPCPR in 2012 and was asked to work as a consultant for a brand new shop in Alpharetta, Georgia that was in need of some help getting started.  It was a temporary assignment but the money was too good to pass up. I left Houston and went to Georgia for a few months.  I handled all the Marketing for the shop, as well as worked in the shop.  I trained the staff , ordered product and built a great events calendar through my contacts in the business.   After my assignment ended, I came back to Texas without a job...so Repping cigars was the next move and a natural fit.   I started representing one company and quickly discovered that Repping independently was not going to pay the bills unless I added more lines.  My business as an Independent Cigar Broker has taken off and I haven't looked back since!




How many different brands are you a representative for?

I represent 5 Boutique Cigar brands and also rep a National accessories line, which I rep along side of my cigars as it goes hand in hand.

Does being a representative require you hold any type of certifications?  If so,how long did ago you get certified and how important is your certification to what you do?

I do not have any certifications. Just 12 years of solid hands on experience.  

As a rep, when introducing your brand to a potential shop what are some of the things that you look for in that shop?

I look for what my shop owner needs to meet the demands and needs of his clientele and make all my lines available to all the shops I work with. 

How long have you smoked cigars?

I started smoking cigars when I started working retail in a cigar shop over 12 years ago. 

What is your favorite type of cigar and why?

I have evolved thru the years. I enjoy a wide variety of blends but I have really come to love medium-full  body cigars and have a lot of favorites. 

How do you rate the Houston cigar scene and lounges versus other areas?

Houston is in my opinion a cigar smokers Mecca and in Houston we have so many educated and experienced smokers.  I see a lot of the true smokers at certain shops but a lot of them travel around and frequent multiple shops in the area.   The lounges in Houston are wonderful and there are so many great ones in Houston to choose from.  I think the shops in other areas are great too but the seats in the lounges are not filled up like they are here in HTown. 

What tips or advice do you have for new smokers?

I would recommend starting off mild and non flavored.  Go with a Connecticut wrapper, for the most part and let your local retailer guide you as you build your palette. Keeping track of what you like and making notes is also a good idea. Names, bands and cigars look all alike to a rookie and if you had a cigar that you like its good to be able to walk in to the cigar shop knowing  what it was that worked for you. It will help the staff in making suggestions for other brands if you can identify what you have smoked and liked a lot. 

Are there any new or boutique cigars that you recommend?

Of course!  I am all about boutique brands. I would suggest my brands to start. They are 7-20-4, Valeroso, Sosa Cigars, La Hoja and Felix Assouline. Another great cigar that's just come out on the scene is Cabal cigars. 

How do you feel about cigar ratings and does the rating influence your choices in what you smoke?

Ratings are a blessing and a great way to promote a brand.  I personally do not rely on them because I like to try smokes based on what people personally recommend. 

What is your favorite drink and cigar pairing and why?

I like vanilla coke with Maduro wrappers and drink bourbon with any cigars.  

Are there any must have products that you recommend?

A quality cutter and lighter is essential. 

What is next for you in the cigar world?

To continue to build my brands in Texas and expand to eventually have reps that work with me as my portfolio of brands continues to grow.  Eventually I will look to blend, and make my own line. 

If you could only smoke one cigar what would it be and why?

It would be a Brazilian wrapper.  I could smoke the 7-20-4 Original blend every single day, for the rest of my life!
