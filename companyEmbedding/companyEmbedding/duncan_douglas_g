Article excerpt

  "Prediction is a very difficult art, especially with respect to the future."    MARK TWAIN    I RECEIVE A LOT OF PHONE CALLS FROM REPORTERS AND CITIZENS ASKING WHETHER THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO BUY A HOUSE. While it sounds a little evasive, the correct answer is, "Yes, if you can afford it." The point is, it is very difficult to forecast interest rates with any degree of accuracy. Therefore, the consumer is well-advised to consider his or her current financial condition and housing needs or wants, and then if at current market interest rates he or she can afford the desired house, buy it.    * If rates go up, the upside risk has been covered (assuming the use of a fixed-rate mortgage). If rates go down, the ease of refinancing offers a relatively low-cost way to reduce the monthly cost of ownership.    * "So, is this a good time to buy?" comes the follow-up. The remarkable economy is showing some signs of weakness. How serious are these signs? What do they mean for the home-buying public? How will they affect the nature, quality and quantity of mortgage debt, current and future? What do these facts portend for mortgage bankers?    Let's take a look at the current signs of weakness in the economy, see how weak it actually is and try to see what the near future holds. The recent--and even not-so-recent--past has been so good that it is easy to overstate the case of this current difficulty.    A quick glance at Figure 1 shows why people are using the term "new economy" when describing our current economic expansion. With the exception of three quarters in 1990--1991, we have been in an economic expansion since the fourth quarter of 1982. The current expansion phase which began in the second quarter of 1991 has run for 117 consecutive months, and we are not forecasting an end to it anytime soon.    The line at the 4 percent level on Figure 1 represents the economic growth rate that many economists have believed for a long time could not be exceeded without generating inflation, especially in a period of low unemployment. While it is not shown here, a similar chart of the rate of unemployment with a line at 4 percent would show that unemployment has recently been sustained at or below that level simultaneous to the high level of economic growth. This was thought to be a ticket to the inflation party.    Yet, a look at Figure 2 shows that this period when gross domestic product (GDP) has exceeded the 4 percent level concurrently with unemployment at or below 4 percent has not been inflationary. In fact, throughout this period, inflation has been stable to falling. This is really unprecedented in the modern U.S. economy, and has led to a lot of discussion about whether the fundamental structure of the economy has changed.    While labor costs have risen in the last several quarters, labor productivity rose strongly as well (see Figure 3). The third quarter of 2000 nonfarm business productivity registered 3.3 percent annualized rate, which was off somewhat from the 3.9 percent and 5.3 percent of the first and second quarters in 2000, but was up substantially from the 1974-1992 period.    The recent dramatic increase in productivity has largely offset the increases in labor costs as the increased wages and benefits can be viewed as payment to labor for additional output per hour worked. Thus, the concern that "cost-push" inflation would emerge from the tight labor market has been assuaged by high productivity levels.    Rather than a new economy, I view this as the old economy having had a cardiovascular "event" in the late 1970s (stagflation). That event led to installation of a rigorous new exercise and dietary regimen (early 1980s' fundamental tax and regulatory reform). The exercise program subsequently was upgraded through newly available and more effective exercise equipment (technology investment). Furthermore, this all took place in an environment that saw a dramatic lowering of the fences that kept out others who wanted to exercise (globalization of the U. …

By Duncan, Douglas G.; Warnock, Veronica Cacdac

Article excerpt

  Compared with record production last year, the 2003 Mortgage Bankers Association forecast calls for $1.77 trillion in residential production. Rising rates and a falloff in refinancing spell the difference. The economy is the more intriguing topic. Here, the outlook calls for an improvement in unemployment and genuine signs of recovery despite uncertainty over Iraq.    THE MORTGAGE MARKET SHOULD EXPERIENCE A THIRD CONSECUTIVE YEAR OF STRONG PRODUCTION IN 2003--BUT NOT AT THE TSUNAMI LEVEL OF 2002. In fact, 2003 should be the third strongest origination year on record, following 2002 and 2001. The economy--in slow motion for much of 2002--Should be in a healthy recovery by the second half of 2003.    The rebounding economy should lead interest rates slightly higher and slow refinancing but keep the purchase market strong as employment picks up. Still, our economic recovery faces major risks.    The economy in 2003    The elements appear to be in place for a self-sustaining recovery. We expect the economic recovery to gain broader footing in 2003, and in the second half to have significant momentum.    Our view is that gross domestic product (GDP) growth should accelerate through the year, with growth in the second half of 2003 at 3.4 percent in real terms or near its long-term capacity in a noninflationary manner (see Figure 1). If this scenario plays out, we expect the Fed to reverse course around midyear and begin raising short-term rates. This will be evidence that the recovery has legs, and the longer-term Treasury market probably will already reflect that fact with gently rising rates.    First, the bad news    As we close 2002, the manufacturing sector is still struggling to get back on its feet. The Institute for Supply Management's PMI, an index of manufacturing activity, shows that earlier in 2002 the manufacturing sector was recovering from the recession but then it stalled again beginning in September (see Figure 2). An index exceeding 50 percent connotes an expansion, while below that indicates a contraction for the manufacturing sector.    A recovery in manufacturing awaits the re-emergence of corporate profits. Growth in corporate profits proved disappointing in 2002. Before-tax profits rose 1.6 percent in the third quarter of 2002, after a rise of 2.9 percent in the second quarter and 6.7 percent in the first quarter. Taking into account depreciation and inventory valuation, however, profits fell in each of those quarters.    For example, a significant share of recent durable goods purchases by consumers has been encouraged by zero-percent financing and other price concessions being offered by the auto industry. Unless these concessions are replaced by higher profits, we will not see new investment pick up.    Surveys of corporate executives indicate a concern about the impact on economic activity of an impending war with Iraq. Such concern seems to be leading to postponement of investment--a fact reflected in the low level of business fixed investment. Nonresidential construction, in serious recession, probably also has been adversely affected by the absence of terrorism insurance until recently when the problem was addressed by legislation passed by Congress and signed by President George W Bush.    Investor uncertainty over the accuracy of corporate financial reporting is another major factor contributing to economic weakness. A number of high-profile cases of restatement of past profits shook investor confidence. While legislation was passed and signed to address corporate accounting accuracy, there remains additional need for clarity of financial reporting to fully restore investor confidence. This, combined with the effects of the recession, caused a significant decline in the stock market, simultaneously raising the equity cost of capital and widening the risk premiums in the high-yield bond market. In both cases, this made the cost of fixed investment very high and impeded its recovery. …

                    From Products To Finance
                

                    Two years ago Douglas Duncan started Global Lending Services, a company that is now on the path to becoming a national player in that segment.

Douglas Duncan leveraged the relationships and expertise gained from two decades in the F&I products business to start a subprime finance company. Two years later, Global Lending Services is on the path to becoming a national player in that segment.
In 2011, Douglas Duncan was at a crossroads. More than two decades earlier, he had founded Safe-Guard Products International LLC. With the help of a dedicated team of executives, including his brother, David Duncan, and a nationwide network of agents and dealers, Atlanta-based Safe-Guard had grown to become an industry leader.
With David at the helm as president, Douglas sold the last of his shares and started looking for a new challenge. At the time, capital was flowing back into the auto finance market after all but grinding to a halt just a few years earlier. He saw an opportunity to start a subprime finance company, and he knew he had a built-in advantage.
“We leveraged the agent channel pretty heavily,” Douglas says. “The agents we do business with have a close relationship with their dealers. In many cases, they’re responsible for the success of the F&I department.”
Two years and several rounds of capitalizations later, Duncan’s new company, Global Lending Services LLC (GLS), has already established itself as a player in the subprime market.
GETTING FUNDED
The summer of 2012 brought a series of announcements from the new company. Duncan assembled a team of experienced auto finance executives and formed a partnership with an investment firm. That deal allowed GLS to acquire Resurgent Auto Finance, an established subprime lender with a $38 million portfolio.
Resurgent was only doing business in four Southern states, but Duncan saw great potential in the company’s funding platform. By April of this year, GLS expanded into 15 additional states, and Duncan expects to be in all 50 before long.
“We funded the business with a lot of equity. That allows us to structure significant debt agreements,” he says, noting that the amount of capital now available for subprime loans is mostly based on the performance of those portfolios in the assetbacked securities (ABS) market.
“The smart money’s going to subprime,” Duncan says.
MAKING DEALS
Agents are certified to represent GLS and educate dealers on the intricacies of the com- pany’s program. The initial introduction is followed by a 60-, 90- or 120-day “ramp-up” of applications and funded deals; meanwhile, the agent follows up regularly to check their progress. The company’s roster now includes several hundred dealers in 19 states and hundreds of deals funded each month.
Duncan describes the current subprime lending space as “very competitive” and says some lenders are buying deals they probably shouldn’t. “Our look-to-book ratio is a bit
lower than I probably would like in normal times, but it’s so competitive right now that I’m not bothered,” he says.
Duncan’s roots on the F&I product side are evident at GLS. Every deal is preapproved for a vehicle service contract and GAP insurance; neither is exclusive to SafeGuard’s offering. “The dealer is dependent upon that income,” Duncan says. “It’s just common sense to allow for a VSC.”
SETTING STANDARDS
As the company continues to expand and enter new states, Duncan says the focus will remain on the dealer. He wants to establish long-lasting relationships between GLS, agents and dealers. To that end, GLS has developed a program called GLS Subprime Retail Strategy. It is designed to develop and train the people manning the dealership’s subprime department. The goal, Duncan says, is to build a relationship that extends beyond the traditional finance source-to- dealer relationship.
Driving the company’s strategy will be Steve Thibodeau, who was hired in May as the company’s new CEO. He comes from Capital One, where he held a number of executive positions since 2000, including managing vice president of the company’s auto finance division servicing operations and its sales and originations business unit.
He was there, Duncan notes, when Capital One purchased Dallas-based Sum- mit Acceptance Corp. and grew its portfolio from $200 million to more than $25 billion. “We have a very experienced and talented executive team, and Steve is going to make us even better.”

Show moreFood You want to feed your family healthy food, but making the best choices can be difficult, especially if you're on a budget or short on time   or if you or any members of your family have special dietary needs. Fortunately, Walmart makes it easy to plan meals and stock up on delicious and nutritious food that is also affordable. Barbecue essentials Anytime is a great time to fire up the barbecue. Grab some hot dogs, hamburgers, steaks, chops, corn on the cob and whatever else you like to grill and get ready for a fun food fest. Of course, barbecue essentials don't necessarily need to be cooked on a grill. Don't forget the: Chips and snacks, like pistachios and mixed nuts, almonds and snack crackers Dips and spreads, including salsa, guacamole and black bean dip Side dishes of rice, mac and cheese and pasta salad beans and chili Condiments, like ketchup, mustard, mayo and more You'll also find Walmart's lowest prices on picnic items like paper plates, napkins, plastic cups, plasticware and more, should you want to take your meal to the great outdoors. Beverages From water and juice to coffee, beer and wine, you'll find a wide variety of delicious and refreshing beverages at Walmart, all at Every Day Low Prices. Explore the varied selection of juices, where you'll find common favorites like apple, orange and cranberry juice as well as mixed fruit and vegetable juices and much more. Browse the soft drinks: colas, root beer, cream soda, fruit sodas and more in both standard and sugar-free varieties, including options from popular brands such as Coca Cola, Pepsi and A&W. If you've been exercising, try sports drinks, like Gatorade, to keep yourself hydrated and maybe a caffeinated energy drink to keep yourself going throughout the day. There is also a large selection of hot beverages, including coffee, tea and hot cocoa, plus adult beverages, including beer, wine and spirits. To turn an ordinary glass of water into a more appealing beverage, consider powdered drink mixes and drink enhancers, which come in a wide range of flavors and include diet and fortified options featuring vitamins and electrolytes. Healthy options Are you confused by all the nutritional information that's available? Walmart's Great For You products feature a simple icon that lets you know you're choosing a healthy item. That includes lots of the foods nutritionists say people should get more of, including fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds and lean meats. It's also easy to find foods that meet special requirements. Simply filter your grocery searches by dietary need and you'll find products that are: Gluten free Sugar free Sodium free Fat free Nut free Dairy free There are also natural, organic, vegetarian, kosher and halal options. Walmart makes it easier to find the foods you want while simultaneously meeting your dietary requirements. No matter what type of special diet you are looking for, there are options that will help you make the right food choices day in and day out. Organic foods If you prefer to feed your family with natural or organic foods, enjoy Walmart's inventory of organic delights, which are made without artificial ingredients; they're grown without synthetic pesticides or chemical fertilizers. A food is labeled as organic by the way farmers grow and process their agricultural products, like different meats, fruits, vegetables, grains and dairy products. Organic farming practices are created to promote soil and water conservation and also to reduce pollution. The farmers who grow organic produce don't use what would be considered conventional methods to fertilize and control weeds. For example, organic farming practices would include the use of natural fertilizers to feed the soil and plants, while using crop rotation or mulch to manage the weeds. So what makes a product organic for certain? The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) established a certification program that requires all organic-labeled foods to meet strict government standards first. These standards regulate how such foods are grown, handled and processed. Thus, any product labeled as organic must be USDA certified. You could look through a variety of foods and check for the organic label on each one, but it s a much easier shopping process when everything can be found together, in one convenient location. Whatever your dietary goals or requirements are, you can easily find foods that meet your needs at Walmart. Just filter your search by dietary need and you'll find a large selection of delicious foods. Save Money.
