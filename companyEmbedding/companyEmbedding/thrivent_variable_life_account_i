Never too early to save 
Retirement may seem far away, but it sneaks up fast. Annuities may help make saving for your retirement goals manageable.










Supplement your savings 
Some annuities offer guarantees to help you create balance among the assets you've earmarked for your retirement.1










Rejoice in retirement 
Kids grown? Mortgage paid off? Annuities may help provide the income you need to retire your way.












What is an annuity?
 

It's an investment product that provides an income stream for the future, usually after retirement. The two main types of annuities are deferred and immediate.
 
 










Immediate Annuities
If you're looking for a way to transform an amount of money  – like an inheritance or IRA rollover – into income that can last the rest of  your life, consider an immediate annuity.
						

Several       income payout options.
Payouts       begin immediately.
May       pay a death benefit to the people or causes you care about.

See more 






Deferred Annuities
Deferred annuities may help you achieve your retirement  savings goals. You won't pay income taxes until you start taking money out and  you get a minimum guaranteed interest rate on fixed annuities. You can choose  how and when to receive your income from several payout options, including  lifetime income.

Options to lock in a future income stream – now or later.

See more 










Additional options to consider
In addition to picking an immediate or deferred payment structure, there are also fixed and variable annuity options to consider.









Fixed: How it works
Fixed annuities earn interest at a set rate. Every fixed annuity has a current interest rate and a minimum guaranteed interest rate. The current interest rate is usually declared on an annual basis.





Advantages
Fixed annuities are not affected by ups and downs in the market. Plus, they also guarantee a minimum interest rate.






Drawbacks
Since fixed annuities are credited interest at a set rate, it is possible that the value of the annuity will not keep pace with inflation.













Variable: How it works
Variable annuities earn investment returns based on the performance of the subaccounts chosen.





Advantages
Because  funds are invested in variable subaccounts, they may keep up with – or even  outpace – inflation.






Drawbacks
Investments  are subject to market fluctuations, so a variable annuity is riskier and can  lose principalMore Information.

Annuities are intended to be long term, particularly for retirement. Product availability and features may vary by state.
Withdrawals and surrenders will decrease the value of your annuity and, subsequently, the income you receive. Any withdrawals in excess of 10% may be subject to a surrender charge. The taxable portion of each annuity distribution is subject to income taxation. If a taxpayer is younger than 59½ at the time of distribution, a 10% federal tax penalty will apply to the taxable portion of the distribution unless a penalty-tax exception applies.
Investing in a variable annuity involves risk,  including the possible loss of principal.

Past performance does not guarantee future results. Annualized total returns reflect the change in unit price, the reinvestment of all dividends and capital gains, and the effects of compounding. Since performance varies, the annualized total return, which assumes a steady rate of growth, differs from the subaccount's actual total return for the time period indicated. These returns reflect all recurring fees that are charged to contract owners and represent past performance. Both the investment return and the principal value of an investment fluctuate so that units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original investment. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted.
These returns do not include the annual administrative charge of $30 deducted from any W-BC-FPVA(02) contract if (a) the Accumulated Value of the Contract on the Contract Anniversary is less than $15,000, (b) the sum of premiums paid on, less all surrenders made from, the Contract is less than $15,000, and (c) the sum of premiums paid, less all surrenders made during the Contract Year just ended is less than $2,400. Inclusion of the administrative charge would reduce the total return figures shown. These figures do not include the cost of optional living or death benefits. Inclusion of the cost of additional benefits would reduce the total return figures shown. Periods less than one year are not annualized. Subaccount total return calculations assume an initial investment of $10,000. At various times, the adviser has contractually or voluntarily reimbursed Portfolio expenses. Had the adviser not done so, the total returns would have been lower. This reimbursement of expenses may be discontinued at any time. See the Variable Series Fund, Inc. prospectus for more information. Call 800-THRIVENT or visit www.thrivent.com for more current performance results.
Non-standardized. Annualized total returns are based on the change in unit values at the subaccount level for the time period mentioned. Expenses included are the current mortality and expense risk charge of 1.10% and applicable annual operating Portfolio expenses ranging from [0.36% to 1.50%]. (The maximum annual operating expenses would be 0.36% to 1.80% without reimbursement.) Standardized calculation was used; however, neither annual administrative charges or surrender charges have been included. If they had been included, the quoted performance would have been lower.
Standardized. "If surrendered" values reflect surrender charges applied during the first seven years. These charges are 7 percent in the first contract year, and decrease by 1 percent each subsequent year until they are zero. Up to 10% of your accumulated value may be withdrawn each contract year without a surrender charge and is reflected in the calculation of performance. Expenses that were included are the maximum mortality and expense risk charge of 1.10% and net annual Portfolio operating expenses ranging from 0.36% to 1.50%. (The maximum annual Portfolio operating expenses would be [0.36% to 1.80% without reimbursement.) Annual expenses are subject to change.

Member FINRA. Member SIPC.
Investing in a variable annuity contract involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. More complete information on the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the variable annuity contract and underlying investment options is included in the prospectus, which investors should read and consider carefully before investing. Prospectuses are available from a Thrivent Financial representative or at www.thrivent.com.

Originally created as an aid organization for members of the Lutheran Church, Thrivent Financial has grown to become a major financial planning option that recently opened to all Christian denominations. As a non-profit organization, Thrivent operates differently from many financial institutions and is the largest fraternal benefit organization in the country.
Thrivent Financial Summary
In 1902, after several years of planning, The Aid Association for Lutherans in Wisconsin and Other States received a charter and began operations in Appleton, Wisconsin. Up until the 1960s, membership was limited to those who were members of a particular Lutheran denomination, the Missouri Synod, and Lutherans in fellowship. In the 1960s membership was opened to all Lutherans, and not until 2014 was it opened to Christians of any denomination.
Thrivent Financial was officially formed in 2002 with the merger of the original Aid Association for Lutherans and the Lutheran Brotherhood, another non-profit organization. The organization today is a Fortune 500 company offering a range of long-term planning insurance and financial products to members.
As a fraternal organization, Thrivent has over 1,400 chapters (although these are legally called lodges, Thrivent does not use this term). Each chapter makes local decisions on use of resources to provide aid to their communities. Among their charitable works, Thrivent supports Habitat for Humanity and sponsors scholarships.
Currently, Thrivent offers a range of products that includes life insurance, disability and long-term care insurance, Medicare supplement insurance, mutual funds, and annuities.




Products
Thrivent provides products intended to help members prepare for the future, including a few insurance products as well as retirement planning.
Life Insurance
Thrivent writes both term and permanent life insurance products. The website provides a life insurance calculator as well as online quoting to help members determine who much coverage they need and quickly calculate costs.
Term Life products are designed to provide coverage for a specific period of time. Thrivent policies include the option to convert the policy to permanent at the end of the term.
Permanent Life products from Thrivent come in four forms:

Whole Life – guaranteeing death benefits and steady premium payments
Blended Life – combining features of whole and term life insurance to provide long-term coverage that is more budget friendly
Universal Life – allowing flexible premium payments, guaranteed death benefits, and the option to build cash value
Variable Universal Life – flexible payment options and a choice of investment portfolios to build cash value

Other Insurance Products
Thrivent has three additional types of insurance products, all aimed at providing care for the future. The available products are:

Disability Income Insurance – providing financial assistance in the event of a disability
Long-Term Care Insurance – assisting with the financial aspects of long-term health care needs
Medicare Supplement Insurance – helping cover medical costs that are not provided for under Medicare plans

Retirement Planning
Annuities
Thrivent offers a range of annuity options to provide a steady income for the future and the present. Both immediate and deferred annuities are available to meet the particular savings and income needs of members.
Retirement Savings
In addition to Annuities, Thrivent also offers other retirement savings products. Both IRA (Individual Retirement Account) and Mutual Fund options are available.
Thrivent offers Traditional and Roth IRA options and a variety of Mutual Funds to choose from. Managed Accounts are available to assist those who want professional guidance in selecting the right financial products and options.
Thrivent Financial Rates
Thrivent is a member-driven non-profit organization, which as a general rule, should point to affordable premiums for their insurance products.
A quick quote on the company website for a 20-year term life insurance policy with a $250,000 death benefit comes back at $25.16 per month for a 30-year-old non-smoking male living in California. That’s a reasonable rate for a relatively long-term policy with a decent death benefit.
As with all life insurance products, rates will vary greatly based on age, health status, and other factors, so it’s important to compare rates carefully based on personal needs.
Thrivent Membership
Thrivent is a membership-based organization, therefore those who wish to purchase their products must become a member. There are two types of membership.
Benefit Member
This level of membership is gained by application and by purchasing a Thrivent insurance product or an annuity product.
Associate Member
This level of membership is gained by application, $19.95 yearly fee, purchasing a product from a Thrivent affiliate, or by joining the Thrivent Credit Union.
Membership is open to Christians, spouses of Christians, and children being raised in the Christian faith. Members have access to a variety of benefits including discounts, fee services, and educational resources.
Consumer Research and Complaints
Thrivent Financial has been Better Business Bureau accredited since 1999 and has an A+ rating, with only eight complaints having been reported in the last three years. Of the eight complaints, two have been closed in the past 12 months.
There are few reviews of Thrivent out there to be found. As with most companies, there are some negative reviews, mainly by people frustrated with procedures. Even these are very minimal, particularly for a company of this size.
The limited number of reviews is possibly based on the fact that the products sold by Thrivent are not those that are dealt with on a regular basis. Life insurance, annuities, and investments are all things people might pay into but not modify often. Unlike other types of insurance, where claims are more common, these types of products can see reduced interaction with customers resulting in less opportunity for a negative experience.

Bottom Line
Thrivent Financial is a good choice for those who need long-term planning insurance and financial products and are seeking a company that matches their personal religious beliefs. As they offer products only to people of the Christian faith, they are obviously not an option for anyone who is not a member of this religious group.
The company has a strong reputation and is financially secure, making them a strong bet for those who do fit the customer profile and who are in search of a different sort of financial services company from the for-profit financial institutions.

My mom just passed away so we called to go over the policies we had from Thrivent.  We were told we would get a call back.  Never received a call.  My husband called again and was told to leave a message and [Redacted] would call back.  No call once again.  I sent an email and there was a generic response, no apology for not calling, nothing.  We are so disappointed with this company and their customer service.  We are now looking to move all of our accounts to another company.  My mom had policies with Vanguard and they went out of their way to help.  Thrivent’s customer service is horrendous.

Thrivent has been harassing my wife for over 3 years for an apparent policy that they claim her parents took out on her when she was 6 months old. The first she knew of any policy is when Thrivent sent a threatening letter demanding payment and had bill collectors calling our home. Both of my wife’s parents have passed and Thrivent claims they had not made all the payments on the policy. Thrivent has refused to correspond with our insurance adviser and declined to send my wife a copy of the policy that they say she is responsible for payments on.
This is a bad company. Do not do business with them.

I would suggest reaching out to a local representative. I find them able to answer my questions and past information you are requesting. I have received nothing but above expectations from our local rep. Best of luck, sounds like a sad situation all around.

After a year of paying out on my mothers Long-Term Nursing Claim, Thrivent has stopped.  They continuously change their minds of what they require within the Plan of Care from the Nursing Home.  This has been going on for 4-5 months now, with at least 6 different versions of the Nursing Plan of Care being submitted.  Not only is this experience frustrating, expensive to now start paying Nursing Home expenses directly, they expect my mother and father to re-start paying the LT Care Premiums while we go through the appeals/Membership Resolution Process.  The Claims Examiners lie/change their minds constantly to avoid paying out!  Lawyer-Up people!   17 Years of paying premiums and now they want more years of premium payments to avoid paying out!  Snakes!

It has taken an escalation to one of three Senior Regional Vice Presidents in the entire company.  This individual reviewed all the information related to my mother claim, supported our justification for her to return “back on claim” and receive payment on her LT Nursing Care Insurance.  I am happy to say this very senior leader was able to reinstate my mother, with all back-invoices (4 – months) paid in less than a week. 
Moral of the story……Escalate jointly with your agent.  The Claims Department and leadership need help in serving their Customers.

Thrivent is the Worst company I’ve ever had to deal with. They are lying [Redacted] who use deceitful business practices. I’ve been waiting a month  for a payout that am told each day will be in my account “Tomorrow”. Customer service and claims people are [Reducted] who duck from accepting calls and keep saying they don’t have what they need to process the claim. The last lie was them saying they didn’t have my checking account info, but they did. In fact, they deducted a fee from my account three days prior. Stay away from Thrivent.

My mom purchased long term care in 2000 and when she needs it, she can’t get it– Thrivent states that a “granddaughter” is IMMEDIATE family and will not pay for immediate family to get paid.  My mom doesn’t want to go into an assisted living or nursing home, she would love to stay in her home where she is comfortable and well taken care of with her own money.  When my mom purchased this piece of paper AAL gave her a book that stated family members can get paid taking care of the insured but…………………  They still continue to make her pay for her piece of paper but won’t take care of her.  It is sad for me that this was a Christian business not taking care of the elderly.  Don’t buy Long Term care–

I’m not currently a Thrivent agent and know nothing about your policy specifics but I will say family typically will not be paid for care, yet in some cases can receive a portion of the benefits paid out. But if she is indeed in need of care, and cannot perform 2 activities of daily living she should qualify to have premiums waived for now. Instead of complaining to the company I recommend speaking to an intelligent agent that specializes in long term care like myself or your current thrivent agent.
Although we wouldn’t be paid to review your policy, it is our job and we’d be happy to do it.
Cheers!

I have heard recently – at least here in NYC that family members can be paid to take care of a spouse or relative.  It may stem from so many companies popping up and not having ‘caring staff’ that family has to quit their job to care for someone….and it is a lotless expensive to stay in your own home

Exhibit 99.(b)14 

 
Description of Offers to Exchange Variable Annuity Contracts 
This Description must be accompanied or preceded by a prospectus for the Flexible Premium Deferred Variable Annuity issued under Thrivent Variable
Annuity Account I. Capitalized terms have the same meaning as given to them in the prospectus, except as otherwise specified.  General
 Thrivent Financial for Lutherans and our indirect subsidiary Thrivent Life Insurance Company (�TLIC�) are making an exchange offer
to owners of certain outstanding variable annuity contracts issued through one or more of our separate accounts (�Current Contracts�). The Current Contracts include the following: 
�


�
�
�
 �2002 Thrivent Variable Annuity� Thrivent issued between 11/4/2002 and 9/30/2005. 
�


�
�
�
 �AAL Variable Annuity� AAL issued between 6/15/1995 and 4/30/2003. 
�


�
�
�
 �LB Variable Annuity� Lutheran Brotherhood issued between 2/3/1994 and 4/30/03. 
�


�
�
�
 �TLIC Variable Annuity� Thrivent Life Insurance Company issued between 2/18/1988 and 4/30/2003. 
The exchange offer is available only for Current Contracts under which we have not yet started making annuity payments. Each eligible contract owner may
exchange his or her Current Contract for the Flexible Premium Deferred Variable Annuity described in the prospectus that accompanies this description (�New Contract�). 
Before deciding to exchange your Contract for a New Contract, you should carefully consider their differences. The New Contract offers an enhanced living
benefit, the Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit, not available under the Current Contracts. The New Contract also offers another enhanced living benefit, the Return Protection Allocation, which is already available in the 2002 Thrivent Variable
Annuity. So, if you are considering exchanging your Current Contract for a New Contract in order to get an enhanced living benefit, also consider some of the other important differences that are discussed below. Please contact your Thrivent
Financial representative or call the Service Center at 800-847-4836 for assistance.  Differences Between Contracts 
Sales/Surrender Charges  Like the
Current Contracts, the New Contract imposes no sales charge at the time of purchase (front-end sales charge). The New Contract imposes a contingent deferred sales charge (surrender charge) that is the same as the AAL Variable Annuity surrender
charge, but higher and longer in duration than that of the other Current Contracts. The New Contract surrender charge begins at 7% in the first year and declines by 1% each Contract Year until the beginning of the 8th Contract Year, after which no
surrender charge applies. The New Contracts waive surrender charges under more circumstances than do the Current Contracts. See the summary comparison chart for more details.  
No surrender charge will apply upon an exchange of Contracts pursuant to this exchange offer. In addition, as part of the exchange offer, the New
Contracts will be deemed to have been issued on the same issue date as the Current Contract for purposes of computing the applicable surrender charge. Should you choose to cancel the New Contract under the Right to Cancel provision, the exchange
will not have been completed under this program. Any surrender charge that applied to the prior contract will be assessed. 
Thrivent.com 


Other Charges 
Prior to the Annuity Date, the New Contract imposes a current mortality and expense risk charge of 1.25% for the first seven years of the Contract, and a
maximum of 1.15% thereafter. The current charge after seven years is 1.00%. On and after the Annuity Date, the New Contract imposes a mortality and expense risk charge of 1.25%. The AAL Variable Annuity imposes a 1.25% mortality and expense risk
charge during the life of the Contract. The other Current Contracts impose a current 1.10% mortality and expense risk charge during the life of the Contract with a maximum charge of 1.25%. Additional charges are associated with optional death and
living benefits that are offered under the Contracts. See the summary comparison chart for more details.   The New Contract imposes an
annual administrative charge that is deducted each Contract Anniversary from the Accumulated Value if the Accumulated Value on that day is less than $15,000 and the sum of all premiums paid, less all partial surrenders made on the Contract, is less
than $15,000, and the sum of premiums paid, less partial surrenders made during the Contract Year just ended, is less than $2,400. The administrative charge is $30 or, if less, 2% of the Accumulated Value on the Contract Anniversary. The Current
Contracts, other than the 2002 Thrivent Variable Annuity, each impose an annual administrative charge on different terms. See the summary comparison chart for more details. The 2002 Thrivent Variable Annuity does not impose an administrative
charge.  The Current and New Contracts impose a transfer charge of $25 after 12 free transfers per Contract Year. The New Contract also
imposes a Commuted Value Charge for surrenders of life income settlement options. If we are making payments under a life income settlement option with a guaranteed period, the contract owner may elect to receive a lump sum instead of continuing
payments under the life income option (unless the life income election was irrevocable). We will calculate the commuted value of the payments remaining in the guaranteed period by using an interest rate that is 0.25% higher than the interest rate
used to determine the income payable under the life income settlement option.  Investment Options 
The Current and New Contracts generally offer the same variable subaccount options. In addition, the New Contract offers the same fixed account options as
the 2002 Thrivent Variable Annuity, and offers market value adjusted (�MVA�) fixed account options that are not available under the AAL, LB and TLIC Variable Annuities. The other fixed account options are generally the same under the
Current and New Contracts, except that the TLIC fixed account option offers a minimum 4% guaranteed interest rate.  Annuity Options
 The Current and New Contracts offer some of the same annuity payment options, namely, interest-only income, single-life income, fixed
period, and specified amount. Joint-life income is offered in the Current and New Contracts, except the LB and TLIC Variable Annuity Contracts. The AAL Variable Annuity Contract only offers fixed annuity payments. 
The other Current Contracts offer annuity payments on both a fixed and variable basis, as does the New Contract. 
The 2002 Thrivent Variable Annuity and the New Contract both offer variable annuity payments using an assumed investment rate (�AIR�) of 3%, 4%
and 5%. The TLIC and LB Variable Annuities offer variable annuity payments using an AIR of 3.5%. See the summary comparison chart for more information.  
Death Benefit Options  The
Current and New Contracts offer the same basic death benefit, namely, the greater of Accumulated Value or return of premiums, less withdrawal. The Current Contracts, other than the 2002 Thrivent Variable Annuity, offer an enhanced death benefit,
namely, the Maximum Anniversary Death Benefit (�MADB�) in the case of the AAL Variable Annuity, and MADB with sixth-year reset in the case of the TLIC Variable Annuity and LB Variable Annuity. The 2002 Thrivent Variable Annuity and the New
Contracts offer several enhanced death benefit options, including MADB, Premium Accumulation Death Benefit (�PADB�) and Earnings Addition Death Benefit (�EADB�). There is no separate charge for the enhanced death benefit under
the AAL, LB or TLIC Variable Annuities. The charges for the enhanced death benefit options are generally higher under the New Contract as compared to the 2002 Thrivent Variable Annuity. However, if you add either the Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal
Benefit or the Return Protection Allocation, you cannot also choose the above-mentioned enhanced death benefit options (except you may add the MADB if you also have the Return Protection Allocation). See the summary comparison chart
for more information.   Guaranteed Living Benefits 
The 2002 Thrivent Variable Annuity and the New Contract offer a Return Protection Allocation (�RPA�), which is an optional benefit that
guarantees the future value of amounts allocated to specified subaccounts for either a seven-year or ten-year period. The RPA charge is 0.75%. The other Current Contracts do not offer this optional benefit. The New Contract also offers the
Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit (�GLWB�). The Current Contracts do not offer the GLWB. The GLWB is an optional rider benefit that you may select at the time the Contract is issued or thereafter. The GLWB allows you to surrender an
amount up to the Guaranteed Withdrawal Amount (�GWA�) with no surrender charge for as long as the GLWB rider is in effect. Under the GLWB rider, if your Contract terminates because the GWA that is surrendered exceeds the Accumulated Value,
we will continue to pay you the GWA each year for as long as the Annuitant is alive under a settlement agreement that we will issue. The GLWB is subject to a Maximum Annual Risk Charge of 1.25%. The current GLWB charge is 1.25%,
 �

0.80% and 0.50% if you select the Moderately Aggressive, Moderate or Moderately Conservative Allocations, respectively. Please refer to the Flexible Premium Deferred Variable Annuity
prospectus for more details.   Partial Surrenders and the Effects on Death Benefits 
A partial surrender will reduce the contract�s guaranteed death benefit. For the AAL, LB and TLIC Variable Annuities, the guaranteed death benefit
will be reduced by the amount of the partial surrender. For the New Contract and the 2002 Thrivent Variable Annuity, a partial surrender will reduce the guaranteed death benefit by the same proportion as the reduction in account value. 
Guaranteed Annuity Rates  Both
the New and Current Variable Annuity Contracts contain guaranteed annuity payment rates. Guaranteed annuity payment rates provide a minimum monthly income that can be established from the annuity�s Accumulated Value. However, mortality rates
have generally improved and interest rates may have changed since the guarantees were developed for the Current Contracts. As such, the guaranteed annuity rates in the New Contracts may be less favorable than those in the Current Contracts;
specifically the mortality and interest rate basis for the guaranteed annuity payments for each annuity contract.  In any case, for all
contracts, the actual annuity payment that is paid to the contract owner is the greater of the guaranteed annuity payment and the annuity payment based on current mortality and interest rate expectations. Generally, annuity payments based on current
mortality and interest rate expectations are often higher than the guaranteed annuity payments. See the summary comparison chart under �Settlement Options� for more details. 
Tax Considerations  We will
impose no fee or charge in connection with an exchange. Please see the discussion of �Federal Tax Matters� in the prospectus for the New Contract regarding the federal income tax treatment of the New Contract. 
Compensation  We do not
compensate our financial representatives for initiating the exchange of a Current Contract for a New Contract. However, we continue to compensate on any additional monies placed into the New Contract. Please see the discussion of �Sales and
other Agreements� in the prospectus for the New Contract regarding commissions.  Availability of Exchange Offer 
If you wish to exchange your Current Contract for a New Contract, please contact your Thrivent Financial representative or the Service Center at
800-847-4836. Generally, the New Contract will be appropriate for you only if you wish to elect the Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit or the Return Protection Allocation available under the New Contract. The Return Protection Allocation is
already available for the 2002 Variable Annuity. There would be no need to exchange your 2002 Variable Annuity for the New Contract if you only wanted the Return Protection Allocation. Partial exchanges are not permitted and, once you have accepted
an exchange offer, any exchange back to the Current Contract will not be permitted. Should you choose to cancel the New Contract under the Right to Cancel provision, the exchange will not have been completed under this program. Any surrender charge
that applied to the prior contract will be assessed. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE OR SUSPEND THE EXCHANGE OFFER AT ANY TIME. This exchange offer may not be available in all states. 
If you decide to exchange your Current Contract for a New Contract, the Accumulated Value under your New Contract immediately after the exchange will be
the same as it was under your Current Contract immediately prior to the exchange. However, if you have a 2002 Thrivent Variable Annuity and you have money allocated to a Fixed Period Allocation, there may be a Market Value Adjustment on the
Accumulated Value in the Fixed Period Allocation. If you decide to exchange your Current Contract for a New Contract, the Market Value Adjustment will be applied and could result in the Accumulated Value under the New Contract being less than or
greater than the Accumulated Value under the Current Contract.  Summary Comparisons 
Following is a chart that provides a summary comparison of some of the important features of the Current and New Contracts. The chart is intended to
highlight features that you may find important in deciding whether to accept the exchange offer described herein. The chart is not intended to be a substitute for careful consideration by you of the features of your Current Contract that are
important to you in light of your own financial and retirement objectives and situation. You should refer to the terms and conditions of your Current Contract and the most recently dated prospectus for the Current Contract for a more complete
description of your Current Contract�s terms and conditions. You may obtain an additional copy of a Current Contract prospectus free of charge by contacting your Thrivent Financial representative, calling the toll-free number on the cover of
your prospectus, or going to www.thrivent.com.  Please note that this description of offers to exchange variable annuity contracts and summary
comparison must be accompanied by or preceded by the most recent prospectus for the Current Contract.
