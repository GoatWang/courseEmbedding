Cleveland Diagnostics





























































Nearly every cancer that iscaught early is curableLearn more



  Cleveland Diagnostics is developing technology to detect cancer early, when it can be treated and cured   Early Detection WorksGenerally, if cancer is found early, 90 percent survive. If cancer is found late, 10 percent survive. Earlier detection leads to earlier, more precise treatment that may treat and cure cancer.However, there are few effective early detection methods for cancer. We're here to change that.  
Survival (%) Correlated with Stage of Diagnosis*













 







How We're DifferentWe've taken an "out-of-the-box" approach to detecting cancer. Today, most laboratories rely on the overall expression of biomarkers. These biomarkers, often proteins, are typically overexpressed in the context of cancer. However, it has become clear that a number of non-cancerous conditions can also cause an overexpression of these biomarkers. Therefore, false positives are very common. For example, PSA, which is the biomarker used for prostate cancer, can also be overexpressed due to inflammation, benign prostatic hyperplasia, urinary tract infection, and even something as common as riding a bike.Our approach to detecting cancer at the earliest stage is to determine not just the overall expression of these biomarkers, but rather their origin. We have developed proprietary technology that separates protein isoforms, allowing investigate proteins based on structure, not concentration.

Background — Cleveland Diagnostics



























































 Your DNA is essentially a set of instructions. It is made up of genes, which are the molecular unit of heredity. Therefore, genes decide your biological traits, such as eye color.







 Genetic switches determine which genes should be expressed. For example, a heart cell will express very different genes than a brain cell. When "turned on", these genes are transcribed into single-stranded RNA. 























 RNA is then translated into proteins, which play a variety of roles in the body, such as catalyzing reactions, replicating DNA, transporting molecules, and much more. Essentially – we all are just manifestation of proteins working together.







Under certain physiological conditions such as stress or disease, a specific protein may be overexpressed or underexpressed. This is the current basis of a biomarker, which is a measurable protein whose altered expression indicates that an individual has a disease. However, in addition to changing the level of protein, diseases also modify the structure of proteins.

The Problem — Cleveland Diagnostics



















































The problem with cancer diagnostics Cancer diagnostics rely on an overexpression of specific biomarkers to identify a disease. But what if other conditions also elevate the concentration of that biomarker in blood, despite the individual not having the disease?







Take prostate cancer, for example 







The standard prostate cancer diagnostic test measures the expression of the biomarker, prostate-specific antigen. While overexpression of PSA indicates the possibility of prostate cancer, high levels of PSA could also be due to inflammation of the prostate or infection. Also, some individuals with prostate cancer never have elevated PSA levels.Positive PSA test, now what?If an individual has a PSA level above 4.0 ng/mL, their physician may advise them to get a transrectal biopsy. This is completed by collecting multiple samples of prostate tissue by inserting needles into the prostate. However, only 25% of men who have a PSA level between 4.0 and 10 ng/mL will have prostate cancer.







There's got to be a better solution, right?We're developing technology to provide more information to better diagnose patients and save more lives.

Solvent Interaction Analysis — Cleveland Diagnostics



















































Changes in protein expression are typically not cancer-specific.We're developing technology to evaluate the changes to the structure of the protein biomarker. These structural changes directly relate to cancer mutations. In contrast to looking at gene mutations, our technology provides direct information about the onset or progression of a disease – instead of just your risk of getting it.







SIA: Simple, Elegant, & Robust 







 The basis of solvent interaction analysis is the separation of proteins with distinct physiochemical properties by a biphasic system. Two distinct immiscible solvent systems arise when polymers and salts are mixed in water. Separation based on structural changeA sample is first placed in the aqueous two-phase system. The system is agitated and then centrifuged to thoroughly mix and then separate the solutes. All protein isoforms partition unequally between the top and bottom phases based on their structure and interaction with other proteins. 







 K Value 







Our SIA technology reports a quantitative ratiometric parameter that is independent of the absolute expression level, called K, which represents the ratio of the biomarker concentration in a customized biphasic solution. The value of K is used as standard cut-off clinical parameters once calibrated against known clinical samples. How do we measure the biomarker concentration in each of the two phases? With a simple conventional technology such as ELISA, which can detect the biomarker – but is incapable of detecting changes to its structure. That is done by SIA.

Arnon Chait, right, shown here in a 2004 photo with AnalizaDX senior scientist Pamela Lechner, will become CEO of Cleveland Diagnostics, a new spin-off company of Cleveland Clinic Innovations.
Plain Dealer file 
CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Cleveland Clinic Innovations has formed a spinoff company, Cleveland Diagnostics Inc., to develop and commercialize cancer diagnostics and screening tests.Cleveland Clinic Innovations, the commercialization arm of the hospital system, formed the new company with biotech company
 AnalizaDx LLC, based in Cleveland. Arnon Chait, president and CEO of AnalizaDx, a spin-off of Analiza Inc., which was founded in 1996, will serve as CEO of Cleveland Diagnostics. AnalizaDx will cease operations, but the company's employees - Chait says there are fewer than 10 - will remain.“As a small company, you can really invent the screw driver,” Chait said. “Once you do that you have to be able to bring [your product] to the market. We absolutely cannot do that on our own.” The backing of CCI will allow the new company to push forward the PSA/SIA prostate cancer screening test, in development for years, closer to the market, Chait said. A few years ago, AnalizaDx, in partnership with the Clinic, University Hospitals and the Veterans Affairs Hospital in Boston, conducted clinical trials for the urine-based test that promised greater accuracy than the prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, test.SIA stands for solvent interaction analysis, the proprietary technology created by AnalizaDx Inc. Earlier this year the company announced that it had entered into a licensing agreement with informatics company Global Health Management Informatics to offer the PSA/SIA tests in Africa and the Caribbean.  Cleveland Diagnostics is developing technology that focuses on protein biomarker structural changes that correlate with the presence of a disease. The company’s portfolio of non-invasive cancer diagnostic tests includes blood-based tests to screen for prostate, breast and ovarian cancer.
“With ovarian cancer, we have data that shows that we can differentiate early stage [disease] from benign [polyps and tumors],” Chait said. “Eventually we think that will become a product.” Early detection of cancer using a blood test could mean surgical removal with laparoscopic surgery and not the more invasive hysterectomy, he said. “Cleveland Clinic has a 90-year history of encouraging discovery and enabling physicians and researchers to create technologies that benefit patients,” Dr. Thomas J. Graham, M.D., Cleveland Clinic’s Chief Innovation Officer, said in a statement. “When fully developed, Cleveland Diagnostics’ unique screenings will provide physicians and patients with the information they need to make decisions on treatments.”
