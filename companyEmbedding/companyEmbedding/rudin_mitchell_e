Mitchell E. Rudin


Mack-Cali’s Mission


An Interview with Mitchell E. Rudin, Chief Executive Officer, Mack-Cali Realty Corporation


Editors’ Note
Mitchell Rudin has served in his current post since joining the company in June 2015. Prior to this, he served as President and Chief Executive Officer of U.S. Commercial Operations at Brookfield Office Properties, overseeing a portfolio in excess of 50 million square feet in nine markets. Before that, he served as President and Chief Executive Officer of the New York Tri-State Region for CBRE. Rudin has a Juris Doctor from Boston College Law School and is a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Franklin & Marshall College.
Company Brief
Mack-Cali Realty Corporation (mack-cali.com) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) providing management, leasing, development, and other tenant-related services for its two-platform operations of waterfront and transit-based office and luxury multi-family assets. Mack-Cali owns or has interests in approximately 225 office and flex properties totaling approximately 20 million square feet and 19 multi-family rental communities containing approximately 5,600 residential units and a pipeline of approximately 11,500 units, all located in the Northeast. Mack-Cali strives to provide its tenants and residents with the most innovative communities that empower them to reimagine the way they work and live.
You came in to change this company. Will you talk about how that process has gone? 
I started with a terrific partner, Mike DeMarco, and we had a vision coming in for the company and for the markets that we are in, and we have exceeded expectations. We announced a plan 100 days after we started called “20/15,” which indicated that we would be consolidating the office portfolio to 20 million square feet and increasing the multi-family portfolio to 15,000 units by 2018. 
At the time, we indicated our approach would be to tour every property and develop a strategy for the 250 or so office buildings that we owned. We identified the markets we considered strategic and those that weren’t. This led to an acquisition strategy and a disposition program, the latter of which was executed mostly in 2016 and will be finished in 2017. This involved selling properties that are not part of our future, even though they’re good properties. 
We have enormous confidence in the Hudson River Waterfront and anticipate that we could have perhaps 60 percent of the value of the company along the waterfront between Fort Lee and Jersey City, but primarily between Weehawken, where we developed Port Imperial, into Hoboken and Jersey City.
We have a number of other markets that we are committed to including Metropark, Parsippany, White Plains, Red Bank, and Short Hills, as well as a few others. We have already seen substantial rent growth in these markets. 
On the waterfront office side, we have seen rents increase by almost 30 percent in the 19 months we’ve been there. We have driven occupancy to 94 percent with a more varied type of tenant. At the end of last year, we finished a deal with Omnicom, the world’s second largest media and advertising company. They had two criteria when entering the marketplace. They looked at the boroughs as well as at us, and they wanted to drive rent down and do something that would synergize with their offices in New York. This led them to our portfolio.
There are a number of fashion and technology companies that have come into the market as well who are interested in this area. The Grow NJ program allows us to take rents into the single digits or even remain flat for a 10-year period.
On the multi-family side, we have also continued to drive growth. We opened M2 at Marbella in Jersey City six months ago and it is now 96 percent leased. We opened another building during the first week in March that stands out on the skyline: Jersey City Urby at Harborside.
It’s a function of providing a high-quality product at a fraction of the cost of not only Manhattan but of Brooklyn and Long Island City. Our multi-family product is approximately 60 percent of the cost of comparable apartments in Manhattan, 75 percent of those in Brooklyn, and 90 percent of Long Island City. For example, you can lease a studio in a fully amenitized building for approximately $2,000/month.
Does your split between office and multi-family provide the right balance for you today?
We are going to grow both, and we see them as highly synergistic in three ways: first, we can create and control a great mixed-use environment. Work/live/play is what we do. It’s about having office space with apartments right next door. We’re also going to be developing 125,000 square feet of retail in Harborside in Jersey City, minutes from all of our office and multi-family projects.
In the major tech hubs like New York and San Francisco where housing is so costly, the fact that we can provide reasonable housing alternatives that are next to work and proximate to Manhattan is really a plus. We also have one of the most dense concentrations of tech workers living in Jersey City.
Second, we have been able to repurpose buildings that had formerly been used for offices into multi-family communities. Rather than selling them at a deep discount, we have created value as well as a built-in pipeline.
Finally, people on that side have greater experience with amenities such as gyms, cafeterias, and the like. Being able to take advantage of that aesthetic has been terrific. 
Will you talk about the start-up nature of the new offices?
We wanted to do something that we would be proud of organizationally, that would increase communication and energy in the office and show the architectural elements of our 100-plus-year-old home. There is an integration of open space and common areas with terrific views. 
We were able to create a showcase while exercising economic prudence in building it out.
How important is brand to the company?
The brand is critical. Ours was a great brand that had suffered and people were looking to us to restore it. There is pride in this organization so people want to see us succeed. We do have outstanding competitors but they don’t have the scale and public exposure we do.
How does the leadership at the top work so well? 
Our strengths are complementary, and we both bring a drive and desire to get things done yesterday. Through the better part of my career, I have worked in cooperative leadership environments so I understand the strengths of it. As a result, we have been able to portray a face of cooperation and confidence to the marketplace.
While in the process, do you take time to celebrate the wins?
I love coming to work every day but we’re always striving to achieve the next goal.•

Mitchell E. Rudin


Professional Management


An Interview with Mitchell E. Rudin, President and Chief Executive Officer, New York Tri-State Region, CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc.


Editors' Note
Mitch Rudin overseas all the business and operating functions for CBRE’s operations in the region. He has significantly improved the region’s operating margins since assuming this role and led the region to profitability every year, including in the past two years, the most tumultuous the industry has seen. While doing this, CBRE’s market dominance in Tri-State has continued to expand. Among Rudin’s other corporate activities, he is a member of CBRE’s Diversity Committee and executive sponsor for the African-American affinity group. He is also Chair of the firm’s global law firm practice group. He was previously President – Brokerage Services, for CBRE, and held a similar position at Insignia/ESG as President of U.S. Transaction Services, until CBRE’s acquisition of that firm in 2003. Rudin also ran the transition team for Insignia/ESG in connection with the merger with CBRE. Before joining Insignia/ESG, Rudin was a partner at Tishman Speyer Properties. He was formerly an attorney with Davis & Gilbert, where he practiced real estate law.
Company Brief
 CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc. (www.cbre.com) is a Fortune 500 and S&P 500 company headquartered in Los Angeles. The company has approximately 29,000 employees (excluding affiliates), and serves real estate owners, investors, and occupiers through more than 300 offices (excluding affiliates) worldwide. CB Richard Ellis offers strategic advice and execution for property sales and leasing; corporate services; property, facilities, and project management; mortgage banking; appraisal and valuation; development services; investment management; and research and consulting.
Were you surprised by the speed and severity of the economic crisis, and where are we in terms of the real estate market coming back?
Virtually everyone was surprised by the depth and severity of the crisis when it hit. Starting in June 2008, we anticipated a downturn. We started to manage into a declining economy, and that enabled us to avoid many more precipitous steps.
Now we’re somewhere in the bottom of a flat U, so we don’t foresee a further decline and we’re seeing modest improvements, depending upon which segment of the market that you’re in. It’s going to bounce along the bottom for awhile.
How challenging is it to differentiate in this space, and how do you define that differentiation for CBRE?
It depends on the market segment that you’re looking at. On the one hand, if you’re somebody who has global requirements, then a global footprint is important, and ours is not only significantly larger, but best in class in almost all major markets and business lines.
On the other hand, if you’re somebody who has a building to lease and manage in New York, or an occupier who has a specific requirement, we have several points of differentiation: the strength and depth of our consulting department, which is 25-plus years old and unique in the entire industry, not just in New York; our market research department, which has continued unabated for as long as I’ve been here; and the training, strength, and coordination of our brokers. In Crain’s New York Business’ 2009 annual list of the 50 largest transactions, we had 28 of the top 50, and six of the top 10; and we again secured the Real Estate Board of New York Deal of the Year for the 26th time.
Has technology had a major impact on the business and has it changed the way you operate?
Yes, and no. It has certainly helped with communication; and it certainly has enhanced our ability to deliver research and other services. But like everything else in the professional service field, it may be an enhancement, but it all starts with the individuals – the selection, training, and management of them. Before any other firm in our industry, CBRE made the decision to move to professional management.
Having said that, when we move into our new Tri-State headquarters next year, we will have the best technology in our industry – telepresence and teleconferencing – significant upgrades in capacity, new computers, wireless offices, etc. 
You are actively involved in CBRE’s diversity committee. How critical is it from a global standpoint to maintain a diverse workforce that mirrors your client base, and what is the message out there about the opportunities for women and minorities?
The commitment to diversity flows from the top, and we are the leader in this area. Approximately 40 percent of our management team in Tri-State arre women. In addition, in one year, CBRE’s top producer, top investment sales professional, and top retail sales professional were all women from Tri-State. What region in any company in almost any industry can say that? The challenge with minorities is greater, but we are attacking that hire by hire.
We started a program a few years ago called the Wheel Program, where we bring in somewhere between four and six people out of college and rotate them through six different departments over an 18-month period, then mutually settle on full-time employment. Our retention rate in that program has been almost 80 percent, and we have succeeded in meeting our diversity objectives for that program, both in terms of women and people of color every year.
We truly have become the company that we want our kids to work at.
Will there be a new framework for pricing in the market going forward, and will we reach and exceed the pricing of some years back?
Real estate professionals and developers are optimists by nature. We have a natural governor though because of the cost and complexity of building. So we’re going through this current cycle with a fairly limited amount of new construction.
Do I think we will return to the heights we had reached? Yes. Is that going to be in the next year or two? No. But the environment in New York is healthy.
In addition, our building stock is fairly old. We still like to characterize ’80s and ’90s product as new, so if you’ve made the decision that you want to be in a LEED-certified building, or you want the most modern technology, you have very few choices here.
Will the environmental focus be a given in future building?
It will be on any new multi-tenant building. You would be foolish not to because there will be a portion of the market that will not consider that as an alternative. Where you are on that spectrum from green to gold to platinum is a little less significant. But the corporate interest in sustainability will continue.•

Mitch Rudin Is Leaving Brookfield Office Properties





















–
Brookfield’s management reorganization has forced the departure of Mitch Rudin from the company.
–

 
–
President and chief operating officer of Brookfield Office Properties’ U.S. commercial operations,    Mitch Rudin,    is stepping down from his position. This according to an announcement made last week.
It was not revealed why Mr. Rudin is leaving the company,    but sources said that the decision for him to go was mutual. Currently Rudin is overseeing Brookfield’s $250 million renovation of the World Financial Center and the construction of Manhattan West,    a 5.4 million-square-foot office,    residential and hotel development near Hudson Yards in Manhattan.
The move comes as part of the company’s management reorganization which it started in 2012. As part of this reorganization Brookfield,    it seems,    is doing away with Rudin’s position entirely. This is part of a process to take the public company private.
Brookfield said about Rudin’s departure that his,    “capabilities would not be fully utilized going forward.” Its CEO Dennis Friedrich is expected to take on many of Rudin’s responsibilities.
Rudin reportedly earned over $6 million in 2011,    making him Brookfield’s highest paid executive that year.
Mr. Mitchell E. Rudin has been the Chief Executive Officer and President of US Commercial Operations at Brookfield Canada Office Properties since June 30,    2011. An attorney by training,    Rudin attended Franklin & Marshall College and Boston College Law School. He made the switch to real estate after managing a deal with Saatchi and Saatchi for 375 Hudson Street.
Mr. Rudin is a member of the Real Estate Board of New York and was on the board of the Maccabiah Games in Israel in 1993,    1997,    and 2001. He also worked on the Pan American Maccabi Games in Buenos Aires in 1995 and Santiago in 2003. He is a member of American Friends of the Israel Museum Board.
With headquarters in Toronto,    New York and Sydney,    Brookfield Office Properties Inc. is a North American commercial real estate company.

Mitch Rudin Is Leaving Brookfield Office Properties





















–
Brookfield’s management reorganization has forced the departure of Mitch Rudin from the company.
–

 
–
President and chief operating officer of Brookfield Office Properties’ U.S. commercial operations,    Mitch Rudin,    is stepping down from his position. This according to an announcement made last week.
It was not revealed why Mr. Rudin is leaving the company,    but sources said that the decision for him to go was mutual. Currently Rudin is overseeing Brookfield’s $250 million renovation of the World Financial Center and the construction of Manhattan West,    a 5.4 million-square-foot office,    residential and hotel development near Hudson Yards in Manhattan.
The move comes as part of the company’s management reorganization which it started in 2012. As part of this reorganization Brookfield,    it seems,    is doing away with Rudin’s position entirely. This is part of a process to take the public company private.
Brookfield said about Rudin’s departure that his,    “capabilities would not be fully utilized going forward.” Its CEO Dennis Friedrich is expected to take on many of Rudin’s responsibilities.
Rudin reportedly earned over $6 million in 2011,    making him Brookfield’s highest paid executive that year.
Mr. Mitchell E. Rudin has been the Chief Executive Officer and President of US Commercial Operations at Brookfield Canada Office Properties since June 30,    2011. An attorney by training,    Rudin attended Franklin & Marshall College and Boston College Law School. He made the switch to real estate after managing a deal with Saatchi and Saatchi for 375 Hudson Street.
Mr. Rudin is a member of the Real Estate Board of New York and was on the board of the Maccabiah Games in Israel in 1993,    1997,    and 2001. He also worked on the Pan American Maccabi Games in Buenos Aires in 1995 and Santiago in 2003. He is a member of American Friends of the Israel Museum Board.
With headquarters in Toronto,    New York and Sydney,    Brookfield Office Properties Inc. is a North American commercial real estate company.

RudinMillburn Planning BoardPostpone  Movement on this Proposed DevelopmentRobin Finkelstein Short Hills, NJRobin FinkelsteinShort Hills, NJ1,334SupportersThere is a proposal to build a mixed use development
on JFK Parkway near the Short Hills mall. From what we
understand, the development would include four 50 unit residential
buildings as well as a large hotel and a 4-story garage building.
Such a development would result in a large influx of new students
into our schools and the need for redistricting or a new building
plan. Given the already-crowded nature of our schools, we wanted
to make Millburn parents aware of the proposal since it hasn't been
covered much in the local press. This petition was delivered to:Town of Millburn, New JerseyMitchell E. RudinMillburn Planning BoardRead the letterLetter toTown of Millburn, New JerseyMitchell E.
