November 2016  L3 to Provide Power Distribution and Switchgear Equipment for the U.S. Navy's Stealthiest Submarine Program


March 17, 2016  L3 to Provide Power Node Control Center® for the U.S. Navy Destroyer Program








 








About











With over a hundred years of experience dating back to Henry Cutter's first "inverse time element" circuit breaker in the late nineteenth century, L3 SPD Electrical Systems (L3 SPDES) is the world's leading supplier of innovative shock-hardened circuit breakers and switchgear for harsh environment applications. SPD Electrical Systems has predominantly supplied the U.S. Navy with power distribution systems installed on every surface combatant, submarine and aircraft carrier.

                In addition to decades of providing in-house designs, L3 SPDES has worked in collaboration with commercial circuit breaker suppliers to militarize commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products for application in combatant environments. This approach has yielded advances such as L3 SPDES' air circuit breakers, which allow increased automation and reduced manning through local and remote-state monitoring and control of circuit breaker parameters.

                L3 SPDES continues to support decades of fielded circuit breaker products through a factory-based repair and overhaul center staffed by dedicated personnel and supported by factory resident engineering. L3 SPDES is located in Northeast Philadelphia and is comprised of nearly 200 engineering, program management, production and support professionals.

AIR CIRCUIT BREAKERS



Model 4012
Air Circuit Breaker-4012 Data Sheet (PDF)

Model 2012
Air Circuit Breaker-2012 Data Sheet (PDF)



L3 SPD Electrical Systems’ air circuit breakers allow for increased automation and reduced manning through  local and remote-state monitoring of circuit breaker parameters. Our air circuit breakers are based on Eaton’s Magnum Double Narrow circuit breaker, the leading  circuit breaker in the world.
Many new standard features include RMS  sensing, ground-fault detection, real-time state monitoring,  bidirectional communications, control functions, undervoltage dropout,  undervoltage lockout, power-up trip, charging motor protection and more.
By integrating electronic overcurrent protection in the air circuit breakers, L3 SPD  Electrical Systems eliminates the need for costly overcurrent  assemblies. This flexibility provides simplified ordering, application  versatility, reduced parts inventory and reduced maintenance, resulting  in manpower savings.
 
POWER NODE CONTROL CENTER (PNCC)

L3's  PNCC offers groundbreaking technology for  electrical power distribution systems by providing the functionality of  transfer switches, frequency converters, motor controllers,  transformers, circuit breakers, rectifiers and inverters – simultaneously  within a single enclosure. Programmable power electronic building  blocks are what enables this technology for mixed application usage. The  PNCC provides the highest reliability, survivability, power density and load-power quality - all with affordability in mind.
