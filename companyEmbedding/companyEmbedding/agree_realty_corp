Our History
In 1971, Richard Agree, our Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors founded Agree Development Company, the predecessor to Agree Realty Corporation. Over its 23 year history, Agree developed over 40 community shopping centers primarily throughout the Midwestern and Southeast United States.
With an Initial Public Offering of 2.5 million shares in 1994, Agree Realty Corporation commenced operations as a publicly traded Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). Follow-on equity offerings have subsequently been issued in 1997, 2003, 2005, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. Agree Realty is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ADC.

Today
Agree Realty Corporation (NYSE: ADC) is a fully-integrated, self-administered, and self-managed REIT focused on the development and acquisition of net lease retail properties throughout the United States. Our growing portfolio of industry leading retailers consists of 416 assets in 43 states, containing approximately 8.0 million square feet of gross leasable space.
Agree’s disciplined and focused investment strategy, its institutional access to capital, and the Company’s industry-wide relationships, consistently produce high-quality opportunities with superior risk adjusted returns.
The Agree Team’s expertise and strategic execution seeks to maximize value for all stakeholders.  Our innovative development and acquisition strategies, adaptive real estate technology, and extensive capabilities are relied upon by our industry leading partners, including Walgreens, McDonalds, JP Morgan Chase, PNC and Wawa.
Building upon the foundation of excellence established throughout the past four decades, Agree Realty continues to be a market leader in the net lease space.

Real-time prices are provided by Bats Exchange on individual U.S. equities quote pages. During market hours, the real-time Bats price displays and new trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash"). Volume always reflects consolidated markets. If the symbol has pre-market or post-market trades, that information will also be reflected along with the last (closing) price from the symbol's exchange. Real-time prices are available during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST).  Note: The Bats Exchange currently accounts for approximately 11-12% of all U.S. equity trading each day. As a result, the real-time prices displayed may have minor discrepancies when comparing the information with other sites offering real-time data, or with brokerage firms. If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the Bats exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related Stocks For comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.Most Recent Stories View the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
