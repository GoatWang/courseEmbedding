      Fitch Affirms Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Trust 2015-P2 Commercial 
      Mtg P-T Certificates
    





December 02, 2016 10:28 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 15 classes of Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage 
      Trust 2015-P2 commercial mortgage pass-through certificates, series 
      2015-P2. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this 
      press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations reflect overall stable performance of the pool since 
      issuance. Pool loss expectations remain inline with expected losses from 
      issuance. As of the November 2016 distribution date, the pool's 
      aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 0.3% to $999 million 
      from $1 billion at issuance.
    

      High Fitch Leverage: The transaction has higher leverage than other 
      recent Fitch-rated fixed rate multiborrower transactions. At issuance 
      the pool's Fitch LTV of 111.2% was above both the year-to-date 2015 
      average of 109.4% and the 2014 average of 106.2%.
    

      Below Average Amortization: At issuance the pool was scheduled to pay 
      down by only 9.1% of the initial pool balance prior to maturity, which 
      is below historical averages. There are 19 full-term interest-only loans 
      (28.4%); 27 loans (48.0%) are partial interest only, and 25 loans 
      (23.6%) are balloon loans.
    

      Property Type Diversity: The pool's largest property type is retail with 
      an exposure of 25.7% of the pool balance, followed by multifamily at 
      19.1%. At issuance, the industrial property type exposure was higher 
      than recent CMBS transactions at 11.0%; hotel exposure was higher than 
      average at 17.0%.
    

      The fourteenth largest loan, the Westgate Shopping Center, had an 
      upcoming lease expiration for the largest tenant at issuance. The TJ 
      Maxx lease was extended from January 2017 to January 2027 according to 
      the September 2016 rent roll.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee 
      positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or 
      asset level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio level 
      metrics. Additional information on rating sensitivity is available in 
      the 'Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Trust 2015-P2' (December 2, 2015) 
      presale report, available at www.fitchratings.com.

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not 
      intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning

Commercial Financing
If you have never had to deal with commercial real estate financing, you may find it intimidating. That is certainly the case for most first-time commercial borrowers. Commercial real estate mortgages are quite different from their residential cousins in terms of both complexity and cost. But getting the facts before you apply for a loan should eliminate any fears about this fantastic business financing technique.

The Basics of Commercial Real Estate Financing

Commercial real estate financing is very similar to residential mortgage lending in that real property is pledged as collateral against a loan to either buy or refinance the property. A business may also borrow against the equity in property it owns, which like its residential counterpart can take the form of a business line of credit or a lump sum payment for any business purpose. Commercial real estate mortgages generally require regular payments of principal and interest -- commercial mortgage rates can be either fixed or variable -- until the loan is paid in full. Moreover, a commercial lender retains a security interest in the property throughout the loan term, with the same right to foreclose if the borrower defaults as a residential lender. 

What distinguishes commercial mortgage lending from residential lending are the characteristics of the property and the borrower. Unlike residential mortgages, which are geared toward the individual and 1-4 unit residential dwellings, commercial property financing is designed for business entities -- both for profit and not-for-profit -- to mortgage nearly any type of retail, office, industrial, multi-unit (5+) unit residential, or just about any other commercially zoned real property.

Because of these property and borrower characteristics, commercial real estate mortgages are viewed as higher risk transactions by the lending industry. The limited marketability of commercial property and higher risk of borrower default translates to less generous terms and more conservative underwriting by commercial mortgage lenders than those found in the residential arena. If a lender has to take possession of a commercial property through foreclosure, it will generally have much more difficulty selling it to recoup its money than it would a house. To compensate for the greater risk, commercial mortgage rates are substantially higher as are down payment requirements, and loan terms are shorter (typically a maximum of 25/30 years). 

Commercial mortgage lenders prefer a solid business borrower, but for newer businesses or companies that cannot meet the required financial performance standards, a personal guarantee of repayment from one or more of the firm's principals may be used to compensate. 

A final important difference between commercial real estate financing and the residential variety is that commercial real estate mortgages are more expensive to process and close. Not only are they much larger loans on average than residential mortgages, but nearly every aspect of the "due diligence" phase -- from valuation, to title, to underwriting -- is more complicated and, therefore, more costly. 

An Illustration: The "Vanilla" Commercial Mortgage Loan

To help you understand how commercial mortgage lending works in practice, here are the major characteristics of a standard "vanilla" commercial mortgage loan.

Debt Coverage Ratio

Commercial real estate financing is based primarily on the income of the property rather than the borrower. The lender will want evidence that the property will produce more than enough income to cover the mortgage payments. Generally, commercial mortgage lenders require the property to produce from 1.1 to 1.25 times the monthly mortgage payment in net rental income. For example, if the monthly mortgage payment is $2,000, the property should be producing $2,200 to $2,500 after all expenses are paid. 

Down Payment

Commercial mortgage loans typically require a borrower to put a minimum of 25% down. A higher down payment may be required for certain properties that carry greater risk, newer companies or those without a solid track record of consistent profitability.

Prepayment Penalties

Commercial real estate mortgages normally carry deescalating prepayment penalties, that is, a fee due to the lender if the loan is paid off within a certain period of time after it is made. For example, the fee might be 5% of the outstanding balance during the first year, 4% the second year, and so on, with no penalty after the fifth year. For obvious reasons, prepayment penalties are a particularly important consideration for a business that may not wish to -- or be able to -- own the property long enough to avoid them.

Although these characteristics illustrate a âstandardâ in commercial real estate mortgages, you can find many lenders with flexibility in any of them. Generally, deviating from a standard will entail an offsetting adjustment in others to compensate for the increased risk. For example, an up-front fee or higher interest rate might reduce or entirely eliminate a prepayment penalty, while a personal guarantee from one or more company owners might reduce the required down payment.
Where to Go For Commercial Real Estate Financing

Commercial mortgage lending is widely available throughout the U.S. The three most common sources of commercial real estate mortgages are:
1. Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities2. Regional Banks3. Private Equity Companies - i.e. Life Insurance Companies / Pension Manager / Hedge Funds4. Specialty Finance Companies - i.e. Third-Party ("Conduit") and Hard Money Lenders
Commercial Mortgage Brokers
Naturally, most business owners turn to banks -- particularly ones with whom they have established relationships -- for their commercial real estate financing. On the one hand, banks tend to offer the lowest commercial mortgage rates; on the other, they are the most rigid in their lending. Many banks will refuse loans on certain classes of property or exclude companies from specific industries. They also require more documentation and may charge higher fees than other commercial mortgage lending sources.

Conduit and hard money lenders can fund commercial mortgage loans with less documentation and more quickly than banks. Because their money comes from private sources, insurance companies, and commercial lines of credit, they can be much more flexible in their lending. You will find that hard money lenders, in particular, will loan money at lightning speed on virtually any type of property with much less stringent criteria for their borrowers -- all at a cost: Hard Money Lenders charge significantly higher mortgage rates than banks.

For larger capital needs, companies often turn to private equity companies. Private equity companies can provide critical commercial real estate financing on the total cost of a project. The equity range is the difference between the total cost of the real estate and the amount the senior lender is willing to provide -- normally no more than 75 percent of costs. So, for a $5 million project, commercial mortgage lenders would typically loan no more than $3.8 million, leaving $1.2 million in the equity range for the borrower to fund. If the borrowing entity has $200,000 in cash to put into the project, it could consider a mezzanine loan or an equity capital investment to come up with the remaining $1 million. Private Equity Companies are quite versatile and they can provide creative, flexible financing solutions, but they expect a good return on investment, so their interest rates are considerably higher than those charged by commercial lenders. Commercial mortgage brokers don't fund loans directly. Instead, a good broker will conduct a thorough assessment of your needs and research the programs offered by other commercial mortgage lending sources to find you the right mortgage solution with the most competitive rates and fees. A good commercial mortgage broker will have established relationships with many different lenders offering a wide variety of lending programs, giving you access to financing you might not be able to find on your own. As an added benefit, commercial mortgage brokers handle the tedious details of loan processing and packaging, making an otherwise complex transaction less stressful and saving you much time and energy. Using just any commercial mortgage broker could cost you either in up-front fees, a higher than market interest rate, or both. A good one, though, will orchestrate a smooth transaction with an optimal loan suited to your company's specific needs at a competitive rate.

With so many choices, it is important that you shop around, but the goal of your shopping should not be just to get the best rate. As is the case in residential mortgages, commercial mortgage rates and terms will vary from one lending source to the next. But with such a big financial commitment at stake, unless you have expertise in commercial real estate financing, you need a trusted advisor to both help you understand and to guide you through the complex process that defines a commercial mortgage loan. 

Regardless of the source you ultimately use, a little preparation before you begin your search for commercial real estate financing will go a long way towards reducing stress and assuring a good outcome.

Preparation: The Key to a Smooth Commercial Mortgage Lending Process

When you are ready to begin your search for a commercial mortgage lender, some advance preparation will serve you well. The complex nature of commercial real estate financing means you cannot expect to "rate shop" multiple lenders with a few minutes on the telephone -- at least, not with any reliability. 
Any prospective lender you contact should ask you for the following information, which is needed to give you an informed, accurate decision about your company's ability to borrow and the approximate rates and terms you can expect: 1. Year-to-date profit & loss statement and balance sheetÂ 2. Three years business income tax returnsÂ 3. Projected cash flow for the next 36 months
4. Personal Financial Statement and Resume for the Principal5. Property information
6. Written business plan
Having these items available will not only make your task easier, it will make it more likely you receive both an accurate quote and solid feedback on your loan request. Be wary of any prospective lender who will quote rates and terms without the required information. You could be in for nasty surprises later!

Commercial real estate financing is another of the business financing power tools available to your company. Unlike other types of credit for business, which typically have less attractive terms and a relatively short repayment period, commercial mortgage loans offer an excellent means to acquire property and manage risk with long-term, asset based financing, at attractive interest rates and with favorable tax treatment.

Fitch Affirms Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Trust 2015-P2 Commercial 
      Mtg P-T Certificates
























NEW YORK, Dec 02, 2016 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
Fitch Ratings has affirmed 15 classes of Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage 
      Trust 2015-P2 commercial mortgage pass-through certificates, series 
      2015-P2. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this 
      press release.


                                        








KEY RATING DRIVERS


                                        








The affirmations reflect overall stable performance of the pool since 
      issuance. Pool loss expectations remain inline with expected losses from 
      issuance. As of the November 2016 distribution date, the pool's 
      aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 0.3% to $999 million 
      from $1 billion at issuance.


                                        








High Fitch Leverage: The transaction has higher leverage than other 
      recent Fitch-rated fixed rate multiborrower transactions. At issuance 
      the pool's Fitch LTV of 111.2% was above both the year-to-date 2015 
      average of 109.4% and the 2014 average of 106.2%.


                                        








Below Average Amortization: At issuance the pool was scheduled to pay 
      down by only 9.1% of the initial pool balance prior to maturity, which 
      is below historical averages. There are 19 full-term interest-only loans 
      (28.4%); 27 loans (48.0%) are partial interest only, and 25 loans 
      (23.6%) are balloon loans.


                                        








Property Type Diversity: The pool's largest property type is retail with 
      an exposure of 25.7% of the pool balance, followed by multifamily at 
      19.1%. At issuance, the industrial property type exposure was higher 
      than recent CMBS transactions at 11.0%; hotel exposure was higher than 
      average at 17.0%.


                                        








The fourteenth largest loan, the Westgate Shopping Center, had an 
      upcoming lease expiration for the largest tenant at issuance. The TJ 
      Maxx lease was extended from January 2017 to January 2027 according to 
      the September 2016 rent roll.


                                        








RATING SENSITIVITIES


                                        








The Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee 
      positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or 
      asset level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio level 
      metrics. Additional information on rating sensitivity is available in 
      the 'Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Trust 2015-P2' (December 2, 2015) 
      presale report, available at         www.fitchratings.com
.


                                        








USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10


                                        








No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.


                                        








Fitch has affirmed the following classes as indicated:

Copyright Â© 2016 by Fitch Ratings, Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its 
      subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 
      1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or 
      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.


                                        








The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.

Why do we ask for Social Security?



Social Security Number


Why do we ask for your Social Security Number

Freddie Mac takes protecting your privacy seriously. We ask for your Social Security Number (SSN) to help us confirm that the requested information is being given to the mortgage holder or to someone authorized by the mortgage holder to receive the information.
We ask for your SSN because it allows us to quickly and accurately determine if your mortgage is held by Freddie Mac and to deliver an answer to you immediately. Providing a SSN increases the speed and accuracy of the look-up response.
We take measures to protect the SSN that you deliver to us (see below).

How do we handle your SSN after you enter it?

The SSN you enter within this form is only used to answer your specific look-up request. We do not save the number you enter or distribute it to a third party for any other purpose.
All information you enter in this form is transmitted from your web browser to our site via an encrypted communication channel. Please review our privacy policy for more details.

Do you have to provide your SSN number?

No. If you wish, you may submit an email request that does not require your SSN. Our customer service representatives will respond as quickly as they can, but given current demand it may take several days. Please be patient.




Verification By checking this box and clicking on the button below to submit this information, I confirm I am the owner of this property or have the consent of the owner to lookup this information.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moodyâs publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

It clarifies that the rating of class X-B is 'AA-sf' rather than 'A-sf' as stated in the ratings list of the original release.)Fitch Ratings has affirmed 15 classes of Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Trust 2015-P2 commercial mortgage pass-through certificates, series 2015-P2. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.KEY RATING DRIVERSThe affirmations reflect overall stable performance of the pool since issuance. Pool loss expectations remain inline with expected losses from issuance. As of the November 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 0.3% to $999 million from $1 billion at issuance.High Fitch Leverage: The transaction has higher leverage than other recent Fitch-rated fixed rate multiborrower transactions. At issuance the pool's Fitch LTV of 111.2% was above both the year-to-date 2015 average of 109.4% and the 2014 average of 106.2%.Below Average Amortization: At issuance the pool was scheduled to pay down by only 9.1% of the initial pool balance prior to maturity, which is below historical averages. There are 19 full-term interest-only loans (28.4%); 27 loans (48.0%) are partial interest only, and 25 loans (23.6%) are balloon loans.Property Type Diversity: The pool's largest property type is retail with an exposure of 25.7% of the pool balance, followed by multifamily at 19.1%. At issuance, the industrial property type exposure was higher than recent CMBS transactions at 11.0%; hotel exposure was higher than average at 17.0%.The 14 largest loan, the Westgate Shopping Center, had an upcoming lease expiration for the largest tenant at issuance.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.

A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.KEY RATING DRIVERSThe affirmations reflect overall stable performance of the pool since issuance. Pool loss expectations remain inline with expected losses from issuance. As of the November 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 0.3% to $999 million from $1 billion at issuance.High Fitch Leverage: The transaction has higher leverage than other recent Fitch-rated fixed rate multiborrower transactions.

There are 19 full-term interest-only loans (28.4%); 27 loans (48.0%) are partial interest only, and 25 loans (23.6%) are balloon loans.Property Type Diversity: The pool's largest property type is retail with an exposure of 25.7% of the pool balance, followed by multifamily at 19.1%. At issuance, the industrial property type exposure was higher than recent CMBS transactions at 11.0%; hotel exposure was higher than average at 17.0%.The fourteenth largest loan, the Westgate Shopping Center, had an upcoming lease expiration for the largest tenant at issuance. The TJ Maxx lease was extended from January 2017 to January 2027 according to the September 2016 rent roll.RATING SENSITIVITIESThe Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or asset level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio level metrics.

(1)Approximate,
  subject to a permitted variance of plus or minus 5%.
Â 

(2)The
  approximate initial credit support percentages set forth for the certificates are approximate
  and, for the Class A-1, Class A-2A, Class A-2B, Class A-3, Class A-4 and Class A-SB certificates,
  are represented in the aggregate.
Â 

(3)The
  assumed final distribution dates set forth in this prospectus have been determined on
  the basis of the assumptions described in âDescription of the CertificatesâAssumed
  Final Distribution Date; Rated Final Distribution Dateâ.
Â 

(4)The
  weighted average life and expected principal window during which distributions of principal
  would be received as set forth in the foregoing table with respect to each class of certificates
  having a certificate balance are based on the assumptions set forth under âYield
  and Maturity ConsiderationsâWeighted Average Lifeâ and on the assumptions
  that there are no prepayments, modifications or losses in respect of the mortgage loans
  and that there are no extensions or forbearances of maturity dates or anticipated repayment
  dates of the mortgage loans.
Â 

(5)The
  pass-through rates for the Class A-1, Class A-2A, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-SB, Class
  A-S, Class B and Class D certificates for any distribution date will, in each case, be
  a fixed rate per annum (described in the table as âFixedâ) equal to
  the pass-through rate set forth opposite such class in the table.
Â 

(6)The
  pass-through rates for the Class A-2B, Class C, Class E, Class F and Class G certificates
  for any distribution date will, in each case, be a variable rate per annum (described
  in the table as âWACâ) equal to the weighted average of the net mortgage
  interest rates on the mortgage loans for the related distribution date. For purposes
  of the calculation of the weighted average of the net mortgage interest rates on the
  mortgage loans for each distribution date, the mortgage interest rates will be adjusted
  as necessary to a 30/360 basis.
Â 

(7)The
  Class X-A certificates are notional amount certificates. The notional amount of the Class
  X-A certificates will be equal to the aggregate certificate balance of the Class A-1,
  Class A-2A, Class A-2B, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-SB and Class A-S certificates.
  The Class X-A certificates will not be entitled to distributions of principal.
Â 

(8)The
  pass-through rate for the Class X-A certificates for any distribution date will be a
  per annum rate equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the weighted average of the
  net mortgage interest rates on the mortgage loans for the related distribution date,
  over (b) the weighted average of the pass-through rates on the Class A-1, Class A-2A,
  Class A-2B, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-SB and Class A-S certificates for the related
  distribution date, weighted on the basis of their respective aggregate certificate balances
  outstanding immediately prior to that distribution date. For purposes of the calculation
  of the weighted average of the net mortgage interest rates on the mortgage loans for
  each distribution date, the mortgage interest rates will be adjusted as necessary to
  a 30/360 basis.
Â 

(9)The
  Class X-B certificates are notional amount certificates. The notional amount of the Class
  X-B certificates will be equal to the certificate balance of the Class B certificates
  outstanding from time to time. The Class X-B certificates will not be entitled to distributions
  of principal.
Â 

(10)The
  pass-through rate for the Class X-B certificates for any distribution date will be a
  per annum rate equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the weighted average of the
  net mortgage interest rates on the mortgage loans for the related distribution date,
  over (b) the pass-through rate on the Class B certificates for the related distribution
  date. For purposes of the calculation of the weighted average of the net mortgage interest
  rates on the mortgage loans for each distribution date, the mortgage interest rates will
  be adjusted as necessary to a 30/360 basis.
Â 

3
Â 
Â 

(11)The
  Class X-D certificates are notional amount certificates. The notional amount of the Class
  X-D certificates will be equal to the certificate balance of the Class D certificates
  outstanding from time to time. The Class X-D certificates will not be entitled to distributions
  of principal.
Â 

(12)The
  pass-through rate for the Class X-D certificates for any distribution date will be a
  per annum rate equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the weighted average of the
  net mortgage interest rates on the mortgage loans for the related distribution date,
  over (b) the pass-through rate on the Class D certificates for the related distribution
  date. For purposes of the calculation of the weighted average of the net mortgage interest
  rates on the mortgage loans for each distribution date, the mortgage interest rates will
  be adjusted as necessary to a 30/360 basis.
Â 

(13)The
  Class V certificates will not have a certificate balance, certificate notional amount,
  credit support, pass-through rate, rated final distribution date or rating. The Class
  V certificates will only be entitled to distributions of excess interest accrued on the
  mortgage loans with an anticipated repayment date. See âDescription of the Mortgage
  PoolâCertain Terms of the Mortgage LoansâARD Loanâ in this prospectus.
Â 

(14)The
  Class R certificates will not have a certificate balance, notional amount, credit support,
  pass-through rate, rated final distribution date or rating. The Class R certificates
  represent the residual interest in each Trust REMIC as further described in this prospectus.
  The Class R certificates will not be entitled to distributions of principal or interest.
Â 
The
Class X-D, Class D, Class E, Class F, Class G, Class R and Class V certificates are not offered by this prospectus. Any information

The special servicer will be primarily responsible for (i) making decisions and performing certain servicing functions with respect to such mortgage loans and related companion loans as to which a special servicing transfer event (such as a default or an imminent default) has occurred and (ii) in certain circumstances, reviewing, evaluating and providing or withholding consent as to certain major decisions relating to such mortgage loans and related companion loans for which a special servicing transfer event has not occurred, in each case pursuant to the pooling and servicing agreement for this

If the special servicer becomes a borrower party with respect to any mortgage loan (such mortgage loan referred to herein as an âexcluded special servicer loanâ), the special servicer will be required to resign as special servicer of that excluded special servicer loan. Prior to the occurrence of a control termination event under the pooling and servicing agreement, the directing certificateholder or the controlling class certificateholder on its behalf will be required to select a separate special servicer that is not a borrower party (referred to herein as an âexcluded special servicerâ) with respect to any excluded special servicer loan, unless such excluded special servicer loan is also an excluded loan. After the occurrence and during the continuance of a control termination event or if at any time the applicable excluded special servicer loan is also an excluded loan, the resigning special servicer will be required
to select the related excluded special servicer. See ââDirecting Certificateholderâ below and âPooling and Servicing AgreementâTermination of Master Servicer and Special Servicer for Causeâ. Any excluded special servicer will be required to perform all of the obligations of the special servicer and will be entitled to all special servicing compensation with respect to such excluded special servicer loan earned during such time as the related mortgage loan is an excluded special servicer loan.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â

See âPooling and Servicing AgreementâServicing of the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loansâ.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Operating Advisor
Â 
Pentalpha Surveillance LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, will be the operating advisor. The operating advisor will have certain review and reporting responsibilities with respect to the performance of the special servicer, and in certain circumstances may recommend to the certificateholders that the special servicer be replaced. The operating advisor will generally have no obligations or consultation rights as operating advisor under the pooling and servicing agreement for this transaction with respect to a non-serviced mortgage loan or any related REO property. See âTransaction PartiesâThe Operating Advisor and Asset Representations Reviewerâ and âPooling and Servicing AgreementâThe Operating Advisorâ.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Asset Representations
Â 
Â 

Reviewer
Â

Â 
Â 
Â 

Directing Certificateholder
Â 
The directing certificateholder will have certain consent and consultation rights in certain circumstances with respect to the mortgage loans (other than any non-serviced mortgage loan and any excluded loan), as further described in this prospectus. The directing certificateholder will generally be the controlling class certificateholder (or its representative) selected by more than a specified percentage of the controlling class certificateholders (by certificate balance, as certified by the certificate registrar from time to time as provided for in the pooling and servicing agreement).

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
An âexcluded loanâ is a mortgage loan or whole loan with respect to which the directing certificateholder or the holder of the majority of the controlling class certificates (by certificate principal balance), is a borrower, a mortgagor, a manager of a mortgaged property, the holder of a mezzanine loan that has accelerated the related mezzanine loan (subject to certain exceptions) or commenced foreclosure or enforcement proceedings against the equity collateral pledged to secure the related mezzanine loan, or any borrower party affiliate thereof. However, in certain circumstances (such as when no directing certificateholder has been appointed and no one holder owns the largest aggregate certificate balance of the controlling class) there may be no directing certificateholder even if there is a controlling class. See âPooling and Servicing AgreementâThe Directing Certificateholderâ.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
The controlling class will be the most subordinate class of the Class E, Class F and Class G certificates then-outstanding that has an aggregate certificate balance, as notionally reduced by any appraisal reductions allocable to such class, at least equal to 25% of the initial certificate balance of that class; provided, however, that during such time as the Class E certificates would be the controlling class, the holders of such certificates will have the right to irrevocably waive their right to appoint a directing certificateholder or to exercise any of the rights of the controlling class certificateholder. No class of certificates, other than as described above, will be eligible to act as the controlling class or appoint a directing certificateholder.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
It is anticipated that on the closing date, funds and/or accounts managed by Raith Capital Partners, LLC or an affiliate, will purchase the Class E, Class F, Class G and Class V certificates (and may purchase certain other classes of certificates), and that Raith Capital Partners,

Â 
Â 
Â 


Â 

28
Â 




Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
LLC or an affiliate, is expected to be appointed as the initial directing certificateholder with respect to each mortgage loan (other than any non-serviced mortgage loan).

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
With respect to the Empire Mall whole loan, the directing certificateholder under this securitization will only have limited consultation rights with respect to various servicing matters or mortgage loan modifications affecting both the mortgage loan and the related pari passu companion loans in the applicable split loan structure. Prior to the securitization of the Empire Mall controlling pari passu companion loan, the holder of the controlling companion loan will have certain consent rights under the pooling and servicing agreement for this transaction and, after the securitization of the controlling pari passu companion loan, the directing certificateholder under the pooling and servicing agreement entered into in connection with the related securitization will have certain consent and consultation rights with respect to the Empire Mall mortgage loan, which are expected to be substantially similar to those of the
directing certificateholder under the pooling and servicing agreement for this transaction. See âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâThe Whole LoansâThe Serviced Pari Passu Whole LoansâThe Empire Mall Whole Loanâ.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
The entity identified in the table titled âNon-Serviced Whole Loansâ under ââThe Mortgage PoolâWhole Loansâ below is the initial directing certificateholder under the pooling and servicing agreement for the indicated transaction and will have certain consent and consultation rights with respect to the related non-serviced whole loan, which are substantially similar, but not identical, to those of the directing certificateholder under the pooling and servicing agreement for this securitization, subject to similar appraisal mechanics. See âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâThe Whole LoansâThe Non-Serviced Pari Passu Whole Loansâ and âPooling and Servicing AgreementâServicing of the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loansâ.

Transaction Overview
Â Â 
On the closing date, each sponsor will sell
its respective mortgage loans to the depositor, which will in turn deposit the mortgage loans into the issuing entity, a common
law trust created on the closing date. The issuing entity will be formed by a pooling and servicing agreement to be entered into
among the depositor, the master servicer, the special servicer, the certificate administrator, the trustee, the operating advisor
and the asset representations reviewer.
Â 
The transfers of the mortgage loans from
the sponsors to the depositor and from the depositor to the issuing entity in exchange for the offered certificates are illustrated

The pass-through rates for the Class A-1, Class A-2A, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-SB, Class A-S and
Class B certificates for any distribution date will, in each case, be a fixed rate per annum equal to the pass-through rate
set forth opposite such class in the table. The pass-through rates for the Class A-2B and Class C certificates for any distribution
date will, in each case, be a variable rate per annum equal to the weighted average of the net mortgage interest rates on
the mortgage loans for the related distribution date. The pass-through rate for the Class X-A certificates for any distribution
date will be a per annum rate equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the weighted average of the net mortgage interest rates
on the mortgage loans for the related distribution date, over (b) the weighted average of the pass-through rates on the Class A-1,
Class A-2A, Class A-2B, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-SB and Class A-S certificates for the related distribution date, weighted
on the basis of their respective aggregate certificate balances outstanding immediately prior to that distribution date. The pass-through
rate for the Class X-B certificates for any distribution date will be a per annum rate equal to the excess, if any, of (a)
the weighted average

Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 


Â Â 

33
Â 
Â 



Â 
Â 
Â 
of the net mortgage interest rates on the mortgage loans for the related distribution date, over (b) the
pass-through rate on the Class B certificates for the related distribution date. For purposes of the calculation of the weighted
average of the net mortgage interest rates on the mortgage loans for each distribution date, the mortgage interest rates will be
adjusted as necessary to a 30/360 basis.

Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 

B. Interest Rate
Â 
Â 
Â 

Â Calculation Convention
Â 
Interest on the offered certificates at their applicable pass-through rates will be calculated based on a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, or a â30/360 basisâ.

Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
For purposes of calculating the pass-through rates on the Class X-A and Class X-B certificates and any other class of certificates that has a pass-through rate limited by, equal to or based on the weighted average net mortgage interest rate (which calculation does not include any companion loan interest rate), the mortgage loan interest rates will not reflect any default interest rate, any loan term modifications agreed to by the special servicer or any modifications resulting from a borrowerâs bankruptcy or insolvency.

Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
For purposes of calculating the pass-through rates on the offered certificates, the interest rate for each mortgage loan that accrues interest based on the actual number of days in each month and assuming a 360-day year, or an âactual/360 basisâ, will be recalculated, if necessary, so that the amount of interest that would accrue at that recalculated rate in the applicable month, calculated on a 30/360 basis, will equal the amount of interest that is required to be paid on that mortgage loan in that month, subject to certain adjustments as described in âDescription of the CertificatesâDistributionsâPass-Through Ratesâ and ââInterest Distribution Amountâ.

Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 

C. Servicing and
Â 
Â 
Â 

Â Administration Fees
Â 
The master servicer and special servicer are entitled to a servicing fee or a special servicing fee, as the case may be, from the interest payments on each mortgage loan (other than any non-serviced mortgage loan with respect to the special servicing fee only), the serviced pari passu companion loans and any related REO loans and, with respect to the special servicing fees, if the related loan interest payments (or other collections in respect of the related mortgage loan or mortgaged property) are insufficient, then from general collections on all mortgage loans.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
The servicing fee for each distribution date, including the master servicing
fee and the portion of the servicing fee payable to any primary servicer or subservicer, is

Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 


Â Â 

34
Â 
Â 



Â 
Â 
calculated on the outstanding principal amount of each mortgage loan (including any non-serviced mortgage loan) and the related serviced pari passu companion loans at the servicing fee rate equal to a per annum rate ranging from 0.0050% to 0.0550%.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
The special servicing fee for each distribution date is calculated based on the outstanding principal amount of each mortgage loan (other than any non-serviced mortgage loan) and the related serviced pari passu companion loans as to which a special servicing transfer event has occurred (including any REO loans), on a loan-by-loan basis at the special servicing fee rate equal to the greater of a per annum rate of 0.2500% and the per annum rate that would result in a special servicing fee of $3,500 for the related month. The special servicer will not be entitled to a special servicing fee with respect to any non-serviced mortgage loan.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
Any primary servicing fees or sub-servicing fees with respect to each mortgage loan (other than any non-serviced mortgage loan) and the related serviced pari passu companion loans will be paid by the master servicer or special servicer, respectively, out of the fees described above.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
The master servicer and special servicer are also entitled to additional fees and amounts, including income on the amounts held in certain accounts and certain permitted investments, liquidation fees and workout fees. See âPooling and Servicing AgreementâServicing and Other Compensation and Payment of Expensesâ.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
The certificate administrator fee for each distribution date is calculated on the outstanding principal amount of each mortgage loan (including any REO loan and non-serviced mortgage loan, but not any companion loan) at a per annum rate equal to 0.0060%. The trustee fee is payable by the certificate administrator from the certificate administrator fee and is equal to $210 per month.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
The operating advisor will be entitled to a fee on each distribution date calculated on the outstanding principal amount of each mortgage loan and REO loan (excluding each non-serviced mortgage loan and the Empire Mall whole loan, and excluding each companion loan) at a per annum rate equal to 0.0020%. The operating advisor will also be entitled under certain circumstances to a consulting fee.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
The asset representations reviewer will be entitled to an upfront fee of $5,000 on the closing date. As compensation for the performance of its routine duties, 


Â Â 

35
Â 


Â 



Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
the asset representations reviewer will be entitled to a fee on each distribution date calculated on the outstanding principal amount of each mortgage loan and REO loan (including each non-serviced mortgage loan, but excluding each companion loan) at a per annum rate equal to 0.00083%. Upon the completion of any asset review with respect to each delinquent loan, the asset representations reviewer will be entitled to a per loan fee in an amount described in âPooling and Servicing AgreementâServicing and Other Compensation and Payment of ExpensesâAsset Representations Reviewer Compensationâ.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
Each party to the pooling and servicing agreement will also be entitled to be reimbursed by the issuing entity for costs, expenses and liabilities borne by them in certain circumstances. Fees and expenses payable by the issuing entity to any party to the pooling and servicing agreement are generally payable prior to any distributions to certificateholders.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
Additionally, with respect to each distribution date, an amount equal to the product of 0.0005% per annum multiplied by the outstanding principal amount of each mortgage loan and any REO loan will be payable to CRE Finance CouncilÂ© as a license fee for use of their names and trademarks, including an investor reporting package. This fee will be payable prior to any distributions to certificateholders.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
Payment of the fees and reimbursement of the costs and expenses described above will generally have priority over the distribution of amounts payable to the certificateholders. See âPooling and Servicing AgreementâServicing and Other Compensation and Payment of Expensesâ and ââLimitation on Liability; Indemnificationâ.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
With respect to each non-serviced mortgage loan set forth in the table below, the master servicer under the related pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of that loan will be entitled to a primary servicing fee at a rate equal to a per annum rate set forth in the table below, and the special servicer under the related pooling and servicing agreement will be entitled to a special servicing fee at a rate equal to the per annum rate set forth below. In addition, each party to the pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of the related non-serviced whole loan will be entitled to receive other fees and reimbursements with respect to the related non-serviced mortgage loan in amounts, from sources, and at frequencies, that are similar, but not necessarily identical, to those described above and, in certain cases (for example, with respect to 

Â 
Â 
Â 



Â 

36
Â 
Â 



Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
unreimbursed special servicing fees and servicing advances with respect to the related non-serviced whole loan), such amounts will be reimbursable from general collections on the mortgage loans to the extent not recoverable from the related non-serviced whole loan and to the extent allocable to the related non-serviced mortgage loan pursuant to the related intercreditor agreement. See âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâThe Whole LoansâThe Non-Serviced Pari Passu Whole Loansâ and âPooling and Servicing AgreementâServicing of the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loansâ.

  loan, the Empire Mall mortgage loan will also be a non-serviced mortgage loan, and the master servicer and special servicer

Â 
Â 

C. Yield Maintenance Charges, 
Â 
Â 

Â Prepayment 
Â Premiums
Â 

Yield maintenance charges and prepayment premiums with respect to the mortgage loans will be allocated to the certificates as described in âDescription of the CertificatesâAllocation of Yield Maintenance Charges and Prepayment Premiumsâ.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
For an explanation of the calculation of yield maintenance charges, see âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâCertain Terms of the Mortgage Loansâ.

Â 
Â 
Â 

D. Subordination, 
Â 
Â 

Â Allocation of Losses 
Â and Certain Expenses
Â 

The chart below describes the manner in which the payment rights of certain classes of certificates will be senior or subordinate, as the case may be, to the payment rights of other classes of certificates. The chart shows the entitlement to receive principal and/or interest of certain classes of certificates (other than excess interest that accrues on each mortgage loan that has an anticipated repayment date) on any distribution date in descending order. It also shows the manner in which mortgage loan losses are allocated to certain classes of the certificates in ascending order (beginning with the non-offered certificates, other than the ClassÂ R and ClassÂ V certificates) to reduce the balance of each such class to zero; provided that no principal payments or mortgage loan losses will be allocated to the ClassÂ X-A, ClassÂ X-B, ClassÂ X-D, ClassÂ R or ClassÂ V certificates, although principal payments and mortgage loan losses may reduce the notional amounts of the
ClassÂ X-A, ClassÂ X-B and ClassÂ X-D certificates and, therefore, the amount of interest they accrue.

Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
(1)
The ClassÂ X-A, X-B and X-D certificates are interest-only
  certificates.

Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
(2)
The ClassÂ X-D certificates are non-offered certificates.

Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
(3)
Other than the Class X-D certificates.




Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
Other than the subordination of certain classes of certificates, as described above, no other form of credit enhancement will be available for the benefit of the holders of the offered certificates.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
The notional amount of the ClassÂ X-A certificates will be reduced by the amount of principal losses or principal payments, if any, allocated to the ClassÂ A-1, ClassÂ A-2A, ClassÂ A-2B, ClassÂ A-3, ClassÂ A-4, ClassÂ A-SB and ClassÂ A-S certificates. The notional amount of the ClassÂ X-B certificates will be reduced by the amount of principal losses or principal payments, if any, allocated to the ClassÂ B certificates.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
To the extent funds are available on a subsequent distribution date for distribution on your offered certificates, you will be reimbursed for any losses allocated to your offered certificates with interest at the pass-through rate on those offered certificates in accordance with the distribution priorities.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
See âDescription of the CertificatesâSubordination; Allocation of Realized Lossesâ for more detailed information regarding the subordination provisions applicable to the certificates and the allocation of losses to the certificates.

Â 
Â 

E. Shortfalls in Available
Â 
Â 
Â 

Â Funds
Â 
The following types of shortfalls in available funds will reduce distributions to the classes of certificates with the lowest payment priorities:

Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
Â·
shortfalls resulting from the payment of special servicing fees and other additional compensation that the special servicer is entitled to receive;

Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
Â·
shortfalls resulting from interest on advances made by the master servicer, the special servicer or the trustee (to the extent not covered by late payment charges or default interest paid by the related borrower);

Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
Â·
shortfalls resulting from the application of appraisal reductions to reduce interest advances;

Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
Â·
shortfalls resulting from extraordinary expenses of the issuing entity including indemnification payments payable to the parties to the pooling and servicing agreement;

Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
Â·
shortfalls resulting from a modification of a mortgage loanâs interest rate or principal balance; and

Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
Â·
shortfalls resulting from other unanticipated or default-related expenses of the issuing entity.




Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
In addition, prepayment interest shortfalls on the mortgage loans that are not covered by certain compensating interest payments made by the master servicer are required to be allocated among the classes of certificates (other than the ClassÂ V certificates) entitled to interest, on a pro rata basis, to reduce the amount of interest payable on each such class of certificates to the extent described in this prospectus. See âDescription of the CertificatesâPrepayment Interest Shortfallsâ.

Â 
Â 
Â 

F. Excess Interest
Â 
On each distribution date, any excess interest in respect of the increase in the interest rate on any mortgage loan with an anticipated repayment date after the related anticipated repayment date to the extent actually collected and applied as interest during a collection period will be distributed to the holders of the ClassÂ V certificates on the related distribution date. This excess interest will not be available to make distributions to any other class of certificates or to provide credit support for other classes of certificates or offset any interest shortfalls or to pay any other amounts to any other party under the pooling and servicing agreement.

Â

Â 
Â 
Â 

Advances
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
Â 

A. P&I Advances
Â 
The master servicer is required to advance a delinquent periodic payment on each mortgage loan (including each non-serviced mortgage loan) or any REO loan (other than any portion of a REO loan related to a companion loan), unless in each case, the master servicer or the special servicer determines that the advance would be non-recoverable. Neither the master servicer nor the trustee will be required to advance balloon payments due at maturity or an anticipated repayment date in excess of the regular periodic payment, interest in excess of a mortgage loanâs regular interest rate, default interest, late payment charges, prepayment premiums or yield maintenance charges.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
The amount of the interest portion of any advance will be subject to reduction to the extent that an appraisal reduction of the related mortgage loan has occurred (and with respect to any mortgage loan that is part of a whole loan, to the extent such appraisal reduction amount is allocated to the related mortgage loan). There may be other circumstances in which the master servicer will not be required to advance a full month of principal and/or interest. If the master servicer fails to make a required advance, the trustee will be required to make the advance, unless the trustee determines that the advance would be non-recoverable. If an interest advance is made by the master servicer, the master servicer will not advance the portion of interest that constitutes its servicing fee, but will advance the portion of interest that constitutes the monthly fees payable to the certificate administrator, the trustee, the operating advisor and the asset representations reviewer
and the CREFCÂ® license fee.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
None of the master servicer, the special servicer or the trustee will make, or be permitted to make, any principal or interest advance with respect to any companion loan that is not held by the issuing entity.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
See âPooling and Servicing AgreementâAdvancesâ.

Â 
Â 
Â 

B. Property Protection
Â 
Â 

Â Advances
Â 
The master servicer may be required to make advances with respect to mortgage loans and related companion loans that it is required to service to pay delinquent real estate taxes, assessments and hazard insurance premiums and similar expenses necessary to:




Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
Â·
protect and maintain (and in the case of REO properties, lease and manage) the related mortgaged property;

Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 


Â 

43
Â 
Â 




Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
Â·
maintain the lien on the related mortgaged property; and/or

Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
Â·
enforce the related mortgage loan documents.




Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
The special servicer will have no obligation to make any property protection advances (although it may elect to make them in an emergency circumstance). If the special servicer makes a property protection advance, the master servicer will be required to reimburse the special servicer for that advance (unless the master servicer determines that the advance would be non-recoverable, in which case the advance will be reimbursed out of the collection account) and the master servicer will be deemed to have made that advance as of the date made by the special servicer.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
If the master servicer fails to make a required advance of this type, the trustee will be required to make this advance. None of the master servicer, the special servicer or the trustee is required to advance amounts determined by such party to be non-recoverable.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
See âPooling and Servicing AgreementâAdvancesâ.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
With respect to a non-serviced mortgage loan, the master servicer (and the trustee, as applicable) under the pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of that non-serviced whole loan will be required to make similar advances with respect to delinquent real estate taxes, assessments and hazard insurance premiums as described above.

Â 
Â 
Â 

C. Interest on Advances
Â 
The master servicer, the special servicer and the trustee, as applicable, will be entitled to interest on the above described advances at the âPrime Rateâ as published in The Wall Street Journal, as described in this prospectus. Interest accrued on outstanding advances may result in reductions in amounts otherwise payable on the certificates. Neither the master servicer nor the trustee will be entitled to interest on advances made with respect to principal and interest due on a mortgage loan until the related due date has passed and any grace period for late payments applicable to the mortgage loan has expired. See âPooling and Servicing AgreementâAdvancesâ.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
With respect to a non-serviced mortgage loan, the applicable makers of advances under the related pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of the related non-serviced whole loan will similarly be entitled to interest on advances, and any accrued and unpaid interest on property protection advances made in respect of such non-serviced mortgage loan may be

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 

44
Â 
Â 




Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
reimbursed from general collections on the other mortgage loans included in the issuing entity to the extent not recoverable from such non-serviced mortgage loan and to the extent allocable to a non-serviced mortgage loan in accordance with the related intercreditor agreement.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
The Mortgage Pool

Â 
Â 
Â 

The Mortgage Pool
Â 
The issuing entityâs primary assets will be 71 fixed rate commercial mortgage loans, each evidenced by one or more promissory notes secured by first mortgages, deeds of trust, deeds to secure debt or similar security instruments on the fee and/or leasehold estate of the related borrower in 115 commercial, multifamily or manufactured housing community properties. See âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâGeneralâ.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
The aggregate principal balance of the mortgage loans as of the cut-off date will be approximately $1,002,201,025.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
Whole Loans

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
Unless otherwise expressly stated in this prospectus, the term âmortgage loanâ refers to each of the 71 commercial mortgage loans to be held by the issuing entity. Of the mortgage loans, each of the loans in the table below is part of a larger whole loan, each of which is comprised of the related mortgage loan and one or more loans that are pari passu in right of payment to the related mortgage loan (each referred to in this prospectus as a âpari passu companion loanâ or a âcompanion loanâ). The companion loans, together with their related mortgage loans, are each referred to in this prospectus as a âwhole loanâ.

(1)Does not reflect the Empire
  Mall mortgage loan, which is part of a split loan structure comprised of five mortgage
  notes, including four pari passu companion loans that may be included in future
  securitizations. After the securitization of the Empire Mall controlling pari passu
  companion loan, the Empire Mall mortgage loan will also be a non-serviced mortgage
  loan, and the master servicer and special servicer under the related pooling and servicing
  agreement for that securitization transaction will be entitled to a primary servicing
  fee and special servicing fee, respectively, as will be set forth in such related pooling
  and servicing agreement.



Â 
Â

For further information regarding the whole loans, see âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâThe Whole Loansâ, and for information regarding the servicing of the non-serviced whole loans, see âPooling and Servicing AgreementâServicing of the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loansâ.

Mortgage Loan Characteristics

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
The following tables set forth certain anticipated characteristics of the mortgage loans as of the cut-off date (unless otherwise indicated). Except as specifically provided in this prospectus, various information presented in this prospectus (including loan-to-value ratios, debt service coverage ratios, debt yields and cut-off date balances per net rentable square foot, pad, room or unit, as applicable) with respect to any mortgage loan with a pari passu companion loan is calculated including the principal balance and debt service payment of the related pari passu companion loan(s), but is calculated excluding the principal balance and debt service payment of any other subordinate debt

Â 
encumbering the related mortgaged property or any related mezzanine debt or preferred equity.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
The sum of the numerical data in any column may not equal the indicated total due to rounding. Unless otherwise indicated, all figures and percentages presented in this âSummary of Termsâ are calculated as described under âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâAdditional Informationâ and, unless otherwise indicated, such figures and percentages are approximate and in each case, represent the indicated figure or percentage of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date. The principal balance of each mortgage loan as of the cut-off date assumes the timely receipt of principal scheduled to be paid on or before the cut-off date and no defaults, delinquencies or prepayments on, or modifications of, any mortgage loan on or prior to the cut-off date. Whenever percentages and other information in this prospectus are presented on the mortgaged property level rather than the mortgage loan level, the information for mortgage
loans secured by more than one mortgaged property (or part of a group of more than one cross-collateralized mortgage loan) is based on allocated loan amounts as stated in AnnexÂ A-1.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
The mortgage loans will have the following approximate characteristics as of the cut-off date:

In the case of 4 mortgaged properties identified as Harbor Pointe
  Apartments, Anchorage Marriott Downtown, Aloft Nashville West End and Westgate Shopping Center on AnnexÂ A-1 to this prospectus,
  securing or partially securing 4 mortgage loans representing approximately 13.4% of the aggregate principal balance of the
  pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date by allocated loan amount, the loan-to-value ratio was calculated based upon
  a hypothetical valuation other than an âas-isâ value. The remaining mortgage loans were calculated using âas-isâ
  values as described under âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâCertain Calculations and Definitionsâ
  in this prospectus. In the case of the Mortgage Loan identified as Heritage Industrial Portfolio on Annex A-1 to this prospectus,
  the âas-isâ appraised value reflects a premium attributed to the value of the related Mortgaged Properties as
  a whole. For further information, see AnnexÂ A-1 to this prospectus. See also âRisk FactorsâRisks Relating
  to the Mortgage LoansâAppraisals May Not Reflect Current or Future Market Value of Each Propertyâ and âDescription

In the case of the 6 mortgaged properties identified as Empire Mall,
  Harbor Pointe Apartments, Heritage Industrial Portfolio, Anchorage Marriott Downtown, Harvey Building Products Portfolio and
  JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot on AnnexÂ A-1 to this prospectus, collectively representing approximately 26.7% of
  the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date, each of which has one or more pari
  passu companion loans that are not included in the issuing entity, the debt service coverage ratios, loan-to-value ratios
  and debt yield have been calculated including the related pari passu companion loans. In general, when a mortgage loan
  is cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with one or more other mortgage loans, we present loan-to-value ratio, debt service
  coverage ratio and debt yield information for the cross-collateralized group on an aggregate basis in the manner described
  in this prospectus.Â Â On an individual basis, without regard to the cross-collateralization feature, any mortgage
  loan that is part of a cross-collateralized group of mortgage loans may have a higher loan-to-value ratio, lower debt service
  coverage ratio and/or lower debt yield than is presented in this prospectus.

Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
(6)
Debt service coverage ratios are calculated using the average of
  the principal and interest payments for the first twelve payment periods of the mortgage loan following the cut-off date,
  provided that (i)Â in the case of a mortgage loan that provides for interest-only payments through maturity or
  its anticipated repayment date, as applicable, such items are calculated based on the interest payments scheduled to be due
  on the first due date following the cut-off date and the 11 due dates thereafter for such mortgage loan and (ii)Â in the
  case of a mortgage loan that provides for an initial interest-only period that ends prior to maturity or its anticipated repayment
  date, as applicable, and provides for scheduled amortization payments thereafter, such items are calculated based on the monthly
  payment of principal and interest payable for the 12 payment periods immediately following the expiration of the interest-only
  period.

Â 


Â 
Â 
All of the mortgage loans accrue interest on an actual/360 basis.

Â 
Â 

Modified and RefinancedÂ Loans
Â 
As of the cut-off date, none of the mortgage loans were modified due to a delinquency, nor were any of the mortgage loans refinancings of loans in default at the time of refinancing and/or otherwise involved discounted

Loans Underwritten

Â 

Based on Projections
Â 
Â 

of Future Income
Â 
With respect to 53 of the mortgaged properties, representing approximately 10.4% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date (by allocated loan amount), such mortgaged properties (i)Â were constructed or the subject of a major renovation that was completed within 12 calendar months prior to the cut-off date and, therefore, the related mortgaged property has no prior operating history, (ii)Â have a borrower or an affiliate under the related mortgage loan that acquired the related mortgaged property within 12 calendar months prior to the cut-off date and such borrower or affiliate was unable to provide the related mortgage loan seller with historical financial information for such acquired mortgaged property or (iii)Â are single tenant properties subject to triple-net leases with the related tenant where the related borrower did not provide the related mortgage loan seller with historical financial information for
the related mortgaged property.

Certain Variances from
Â 
Â 

 Underwriting Standards
Â 
Certain of the mortgage loans may vary from the underwriting guidelines described under âTransaction PartiesâThe Sponsors and Mortgage Loan Sellersâ with respect to the related third party materials requirements.Â Â With respect to twoÂ (2) mortgage loans representing approximately 8.6% of the initial pool balance, there were exceptions from Principal Commercial Capitalâs underwriting guidelines with respect to underwritten occupancy being greater than 80% and additionally, with respect to oneÂ (1) of the aforementioned mortgage loans representing approximately 6.1% of the initial pool balance, there was an exception from Principal Commercial Capitalâs underwriting guidelines with respect to ADA compliance.Â Â With respect to twoÂ (2) mortgage loans representing in the aggregate approximately 3.8% of the initial pool balance, the underwritten management fee is less than provided in Wells Fargo Bank, National Associationâs underwriting guidelines.Â Â See

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
compensate the issuing entity in the event of a document defect or a breach of a representation and warranty made by the related mortgage loan seller with respect to the mortgage loan in the related mortgage loan purchase agreement that materially and adversely affects the value of the mortgage loan, the value of the related mortgaged property or the interests of any certificateholders in the mortgage loan or mortgaged property or causes the mortgage loan to be other than a âqualified mortgageâ within the meaning of SectionÂ 860G(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (but without regard to the rule of Treasury regulations SectionÂ 1.860G-2(f)(2) that causes a defective loan to be treated as a âqualified mortgageâ). See âDescription of the Mortgage Loan Purchase AgreementsâGeneralâ.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Sale of Defaulted Loans
Â 
Pursuant to the pooling and servicing agreement, under certain circumstances the special servicer is required to use reasonable efforts to solicit offers for defaulted serviced mortgage loans (or a defaulted serviced whole loan and/or related REO properties) and, in the absence of a cash offer at least equal to its outstanding principal balance plus all accrued and unpaid interest and outstanding costs and expenses and certain other amounts under the pooling and servicing agreement, may accept the first (and, if multiple offers are received, the highest) cash offer from any person that constitutes a fair price for the defaulted serviced mortgage loan (or defaulted whole loan) or related REO property, determined as described in âPooling and Servicing AgreementâRealization Upon Mortgage Loansâ and ââSale of Defaulted Loans and REO Propertiesâ, unless the special servicer determines, in accordance with the servicing standard (and subject
to the requirements of any related intercreditor agreement), that rejection of such offer would be in the best interests of the certificateholders and the related companion loan holders (as a collective whole as if such certificateholders and such companion loan holders constituted a single lender).

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
With respect to each non-serviced mortgage loan, if a related pari passu companion loan becomes a defaulted mortgage
loan under the pooling and servicing agreement for the related pari passu companion loan and the special servicer under
the related pooling and servicing agreement for the related pari passu companion loan determines to sell such pari passu
companion loan, then that special servicer will be required to sell such non-serviced mortgage loan together with the related
pari passu companion loan in a

manner similar to that described above. See âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâThe Whole Loansâ.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Tax Status
Â 
Elections will be made to treat designated portions of the issuing entity (exclusive of interest that is deferred after the anticipated repayment date of each mortgage loan with an anticipated repayment date and the excess interest distribution account) as two separate REMICs â the lower-tier REMIC and the upper-tier REMIC â for federal income tax purposes.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
In addition, the portions of the issuing entity consisting of the excess interest accrued on the mortgage loan with an anticipated repayment date, beneficial ownership of which is represented by the ClassÂ V certificates will be treated as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes.

Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
Pertinent federal income tax consequences of an investment in the offered certificates include:

Ratings
Â 
The offered certificates will not be issued unless each of the offered classes receives a credit rating from one or more of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations engaged by the depositor to rate the offered certificates. The decision not to engage one or more other rating agencies in the rating of certain classes of certificates to be issued in connection with this transaction, may negatively impact the liquidity, market value and regulatory characteristics of those classes of certificates. Neither the depositor nor any other person or entity will have any duty to notify you if any other nationally recognized statistical rating organization issues, or delivers notice of its intention to issue, unsolicited ratings on one or more classes of certificates after the date of this prospectus.

Â 
Â 
Risk
Factors
Â 
You should carefully consider the following
risks before making an investment decision. In particular, distributions on your certificates will depend on payments received
on, and other recoveries with respect to the mortgage loans. Therefore, you should carefully consider the risk factors relating
to the mortgage loans and the mortgaged properties.
Â 
If any of the following events or circumstances
identified as risks actually occur or materialize, your investment could be materially and adversely affected. We note that additional
risks and uncertainties not presently known to us may also impair your investment.
Â 
This prospectus also contains forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking
statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this prospectus.
Â 
The Certificates May
Not Be a Suitable Investment for You
Â 
The certificates will not be suitable investments
for all investors. In particular, you should not purchase any class of certificates unless you understand and are able to bear
the risk that the yield to maturity and the aggregate amount and timing of distributions on the certificates will be subject to
material variability from period to period and give rise to the potential for significant loss over the life of the certificates.
The interaction of the foregoing factors and their effects are impossible to predict and are likely to change from time to time.
As a result, an investment in the certificates involves substantial risks and uncertainties and should be considered only by sophisticated
institutional investors with substantial investment experience with similar types of securities and who have conducted appropriate
due diligence on the mortgage loans, the mortgaged properties and the certificates.
Â 
Combination or âLayeringâ
of Multiple Risks May Significantly Increase Risk of Loss
Â 
Although the various risks discussed in
this prospectus are generally described separately, you should consider the potential effects of the interplay of multiple risk
factors. Where more than one significant risk factor is present, the risk of loss to an investor in the certificates may be significantly
increased.
Â 
Risks Related to Market
Conditions and Other External Factors
Â 
The Volatile Economy, Credit
Crisis and Downturn in the Real Estate Market Have Adversely Affected and May Continue To Adversely Affect the Value of CMBS
Â 
In recent years, the real estate and securitization
markets, including the market for commercial mortgage-backed securities (âCMBSâ), experienced significant dislocations,
illiquidity and volatility. We cannot assure you that another dislocation in CMBS will not occur.
Â 
Any economic downturn may adversely affect
the financial resources of borrowers under commercial mortgage loans and may result in their inability to make payments on, or
refinance, their outstanding mortgage debt when due or to sell their mortgaged properties
Â 

57
Â 
Â 
for an aggregate amount sufficient to
pay off the outstanding debt when due. As a result, distributions of principal and interest on your certificates, and the value
of your certificates, could be adversely affected.
Â 
Other Events May Affect
the Value and Liquidity of Your Investment
Â 
Moreover, other types of events, domestic
or international, may affect general economic conditions and financial markets:
Â 

Â·Wars, revolts, terrorist attacks, armed conflicts, energy
supply or price disruptions, political crises, natural disasters and man-made disasters may have an adverse effect on the mortgaged
properties and/or your certificates; and

Â 

Â·Trading activity associated with indices of CMBS may
drive spreads on those indices wider than spreads on CMBS, thereby resulting in a decrease in value of such CMBS, including your
certificates, and spreads on those indices may be affected by a variety of factors, and may or may not be affected for reasons
involving the commercial and multifamily real estate markets and may be affected for reasons that are unknown and cannot be discerned.

Â 
You should consider that the foregoing factors
may adversely affect the performance of the mortgage loans and accordingly the performance of the offered certificates.
Â 
Risks Relating to
the Mortgage Loans
Â 
Mortgage Loans Are Non-Recourse
and Are Not Insured or Guaranteed
Â 
The mortgage loans are not insured or guaranteed
by any person or entity, governmental or otherwise.
Â 
Investors should treat each mortgage loan
as a non-recourse loan. If a default occurs, recourse generally may be had only against the specific mortgaged properties and other
assets that have been pledged to secure the mortgage loan. Consequently, payment prior to maturity is dependent primarily on the
sufficiency of the net operating income of the mortgaged property. Payment at maturity or anticipated repayment date is primarily
dependent upon the market value of the mortgaged property or the borrowerâs ability to refinance or sell the mortgaged property.
Â 
Although the mortgage loans generally are
non-recourse in nature, certain mortgage loans contain non-recourse carveouts for liabilities such as liabilities as a result of
fraud by the borrower, certain voluntary insolvency proceedings or other matters. Certain mortgage loans set forth under âDescription
of the Mortgage PoolâNon-Recourse Carveout Limitationsâ either do not contain non-recourse carveouts or contain
material limitations to non-recourse carveouts. Often these obligations are guaranteed by an affiliate of the related borrower,
although liability under any such guaranty may be capped or otherwise limited in amount or scope. Furthermore, certain guarantors
may be foreign entities or individuals which, while subject to the domestic governing law provisions in the guaranty and related
mortgage loan documents, could nevertheless require enforcement of any judgment in relation to a guaranty in a foreign jurisdiction,
which could, in turn, cause a significant time delay or result in the inability to enforce the guaranty under foreign law. Additionally,
the guarantorâs net worth and liquidity may be less (and in some cases, materially less) than amounts due under the related
mortgage loan or the guarantorâs sole asset may be its interest in the related borrower. Certain mortgage loans may have
the benefit of a general payment guaranty of a portion of the indebtedness under the mortgage loan. In all cases,
Â 


58
Â 
Â 
however, the
mortgage loans should be considered to be non-recourse obligations because neither the depositor nor the sponsors make any representation
or warranty as to the obligation or ability of any borrower or guarantor to pay any deficiencies between any foreclosure proceeds
and the mortgage loan indebtedness.
Â 
Risks of Commercial and
Multifamily Lending Generally
Â 
The mortgage loans will be secured by various
income-producing commercial and multifamily properties. The repayment of a commercial or multifamily loan is typically dependent
upon the ability of the related mortgaged property to produce cash flow through the collection of rents. Even the liquidation value
of a commercial property is determined, in substantial part, by the capitalization of the propertyâs ability to produce cash
flow. However, net operating income can be volatile and may be insufficient to cover debt service on the loan at any given time.
Â 
The net operating incomes and property values
of the mortgaged properties may be adversely affected by a large number of factors. Some of these factors relate to the properties
themselves, such as:
Â 

Â·the age, design and construction quality of the properties;

Â 

Â·perceptions regarding the safety, convenience and attractiveness
of the properties;

Â 

Â·the characteristics and desirability of the area where
the property is located;

Â 

Â·the strength and nature of the local economy, including
labor costs and quality, tax environment and quality of life for employees;

Â 

Â·the proximity and attractiveness of competing properties;

Â 

Â·the adequacy of the propertyâs management and maintenance;

Â 

Â·increases in interest rates, real estate taxes and operating
expenses at the property and in relation to competing properties;

Â 

Â·an increase in the capital expenditures needed to maintain
the properties or make improvements;

Â 

Â·the dependence upon a single tenant or concentration
of tenants in a particular business or industry;

Â 

Â·a decline in the businesses operated by tenants or in
their financial condition;

Â 

Â·an increase in vacancy rates; and

Â 

Â·a decline in rental rates as leases are renewed or entered
into with new tenants.

Â 
Other factors are more general in nature, such as:
Â 

Â·national or regional economic conditions, including plant
closings, military base closings, industry slowdowns, oil and/or gas drilling facility slowdowns or closings and unemployment
rates;

Â 

Â·local real estate conditions, such as an oversupply of
competing properties, retail space, office space, multifamily housing or hotel capacity;

Â 

59
Â 
Â 


Â·demographic factors;

Â 

Â·consumer confidence;

Â 

Â·consumer tastes and preferences;

Â 

Â·political factors;

Â 

Â·environmental factors;

Â 

Â·seismic activity risk;

Â 

Â·retroactive changes in building codes;

Â 

Â·changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments;

Â 

Â·location of certain mortgaged properties in less densely
populated or less affluent areas; and

Â 

Â·the public perception of safety for customers and clients.

Â 
The volatility of net operating income will
be influenced by many of the foregoing factors, as well as by:
Â 

Â·the length of tenant leases (including that in certain
cases, all or substantially all of the tenants, or one or more sole, anchor or other major tenants, at a particular mortgaged
property may have leases that expire or permit the tenant(s) to terminate its lease during the term of the loan);

Â 

Â·the quality and creditworthiness of tenants;

Â 

Â·tenant defaults;

Â 

Â·in the case of rental properties, the rate at which new
rentals occur; and

Â 

Â·the propertyâs âoperating leverageâ,
which is generally the percentage of total property expenses in relation to revenue, the ratio of fixed operating expenses to
those that vary with revenues, and the level of capital expenditures required to maintain the property and to retain or replace
tenants.

Â 
A decline in the real estate market or in
the financial condition of a major tenant will tend to have a more immediate effect on the net operating income of properties with
relatively higher operating leverage or short term revenue sources, such as short term or month to month leases, and may lead to
higher rates of delinquency or defaults.
Â 
Performance of the Mortgage
Loans Will Be Highly Dependent on the Performance of Tenants and Tenant Leases
Â 
General
Â 
Any tenant may, from time to time, experience
a downturn in its business, which may weaken its financial condition and result in a reduction or failure to make rental payments
when due. If tenantsâ sales were to decline, percentage rents may decline and, further, tenants may be unable to pay their
base rent or other occupancy costs. If a tenant defaults in its obligations to a property owner, that property owner may experience
delays in enforcing its rights as lessor and may incur substantial costs and experience significant
Â 

60
Â 
Â 
delays associated with protecting
its investment, including costs incurred in renovating and reletting the property.
Â 
Additionally, the income from, and market
value of, the mortgaged properties leased to various tenants would be adversely affected if:
Â 

Â·space in the mortgaged properties could not be leased
or re-leased or substantial re-leasing costs were required and/or the cost of performing landlord obligations under existing leases
materially increased;

Â 

Â·leasing or re-leasing is restricted by exclusive rights
of tenants to lease the mortgaged properties or other covenants not to lease space for certain uses or activities, or covenants
limiting the types of tenants to which space may be leased;

Â 

Â·a significant tenant were to become a debtor in a bankruptcy
case;

Â 

Â·rental payments could not be collected for any other
reason; or

Â 

Â·a borrower fails to perform its obligations under a lease
resulting in the related tenant having a right to terminate such lease.

Â 
Certain tenants currently may be in a rent
abatement period. We cannot assure you that such tenants will be in a position to pay full rent when the abatement period expires.
We cannot assure you that the net operating income contributed by the mortgaged properties will remain at its current or past levels.
Â 
A Tenant Concentration May
Result in Increased Losses
Â 
Mortgaged properties that are owner-occupied
or leased to a single tenant, or a tenant that makes up a significant portion of the rental income, also are more susceptible to
interruptions of cash flow if that tenantâs business operations are negatively impacted or if such tenant fails to renew
its lease. This is so because:
Â 

Â·the financial effect of the absence of rental income
may be severe;

Â 

Â·more time may be required to re-lease the space; and

Â 

Â·substantial capital costs may be incurred to make the
space appropriate for replacement tenants.

Â 
In the event of a default by that tenant,
if the related lease expires prior to the mortgage loan maturity date and the related tenant fails to renew its lease or if such
tenant exercises an early termination option, there would likely be an interruption of rental payments under the lease and, accordingly,
insufficient funds available to the borrower to pay the debt service on the mortgage loan. In certain cases where the tenant owns
the improvements on the mortgaged property, the related borrower may be required to purchase such improvements in connection with
the exercise of its remedies.
Â 
With respect to certain of these mortgaged
properties that are leased to a single tenant, the related leases may expire prior to, or soon after, the maturity dates of the
mortgage loans or the related tenant may have the right to terminate the lease prior to the maturity date of the mortgage loan.
If the current tenant does not renew its lease on comparable economic terms to the expired lease, if a single tenant terminates
its lease or if a suitable replacement tenant does not enter into a new lease on similar economic terms, there could be a negative
impact on the payments on the related mortgage loan.
Â 

61
Â 

Â 
A deterioration in the financial condition
of a tenant, the failure of a tenant to renew its lease or the exercise by a tenant of an early termination right can be particularly
significant if a mortgaged property is owner-occupied, leased to a single tenant, or if any tenant makes up a significant portion
of the rental income at the mortgaged property.
Â 
Concentrations of particular tenants among
the mortgaged properties or within a particular business or industry at one or multiple mortgaged properties increase the possibility
that financial problems with such tenants or such business or industry sectors could affect the mortgage loans. In addition, the
mortgage loans may be adversely affected if a tenant at the mortgaged property is highly specialized, or dependent on a single
industry or only a few customers for its revenue. See ââTenant Bankruptcy Could Result in a Rejection of the Related
Leaseâ below, and âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâTenant IssuesâTenant Concentrationsâ
for information on tenant concentrations in the mortgage pool.
Â 
Mortgaged Properties Leased
to Multiple Tenants Also Have Risks
Â 
If a mortgaged property has multiple tenants,
re-leasing expenditures may be more frequent than in the case of mortgaged properties with fewer tenants, thereby reducing the
cash flow available for payments on the related mortgage loan. Multi-tenant mortgaged properties also may experience higher continuing
vacancy rates and greater volatility in rental income and expenses. See AnnexÂ A-1 for tenant lease expiration dates for the
5 largest tenants at each mortgaged property.
Â 
Mortgaged Properties Leased
to Borrowers or Borrower Affiliated Entities Also Have Risks
Â 
If a mortgaged property is leased in whole
or substantial part to the borrower under the mortgage loan or to an affiliate of the borrower, there may be conflicts of interest.
For instance, it is more likely a landlord will waive lease conditions for an affiliated tenant than it would for an unaffiliated
tenant. We cannot assure you that the conflicts of interest arising where a borrower is affiliated with a tenant at a mortgaged
property will not adversely impact the value of the related mortgage loan.
Â 
In certain cases, an affiliated lessee may
be a tenant under a master lease with the related borrower, under which the tenant is obligated to make rent payments but does
not occupy any space at the mortgaged property. Master leases in these circumstances may be used to bring occupancy to a âstabilizedâ
level with the intent of finding additional tenants to occupy some or all of the master leased space, but may not provide additional
economic support for the mortgage loan. If a mortgaged property is leased in whole or substantial part to the borrower or to an
affiliate of the borrower, a deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or its affiliates could significantly affect
the borrowerâs ability to perform under the mortgage loan as it would directly interrupt the cash flow from the mortgaged
property if the borrowerâs or its affiliateâs financial condition worsens. We cannot assure you that any space leased
by a borrower or an affiliate of the borrower will eventually be occupied by third party tenants.
Â 
See âDescription of the Mortgage
PoolâTenant IssuesâAffiliated Leasesâ for information on properties leased in whole or in part to borrowers
and their affiliates.
Â 
Tenant Bankruptcy Could Result
in a Rejection of the Related Lease
Â 
The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major
tenant or a number of smaller tenants, such as in retail properties, may have an adverse impact on the mortgaged properties affected
and
Â 

62
Â 
Â 
the income produced by such mortgaged properties. Under the federal bankruptcy code, a tenant has the option of assuming or
rejecting or, subject to certain conditions, assuming and assigning to a third party, any unexpired lease. If the tenant rejects
the lease, the landlordâs claim for breach of the lease would (absent collateral securing the claim) be treated as a general
unsecured claim against the tenant and a lessorâs damages for lease rejection are generally subject to certain limitations.
We cannot assure you that tenants of the mortgaged properties will continue making payments under their leases or that tenants
will not file for bankruptcy protection in the future or, if any tenants do file, that they will continue to make rental payments
in a timely manner. See âCertain Legal Aspects of Mortgage LoansâBankruptcy Lawsâ. See âDescription
of the Mortgage PoolâLoan Purpose; Default History, Bankruptcy Issues and Other Proceedingsâ for information regarding
bankruptcy issues with respect to certain mortgage loans.
Â 
In the case of certain mortgage loans included
in the mortgage pool, it may be possible that the related master lease could be construed in a bankruptcy as a financing lease
or other arrangement under which the related master lessee (and/or its affiliates) would be deemed as effectively the owner of
the related mortgaged property, rather than a tenant, which could result in potentially adverse consequences for the trust, as
the holder of such mortgage loan, including a potentially greater risk of an unfavorable plan of reorganization and competing claims
of creditors of the related master lessee and/or its affiliates. See âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâTenant IssuesâAffiliated
Leasesâ.
Â 
Leases That Are Not Subordinated
to the Lien of the Mortgage or Do Not Contain Attornment Provisions May Have an Adverse Impact at Foreclosure
Â 
In certain jurisdictions, if tenant leases
are subordinated to the liens created by the mortgage but do not contain attornment provisions that require the tenant to recognize
a successor owner, the tenants may terminate their leases upon the transfer of the property to a foreclosing lender or purchaser
at foreclosure. Accordingly, if a mortgaged property is located in such a jurisdiction and is leased to one or more desirable tenants
under leases that are subordinate to the mortgage and do not contain attornment provisions, such mortgaged property could experience
a further decline in value if such tenantsâ leases were terminated. This is particularly likely if those tenants were paying
above-market rents or could not be replaced. If a lease is not subordinate to a mortgage, the issuing entity will not possess the
right to dispossess the tenant upon foreclosure of the mortgaged property (unless otherwise agreed to with the tenant). Also, if
the lease contains provisions inconsistent with the mortgage (e.g., provisions relating to application of insurance proceeds
or condemnation awards) or which could affect the enforcement of the lenderâs rights (e.g., a right of first refusal
to purchase the property), the provisions of the lease will take precedence over the provisions of the mortgage. Not all leases
were reviewed to ascertain the existence of attornment or subordination provisions.
Â 
With respect to certain of the mortgage
loans, the related borrower may have given to certain tenants or others an option to purchase, a right of first refusal and/or
a right of first offer to purchase all or a portion of the mortgaged property in the event a sale is contemplated, and such right
is not subordinate to the related mortgage. This may impede the mortgageeâs ability to sell the related mortgaged property
at foreclosure, or, upon foreclosure, this may affect the value and/or marketability of the related mortgaged property. See âDescription
of the Mortgage PoolâTenant IssuesâPurchase Options and Rights of First Refusalâ for information regarding
material purchase options and/or rights of first refusal, if any, with respect to mortgaged properties securing certain mortgage
loans.
Â 

63
Â 

Â 
Early Lease Termination Options
May Reduce Cash Flow
Â 
Leases often give tenants the right to terminate
the related lease, abate or reduce the related rent, and/or exercise certain remedies against the related borrower for various
reasons or upon various conditions, including:
Â 

Â·if the borrower for the applicable mortgaged property
allows uses at the mortgaged property in violation of use restrictions in current tenant leases,

Â 

Â·if the borrower or any of its affiliates owns other properties
within a certain radius of the mortgaged property and allows uses at those properties in violation of use restrictions,

Â 

Â·if the related borrower fails to provide a designated
number of parking spaces,

Â 

Â·if there is construction at the related mortgaged property
or an adjacent property (whether or not such adjacent property is owned or controlled by the borrower or any of its affiliates)
that may interfere with visibility of, access to or a tenantâs use of the mortgaged property or otherwise violate the terms
of a tenantâs lease,

Â 

Â·upon casualty or condemnation with respect to all or
a portion of the mortgaged property that renders such mortgaged property unsuitable for a tenantâs use or if the borrower
fails to rebuild such mortgaged property within a certain time,

Â 

Â·if a tenantâs use is not permitted by zoning or
applicable law,

Â 

Â·if the tenant is unable to exercise an expansion right,

Â 

Â·if the landlord defaults on its obligations under the
lease,

Â 

Â·if a landlord leases space at the mortgaged property
or within a certain radius of the mortgaged property to a competitor,

Â 

Â·if the tenant fails to meet certain sales targets or
other business objectives for a specified period of time,

Â 

Â·if significant tenants at the subject property go dark
or terminate their leases, or if a specified percentage of the mortgaged property is unoccupied,

Â 

Â·if the landlord violates the tenantâs exclusive
use rights for a specified period of time,

Â 

Â·if the related borrower violates covenants under the
related lease or if third parties take certain actions that adversely affect such tenantsâ business or operations,

Â 

Â·in the case of government sponsored tenants, at any time
or for lack of appropriations, or

Â 

Â·if the related borrower violates covenants under the
related lease or if third parties take certain actions that adversely affect such tenantsâ business or operations.

Â 
In certain cases, compliance or satisfaction
of landlord covenants may be the responsibility of a third party affiliated with the borrower or, in the event that partial releases
of the applicable mortgaged property are permitted, an unaffiliated or affiliated third party.
Â 

64
Â 

Â 
Any exercise of a termination right by a
tenant at a mortgaged property could result in vacant space at the related mortgaged property, renegotiation of the lease with
the related tenant or re-letting of the space. Any such vacated space may not be re-let. Furthermore, such foregoing termination
and/or abatement rights may arise in the future or materially adversely affect the related borrowerâs ability to meet its
obligations under the related mortgage loan documents. See âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâTenant IssuesâLease
Expirations and Terminationsâ for information on material tenant lease expirations and early termination options.
Â 
Mortgaged Properties Leased
to Not-for-Profit Tenants Also Have Risks
Â 
Certain mortgaged properties may have tenants
that are charitable institutions that generally rely on contributions from individuals and government grants or other subsidies
to pay rent on office space and other operating expenses. We cannot assure you that the rate, frequency and level of individual
contributions or governmental grants and subsidies will continue with respect to any such institution. A reduction in contributions
or grants may impact the ability of the related institution to pay rent, and we cannot assure you that the related borrower will
be in a position to meet its obligations under the related mortgage loan documents if such tenant fails to pay its rent.
Â 
Retail Properties Have Special
Risks
Â 
The value of retail properties is significantly
affected by the quality of the tenants as well as fundamental aspects of real estate, such as location and market demographics,
as further described in ââRisks of Commercial and Multifamily Lending Generallyâ and ââPerformance
of the Mortgage Loans Will Be Highly Dependent on the Performance of Tenants and Tenant Leasesâ above. The correlation
between success of tenant business and a retail propertyâs value may be more direct with respect to retail properties than
other types of commercial property because a component of the total rent paid by certain retail tenants is often tied to a percentage
of gross sales.
Â 
Whether a retail property is âanchoredâ,
âshadow anchoredâ or âunanchoredâ is also an important consideration. Retail properties that have anchor
tenant-owned stores often have reciprocal easement and/or operating agreements (each, an âREAâ) between the
retail property owner and such anchor tenants containing certain operating and maintenance covenants. Although an anchor tenant
is often required to pay a contribution toward common area maintenance and real estate taxes on the improvements and related real
property, an anchor tenant that owns its own parcel does not pay rent. However, the presence or absence of an âanchor tenantâ
or a âshadow anchor tenantâ in or near a retail property also can be important because anchors play a key role in generating
customer traffic and making a retail property desirable for other tenants. Many of the retail properties that will secure one or
more mortgage loans will also have shadow anchor tenants. An âanchor tenantâ is located on the related mortgaged property,
usually proportionately larger in size than most or all other tenants in the mortgaged property and is vital in attracting customers
to a retail property. A âshadow anchor tenantâ is usually proportionally larger in size than most tenants in the mortgaged
property, is important in attracting customers to a retail property and is located sufficiently close and convenient to the mortgaged
property so as to influence and attract potential customers, but is not located on the mortgaged property.
Â 

65
Â 

Â 
The economic performance of an anchored
or shadow anchored retail property will consequently be adversely affected by:
Â 

Â·an anchor tenantâs or shadow anchor tenantâs
failure to renew its lease or the termination of an anchor tenantâs or shadow anchor tenantâs lease;

Â 

Â·an anchor tenantâs or shadow anchor tenantâs
decision to vacate;

Â 

Â·the bankruptcy or economic decline of an anchor tenant,
shadow anchor or self-owned anchor; or

Â 

Â·the cessation of the business of an anchor tenant, a
shadow anchor tenant or of a self-owned anchor or a change in use or in the nature of its retail operations (notwithstanding its
continued payment of rent).

Â 
If anchor stores in a mortgaged property
were to close, the related borrower may be unable to replace those anchors in a timely manner or without suffering adverse economic
consequences. In addition, it is common for anchor tenants and non-anchor tenants at anchored or shadow anchored retail centers
to have co-tenancy clauses and/or operating covenants in their leases or operating agreements that permit those tenants or anchor
stores to cease operating, reduce rent or terminate their leases if an anchor or shadow anchor tenant goes dark. Even if non-anchor
tenants do not have termination or rent abatement rights, because the anchor or shadow anchor tenant plays a key role in generating
customer traffic and making a center desirable for other tenants, the loss of an anchor tenant or a shadow anchor tenant may have
a material adverse impact on the non-anchor tenantâs ability to operate, which may in turn adversely impact the borrowerâs
ability to meet its obligations under the related mortgage loan documents. In addition, in the event that a âshadow anchorâ
fails to renew its lease, terminates its lease or otherwise ceases to conduct business within a close proximity to the mortgaged
property, customer traffic at the mortgaged property may be substantially reduced. If an anchor tenant goes dark, generally the
borrowerâs only remedy is to terminate that lease after the anchor tenant has been dark for a specified amount of time.
Â 
We cannot assure you that if anchor tenants
or shadow anchor tenants at a particular mortgaged property were to close or otherwise become vacant or remain vacant, such anchor
tenants or shadow anchor tenants, as applicable, would be replaced in a timely manner or, if part of the collateral for the related
mortgage loan, without incurring material additional costs to the related borrower and resulting in adverse economic effects.
Â 
Certain of the tenants or anchor tenants
of the retail properties may have operating covenants in their leases or operating agreements which permit those tenants or anchor
tenants to cease operating, reduce rent or terminate their leases if the subject store is not meeting the minimum sales requirement
under its lease.
Â 
In addition, the limited adaptability of
certain shopping malls that have proven unprofitable may result in high (and possibly extremely high) loss severities on mortgage
loans secured by those shopping malls. For example, it is possible that a significant amount of advances made by the applicable
servicer(s) of a mortgage loan secured by a shopping mall property, combined with low liquidation proceeds in respect of that property,
may result in a loss severity exceeding 100% of the outstanding principal balance of that mortgage loan.
Â 
Certain anchor tenant and tenant estoppels
will have been obtained in connection with the origination of the mortgage loans that may identify disputes between the related
Â 

66
Â 
Â 
borrower and the applicable anchor tenant or tenant, or alleged defaults or potential defaults by the applicable property owner
under the lease or REA. Such disputes, defaults or potential defaults, could lead to a termination or attempted termination of
the applicable lease or REA by the anchor tenant or tenant or to litigation against the related borrower. We cannot assure you
that these anchor tenant and tenant disputes will not have a material adverse effect on the ability of the related borrowers to
repay their portion of the mortgage loan. In addition, we cannot assure you that the anchor tenant or tenant estoppels obtained
identify all potential disputes that may arise with anchor tenants or tenants who did not provide estoppels prior to origination.
We cannot assure you that the failure to have obtained related estoppel information will not have a material adverse effect on
the related mortgage loans.
Â 
Rental payments from tenants of retail properties
typically comprise the largest portion of the net operating income of those mortgaged properties. We cannot assure you that the
rate of occupancy at the stores will remain at the levels described in this prospectus or that the net operating income contributed
by the mortgaged properties will remain at the level specified in this prospectus or remain consistent with past levels.
Â 
Retail properties also face competition
from sources outside a given real estate market. For example, all of the following compete with more traditional retail properties
for consumer dollars: factory outlet centers, discount shopping centers and clubs, catalogue retailers, home shopping networks,
internet websites, and telemarketing. Continued growth of these alternative retail outlets (which often have lower operating costs)
could adversely affect the rents collectible at the retail properties included in the pool of mortgage loans, as well as the income
from, and market value of, the mortgaged properties and the related borrowerâs ability to refinance such property. Moreover,
additional competing retail properties may be built in the areas where the retail properties are located.
Â 
Certain retail properties have specialty
use tenants. See ââSome Mortgaged Properties May Not Be Readily Convertible to Alternative Usesâ below.
Â 
See âDescription of the Mortgage
PoolâMortgage Pool CharacteristicsâProperty TypesâRetail Propertiesâ.
Â 
Multifamily Properties Have
Special Risks
Â 
In addition to the factors discussed in
ââRisks of Commercial and Multifamily Lending Generallyâ and ââPerformance of the Mortgage
Loans Will Be Highly Dependent on the Performance of Tenants and Tenant Leasesâ above, other factors may adversely affect
the financial performance and value of multifamily properties, including:
Â 

Â·the quality of property management;

Â 

Â·the ability of management to provide adequate maintenance
and insurance;

Â 

Â·the types of services or amenities that the property
provides;

Â 

Â·the propertyâs reputation;

Â 

Â·the level of mortgage interest rates, which may encourage
tenants to purchase rather than lease housing;

Â 

Â·the generally short terms of residential leases and the
need for continued reletting;

Â 


67
Â 
Â 

Â·rent concessions and month-to-month leases, which may
impact cash flow at the property;

Â 

Â·the tenant mix, such as the tenant population being predominantly
students or being heavily dependent on workers from a particular business or industry or personnel from or workers related to
a local military base or oil and/or gas drilling industries;

Â 

Â·in the case of student housing facilities or properties
leased primarily to students, which may be more susceptible to damage or wear and tear than other types of multifamily housing,
the reliance on the financial well-being of the college or university to which it relates, competition from on campus housing
units, which may adversely affect occupancy, the physical layout of the housing, which may not be readily convertible to traditional
multifamily use, and that student tenants have a higher turnover rate than other types of multifamily tenants, which in certain
cases is compounded by the fact that student leases are available for periods of less than 12 months;

Â 

Â·certain multifamily properties may be considered to be
âflexible apartment propertiesâ. Such properties have a significant percentage of units leased to tenants under short-term
leases (less than one year in term), which creates a higher turnover rate than for other types of multifamily properties;

Â 

Â·restrictions on the age of tenants who may reside at
the property;

Â 

Â·dependence upon governmental programs that provide rent
subsidies to tenants pursuant to tenant voucher programs, which vouchers may be used at other properties and influence tenant
mobility;

Â 

Â·adverse local, regional or national economic conditions,
which may limit the amount of rent that may be charged and may result in a reduction of timely rent payments or a reduction in
occupancy levels;

Â 

Â·state and local regulations, which may affect the building
ownerâs ability to increase rent to market rent for an equivalent apartment; and

Â 

Â·the existence of government assistance/rent subsidy programs,
and whether or not they continue and provide the same level of assistance or subsidies.

Â 
Certain states regulate the relationship
between an owner and its tenants. Commonly, these laws require a written lease, good cause for eviction, disclosure of fees, and
notification to residents of changed land use, while prohibiting unreasonable rules, retaliatory evictions, and restrictions on
a residentâs choice of unit vendors. Apartment building owners have been the subject of suits under state âUnfair and
Deceptive Practices Actsâ and other general consumer protection statutes for coercive, abusive or unconscionable leasing
and sales practices. A few states offer more significant protection. For example, there are provisions that limit the bases on
which a landlord may terminate a tenancy or increase a tenantâs rent or prohibit a landlord from terminating a tenancy solely
by reason of the sale of the ownerâs building.
Â 
In addition to state regulation of the landlord
tenant relationship, numerous counties and municipalities impose rent control on apartment buildings. These ordinances may limit
rent increases to fixed percentages, to percentages of increases in the consumer price index, to increases set or approved by a
governmental agency, or to increases determined through mediation or binding arbitration. Any limitations on a borrowerâs
ability to raise
Â 

68
Â 
Â 
property rents may impair such borrowerâs ability to repay its multifamily loan from its net operating income
or the proceeds of a sale or refinancing of the related multifamily property.
Â 
Certain of the mortgage loans may be secured
in the future by mortgaged properties that are subject to certain affordable housing covenants and other covenants and restrictions
with respect to various tax credit, city, state and federal housing subsidies, rent stabilization or similar programs, in respect
of various units within the mortgaged properties. The limitations and restrictions imposed by these programs could result in losses
on the mortgage loans. In addition, in the event that the program is cancelled, it could result in less income for the project.
These programs may include, among others:
Â 

Â·rent limitations that would adversely affect the ability
of borrowers to increase rents to maintain the condition of their mortgaged properties and satisfy operating expense; and

Â 

Â·tenant income restrictions that may reduce the number
of eligible tenants in those mortgaged properties and result in a reduction in occupancy rates.

Â 
The difference in rents between subsidized
or supported properties and other multifamily rental properties in the same area may not be a sufficient economic incentive for
some eligible tenants to reside at a subsidized or supported property that may have fewer amenities or be less attractive as a
residence. As a result, occupancy levels at a subsidized or supported property may decline, which may adversely affect the value
and successful operation of such property.
Â 
Certain of the multifamily properties may
be residential cooperative buildings and the land under any such building is owned or leased by a non-profit residential cooperative
corporation. The cooperative owns all the units in the building and all common areas. Its tenants own stock, shares or membership
certificates in the corporation. This ownership entitles the tenant-stockholders to proprietary leases or occupancy agreements
which confer exclusive rights to occupy specific units. Generally, the tenant-stockholders make monthly maintenance payments which
represent their share of the cooperative corporationâs mortgage loan payments, real property taxes, reserve contributions
and capital expenditures, maintenance and other expenses, less any income the corporation may receive. These payments are in addition
to any payments of principal and interest the tenant-stockholder may be required to make on any loans secured by its shares in
the cooperative.
Â 
A number of factors may adversely affect
the value and successful operation of a residential cooperative property. Some of these factors include:
Â 

Â·the primary dependence of a borrower upon maintenance
payments and any rental income from units or commercial areas to meet debt service obligations;

Â 

Â·the initial concentration of shares relating to occupied
rental units of the sponsor, owner or investor after conversion from rental housing, which may result in an inability to meet
debt service obligations on the residential cooperative corporationâs mortgage loan if the sponsor, owner or investor is
unable to make the required maintenance payments;

Â 

Â·the failure of a borrower to qualify for favorable tax
treatment as a âcooperative housing corporationâ each year, which may reduce the cash flow available to make payments
on the related mortgage loan; and

Â 

69
Â 
Â 


Â·that, upon foreclosure, in the event a cooperative property
becomes a rental property, certain units could be subject to rent control, stabilization and tenantsâ rights laws, at below
market rents, which may affect rental income levels and the marketability and sale proceeds of the rental property as a whole.

Â 
See âDescription of the Mortgage
PoolâMortgage Pool CharacteristicsâProperty TypesâMultifamily Propertiesâ.
Â 
Hotel Properties Have Special
Risks
Â 
In addition to the factors discussed in
ââRisks of Commercial and Multifamily Lending Generallyâ above, various other factors may adversely affect
the financial performance and value of hotel properties, including:
Â 

Â·adverse economic and social conditions, either local,
regional or national (which may limit the amount that can be charged for a room and reduce occupancy levels);

Â 

Â·continuing expenditures for modernizing, refurbishing
and maintaining existing facilities prior to the expiration of their anticipated useful lives;

Â 

Â·ability to convert to alternative uses which may not
be readily made;

Â 

Â·a deterioration in the financial strength or managerial
capabilities of the owner or operator of a hotel property;

Â 

Â·changes in travel patterns caused by general adverse
economic conditions, fear of terrorist attacks, adverse weather conditions and changes in access, energy prices, strikes, travel
costs, relocation of highways, the construction of additional highways, concerns about travel safety or other factors; and

Â 

Â·relative illiquidity of hospitality investments which
limits the ability of the borrowers and property managers to respond to changes in economic or other conditions.

Â 
Because hotel rooms are generally rented
for short periods of time, the financial performance of hotel properties tends to be affected by adverse economic conditions and
competition more quickly than other commercial properties. Additionally, as a result of high operating costs, relatively small
decreases in revenue can cause significant stress on a propertyâs cash flow.
Â 
Moreover, the hospitality and lodging industry
is generally seasonal in nature and different seasons affect different hotel properties differently depending on type and location.
This seasonality can be expected to cause periodic fluctuations in a hotel propertyâs room and restaurant revenues, occupancy
levels, room rates and operating expenses. We cannot assure you that cash flow will be sufficient to offset any shortfalls that
occur at the mortgaged property during slower periods or that the related mortgage loans provide for seasonality reserves, or if
seasonality reserves are provided for, that such reserves will be funded or will be sufficient or available to fund such shortfalls.
Â 
In addition, certain hotel properties are
limited-service, select service or extended stay hotels. Hotel properties that are limited-service, select service or extended
stay hotels may subject a lender to more risk than full-service hotel properties as they generally require less capital for construction
than full-service hotel properties. In addition, as limited-service, select service or extended stay hotels generally offer fewer
amenities than full-service hotel properties, they are less distinguishable from each other. As a result, it is easier for
Â 

70
Â 
Â 
limited-service,
select service or extended stay hotels to experience increased or unforeseen competition.
Â 
In addition to hotel operations, some hotel
properties also operate entertainment complexes that include restaurants, lounges, nightclubs and/or banquet and meeting spaces
and may derive a significant portion of the related propertyâs revenue from such operations. Consumer demand for entertainment
resorts is particularly sensitive to downturns in the economy and the corresponding impact on discretionary spending on leisure
activities. Changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences could be driven by factors such as perceived or
actual general economic conditions, high energy, fuel and food costs, the increased cost of travel, the weakened job market, perceived
or actual disposable consumer income and wealth, fears of recession and changes in consumer confidence in the economy, or fears
of war and future acts of terrorism. These factors could reduce consumer demand for the leisure activities that the property offers,
thus imposing practical limits on pricing and harming operations. Restaurants and nightclubs are particularly vulnerable to changes
in consumer preferences. In addition, a nightclubâs, restaurantâs or barâs revenue is extremely dependent on
its popularity and perception. These characteristics are subject to change rapidly and we cannot assure you that any of a hotel
propertyâs nightclubs, restaurants or bars will maintain their current level of popularity or perception in the market. Any
such change could have a material adverse effect on the net cash flow of the property.
Â 
Some of the hotel properties have liquor
licenses associated with the mortgaged property. The liquor licenses for these mortgaged properties are generally held by affiliates
of the related borrowers, unaffiliated managers or operating lessees. The laws and regulations relating to liquor licenses generally
prohibit the transfer of such licenses to any person, or condition such transfer on the prior approval of the governmental authority
that issued the license. In the event of a foreclosure of a hotel property that holds a liquor license, the special servicer on
behalf of the issuing entity or a purchaser in a foreclosure sale would likely have to apply for a new license, which might not
be granted or might be granted only after a delay that could be significant. We cannot assure you that a new license could be obtained
promptly or at all. The lack of a liquor license in a hotel property could have an adverse impact on the revenue from the related
mortgaged property or on the hotel propertyâs occupancy rate.
Â 
In addition, there may be risks associated
with hotel properties that have not entered into or become a party to any franchise agreement, license agreement or other âflagâ.
Hotel properties often enter into these types of agreements in order to align the hotel property with a certain public perception
or to benefit from a centralized reservation system. We cannot assure you that hotel properties that lack such benefits will be
able to operate successfully on an independent basis.
Â 
See âDescription of the Mortgage
PoolâMortgage Pool CharacteristicsâProperty TypesâHotel Propertiesâ.
Â 
Risks Relating to Affiliation
with a Franchise or Hotel Management Company
Â 
The performance of a hotel property affiliated
with a franchise or hotel management company depends in part on:
Â 

Â·the continued existence and financial strength of the
franchisor or hotel management company;

Â 

Â·the public perception of the franchise or hotel chain
service mark; and

Â 

71
Â 
Â 


Â·the duration of the franchise licensing or management
agreements.

Â 
The continuation of a franchise agreement
or management agreement is subject to specified operating standards and other terms and conditions set forth in such agreements.
The failure of a borrower to maintain such standards or adhere to other applicable terms and conditions, such as property improvement
plans, could result in the loss or cancellation of their rights under the franchise or hotel management company agreement or management
agreement. We cannot assure you that a replacement franchise could be obtained in the event of termination or that such replacement
franchise affiliation would be of equal quality to the terminated franchise affiliation. In addition, replacement franchises and/or
hotel property managers may require significantly higher fees as well as the investment of capital to bring the hotel property
into compliance with the requirements of the replacement franchisor and/or hotel property managers. Any provision in a franchise
agreement or management agreement providing for termination because of a bankruptcy of a franchisor or manager generally will not
be enforceable.
Â 
The transferability of franchise agreements,
license agreements and the property management agreements is restricted. In the event of a foreclosure, the lender may not have
the right to use the franchise license without the franchisorâs consent or the manager might be able to terminate the management
agreement. Conversely, in the case of certain mortgage loans, the lender may be unable to remove a franchisor/licensor or a hotel
management company that it desires to replace following a foreclosure and, further, may be limited as regards the pool of potential
transferees for a foreclosure or real estate owned property.
Â 
In some cases where a hotel property is
subject to a license or franchise agreement, the licensor or franchisor has required or may in the future require the completion
of various repairs and/or renovations pursuant to a property improvement plan issued by the franchisor. Failure to complete those
repairs and/or renovations in accordance with the plan could result in the hotel property losing its license or franchise. AnnexÂ A-1
and the related footnotes set forth the amount of reserves, if any, established under the related mortgage loans in connection
with any of those repairs and/or renovations. We cannot assure you that any amounts reserved will be sufficient to complete the
repairs and/or renovations required with respect to any affected hotel property. In addition, in some cases, those reserves will
be maintained by the franchisor or property manager. Furthermore, the lender may not require a reserve for repairs and/or renovations
in all instances.

PoolâMortgage Pool CharacteristicsâProperty TypesâHotel Propertiesâ.
Â 
Industrial Properties Have
Special Risks
Â 
In addition to the factors discussed in
ââRisks of Commercial and Multifamily Lending Generallyâ and ââPerformance of the Mortgage
Loans Will Be Highly Dependent on the Performance of Tenants and Tenant Leasesâ above, other factors may adversely affect
the financial performance and value of industrial properties, including:
Â 

Â·reduced demand for industrial space because of a decline
in a particular industry segment;

Â 

Â·the property becoming functionally obsolete;

Â 

Â·building design and adaptability;

Â 

72
Â 
Â 


Â·unavailability of labor sources;

Â 

Â·changes in access, energy prices, strikes, relocation
of highways, the construction of additional highways or other factors;

Â 

Â·changes in proximity of supply sources;

Â 

Â·the expenses of converting a previously adapted space
to general use; and

Â 

Â·the location of the property.

Â 
Industrial properties may be adversely affected
by reduced demand for industrial space occasioned by a decline in a particular industry segment in which the related tenant(s)
conduct their businesses (for example, a decline in consumer demand for products sold by a tenant using the property as a distribution
center). In addition, a particular industrial or warehouse property that suited the needs of its original tenant may be difficult
to relet to another tenant or may become functionally obsolete relative to newer properties. Furthermore, lease terms with respect
to industrial properties are generally for shorter periods of time and may result in a substantial percentage of leases expiring
in the same year at any particular industrial property. In addition, mortgaged properties used for many industrial purposes are
more prone to environmental concerns than other property types.
Â 
Aspects of building site design and adaptability
affect the value of an industrial property. Site characteristics that are generally desirable to a warehouse/industrial property
include high clear ceiling heights, wide column spacing, a large number of bays (loading docks) and large bay depths, divisibility,
a layout that can accommodate large truck minimum turning radii and overall functionality and accessibility.
Â 
In addition, because of unique construction
requirements of many industrial properties, any vacant industrial property space may not be easily converted to other uses. Thus,
if the operation of any of the industrial properties becomes unprofitable due to competition, age of the improvements or other
factors such that the borrower becomes unable to meet its obligations on the related mortgage loan, the liquidation value of that
industrial property may be substantially less, relative to the amount owing on the related mortgage loan, than would be the case
if the industrial property were readily adaptable to other uses.
Â 
Location is also important because an industrial
property requires the availability of labor sources, proximity to supply sources and customers and accessibility to rail lines,
major roadways and other distribution channels.
Â 
Further, certain of the industrial properties
may have tenants that are subject to risks unique to their business, such as cold storage facilities. Cold storage facilities may
have unique risks such as short lease terms due to seasonal use, making income potentially more volatile than for properties with
longer term leases, and customized refrigeration design, rendering such facilities less readily convertible to alternative uses.
Because of seasonal use, leases at such facilities are customarily for shorter terms, making income potentially more volatile than
for properties with longer term leases. In addition, such facilities require customized refrigeration design, rendering them less
readily convertible to alternative uses.
Â 
See âDescription of the Mortgage
PoolâMortgage Pool CharacteristicsâProperty TypesâIndustrial Propertiesâ.
Â

Â 

Â 
Self Storage Properties
Have Special Risks
Â 
In addition to the factors discussed in
ââRisks of Commercial and Multifamily Lending Generallyâ above, other factors may adversely affect the
financial performance and value of self storage properties, including:
Â 

Â·decreased demand;

Â 

Â·lack of proximity to apartment complexes or commercial
users;

Â 

Â·apartment tenants moving to single family homes;

Â 

Â·decline in services rendered, including security;

Â 

Â·dependence on business activity ancillary to renting
units;

Â 

Â·security concerns;

Â 

Â·age of improvements; or

Â 

Â·competition or other factors.

Â 
Self storage properties are considered vulnerable
to competition, because both acquisition costs and break-even occupancy are relatively low. The conversion of self storage facilities
to alternative uses would generally require substantial capital expenditures. Thus, if the operation of any of the self storage
properties becomes unprofitable, the liquidation value of that self storage mortgaged property may be substantially less, relative
to the amount owing on the mortgage loan, than if the self storage mortgaged property were readily adaptable to other uses.
Â 
Tenants at self storage properties tend
to require and receive privacy, anonymity and efficient access, each of which may heighten environmental and other risks related
to such property as the borrower may be unaware of the contents in any self storage unit. No environmental assessment of a self
storage mortgaged property included an inspection of the contents of the self storage units at that mortgaged property, and there
is no assurance that all of the units included in the self storage mortgaged properties are free from hazardous substances or other
pollutants or contaminants or will remain so in the future.
Â 
Certain mortgage loans secured by self storage
properties may be affiliated with a franchise company through a franchise agreement. The performance of a self storage property
affiliated with a franchise company may be affected by the continued existence and financial strength of the franchisor, the public
perception of a service mark, and the duration of the franchise agreement. The transferability of franchise license agreements
is restricted. In the event of a foreclosure, the lender or its agent would not have the right to use the franchise license without
the franchisorâs consent. In addition, certain self storage properties may derive a material portion of revenue from business
activities ancillary to self storage such as truck rentals, parking fees and similar activities which require special use permits
or other discretionary zoning approvals. See AnnexÂ A-1 and the footnotes related thereto.
Â 
See âDescription of the Mortgage
PoolâMortgage Pool CharacteristicsâProperty TypesâSelf Storage Propertiesâ.
Â 

74
Â 

Â 
Office Properties Have Special
Risks
Â 
In addition to the factors discussed in
ââRisks of Commercial and Multifamily Lending Generallyâ and ââPerformance of the Mortgage
Loans Will Be Highly Dependent on the Performance of Tenants and Tenant Leasesâ above, other factors may adversely affect
the financial performance and value of office properties, including:
Â 

Â·the physical attributes of the building in relation to
competing buildings (e.g., age, condition, design, appearance, access to transportation and ability to offer certain amenities,
such as sophisticated building systems and/or business wiring requirements);

Â 

Â·the adaptability of the building to changes in the technological
needs of the tenants;

Â 

Â·an adverse change in population, patterns of telecommuting
or sharing of office space, and employment growth (which creates demand for office space); and

Â 

Â·in the case of a medical office property, (a)Â the
proximity of such property to a hospital or other healthcare establishment, (b)Â reimbursements for patient fees from private
or government sponsored insurers, (c)Â its ability to attract doctors and nurses to be on staff, and (d)Â its ability
to afford and acquire the latest medical equipment. Issues related to reimbursement (ranging from nonpayment to delays in payment)
from such insurers could adversely impact cash flow at such mortgaged property.

Â 
Moreover, the cost of refitting office space
for a new tenant is often higher than the cost of refitting other types of properties for new tenants.
Â 
If one or more major tenants at a particular
office property were to close or remain vacant, we cannot assure you that such tenants would be replaced in a timely manner or
without incurring material additional costs to the related borrower and resulting in an adverse effect on the financial performance
of the property.
Â 
See âDescription of the Mortgage
PoolâMortgage Pool CharacteristicsâProperty TypesâOffice Propertiesâ.
Â 
Mixed Use Properties Have
Special Risks
Â 
Certain properties are mixed use properties.
Such mortgaged properties are subject to the risks relating to the property types described in ââOffice Properties
Have Special Risksâ, ââRetail Properties Have Special Risksâ, ââHotel Properties
Have Special Risksâ, ââMultifamily Properties Have Special Risksâ, ââManufactured
Housing Community Properties Have Special Risksâ, ââIndustrial Properties Have Special Risksâ,
ââSelf Storage Properties Have Special Risksâ, ââCondominium Ownership May Limit Use and
Improvementsâ and ââLeased Fee Properties Have Special Risksâ, as applicable. See AnnexÂ A-1
for the 5 largest tenants (by net rentable area leased) at the mixed use property. A mixed use property may be subject to
additional risks, including the property managerâs inexperience in managing the different property types that comprise such
mixed use property.
Â 
See âDescription of the Mortgage
PoolâMortgage Pool CharacteristicsâProperty TypesâMixed Use Propertiesâ.
Â 

75
Â 

Â 
Manufactured Housing Community
Properties Have Special Risks
Â 
In addition to the factors discussed in
ââRisks of Commercial and Multifamily Lending Generallyâ and ââPerformance of the Mortgage
Loans Will Be Highly Dependent on the Performance of Tenants and Tenant Leasesâ above, other factors may adversely affect
the financial performance and value of manufactured housing community properties, including:
Â 

Â·the number of competing residential developments in the
local market, such as: other manufactured housing community properties apartment buildings and site built single family homes;

Â 

Â·the physical attributes of the community, including its
age and appearance;

Â 

Â·the location of the manufactured housing property;

Â 

Â·the presence and/or continued presence of sufficient
manufactured homes at the manufactured housing property (manufactured homes are not generally part of the collateral for a mortgage
loan secured by a manufactured housing property; rather, the pads upon which manufactured homes are located are leased to the
owners of such manufactured homes; manufactured homes may be moved from a manufactured housing property);

Â 

Â·the type of services or amenities it provides;

Â 

Â·any age restrictions;

Â 

Â·the propertyâs reputation; and

Â 

Â·state and local regulations, including rent control and
rent stabilization, and tenant association rights.

Â 
The manufactured housing community properties
have few improvements (which are highly specialized) and are âsingle purposeâ properties that could not be readily
converted to general residential, retail or office use. Thus, if the operation of any of the manufactured housing community properties
becomes unprofitable due to competition, age of the improvements or other factors such that the borrower becomes unable to meet
its obligations on the related mortgage loan, the liquidation value of that manufactured housing property may be substantially
less, relative to the amount owing on the related mortgage loan, than would be the case if the manufactured housing community property
were readily adaptable to other uses.
Â 
Some manufactured housing community properties
are either recreational vehicle resorts or have a significant portion of the properties that are intended for short-term recreational
vehicle hook-ups, and tenancy of these communities may vary significantly by season. This seasonality may cause periodic fluctuations
in revenues, tenancy levels, rental rates and operating expenses for these properties.
Â 
Some of the manufactured housing community
mortgaged properties securing the mortgage loans in the trust may have a material number of leased homes that are currently owned
by the related borrower or an affiliate thereof and rented by the respective tenants like apartments. In circumstances where the
leased homes are owned by an affiliate of the borrower, the related pads may, in some cases, be subject to a master lease with
that affiliate. In such cases, the tenants will tend to be more transient and less tied to the property than if they owned their
own home. Such leased homes do not, in all (or, possibly, in any) such cases, constitute collateral for the related mortgage loan.
Some of the leased
Â 

76
Â 
Â 
homes that are not collateral for the related mortgage loan are rented on a lease-to-own basis. In some cases,
the borrower itself owns, leases, sells and/or finances the sale of homes, although generally the related income therefrom will
be excluded for loan underwriting purposes. See also representation and warranty no.Â 31 on AnnexÂ D-1 to this prospectus
and the exceptions thereto on AnnexÂ D-2 to this prospectus (subject to the limitations and qualifications set forth in the
preamble to AnnexÂ D-1 to this prospectus). Some of the leased homes owned by a borrower or its affiliate may be financed and
a default on that financing may materially adversely affect the performance of the manufactured housing community mortgaged property.
Â 
Certain of the manufactured housing community
mortgaged properties may not be connected in their entirety to public water and/or sewer systems. In such cases, the borrower could
incur a substantial expense if it were required to connect the property to such systems in the future. In addition, the use of
well water enhances the likelihood that the property could be adversely affected by a recognized environmental condition that impacts
soil and groundwater.
Â 
See âDescription of the Mortgage
PoolâMortgage Pool Characteristicsâ.
Â 
Operation of a Mortgaged
Property Depends on the Property Managerâs Performance
Â 
The successful operation of a real estate
project depends upon the property managerâs performance and viability. The property manager is responsible for:
Â 

Â·responding to changes in the local market;

Â 

Â·planning and implementing the rental structure;

Â 

Â·operating the property and providing building services;

Â 

Â·managing operating expenses; and

Â 

Â·assuring that maintenance and capital improvements are
carried out in a timely fashion.

Â 
Properties deriving revenues primarily from
short term sources, such as hotel guests or short term or month to month leases, are generally more management intensive than properties
leased to creditworthy tenants under long term leases.
Â 
Certain of the mortgaged properties will
be managed by affiliates of the related borrower. If a mortgage loan is in default or undergoing special servicing, such relationship
could disrupt the management of the related mortgaged property, which may adversely affect cash flow. However, the related mortgage
loans will generally permit, in the case of mortgaged properties managed by borrower affiliates, the lender to remove the related
property manager upon the occurrence of an event of default under the related mortgage loan beyond applicable cure periods (or,
in some cases, in the event of a foreclosure following such default), and in some cases a decline in cash flow below a specified
level or the failure to satisfy some other specified performance trigger.
Â 
Concentrations Based on
Property Type, Geography, Related Borrowers and Other Factors May Disproportionately Increase Losses
Â 
The effect of mortgage pool loan losses
will be more severe if the losses relate to mortgage loans that account for a disproportionately large percentage of the poolâs
Â 

77
Â 
Â 
aggregate principal balance. As mortgage loans pay down or properties are released, the remaining mortgage loans may face a higher
risk with respect to the diversity of property types and property characteristics and with respect to the number of borrowers.
Â 
See the tables entitled âRemaining
Term to Maturity/ARD in Monthsâ in AnnexÂ A-2 for a stratification of the remaining terms to maturity of the mortgage
loans. Because principal on the certificates is payable in sequential order of payment priority, and a class receives principal
only after the preceding class(es) have been paid in full, classes that have a lower sequential priority are more likely to face
these types of risk of concentration than classes with a higher sequential priority.
Â 
Several of the mortgage loans have cut-off
date balances that are substantially higher than the average cut-off date balance. In general, concentrations in mortgage loans
with larger-than-average balances can result in losses that are more severe, relative to the size of the mortgage loan pool, than
would be the case if the aggregate balance of the mortgage loan pool were more evenly distributed.
Â 
A concentration of mortgage loans secured
by the same mortgaged property types can increase the risk that a decline in a particular industry or business would have a disproportionately
large impact on the pool of mortgage loans. Mortgaged property types representing more than 5.0% of the aggregate principal balance
of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date (based on allocated loan amount) are retail, multifamily, hospitality, industrial,
self storage, office and other. See âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâMortgage Pool CharacteristicsâProperty
Typesâ for information on the types of mortgaged properties securing the mortgage loans in the mortgage pool.
Â 
Repayments by borrowers and the market value
of the related mortgaged properties could be affected by economic conditions generally or specific to particular geographic areas
or regions of the United States, and concentrations of mortgaged properties in particular geographic areas may increase the risk
that conditions in the real estate market where the mortgaged property is located, or other adverse economic or other developments
or natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, floods, forest fires, tornadoes or hurricanes or changes in governmental rules
or fiscal policies) affecting a particular region of the country, could increase the frequency and severity of losses on mortgage
loans secured by those mortgaged properties.
Â 
Mortgaged properties securing 5.0% or more
of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date (based on allocated loan amount) are located
in California, Virginia, South Dakota, New York, Florida, Texas, Washington and New Jersey. See âDescription of the Mortgage
PoolâMortgage Pool CharacteristicsâGeographic Concentrationsâ.
Â 
Some of the mortgaged properties are located
in areas that, based on low population density, poor economic demographics (such as higher than average unemployment rates, lower
than average annual household income and/or overall loss of jobs) and/or negative trends in such regards, would be considered secondary
or tertiary markets.
Â 
A concentration of mortgage loans with the
same borrower or related borrowers also can pose increased risks:
Â 

Â·if a borrower that owns or controls several mortgaged
properties (whether or not all of them secure mortgage loans in the mortgage pool) experiences financial difficulty at one mortgaged
property, it could defer maintenance at another 

Â 


78
Â 
Â 



mortgaged property in order to satisfy current expenses with respect to the first mortgaged
  property;


Â 

Â·a borrower could also attempt to avert foreclosure by
filing a bankruptcy petition that might have the effect of interrupting debt service payments on the mortgage loans in the mortgage
pool secured by that borrowerâs mortgaged properties (subject to the master servicerâs and the trusteeâs obligation
to make advances for monthly payments) for an indefinite period; and

Â 

Â·mortgaged properties owned by the same borrower or related
borrowers are likely to have common management, common general partners and/or common managing members increasing the risk that
financial or other difficulties experienced by such related parties could have a greater impact on the pool of mortgage loans.
See ââA Bankruptcy Proceeding May Result in Losses and Delays in Realizing on the Mortgage Loansâ below.

Â 
See âDescription of the Mortgage
PoolâMortgage Pool Characteristicsâ for information on the composition of the mortgage pool by property type and
geographic distribution and loan concentration.
Â 
Adverse Environmental Conditions
at or Near Mortgaged Properties May Result in Losses
Â 
The issuing entity could become liable for
a material adverse environmental condition at an underlying mortgaged property. Any such potential liability could reduce or delay
payments on the offered certificates.
Â 
Each of the mortgaged properties was either
(i)Â subject to environmental site assessments prior to the time of origination of the related mortgage loan (or, in certain
limited cases, after origination) including Phase I environmental site assessments or updates of previously performed Phase I environmental
site assessments, or (ii)Â subject to a secured creditor environmental insurance policy or other environmental insurance policy.
See âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâEnvironmental Considerationsâ.
Â 
We cannot assure you that the environmental
assessments revealed all existing or potential environmental risks or that all adverse environmental conditions have been or will
be completely abated or remediated or that any reserves, insurance or operations and maintenance plans will be sufficient to remediate
the environmental conditions. Moreover, we cannot assure you that:
Â 

Â·future laws, ordinances or regulations will not impose
any material environmental liability; or

Â 

Â·the current environmental condition of the mortgaged
properties will not be adversely affected by tenants or by the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of the mortgaged
properties (such as underground storage tanks).

Â 
We cannot assure you that with respect to
any mortgaged property any remediation plan or any projected remedial costs or time is accurate or sufficient to complete the remediation
objectives, or that no additional contamination requiring environmental investigation or remediation will not be discovered on
any mortgaged property. Likewise, all environmental policies naming the lender as named insured cover certain risks or events specifically
identified in the policy, but the coverage is limited by its terms, conditions, limitations and exclusions, and does not purport
to cover all environmental conditions
Â 

79
Â 
Â 
whatsoever affecting the applicable mortgaged property, and we cannot assure you that any
environmental conditions currently known, suspected, or unknown and discovered in the future will be covered by the terms of the
policy.
Â 
Before the trustee or the special servicer,
as applicable, acquires title to a mortgaged property on behalf of the issuing entity or assumes operation of the property, it
will be required to obtain an environmental assessment of such mortgaged property, or rely on a recent environmental assessment.
This requirement is intended to mitigate the risk that the issuing entity will become liable under any environmental law. There
is accordingly some risk that the mortgaged property will decline in value while this assessment is being obtained or remedial
action is being taken. Moreover, we cannot assure you that this requirement will effectively insulate the issuing entity from potential
liability under environmental laws. Any such potential liability could reduce or delay distributions to certificateholders.
Â 
See âDescription of the Mortgage
PoolâEnvironmental Considerationsâ for additional information on environmental conditions at mortgaged properties
securing certain mortgage loans in the issuing entity. See also representation and warranty no.Â 40 on AnnexÂ D-1 to this
prospectus and the exceptions thereto on AnnexÂ D-2 to this prospectus (subject to the limitations and qualifications set forth
in the preamble to AnnexÂ D-1 to this prospectus).

Â 
Risks Related to Redevelopment,
Expansion and Renovation at Mortgaged Properties
Â 
Certain of the mortgaged properties are
properties which are currently undergoing or, in the future, are expected to undergo redevelopment, expansion or renovation. To
the extent applicable, we cannot assure you that any escrow or reserve collected, if any, will be sufficient to complete the current
renovation or be otherwise sufficient to satisfy any tenant improvement expenses at a mortgaged property. Failure to complete those
planned improvements may have a material adverse effect on the cash flow at the mortgaged property and the related borrowerâs
ability to meet its payment obligations under the mortgage loan documents.
Â 
Certain of the hotel properties securing
the mortgage loans are currently undergoing or are scheduled to undergo renovations or property improvement plans (âPIPsâ).
In some circumstances, these renovations or PIPs may necessitate taking a portion of the available guest rooms temporarily offline,
temporarily decreasing the number of available rooms and the revenue generating capacity of the related hotel property. In other
cases, these renovations may involve renovations of common spaces or external features of the related hotel property, which may
cause disruptions or otherwise decrease the attractiveness of the related hotel property to potential guests. These PIPs may be
required under the related franchise or management agreement and a failure to timely complete them may result in a
Â 

80
Â 
Â 
termination
or expiration of a franchise or management agreement and may be an event of default under the related mortgage loan.
Â 
Certain of the retail properties securing
the mortgage loans 	may currently be undergoing or are scheduled to undergo renovations or property expansions. Such renovations
or expansions may be required under tenant leases and a failure to timely complete such renovations or expansions may result in
a termination of such lease and may have a material adverse effect on the cash flow at the mortgaged property and the related borrowerâs
ability to meet its payment obligations under the mortgage loan documents.
Â 
We cannot assure you that current or planned
redevelopment, expansion or renovation will be completed at all, that such redevelopment, expansion or renovation will be completed
in the time frame contemplated, or that, when and if such redevelopment, expansion or renovation is completed, such redevelopment,
expansion or renovation will improve the operations at, or increase the value of, the related mortgaged property. Failure of any
of the foregoing to occur could have a material negative impact on the related mortgaged property, which could affect the ability
of the related borrower to repay the related mortgage loan.
Â 
In the event the related borrower fails
to pay the costs for work completed or material delivered in connection with such ongoing redevelopment, expansion or renovation,
the portion of the mortgaged property on which there are renovations may be subject to mechanicâs or materialmenâs
liens that may be senior to the lien of the related mortgage loan.
Â 
The existence of construction or renovation
at a mortgaged property may take rental units or rooms or leasable space âoff-lineâ or otherwise make space unavailable
for rental, impair access or traffic at or near the mortgaged property, or, in general, make that mortgaged property less attractive
to tenants or their customers, and accordingly could have a negative effect on net operating income. In addition, any such construction
or renovation at a mortgaged property may temporarily interfere with the use and operation of any portion of such mortgaged property.
See âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâRedevelopment, Renovation and Expansionâ for information regarding
mortgaged properties which are currently undergoing or, in the future, are expected to undergo redevelopment, expansion or renovation.
See also AnnexÂ A-3 for additional information on redevelopment, renovation and expansion at the mortgaged properties securing
the 15 largest mortgage loans or groups of cross-collateralized mortgage loans.
Â 
Some Mortgaged Properties
May Not Be Readily Convertible to Alternative Uses
Â 
Certain mortgaged properties securing the
mortgage loans may have specialty use tenants and may not be readily convertible (or convertible at all) to alternative uses if
those properties were to become unprofitable for any reason.
Â 
For example, retail, mixed-use or office
properties may have theater tenants. Properties with theater tenants are exposed to certain unique risks. Aspects of building site
design and adaptability affect the value of a theater. In addition, decreasing attendance at a theater could adversely affect revenue
of the theater, which may, in turn, cause the tenant to experience financial difficulties, resulting in downgrades in their credit
ratings and, in certain cases, bankruptcy filings. In addition, because of unique construction requirements of theaters, any vacant
theater space would not easily be converted to other uses.
Â 

81
Â 

Â 
Retail, mixed-use or office properties may
also have health clubs as tenants. Several factors may adversely affect the value and successful operation of a health club, including:
Â 

Â·the physical attributes of the health club (e.g.,
its age, appearance and layout);

Â 

Â·the reputation, safety, convenience and attractiveness
of the property to users;

Â 

Â·managementâs ability to control membership growth
and attrition;

Â 

Â·competition in the tenantâs marketplace from other
health clubs and alternatives to health clubs; and

Â 

Â·adverse changes in economic and social conditions and
demographic changes (e.g., population decreases or changes in average age or income), which may result in decreased demand.

Â 
In addition, there may be significant costs
associated with changing consumer preferences (e.g., multipurpose clubs from single-purpose clubs or varieties of equipment,
classes, services and amenities). In addition, health clubs may not be readily convertible to alternative uses if those properties
were to become unprofitable for any reason. The liquidation value of any such health club consequently may be less than would be
the case if the property were readily adaptable to changing consumer preferences for other uses.
Â 
Certain retail, mixed use or office properties
may be partially comprised of a parking garage. Parking garages and parking lots present risks not associated with other properties.
The primary source of income for parking lots and garages is the rental fees charged for parking spaces.
Â 
Factors affecting the success of a parking
lot or garage include:
Â 

Â·the number of rentable parking spaces and rates charged;

Â 

Â·the location of the lot or garage and, in particular,
its proximity to places where large numbers of people work, shop or live;

Â 

Â·the amount of alternative parking spaces in the area;

Â 

Â·the availability of mass transit; and

Â 

Â·the perceptions of the safety, convenience and services
of the lot or garage.

Â 
Aspects of building site design and adaptability
affect the value of a parking garage facility. Site characteristics that are valuable to a parking garage facility include location,
clear ceiling heights, column spacing, zoning restrictions, number of spaces and overall functionality and accessibility.
Â 
In addition, because of the unique construction
requirements of many parking garages and because a parking lot is often vacant paved land without any structure, a vacant parking
garage facility or parking lot may not be easily converted to other uses.
Â 
Mortgaged properties may have other specialty
use tenants, such as medical and dental offices, gas stations, data centers, urgent care facilities, daycare centers and/or restaurants,
as part of the mortgaged property.
Â 
In the case of specialty use tenants such
as restaurants and theaters, aspects of building site design and adaptability affect the value of such properties and other retailers
at the
Â 

82
Â 
Â 
mortgaged property. Decreasing patronage at such properties could adversely affect revenue of the property, which may, in
turn, cause the tenants to experience financial difficulties, resulting in downgrades in their credit ratings, lease defaults and,
in certain cases, bankruptcy filings. See ââTenant Bankruptcy Could Result in a Rejection of the Related Leaseâ
above. Additionally, receipts at such properties are also affected not only by objective factors but by subjective factors. For
instance, restaurant receipts are affected by such varied influences as the current personal income levels in the community, an
individual consumerâs preference for type of food, style of dining and restaurant atmosphere, the perceived popularity of
the restaurant, food safety concerns related to personal health with the handling of food items at the restaurant or by food suppliers
and the actions and/or behaviors of staff and management and level of service to the customers. In addition, because of unique
construction requirements of such properties, any vacant space would not easily be converted to other uses.
Â 
Mortgaged properties with specialty use
tenants may not be readily convertible (or convertible at all) to alternative uses if those properties were to become unprofitable,
or the leased spaces were to become vacant, for any reason due to their unique construction requirements. In addition, converting
commercial properties to alternate uses generally requires substantial capital expenditures and could result in a significant adverse
effect on, or interruption of, the revenues generated by such properties.
Â 
In addition, a mortgaged property may not
be readily convertible due to restrictive covenants related to such mortgaged property, including in the case of mortgaged properties
that are subject to a condominium regime or subject to a ground lease, the use and other restrictions imposed by the condominium
declaration and other related documents, especially in a situation where a mortgaged property does not represent the entire condominium
regime. See ââCondominium Ownership May Limit Use and Improvementsâ above.
Â 
Some of the mortgaged properties may be
part of tax-reduction programs that apply only if the mortgaged properties are used for certain purposes. Such properties may be
restricted from being converted to alternative uses because of such restrictions.
Â 
Some of the mortgaged properties have government
tenants or other tenants which may have space that was âbuilt to suitâ that particular tenantâs uses and needs.
For example, a government tenant may require enhanced security features that required additional construction or renovation costs
and for which the related tenant may pay above market rent. However, such enhanced features may not be necessary for a new tenant
(and such new tenant may not be willing to pay the higher rent associated with such features). While a government office building
or government leased space may be usable as a regular office building or tenant space, the rents that may be collected in the event
the government tenant does not renew its lease may be significantly lower than the rent currently collected.
Â 
Additionally, zoning, historical preservation
or other restrictions also may prevent alternative uses. See ââRisks Related to Zoning Non-Compliance and
Use Restrictionsâ below.
Â 
Risks Related to Zoning
Non-Compliance and Use Restrictions
Â 
Certain of the mortgaged properties may
not comply with current zoning laws, including density, use, parking, height, landscaping, open space and set back requirements,
due to changes in zoning requirements after such mortgaged properties were constructed. These properties, as well as those for
which variances or special permits were issued or for which non-conformity with current zoning laws is otherwise permitted, are
considered to be a
Â 

83
Â 
Â 
âlegal non-conforming useâ and/or the improvements are considered to be âlegal non-conforming
structuresâ. This means that the borrower is not required to alter its structure to comply with the existing or new law;
however, the borrower may not be able to rebuild the premises âas-isâ in the event of a substantial casualty loss.
This may adversely affect the cash flow of the property following the loss. If a substantial casualty were to occur, we cannot
assure you that insurance proceeds would be available to pay the mortgage loan in full. In addition, if a non-conforming use were
to be discontinued and/or the property were repaired or restored in conformity with the current law, the value of the property
or the revenue-producing potential of the property may not be equal to that before the casualty.
Â 
In addition, certain of the mortgaged properties
that do not conform to current zoning laws may not be âlegal non-conforming usesâ or âlegal non-conforming structuresâ.
The failure of a mortgaged property to comply with zoning laws or to be a âlegal non-conforming useâ or âlegal
non-conforming structureâ may adversely affect the market value of the mortgaged property or the borrowerâs ability
to continue to use it in the manner it is currently being used or may necessitate material additional expenditures to remedy non-conformities.
In some cases, the related borrower has obtained law and ordinance insurance to cover additional costs that result from rebuilding
the mortgaged property in accordance with current zoning requirements. However, if as a result of the applicable zoning laws the
rebuilt improvements are smaller or less attractive to tenants than the original improvements, the resulting loss in income will
generally not be covered by law and ordinance insurance. Zoning protection insurance will generally reimburse the lender for the
difference between (i)Â the mortgage loan balance on the date of damage loss to the mortgaged property from an insured peril
and (ii)Â the total insurance proceeds at the time of the damage to the mortgaged property if such mortgaged property cannot
be rebuilt to its former use due to new zoning ordinances.
Â 
In addition, certain of the mortgaged properties
may be subject to certain use restrictions and/or operational requirements imposed pursuant to development agreements, ground leases,
restrictive covenants, reciprocal easement agreements or operating agreements or historical landmark designations or, in the case
of those mortgaged properties that are condominiums, condominium declarations or other condominium use restrictions or regulations,
especially in a situation where the mortgaged property does not represent the entire condominium building. Such use restrictions
could include, for example, limitations on the character of the improvements or the properties, limitations affecting noise and
parking requirements, among other things, and limitations on the borrowersâ right to operate certain types of facilities
within a prescribed radius. These limitations impose upon the borrower stricter requirements with respect to repairs and alterations,
including following a casualty loss. These limitations could adversely affect the ability of the related borrower to lease the
mortgaged property on favorable terms, thus adversely affecting the borrowerâs ability to fulfill its obligations under the
related mortgage loan. In addition, any alteration, reconstruction, demolition, or new construction affecting a mortgaged property
designated a historical landmark may require prior approval. Any such approval process, even if successful, could delay any redevelopment
or alteration of a related property. The liquidation value of such property, to the extent subject to limitations of the kind described
above or other limitations on convertibility of use, may be substantially less than would be the case if such property was readily
adaptable to other uses or redevelopment. See âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâUse Restrictionsâ for
examples of mortgaged properties that are subject to restrictions relating to the use of the mortgaged properties.
Â 

84
Â 

Â 
Risks Relating to Inspections
of Properties
Â 
Licensed engineers or consultants inspected
the mortgaged properties at or about the time of the origination of the mortgage loans to assess items such as structural integrity
of the buildings and other improvements on the mortgaged property, including exterior walls, roofing, interior construction, mechanical
and electrical systems and general condition of the site, buildings and other improvements. However, we cannot assure you that
all conditions requiring repair or replacement were identified. No additional property inspections were conducted in connection
with the issuance of the offered certificates.
Â 
Risks Relating to Costs
of Compliance with Applicable Laws and Regulations
Â 
A borrower may be required to incur costs
to comply with various existing and future federal, state or local laws and regulations applicable to the related mortgaged property,
for example, zoning laws and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, which requires all public accommodations
to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by persons with disabilities. See âCertain Legal Aspects
of Mortgage LoansâAmericans with Disabilities Actâ. The expenditure of these costs or the imposition of injunctive
relief, penalties or fines in connection with the borrowerâs noncompliance could negatively impact the borrowerâs cash
flow and, consequently, its ability to pay its mortgage loan.
Â 
Insurance May Not Be Available
or Adequate
Â 
Although the mortgaged properties are required
to be insured, or self-insured by a sole tenant of a related building or group of buildings, against certain risks, there is a
possibility of casualty loss with respect to the mortgaged properties for which insurance proceeds may not be adequate or which
may result from risks not covered by insurance.
Â 
In addition, certain types of mortgaged
properties, such as manufactured housing and recreational vehicle communities, have few or no insurable buildings or improvements
and thus do not have casualty insurance or low limits of casualty insurance in comparison with the related mortgage loan balances.
Â 
In addition, hazard insurance policies will
typically contain co-insurance clauses that in effect require an insured at all times to carry insurance of a specified percentage,
generally 80% to 90%, of the full replacement value of the improvements on the related mortgaged property in order to recover the
full amount of any partial loss. As a result, even if insurance coverage is maintained, if the insuredâs coverage falls below
this specified percentage, those clauses generally provide that the insurerâs liability in the event of partial loss does
not exceed the lesser of (1)Â the replacement cost of the improvements less physical depreciation and (2)Â that proportion
of the loss as the amount of insurance carried bears to the specified percentage of the full replacement cost of those improvements.
Â 
Certain of the mortgaged properties may
be located in areas that are considered a high earthquake risk (seismic zones 3 or 4). See âDescription of the Mortgage
PoolâMortgage Pool CharacteristicsâGeographic Concentrationsâ.
Â 
Furthermore, with respect to certain mortgage
loans, the insurable value of the related mortgaged property as of the origination date of the related mortgage loan was lower
than the principal balance of the related mortgage loan. In the event of a casualty when a borrower is not required to rebuild
or cannot rebuild, we cannot assure you that the insurance required with respect to the related mortgaged property will be sufficient
to pay the related mortgage loan in full and there is no âgapâ insurance required under such
Â 

85
Â 
Â 
mortgage loan to cover
any difference. In those circumstances, a casualty that occurs near the maturity date may result in an extension of the maturity
date of the mortgage loan if the special servicer, in accordance with the servicing standard, determines that such extension was
in the best interest of certificateholders.
Â 
The mortgage loans do not all require flood
insurance on the related mortgaged properties unless they are in a flood zone and flood insurance is available and, in certain
instances, even where the related mortgaged property was in a flood zone and flood insurance was available, flood insurance was
not required.
Â 
We cannot assure you that the borrowers
will in the future be able to comply with requirements to maintain adequate insurance with respect to the mortgaged properties,
and any uninsured loss could have a material adverse impact on the amount available to make payments on the related mortgage loan,
and consequently, the offered certificates. As with all real estate, if reconstruction (for example, following fire or other casualty)
or any major repair or improvement is required to the damaged property, changes in laws and governmental regulations may be applicable
and may materially affect the cost to, or ability of, the borrowers to effect such reconstruction, major repair or improvement.
As a result, the amount realized with respect to the mortgaged properties, and the amount available to make payments on the related
mortgage loan, and consequently, the offered certificates, could be reduced. In addition, we cannot assure you that the amount
of insurance required or provided would be sufficient to cover damages caused by any casualty, or that such insurance will be available
in the future at commercially reasonable rates. See representation and warranty no.Â 16 on AnnexÂ D-1 to this prospectus
and the exceptions thereto on AnnexÂ D-2 to this prospectus (subject to the limitations and qualifications set forth in the
preamble to AnnexÂ D-1 to this prospectus).
Â 
Inadequacy of Title Insurers
May Adversely Affect Distributions on Your Certificates
Â 
Title insurance for a mortgaged property
generally insures a lender against risks relating to a lender not having a first lien with respect to a mortgaged property, and
in some cases can insure a lender against specific other risks. The protection afforded by title insurance depends on the ability
of the title insurer to pay claims made upon it. We cannot assure you that with respect to any mortgage loan:
Â 


Â·a title insurer will have the ability to pay title insurance claims made upon it;
Â 

Â·the title insurer will maintain its present financial strength; or
Â 

Â·a title insurer will not contest claims made upon it.
Â 


Certain of the mortgaged properties are
either completing initial construction or undergoing renovation or redevelopment. Under such circumstances, there may be limitations
to the amount of coverage or other exceptions to coverage that could adversely affect the issuing entity if losses are suffered.
Â 
Terrorism Insurance May
Not Be Available for All Mortgaged Properties
Â 
The occurrence or the possibility of terrorist
attacks could (1)Â lead to damage to one or more of the mortgaged properties if any terrorist attacks occur or (2)Â result
in higher costs for security and insurance premiums or diminish the availability of insurance coverage for losses related to terrorist
attacks, particularly for large properties, which could adversely affect the cash flow at those mortgaged properties.
Â 

86
Â 

Â 

After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks
in New York City and the Washington, D.C. area, all forms of insurance were impacted, particularly from a cost and availability
perspective, including comprehensive general liability and business interruption or rent loss insurance policies required by typical
mortgage loans. To give time for private markets to develop a pricing mechanism for terrorism risk and to build capacity to absorb
future losses that may occur due to terrorism, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 was enacted on November 26, 2002, establishing
the Terrorism Insurance Program. The Terrorism Insurance Program was extended through December 31, 2014 by the Terrorism Risk Insurance
Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 and was subsequently reauthorized on January 12, 2015 for a period of six years through December
31, 2020 pursuant to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 (âTRIPRAâ).
Â 
The Terrorism Insurance Program requires
insurance carriers to provide terrorism coverage in their basic âall-riskâ policies. Any commercial property and casualty
terrorism insurance exclusion that was in force on November 26, 2002 is automatically void to the extent that it excluded losses
that would otherwise be insured losses. Any state approval of those types of exclusions in force on November 26, 2002 is also void.
Â 
Under the Terrorism Insurance Program, the
federal government shares in the risk of losses occurring within the United States resulting from acts committed in an effort to
influence or coerce United States civilians or the United States government. The federal share of compensation for insured losses
of an insurer equals 85% (subject to annual 1% decreases beginning in 2016 until such percentage equals 80%) of the portion of
such insured losses that exceed a deductible equal to 20% of the value of the insurerâs direct earned premiums over the calendar
year immediately preceding that program year. Federal compensation in any program year is capped at $100 billion (with insurers
being liable for any amount that exceeds such cap), and no compensation is payable with respect to a terrorist act unless the aggregate
industry losses relating to such act exceed $100 million (subject to annual $20 million increases beginning in 2016 until such
threshold equals $200 million). The Terrorism Insurance Program does not cover nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks.
Unless a borrower obtains separate coverage for events that do not meet the thresholds or other requirements above, such events
will not be covered.
Â 
If the Terrorism Insurance Program is not
reenacted after its expiration in 2020, premiums for terrorism insurance coverage will likely increase and the terms of such insurance
policies may be materially amended to increase stated exclusions or to otherwise effectively decrease the scope of coverage available
(perhaps to the point where it is effectively not available). In addition, to the extent that any insurance policies contain âsunset
clausesâ (i.e., clauses that void terrorism coverage
if the federal insurance backstop program is not renewed), then such policies may cease to provide terrorism insurance upon the
expiration of the Terrorism Insurance Program. We cannot assure you that the Terrorism Insurance Program or any successor program
will create any long term changes in the availability and cost of such insurance. Moreover, future legislation, including regulations
expected to be adopted by the Treasury Department pursuant to TRIPRA, may have a material effect on the availability of federal
assistance in the terrorism insurance market. To the extent that uninsured or underinsured casualty losses occur with respect to
the related mortgaged properties, losses on the mortgage loans may result. In addition, the failure to maintain such terrorism
insurance may constitute a default under the related mortgage loan.
Â 
Some of the mortgage loans do not require
the related borrower to maintain terrorism insurance. In addition, most of the mortgage loans contain limitations on the related
borrowerâs obligation to obtain terrorism insurance, such as (i)Â waiving the requirement that such borrower maintain
terrorism insurance if such insurance is not available at
Â 


87
Â 
Â 
commercially reasonable rates, (ii)Â providing that the related borrower
is not required to spend in excess of a specified dollar amount (or in some cases, a specified multiple of what is spent on other
insurance) in order to obtain such terrorism insurance, (iii)Â requiring coverage only for as long as the TRIPRA is in effect,
or (iv)Â requiring coverage only for losses arising from domestic acts of terrorism or from terrorist acts certified by the
federal government as âacts of terrorismâ under the TRIPRA. See AnnexÂ A-3 for a summary of the terrorism insurance
requirements under each of the 15 largest mortgage loans or groups of cross-collateralized mortgage loans. See representation and
warranty no.Â 29 on AnnexÂ D-1 to this prospectus and the exceptions thereto on AnnexÂ D-2 to this prospectus (subject
to the limitations and qualifications set forth in the preamble to AnnexÂ D-1 to this prospectus).
Â 
We cannot assure you that all of the mortgaged
properties will be insured against the risks of terrorism and similar acts. As a result of any of the foregoing, the amount available
to make distributions on your certificates could be reduced.
Â 
Other mortgaged properties securing mortgage
loans may also be insured under a blanket policy or self-insured or insured by a sole tenant. See ââRisks Associated
with Blanket Insurance Policies or Self-Insuranceâ below.
Â 
Risks Associated with Blanket
Insurance Policies or Self-Insurance
Â 
Certain of the mortgaged properties are
covered by blanket insurance policies, which also cover other properties of the related borrower or its affiliates (including certain
properties in close proximity to the mortgaged properties). In the event that such policies are drawn on to cover losses on such
other properties, the amount of insurance coverage available under such policies would thereby be reduced and could be insufficient
to cover each mortgaged propertyâs insurable risks. In addition, with respect to some of the mortgaged properties, a sole
or significant tenant is allowed to provide self-insurance against risks.
Â 
Additionally, if the mortgage loans that
allow coverage under blanket insurance policies are part of a group of mortgage loans with related borrowers, then all of the related
mortgaged properties may be covered under the same blanket policy, which may also cover other properties owned by affiliates of
such borrowers.
Â 
Certain mortgaged properties may also be
insured or self-insured by a sole or significant tenant, as further described under âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâTenant
IssuesâInsurance Considerationsâ.
Â 
Condemnation of a Mortgaged
Property May Adversely Affect Distributions on Certificates
Â 
From time to time, there may be condemnations
pending or threatened against one or more of the mortgaged properties securing the mortgage loans. The proceeds payable in connection
with a total condemnation may not be sufficient to restore the related mortgaged property or to satisfy the remaining indebtedness
of the related mortgage loan. The occurrence of a partial condemnation may have a material adverse effect on the continued use
of, or income generated by, the affected mortgaged property. Therefore, we cannot assure you that the occurrence of any condemnation
will not have a negative impact upon distributions on your offered certificates.
Â 

88
Â 

Â 
Limited Information Causes
Uncertainty
Â 
Historical Information
Â 
Some of the mortgage loans that we intend
to include in the issuing entity are secured in whole or in part by mortgaged properties for which limited or no historical operating
information is available. As a result, you may find it difficult to analyze the historical performance of those mortgaged properties.
Â 
A mortgaged property may lack prior operating
history or historical financial information because it is newly constructed or renovated, it is a recent acquisition by the related
borrower or it is a single-tenant property that is subject to a triple net lease. In addition, a tenantâs lease may contain
confidentiality provisions that restrict the sponsorsâ access to or disclosure of such tenantâs financial information.
The underwritten net cash flows and underwritten net operating income for such mortgaged properties are derived principally from
current rent rolls or tenant leases and historical expenses, adjusted to account for inflation, significant occupancy increases
and a market rate management fee. In some cases, underwritten net cash flows and underwritten net operating income for mortgaged
properties are based all or in part on leases (or letters of intent) that are not yet in place (and may still be under negotiation)
or on tenants that may have signed a lease (or letter of intent), or lease amendment expanding the leased space, but are not yet
in occupancy and/or paying rent), which present certain risks described in ââUnderwritten Net Cash Flow Could Be
Based On Incorrect or Failed Assumptionsâ below.
Â 
See AnnexÂ A-1 for certain historical
financial information relating to the mortgaged properties, including net operating income for the most recent reporting period
and prior 3Â calendar years, to the extent available.
Â 
Ongoing Information
Â 
The primary source of ongoing information
regarding the offered certificates, including information regarding the status of the related mortgage loans and any credit support
for the offered certificates, will be the periodic reports delivered to you. See âDescription of the CertificatesâReports
to Certificateholders; Certain Available Informationâ. We cannot assure you that any additional ongoing information regarding
the offered certificates will be available through any other source. The limited nature of the available information in respect
of the offered certificates may adversely affect their liquidity, even if a secondary market for the offered certificates does
develop.
Â 
We are not aware of any source through which
pricing information regarding the offered certificates will be generally available on an ongoing basis or on any particular date.
Â 
Underwritten Net Cash Flow
Could Be Based On Incorrect or Failed Assumptions
Â 
As described under âDescription
of the Mortgage PoolâAdditional Informationâ, underwritten net cash flow generally includes cash flow (including
any cash flow from master leases) adjusted based on a number of assumptions used by the sponsors. We make no representation that
the underwritten net cash flow set forth in this prospectus as of the cut-off date or any other date represents actual future net
cash flows. For example, with respect to certain mortgage loans included in the issuing entity, the occupancy of the related mortgaged
property reflects tenants that (i)Â may not have yet actually executed leases (or letters of intent), (ii)Â have signed
leases but have not yet taken occupancy and/or are not paying full contractual rent, (iii)Â are seeking or may in the future
seek to sublet all
Â 

89
Â 
Â 
or a portion of their respective spaces, (iv)Â are âdarkâ tenants but paying rent, or (v)Â are
affiliates of the related borrower and are leasing space pursuant to a master lease or a space lease. Similarly, with respect to
certain mortgage loans included in the issuing entity, the underwritten net cash flow may be based on certain tenants that have
not yet executed leases or that have signed leases but are not yet in place and/or are not yet paying rent, or have a signed lease
or lease amendment expanding the leased space, but are not yet in occupancy of all or a portion of their space and/or paying rent,
or may assume that future contractual rent steps (during some or all of the remaining term of a lease) have occurred. In many cases,
co-tenancy provisions were assumed to be satisfied and vacant space was assumed to be occupied and space that was due to expire
was assumed to have been re-let, in each case at market rates that may have exceeded current rent. You should review these and
other similar assumptions and make your own determination of the appropriate assumptions to be used in determining underwritten
net cash flow.
Â 
In addition, underwritten or adjusted cash
flows, by their nature, are speculative and are based upon certain assumptions and projections. The failure of these assumptions
or projections in whole or in part could cause the underwritten net operating income (calculated as described in âDescription
of the Mortgage PoolâAdditional Informationâ) to vary substantially from the actual net operating income of a mortgaged
property.
Â 
In the event of the inaccuracy of any assumptions
or projections used in connection with the calculation of underwritten net cash flow, the actual net cash flow could be significantly
different (and, in some cases, may be materially less) than the underwritten net cash flow presented in this prospectus, and this
would change other numerical information presented in this prospectus based on or derived from the underwritten net cash flow,
such as the debt service coverage ratios or debt yield presented in this prospectus. We cannot assure you that any such assumptions
or projections made with respect to any mortgaged property will, in fact, be consistent with that mortgaged propertyâs actual
performance.
Â 
Frequent and Early Occurrence
of Borrower Delinquencies and Defaults May Adversely Affect Your Investment
Â 
If you calculate the anticipated yield of
your offered certificates based on a rate of default or amount of losses lower than that actually experienced on the mortgage loans
and those additional losses result in a reduction of the total distributions on, or the certificate balance of, your offered certificates,
your actual yield to maturity will be lower than expected and could be negative under certain extreme scenarios. The timing of
any loss on a liquidated mortgage loan that results in a reduction of the total distributions on or the certificate balance of
your offered certificates will also affect the actual yield to maturity of your offered certificates, even if the rate of defaults
and severity of losses are consistent with your expectations. In general, the earlier a loss is borne by you, the greater the effect
on your yield to maturity.
Â 
Delinquencies on the mortgage loans, if
the delinquent amounts are not advanced, may result in shortfalls in distributions of interest and/or principal to the holders
of the offered certificates for the current month. Furthermore, no interest will accrue on this shortfall during the period of
time that the payment is delinquent. Additionally, in instances where the principal portion of any balloon payment scheduled with
respect to a mortgage loan is collected by the master servicer following the end of the related collection period, no portion of
the principal received on such payment will be passed through for distribution to the certificateholders until the subsequent distribution
date, which may result in shortfalls in distributions of interest to the holders of the offered certificates in the following month.
Furthermore, in such instances no provision is made for the master servicer or any other party to cover any such interest shortfalls
that may occur as a result. In addition, if interest
Â 

90
Â 
Â 
and/or principal advances and/or servicing advances are made with respect
to a mortgage loan after a default and the related mortgage loan is thereafter worked out under terms that do not provide for the
repayment of those advances in full at the time of the workout, then any reimbursements of those advances prior to the actual collection
of the amount for which the advance was made may also result in shortfalls in distributions of principal to the holders of the
offered certificates with certificate balances for the current month. Even if losses on the mortgage loans are not allocated to
a particular class of offered certificates with certificate balances, the losses may affect the weighted average life and yield
to maturity of that class of offered certificates. In the case of any material monetary or material non-monetary default, the special
servicer may accelerate the maturity of the related mortgage loan, which could result in an acceleration of principal distributions
to the certificateholders. The special servicer may also extend or modify a mortgage loan, which could result in a substantial
delay in principal distributions to the certificateholders. In addition, losses on the mortgage loans, even if not allocated to
a class of offered certificates with certificate balances, may result in a higher percentage ownership interest evidenced by those
offered certificates in the remaining mortgage loans than would otherwise have resulted absent the loss. The consequent effect
on the weighted average life and yield to maturity of the offered certificates will depend upon the characteristics of those remaining
mortgage loans in the trust fund.

The Mortgage Loans Have
Not Been Reviewed or Re-Underwritten by Us; Some Mortgage Loans May Not Have Complied With Another Originatorâs Underwriting
Criteria
Â 
Although the sponsors have conducted a review
of the mortgage loans to be sold to us for this securitization transaction, we, as the depositor for this securitization transaction,
have neither originated the mortgage loans nor conducted a review or re-underwriting of the mortgage loans. Instead, we have relied
on the representations and warranties made by the applicable sponsors and the remedies for breach of a representation and warranty

Â 
The representations and warranties made
by the sponsors may not cover all of the matters that one would review in underwriting a mortgage loan and you should not view
them as a substitute for re-underwriting the mortgage loans. Furthermore, these representations and warranties in some respects
represent an allocation of risk rather than a confirmed description of the mortgage loans. If we had re-underwritten the mortgage
loans, it is possible that the re-underwriting process may have revealed problems with a mortgage loan not covered by a representation
or warranty or may have revealed inaccuracies in the representations and warranties. See ââOther Risks Relating

Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreementsâ.
Â 
In addition, we cannot assure you that all
of the mortgage loans would have complied with the underwriting criteria of the other originators or, accordingly, that each originator
would have made the same decision to originate every mortgage loan included in the issuing entity or, if they did decide to originate
an unrelated mortgage loan, that they would have been underwritten on the same terms and conditions.
Â 
As a result of the foregoing, you are advised
and encouraged to make your own investment decision based on a careful review of the information set forth in this prospectus and
your own view of the mortgage pool.
Â 
Static Pool Data Would Not
Be Indicative of the Performance of this Pool
Â 
As a result of the distinct nature of each
pool of commercial mortgage loans, and the separate mortgage loans within the pool, this prospectus does not include disclosure
concerning the delinquency and loss experience of static pools of periodic originations by any sponsor of assets of the type to
be securitized (known as âstatic pool dataâ). In particular, static pool data showing a low level of delinquencies
and defaults would not be indicative of the performance of this pool or any other pools of mortgage loans originated by the same
sponsor or sponsors.
Â 
While there may be certain common factors
affecting the performance and value of income-producing real properties in general, those factors do not apply equally to all income-producing
real properties and, in many cases, there are unique factors that will affect the performance and/or value of a particular income-producing
real property. Moreover, the effect of a given factor on a particular real property will depend on a number of variables, including
but not limited to property type, geographic location, competition, sponsorship and other characteristics of the property and the
related commercial mortgage loan. Each income-producing real property represents a separate and distinct business venture and,
as a result, each of the mortgage loans requires a unique underwriting analysis. Furthermore, economic and other conditions affecting
real properties, whether worldwide, national, regional or local, vary over time. The performance of a pool of mortgage loans originated
and outstanding under a given set of economic conditions may vary significantly from the performance of an otherwise comparable
mortgage pool originated and outstanding under a different set of economic conditions.
Â 
Therefore, you should evaluate this offering
on the basis of the information set forth in this prospectus with respect to the mortgage loans, and not on the basis of the performance
of other pools of securitized commercial mortgage loans.
Â 
Appraisals May Not Reflect
Current or Future Market Value of Each Property
Â 
Appraisals were obtained with respect to
each of the mortgaged properties at or about the time of origination of the related mortgage loan (or whole loan, if applicable)
or at or around the time of the acquisition of the mortgage loan (or whole loan, if applicable) by the related sponsor. See AnnexÂ A-1
for the dates of the latest appraisals for the mortgaged properties. We have not obtained new appraisals of the mortgaged properties
or assigned new valuations to the mortgage loans in connection with the offering of the offered certificates. The market values
of the mortgaged properties could have declined since the origination of the related mortgage loans.
Â 

92
Â 

Â 
In general, appraisals represent the analysis
and opinion of qualified appraisers and are not guarantees of present or future value. One appraiser may reach a different conclusion
than that of a different appraiser with respect to the same property. The appraisals seek to establish the amount a typically motivated
buyer would pay a typically motivated seller and, in certain cases, may have taken into consideration the purchase price paid by
the borrower. The amount could be significantly higher than the amount obtained from the sale of a mortgaged property in a distress
or liquidation sale.
Â 
Information regarding the appraised values
of the mortgaged properties (including loan-to-value ratios) presented in this prospectus is not intended to be a representation
as to the past, present or future market values of the mortgaged properties. For example, in some cases, a borrower or its affiliate
may have acquired the related mortgaged property for a price or otherwise for consideration in an amount that is less than the
related appraised value specified on AnnexÂ A-1, including at a foreclosure sale or through acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of
foreclosure. Historical operating results of the mortgaged properties used in these appraisals, as adjusted by various assumptions,
estimates and subjective judgments on the part of the appraiser, may not be comparable to future operating results. In addition,
certain appraisals may be based on extraordinary assumptions, including without limitation, that certain tenants are in-place and
paying rent when such tenants have not yet taken occupancy or that certain renovations or property improvement plans have been
completed. Additionally, certain appraisals with respect to mortgage loans secured by multiple mortgaged properties may have been
conducted on a portfolio basis rather than on an individual property basis, and the sum of the values of the individual properties
may be different from (and in some cases may be less than) the appraised value of the aggregate of such properties on a portfolio
basis. In addition, other factors may impair the mortgaged propertiesâ value without affecting their current net operating
income, including:
Â 

Â·changes in governmental regulations, zoning or tax laws;
Â 

Â·potential environmental or other legal liabilities;
Â 

Â·the availability of refinancing; and
Â 

Â·changes in interest rate levels.
Â 
In certain cases, appraisals may reflect
both âas-stabilizedâ and âas-isâ values. However, the appraised value reflected in this prospectus with
respect to each mortgaged property, except as described under âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâCertain Calculations
and Definitionsâ, reflects only the âas-isâ value (or, in certain cases, may reflect the âas-stabilizedâ
value as a result of the satisfaction of the related conditions or assumptions unless otherwise specified), which may contain certain
assumptions, such as future construction completion, projected re-tenanting or increased tenant occupancies. See âDescription
of the Mortgage PoolâAppraised Valueâ.
Â 
Additionally, with respect to the appraisals
setting forth assumptions, particularly those setting forth extraordinary assumptions, as to the âas-isâ and âas-stabilizedâ
values, we cannot assure you that those assumptions are or will be accurate or that the âas-stabilizedâ value will
be the value of the related mortgaged property at the indicated stabilization date or at maturity or anticipated repayment date.

Â 
The Performance of a Mortgage
Loan and Its Related Mortgaged Property Depends in Part on Who Controls the Borrower and Mortgaged Property
Â 
The operation and performance of a mortgage
loan will depend in part on the identity of the persons or entities who control the borrower and the mortgaged property. The performance
of a mortgage loan may be adversely affected if control of a borrower changes, which may occur, for example, by means of transfers
of direct or indirect ownership interests in the borrower, or if the mortgage loan is assigned to and assumed by another person
or entity along with a transfer of the property to that person or entity.
Â 
Many of the mortgage loans generally place
certain restrictions on the transfer and/or pledging of general partnership and managing member equity interests in a borrower,
such as specific percentage or control limitations, although some have current or permit future mezzanine or subordinate debt.
We cannot assure you the ownership of any of the borrowers would not change during the term of the related mortgage loan and result
in a material adverse effect on your certificates. See âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâAdditional Indebtednessâ
and ââCertain Terms of the Mortgage LoansââDue-On-Saleâ and âDue-On-Encumbranceâ Provisionsâ.
Â 
The Borrowerâs Form
of Entity May Cause Special Risks
Â 
The borrowers are legal entities rather
than individuals. Mortgage loans made to legal entities may entail greater risks of loss than those associated with mortgage loans
made to individuals. For example, a legal entity, as opposed to an individual, may be more inclined to seek legal protection from
its creditors under the bankruptcy laws. Unlike individuals involved in bankruptcies, most entities generally, but not in all cases,
do not have personal assets and creditworthiness at stake.
Â 
The terms of certain of the mortgage loans
require that the borrowers be single-purpose entities and, in most cases, such borrowersâ organizational documents or the
terms of the mortgage loans limit their activities to the ownership of only the related mortgaged property or mortgaged properties
and limit the borrowersâ ability to incur additional indebtedness. Such provisions are designed to mitigate the possibility
that the borrowerâs financial condition would be adversely impacted by factors unrelated to the related mortgaged property
and mortgage loan. Such borrower may also have previously owned property other than the related mortgaged property or may be a
so-called ârecycledâ single-purpose entity that previously had other business activities and liabilities. However,
we cannot assure you that such borrowers have in the past complied, or in the future will comply, with such requirements. Additionally,
in some cases unsecured debt exists and/or is allowed in the future. Furthermore, in many cases such borrowers are not required
to observe all covenants and conditions which typically are required in order for such borrowers to be viewed under standard rating
agency criteria as âsingle purpose entitiesâ.
Â 

94
Â 

Â 
Although a borrower may currently be a single
purpose entity, in certain cases the borrowers were not originally formed as single purpose entities, but at origination of the
related mortgage loan their organizational documents were amended. Such borrower may have previously owned property other than
the related mortgaged property and may not have observed all covenants that typically are required to consider a borrower a âsingle
purpose entityâ and thus may have liabilities arising from events prior to becoming a single purpose entity.
Â 
The organizational documents of a borrower
or the direct or indirect managing partner or member of a borrower may also contain requirements that there be one or two independent
directors, managers or trustees (depending on the entity form of such borrower) whose vote is required before the borrower files
a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency petition or otherwise institutes insolvency proceedings. Generally, but not always, the independent
directors, managers or trustees may only be replaced with certain other independent successors. Although the requirement of having
independent directors, managers or trustees is designed to mitigate the risk of a voluntary bankruptcy filing by a solvent borrower,
a borrower could file for bankruptcy without obtaining the consent of its independent director(s) (and we cannot assure you that
such bankruptcy would be dismissed as an unauthorized filing), and in any case the independent directors, managers or trustees
may determine that a bankruptcy filing is an appropriate course of action to be taken by such borrower. Although the independent
directors, managers or trustees generally owe no fiduciary duties to entities other than the borrower itself, such determination
might take into account the interests and financial condition of such borrowerâs parent entities and such parent entitiesâ
other subsidiaries in addition to those of the borrower. Consequently, the financial distress of an affiliate of a borrower might
increase the likelihood of a bankruptcy filing by a borrower.
Â 
The bankruptcy of a borrower, or a general
partner or managing member of a borrower, may impair the ability of the lender to enforce its rights and remedies under the related
mortgage loan. Certain of the mortgage loans have been made to single purpose limited partnerships that have a general partner
or general partners that are not themselves single purpose entities. Such loans are subject to additional bankruptcy risk. The
organizational documents of the general partner in such cases do not limit it to acting as the general partner of the partnership.
Accordingly there is a greater risk that the general partner may become insolvent for reasons unrelated to the mortgaged property.
The bankruptcy of a general partner may dissolve the partnership under applicable state law. In addition, even if the partnership
itself is not insolvent, actions by the partnership and/or a bankrupt general partner that are outside the ordinary course of their
business, such as refinancing the related mortgage loan, may require prior approval of the bankruptcy court in the general partnerâs
bankruptcy case. The proceedings required to resolve these issues may be costly and time-consuming.
Â 
Any borrower, even an entity structured
as a single purpose entity, as an owner of real estate, will be subject to certain potential liabilities and risks as an owner
of real estate. We cannot assure you that any borrower will not file for bankruptcy protection or that creditors of a borrower
or a corporate or individual general partner or managing member of a borrower will not initiate a bankruptcy or similar proceeding
against such borrower or corporate or individual general partner or managing member.
Â 
Certain borrowersâ organizational
documents or the terms of certain mortgage loans permit an affiliated property manager to maintain a custodial account on behalf
of such borrower and certain affiliates of such borrower into which funds available to such borrower under the terms of the related
mortgage loans and funds of such affiliates are held, but which funds are and will continue to be separately accounted for as to
each item of income
Â 

95
Â 
Â 
and expense for each related mortgaged property and each related borrower. A custodial account structure for
affiliated entities, while common among certain REITs, institutions or independent owners of multiple properties, presents a risk
for consolidation of the assets of such affiliates as commingling of funds is a factor a court may consider in considering a request
by other creditors for substantive consolidation. Substantive consolidation is an equitable remedy that could result in an otherwise
solvent company becoming subject to the bankruptcy proceedings of an insolvent affiliate, making its assets available to repay
the debts of affiliated companies. A court has the discretion to order substantive consolidation in whole or in part and may include
non-debtor affiliates of the bankrupt entity in the proceedings. In particular, consolidation may be ordered when corporate funds
are commingled and used for a principalâs personal purposes, inadequate records of transfers are made and corporate entities
are deemed an alter ego of a principal. Strict adherence to maintaining separate books and records, avoiding commingling of assets
and otherwise maintaining corporate policies designed to preserve the separateness of corporate assets and liabilities make it
less likely that a court would order substantive consolidation, but we cannot assure you that the related borrowers, property managers
or affiliates will comply with these requirements as set forth in the related mortgage loans.
Â 
Furthermore, with respect to any affiliated
borrowers, creditors of a common parent in bankruptcy may seek to consolidate the assets of such borrowers with those of the parent.
Consolidation of the assets of such borrowers would likely have an adverse effect on the funds available to make distributions
on your certificates, and may lead to a downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of the ratings of your certificates.
Â 
See âDescription of the Mortgage
PoolâCertain Terms of the Mortgage LoansâSingle Purpose Entity Covenantsâ and âCertain Legal Aspects
of Mortgage LoansâBankruptcy Lawsâ.
Â 
In addition, borrowers may own a mortgaged
property as a Delaware statutory trust or as tenants-in-common. Delaware statutory trusts may be restricted in their ability to
actively operate a property, and in the case of a mortgaged property that is owned by a Delaware statutory trust or by tenants
-in- common, there is a risk that obtaining the consent of the holders of the beneficial interests in the Delaware statutory trust
or the consent of the tenants -in- common will be time consuming and cause delays with respect to the taking of certain actions
by or on behalf of the borrower, including with respect to the related mortgaged property. See ââTenancies -in- Common May Hinder
Recoveryâ below. See also âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâMortgage Pool CharacteristicsâTenancies in Common; Crowd Fundingâ
in this prospectus.
Â 
In addition, certain of the mortgage loans may have borrowers that are wholly or partially (directly or indirectly)
owned by one or more crowd funding investor groups. Investments in the commercial real estate market through crowd funding investor
groups are a relatively recent development and there may be certain unanticipated risks to this new ownership structure which
may adversely affect the related mortgage loan. Typically, the crowd funding investor group is made up of a large number of individual
investors who invest relatively small amounts in the group pursuant to a securities offering. With respect to an equity investment
in the borrower, the crowd funding investor group in turn purchases a stake in the borrower. Accordingly, equity in the borrower
is indirectly held by the individual investors in the crowd funding group. We cannot assure you that either the crowd funding
investor group or the individual investors in the crowd funding investor group have relevant expertise in the commercial real
estate market. Additionally, crowd funding investor groups are required to comply with various securities regulations related
to offerings of securities and we cannot assure you that any enforcement action or legal proceeding regarding failure to comply
with such securities regulations would not delay
Â 

96
Â 
Â 
enforcement of the related
mortgage loan. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that a bankruptcy proceeding by the crowd funding investor group will not delay
enforcement of the related mortgage loan. See âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâMortgage Pool CharacteristicsâTenancies
in Common; Crowd Fundingâ in this prospectus. See ââLitigation Regarding the Mortgaged Properties or Borrowers
May Impair Your Distributionsâ ââFrequent and Early Occurrence of Borrower Delinquencies and Defaults
May Adversely Affect Your Investmentâ and ââThe Performance of a Mortgage Loan and Its Related Mortgaged
Property Depends in Part on Who Controls the Borrower and Mortgaged Propertyâ.
Â 
A Bankruptcy Proceeding
May Result in Losses and Delays in Realizing on the Mortgage Loans
Â 
Numerous statutory provisions, including
the federal bankruptcy code and state laws affording relief to debtors, may interfere with and delay the ability of a secured mortgage
lender to obtain payment of a loan, to realize upon collateral and/or to enforce a deficiency judgment. For example, under the
federal bankruptcy code, virtually all actions (including foreclosure actions and deficiency judgment proceedings) are automatically
stayed upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition, and, often, no interest or principal payments are made during the course of the
bankruptcy proceeding. Also, under federal bankruptcy law, the filing of a petition in bankruptcy by or on behalf of a junior lien
holder may stay the senior lender from taking action to foreclose out such junior lien. Certain of the mortgage loans have sponsors
that have previously filed bankruptcy and we cannot assure you that such sponsors will not be more likely than other sponsors to
utilize their rights in bankruptcy in the event of any threatened action by the mortgagee to enforce its rights under the related
mortgage loan documents. As a result, the issuing entityâs recovery with respect to borrowers in bankruptcy proceedings may
be significantly delayed, and the aggregate amount ultimately collected may be substantially less than the amount owed. See ââOther
Financings or Ability To Incur Other Indebtedness Entails Riskâ below, âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâLoan
Purpose; Default History, Bankruptcy Issues and Other Proceedingsâ and âCertain Legal Aspects of Mortgage LoansâBankruptcy
Lawsâ.
Â 
Additionally, the courts of any state may
refuse the foreclosure of a mortgage or deed of trust when an acceleration of the indebtedness would be inequitable or unjust or
the circumstances would render the action unconscionable. See âCertain Legal Aspects of Mortgage LoansâForeclosureâ.
Â 
See also ââPerformance of
the Mortgage Loan Will Be Highly Dependent on the Performance of Tenants and Tenant LeasesâTenant Bankruptcy Could Result
in a Rejection of the Related Leaseâ above.
Â 
Litigation Regarding the
Mortgaged Properties or Borrowers May Impair Your Distributions
Â 
There may be (and there may exist from time
to time) pending or threatened legal proceedings against, or disputes with, the borrowers, the borrower sponsors, the managers
of the mortgaged properties and their respective affiliates arising out of their ordinary business. We have not undertaken a search
for all legal proceedings that relate to the borrowers, borrower sponsors, managers for the mortgaged properties or their respective
affiliates. Potential investors are advised and encouraged to perform their own searches related to such matters to the extent
relevant to their investment decision. Any such litigation or dispute may materially impair distributions to certificateholders
if borrowers must use property income to pay judgments, legal fees or litigation costs. We cannot assure you that any litigation
or dispute or any settlement of any litigation or dispute will not have a material adverse effect on your investment.
Â 

97
Â 

Â 
Additionally, a borrower or a principal
of a borrower or affiliate may have been a party to a bankruptcy, foreclosure, litigation or other proceeding, particularly against
a lender, or may have been convicted of a crime in the past. In addition, certain of the borrower sponsors, property managers,
affiliates of any of the foregoing and/or entities controlled thereby have been a party to bankruptcy proceedings, mortgage loan
defaults and restructures, discounted payoffs, foreclosure proceedings or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transactions, or other material
proceedings (including criminal proceedings) in the past, whether or not related to the mortgaged property securing a mortgage
loan in this securitization transaction. In some cases, mortgaged properties securing certain of the mortgage loans previously
secured other loans that had been in default, restructured or the subject of a discounted payoff, foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of
foreclosure.
Â 
Certain of the borrower sponsors may have
a history of litigation or other proceedings against their lender, in some cases involving various parties to a securitization
transaction. We cannot assure you that the borrower sponsors that have engaged in litigation or other proceedings in the past will
not commence action against the issuing entity in the future upon any attempt by the special servicer to enforce the mortgage loan
documents. Any such actions by the borrower or borrower sponsor may result in significant expense and potential loss to the issuing
entity and a shortfall in funds available to make payments on the offered certificates. In addition, certain principals or borrower
sponsors may have in the past been convicted of, or pled guilty to, a felony. We cannot assure you that the borrower or principal
will not be more likely than other borrowers or principals to avail itself or cause a borrower to avail itself of its legal rights,
under the federal bankruptcy code or otherwise, in the event of an action or threatened action by the lender or its servicer to
enforce the related mortgage loan documents, or otherwise conduct its operations in a manner that is in the best interests of the
lender and/or the mortgaged property. We cannot assure you that any such proceedings or actions will not have a material adverse
effect upon distributions on your certificates. Further, borrowers, principals of borrowers, property managers and affiliates of
such parties may, in the future, be involved in bankruptcy proceedings, foreclosure proceedings or other material proceedings (including
criminal proceedings), whether or not related to the mortgage loans. We cannot assure you that any such proceedings will not negatively
impact a borrowerâs or borrower sponsorâs ability to meet its obligations under the related mortgage loan and, as a
result could have a material adverse effect upon your certificates.
Â 
Often it is difficult to confirm the identity
of owners of all of the equity in a borrower, which means that past issues may not be discovered as to such owners. See âDescription
of the Mortgage PoolâLitigation and Other Considerationsâ and ââLoan Purpose; Default History, Bankruptcy
Issues and Other Proceedingsâ for additional information on certain mortgage loans in the issuing entity. However, we
cannot assure you that there are no undisclosed bankruptcy proceedings, foreclosure proceedings, deed-in-lieu-of-foreclosure transaction
and/or mortgage loan workout matters that involved one or more mortgage loans or mortgaged properties, and/or a guarantor, borrower
sponsor or other party to a mortgage loan.
Â 
In addition, in the event the owner of a
borrower experiences financial problems, we cannot assure you that such owner would not attempt to take actions with respect to
the mortgaged property that may adversely affect the borrowerâs ability to fulfill its obligations under the related mortgage
loan. See âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâLitigation and Other Considerationsâ for information regarding
litigation matters with respect to certain mortgage loans.
Â 

98
Â 

Â 
Other Financings or Ability
to Incur Other Indebtedness Entails Risk
Â 
When a borrower (or its constituent members)
also has one or more other outstanding loans (even if they are pari passu, subordinated, mezzanine, preferred equity or
unsecured loans or another type of equity pledge), the issuing entity is subjected to additional risk such as:
Â 

Â·the borrower (or its constituent members) may have difficulty servicing and repaying multiple financings;
Â 

Â·the existence of other financings will generally also make it more difficult for the borrower to obtain refinancing of the
related mortgage loan (or whole loan, if applicable) or sell the related mortgaged property and may thereby jeopardize repayment
of the mortgage loan (or whole loan, if applicable);
Â 

Â·the need to service additional financings may reduce the cash flow available to the borrower to operate and maintain the mortgaged
property and the value of the mortgaged property may decline as a result;
Â 

Â·if a borrower (or its constituent members) defaults on its mortgage loan and/or any other financing, actions taken by other
lenders such as a suit for collection, foreclosure or an involuntary petition for bankruptcy against the borrower could impair
the security available to the issuing entity, including the mortgaged property, or stay the issuing entityâs ability to foreclose
during the course of the bankruptcy case;
Â 

Â·the bankruptcy of another lender also may operate to stay foreclosure by the issuing entity; and
Â 

Â·the issuing entity may also be subject to the costs and administrative burdens of involvement in foreclosure or bankruptcy
proceedings or related litigation.
Â 
Although the companion loans related to
the whole loans are not assets of the issuing entity, each related borrower is still obligated to make interest and principal payments
on such companion loans. As a result, the issuing entity is subject to additional risks, including:
Â 

Â·the risk that the necessary maintenance of the related mortgaged property could be deferred to allow the borrower to pay the
required debt service on these other obligations and that the value of the mortgaged property may fall as a result; and
Â 

Â·the risk that it may be more difficult for the borrower to refinance these loans or to sell the related mortgaged property
for purposes of making any balloon payment on the entire balance of such loans and the related additional debt at maturity or anticipated
repayment date.
Â 
With respect to mezzanine financing (if
any), while a mezzanine lender has no security interest in the related mortgaged properties, a default under a mezzanine loan could
cause a change in control of the related borrower. With respect to mortgage loans that permit mezzanine financing, the relative
rights of the mortgagee and the related mezzanine lender will generally be set forth in an intercreditor agreement, which agreements
typically provide that the rights of the mezzanine lender (including the right to payment) against the borrower and mortgaged property
are subordinate to the rights of the mortgage lender and that the mezzanine lender may not take any enforcement action against
the mortgage borrower and mortgaged property.
Â 

99
Â 

Â 
In addition, the mortgage loan documents
related to certain mortgage loans may have or permit future âpreferred equityâ structures, where one or more special
limited partners or members receive a preferred return in exchange for an infusion of capital or other type of equity pledge that
may require payments of a specified return or of excess cash flow. Such arrangements can present risks that resemble mezzanine
debt, including dilution of the borrowerâs equity in the mortgaged property, stress on the cash flow in the form of a preferred
return or excess cash payments, and/or potential changes in the management of the related mortgaged property in the event the preferred
return is not satisfied.
Â 
Additionally, the terms of certain mortgage
loans permit or require the borrowers to post letters of credit and/or surety bonds for the benefit of the related mortgage loan,
which may constitute a contingent reimbursement obligation of the related borrower or an affiliate. The issuing bank or surety
will not typically agree to subordination and standstill protection benefiting the mortgagee.
Â 
In addition, borrowers under most of the
mortgage loans are generally permitted to incur trade payables and equipment financing, which may not be limited or may be significant,
in order to operate the related mortgaged properties. Also, with respect to certain mortgage loans the related borrower either
has incurred or is permitted to incur unsecured debt from an affiliate of either the borrower or the sponsor of the borrower. See
âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâAdditional IndebtednessâOther Unsecured Indebtednessâ.
Â 
For additional information, see âDescription
of the Mortgage PoolâAdditional Indebtednessâ and âPooling and Servicing AgreementâServicing of
the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loansâ.
Â 
Tenancies-in-Common May
Hinder Recovery
Â 
Certain of the mortgage loans included in
the issuing entity have borrowers that own the related mortgaged properties as tenants-in-common. In general, with respect to a
tenant-in-common ownership structure, each tenant-in-common owns an undivided share in the property and if such tenant-in-common
desires to sell its interest in the property (and is unable to find a buyer or otherwise needs to force a partition) the tenant-in-common
has the ability to request that a court order a sale of the property and distribute the proceeds to each tenant in common proportionally.
As a result, if a tenant-in-common that has not waived its right of partition or similar right exercises a right of partition,
the related mortgage loan may be subject to prepayment. The bankruptcy, dissolution or action for partition by one or more of the
tenants-in-common could result in an early repayment of the related mortgage loan, significant delay in recovery against the tenant-in-common
borrowers, particularly if the tenant-in-common borrowers file for bankruptcy separately or in series (because each time a tenant-in-common
borrower files for bankruptcy, the bankruptcy court stay will be reinstated), a material impairment in property management and
a substantial decrease in the amount recoverable upon the related mortgage loan. Not all tenants-in-common under the mortgage loans
will be single purpose entities. Each tenant-in-common borrower has waived its right to partition, reducing the risk of partition.
However, we cannot assure you that, if challenged, this waiver would be enforceable. In addition, in some cases, the related mortgage
loan documents may provide for full recourse (or in an amount equal to its pro rata share of the debt) to the related tenant-in-common
borrower or the guarantor if a tenant-in-common files for partition.
Â 

100
Â 
Â 
Risks Relating to Enforceability
of Cross-Collateralization
Â 
Cross-collateralization arrangements may
be terminated in certain circumstances under the terms of the related mortgage loan documents. Cross-collateralization arrangements
whereby multiple borrowers grant their respective mortgaged properties as security for one or more mortgage loans could be challenged
as fraudulent conveyances by the creditors or the bankruptcy estate of any of the related borrowers.
Â 
Among other things, a legal challenge to
the granting of the liens may focus on the benefits realized by that borrower from the respective mortgage loan proceeds, as well
as the overall cross-collateralization. If a court were to conclude that the granting of the liens was an avoidable fraudulent
conveyance, that court could subordinate all or part of the mortgage loan to other debt of that borrower, recover prior payments
made on that mortgage loan, or take other actions such as invalidating the mortgage loan or the mortgages securing the cross-collateralization.
See âCertain Legal Aspects of Mortgage LoansâBankruptcy Lawsâ.
Â 
In addition, when multiple real properties
secure a mortgage loan, the amount of the mortgage encumbering any particular one of those properties may be less than the full
amount of the related aggregate mortgage loan indebtedness, to minimize recording tax. This mortgage amount is generally established
at 100% to 150% of the appraised value or allocated loan amount for the mortgaged property and will limit the extent to which proceeds
from the property will be available to offset declines in value of the other properties securing the same mortgage loan.
Â 
See âDescription of the Mortgage
PoolâMortgage Pool Characteristicsâ for a description of any mortgage loans that are cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted
with each other or that are secured by multiple properties owned by multiple borrowers.
Â 
Risks Relating to Enforceability
of Yield Maintenance Charges, Prepayment Premiums or Defeasance Provisions
Â 
Provisions requiring yield maintenance charges,
prepayment premiums or lockout periods may not be enforceable in some states and under federal bankruptcy law. Provisions requiring
prepayment premiums or yield maintenance charges also may be interpreted as constituting the collection of interest for usury purposes.
Accordingly, we cannot assure you that the obligation to pay a yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium will be enforceable.
Also, we cannot assure you that foreclosure proceeds will be sufficient to pay an enforceable yield maintenance charge or prepayment
premium.
Â 
Additionally, although the collateral substitution
provisions related to defeasance do not have the same effect on the certificateholders as prepayment, we cannot assure you that
a court would not interpret those provisions as the equivalent of a yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium. In certain
jurisdictions those collateral substitution provisions might therefore be deemed unenforceable or usurious under applicable law
or public policy.
Â 
Risks Associated with One
Action Rules
Â 
Several states (such as California) have
laws that prohibit more than one âjudicial actionâ to enforce a mortgage obligation, and some courts have construed
the term âjudicial actionâ broadly. Accordingly, the special servicer will be required to obtain advice of counsel
prior to enforcing any of the issuing entityâs rights under any of the mortgage loans that include mortgaged properties where
a âone actionâ rule could be applicable. In the case of a multi property mortgage loan which is secured by mortgaged
properties located in multiple
Â 

101
Â 
Â 
states, the special servicer may be required to foreclose first on properties located in states
where âone actionâ rules apply (and where non-judicial foreclosure is permitted) before foreclosing on properties located
in states where judicial foreclosure is the only permitted method of foreclosure. See âCertain Legal Aspects of Mortgage
LoansâForeclosureâ.
Â 
State Law Limitations on
Assignments of Leases and Rents May Entail Risks
Â 
Generally mortgage loans included in an
issuing entity secured by mortgaged properties that are subject to leases typically will be secured by an assignment of leases
and rents pursuant to which the related borrower (or with respect to any indemnity deed of trust structure, the related property
owner) assigns to the lender its right, title and interest as landlord under the leases of the related mortgaged properties, and
the income derived from those leases, as further security for the related mortgage loan, while retaining a license to collect rents
for so long as there is no default. If the borrower defaults, the license terminates and the lender is entitled to collect rents.
Some state laws may require that the lender take possession of the related property and obtain a judicial appointment of a receiver
before becoming entitled to collect the rents. In addition, if bankruptcy or similar proceedings are commenced by or in respect
of the borrower, the lenderâs ability to collect the rents may be adversely affected. See âCertain Legal Aspects
of Mortgage LoansâLeases and Rentsâ and ââBankruptcy Lawsâ.
Â 
Various Other Laws Could
Affect the Exercise of Lenderâs Rights
Â 
The laws of the jurisdictions in which the
mortgaged properties are located (which laws may vary substantially) govern many of the legal aspects of the mortgage loans. These
laws may affect the ability to foreclose on, and, in turn the ability to realize value from, the mortgaged properties securing
the mortgage loans. For example, state law determines:
Â 

Â·what proceedings are required for foreclosure;
Â 

Â·whether the borrower and any foreclosed junior lienors may redeem the property and the conditions under which these rights
of redemption may be exercised;
Â 

Â·whether and to what extent recourse to the borrower is permitted; and
Â 

Â·what rights junior mortgagees have and whether the amount of fees and interest that lenders may charge is limited.
Â 
In addition, the laws of some jurisdictions
may render certain provisions of the mortgage loans unenforceable or subject to limitations which may affect lenderâs rights
under the mortgage loans. Delays in liquidations of defaulted mortgage loans and shortfalls in amounts realized upon liquidation
as a result of the application of these laws may create delays and shortfalls in payments to certificateholders. See âCertain
Legal Aspects of Mortgage Loansâ.
Â 
Risks of Anticipated Repayment
Date Loans
Â 
Certain of the mortgage loans provide that,
if after a certain date (referred to as the anticipated repayment date) the related borrower has not prepaid the mortgage loan
in full, any principal outstanding after that anticipated repayment date will accrue interest at an increased interest rate rather
than the stated mortgage loan rate. Generally, from and after the anticipated repayment date, cash flow in excess of that required
for debt service, the funding of reserves and certain approved operating expenses with respect to the related mortgaged property
will be applied toward the payment of principal (without payment of a
Â 

102
Â 
Â 
yield maintenance charge) of the related mortgage loan until
its principal balance has been reduced to zero. Although these provisions may create an incentive for the borrower to repay the
mortgage loan in full on its anticipated repayment date, a substantial payment would be required and the borrower has no obligation
to do so. While interest at the initial mortgage rate continues to accrue and be payable on a current basis on this mortgage loan
after its anticipated repayment date, the payment of excess interest will be deferred and will be required to be paid only after
the outstanding principal balance of the related mortgage loan has been paid in full, at which time the excess interest that has
been deferred, to the extent actually collected, will be paid to the holders of the ClassÂ V certificates, which are not offered
by this prospectus. See âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâCertain Terms of the Mortgage LoansâARD Loanâ.
Â 
The Absence of Lockboxes
Entails Risks That Could Adversely Affect Distributions on Your Certificates
Â 
Certain of the mortgage loans may not require
the related borrower to cause rent and other payments to be made into a lockbox account maintained on behalf of the mortgagee,
although some of those mortgage loans do provide for a springing lockbox. If rental payments are not required to be made directly
into a lockbox account, there is a risk that the borrower will divert such funds for other purposes.
Â 
Borrower May Be Unable To
Repay Remaining Principal Balance on Maturity Date or Anticipated Repayment Date; Longer Amortization Schedules and Interest-Only
Provisions Increase Risk
Â 
Mortgage loans with substantial remaining
principal balances at their stated maturity date or anticipated repayment date, as applicable, involve greater risk than fully-amortizing
mortgage loans because the borrower may be unable to repay the mortgage loan at that time. In addition, fully amortizing mortgage
loans which may pay interest on an âactual/360â basis but have fixed monthly payments may, in effect, have a small
balloon payment due at maturity or anticipated repayment date.
Â 
All of the mortgage loans have amortization
schedules that are significantly longer than their respective terms to maturity or anticipated repayment date, as applicable, and
many of the mortgage loans require only payments of interest for part or all of their respective terms. See âDescription
of the Mortgage PoolâCertain Terms of the Mortgage LoansâDue Dates; Mortgage Rates; Calculations of Interestâ.
A longer amortization schedule or an interest-only provision in a mortgage loan will result in a higher amount of principal outstanding
under the mortgage loan at any particular time, including at the maturity date of the mortgage loan, than would have otherwise
been the case had a shorter amortization schedule been used or had the mortgage loan had a shorter interest-only period or not
included an interest-only provision at all. That higher principal amount outstanding could both (i)Â make it more difficult
for the related borrower to make the required balloon payment at maturity or anticipated repayment date and (ii)Â lead to increased
losses for the issuing entity either during the loan term or at maturity or anticipated repayment date if the mortgage loan becomes
a defaulted mortgage loan.
Â 
A borrowerâs ability to repay a mortgage
loan on its stated maturity date or anticipated repayment date, as applicable, typically will depend upon its ability either to
refinance the mortgage loan or to sell the mortgaged property at a price sufficient to permit repayment. A borrowerâs ability
to achieve either of these goals will be affected by a number of factors, including:
Â 


103
Â 
Â 

Â·the availability of, and competition for, credit for commercial, multifamily or manufactured housing community real estate
projects, which fluctuate over time;
Â 

Â·the prevailing interest rates;
Â 

Â·the net operating income generated by the mortgaged property;
Â 

Â·the fair market value of the related mortgaged property;
Â 

Â·the borrowerâs equity in the related mortgaged property;
Â 

Â·significant tenant rollover at the related mortgaged properties (see ââRetail Properties Have Special Risksâ
and ââOffice Properties Have Special Risksâ above);
Â 

Â·the borrowerâs financial condition;
Â 

Â·the operating history and occupancy level of the mortgaged property;
Â 

Â·reductions in applicable government assistance/rent subsidy programs;
Â 

Â·the tax laws; and
Â 

Â·prevailing general and regional economic conditions.
Â 
With respect to any mortgage loan that is
part of a whole loan, the risks relating to balloon payment obligations are enhanced by the existence and amount of the related
companion loans.
Â 
None of the sponsors, any party to the pooling
and servicing agreement or any other person will be under any obligation to refinance any mortgage loan. However, in order to maximize
recoveries on defaulted mortgage loans, the pooling and servicing agreement permits the special servicer (and the pooling and servicing
agreement governing the servicing of a non-serviced whole loan may permit the related special servicer) to extend and modify mortgage
loans in a manner consistent with the servicing standard, subject to the limitations described under âPooling and Servicing
AgreementâRealization Upon Mortgage Loansâ and ââModifications, Waivers and Amendmentsâ.
Â 
Neither the master servicer nor the special
servicer will have the ability to extend or modify a non-serviced mortgage loan because such mortgage loan is being serviced by
a master servicer or special servicer pursuant to the pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of the applicable
non-serviced whole loan. See âPooling and Servicing AgreementâServicing of the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loansâ.
Â 
We cannot assure you that any extension
or modification will increase the present value of recoveries in a given case. Whether or not losses are ultimately sustained,
any delay in collection of a balloon payment that would otherwise be distributable on your certificates, whether such delay is
due to borrower default or to modification of the related mortgage loan, will likely extend the weighted average life of your certificates.
Â 
In any event, we cannot assure you that
each borrower under a balloon loan will have the ability to repay the principal balance of such mortgage loan on the related maturity
date or anticipated repayment date, as applicable.
Â 
See âDescription of the Mortgage
PoolâMortgage Pool Characteristicsâ.
Â 


104
Â 
Â 
Risks Related to Ground
Leases and Other Leasehold Interests
Â 
With respect to certain mortgaged properties,
the encumbered interest will be characterized as a âfee interestâ if (i)Â the borrower has a fee interest in all
or substantially all of the mortgaged property (provided that if the borrower has a leasehold interest in any portion of
the mortgaged property, such portion is not material to the use or operation of the mortgaged property), or (ii)Â the mortgage
loan is secured by the borrowerâs leasehold interest in the mortgaged property as well as the borrowerâs (or other
fee ownerâs) overlapping fee interest in the related mortgaged property.
Â 
Leasehold mortgage loans are subject to
certain risks not associated with mortgage loans secured by a lien on the fee estate of the borrower. The most significant of these
risks is that if the related borrowerâs leasehold were to be terminated upon a lease default, the lender would lose its security
in the leasehold interest. Generally, each related ground lease or a lessor estoppel requires the lessor to give the lender notice
of the borrowerâs defaults under the ground lease and an opportunity to cure them, permits the leasehold interest to be assigned
to the lender or the purchaser at a foreclosure sale, in some cases only upon the consent of the lessor, and contains certain other
protective provisions typically included in a âmortgageableâ ground lease, although not all these protective provisions
are included in each case.
Â 
Upon the bankruptcy of a lessor or a lessee
under a ground lease, the debtor has the right to assume or reject the lease. If a debtor lessor rejects the lease, the lessee
has the right pursuant to the federal bankruptcy code to treat such lease as terminated by rejection or remain in possession of
its leased premises for the rent otherwise payable under the lease for the remaining term of the ground lease (including renewals)
and to offset against such rent any damages incurred due to the landlordâs failure to perform its obligations under the lease.
If a debtor lessee/borrower rejects any or all of the lease, the leasehold lender could succeed to the lessee/borrowerâs
position under the lease only if the lease specifically grants the lender such right. If both the lessor and the lessee/borrower
are involved in bankruptcy proceedings, the issuing entity may be unable to enforce the bankrupt lessee/borrowerâs pre-petition
agreement to refuse to treat a ground lease rejected by a bankrupt lessor as terminated. In such circumstances, a ground lease
could be terminated notwithstanding lender protection provisions contained in the ground lease or in the mortgage.
Â 
Some of the ground leases securing the mortgage
loans may provide that the ground rent payable under the related ground lease increases during the term of the mortgage loan. These
increases may adversely affect the cash flow and net income of the related borrower.
Â 
A leasehold lender could lose its security
unless (i)Â the leasehold lender holds a fee mortgage, (ii)Â the ground lease requires the lessor to enter into a new lease
with the leasehold lender upon termination or rejection of the ground lease, or (iii)Â the bankruptcy court, as a court of
equity, allows the leasehold lender to assume the ground lesseeâs obligations under the ground lease and succeed to the ground
lesseeâs position. Although not directly covered by the 1994 Amendments to the federal bankruptcy code, such a result would
be consistent with the purpose of the 1994 Amendments to the federal bankruptcy code granting the holders of leasehold mortgages
permitted under the terms of the lease the right to succeed to the position of a leasehold mortgagor. Although consistent with
the federal bankruptcy code, such position may not be adopted by the applicable bankruptcy court.
Â 


105
Â 
Â 
Further, in a decision by the United States
Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (Precision Indus. v. Qualitech Steel SBQ, LLC, 327 F.3d 537 (7th Cir. 2003)) the
court ruled with respect to an unrecorded lease of real property that where a statutory sale of the fee interest in leased property
occurs under the federal bankruptcy code upon the bankruptcy of a landlord, such sale terminates a lesseeâs possessory interest
in the property, and the purchaser assumes title free and clear of any interest, including any leasehold estates. Pursuant to the
federal bankruptcy code, a lessee may request the bankruptcy court to prohibit or condition the statutory sale of the property
so as to provide adequate protection of the leasehold interest; however, the court ruled that this provision does not ensure continued
possession of the property, but rather entitles the lessee to compensation for the value of its leasehold interest, typically from
the sale proceeds. While there are certain circumstances under which a âfree and clearâ sale under the federal bankruptcy
code would not be authorized (including that the lessee could not be compelled in a legal or equitable proceeding to accept a monetary
satisfaction of his possessory interest, and that none of the other conditions of the federal bankruptcy code otherwise permits
the sale), we cannot assure you that those circumstances would be present in any proposed sale of a leased premises. As a result,
we cannot assure you that, in the event of a statutory sale of leased property pursuant to the federal bankruptcy code, the lessee
will be able to maintain possession of the property under the ground lease. In addition, we cannot assure you that the lessee and/or
the lender will be able to recoup the full value of the leasehold interest in bankruptcy court. Most of the ground leases contain
standard protections typically obtained by securitization lenders. Certain of the ground leases with respect to a mortgage loan
included in the issuing entity may not. See also representation and warranty no.Â 34 on AnnexÂ D-1 to this prospectus and
the exceptions thereto on AnnexÂ D-2 to this prospectus (subject to the limitations and qualifications set forth in the preamble
to AnnexÂ D-1 to this prospectus).
Â 
Except as noted in this prospectus, each
of the ground leases has a term that extends at least 20 years beyond the maturity date of the mortgage loan (taking into account
all freely exercisable extension options) and contains customary mortgagee protection provisions, including notice and cure rights
and the right to enter into a new lease with the applicable ground lessor in the event a ground lease is rejected or terminated.
Â 
With respect to certain of the mortgage
loans, the related borrower may have given to certain lessors under the related ground lease a right of first refusal in the event
a sale is contemplated or an option to purchase all or a portion of the mortgaged property and these provisions, if not waived,
may impede the mortgageeâs ability to sell the related mortgaged property at foreclosure or adversely affect the foreclosure
process.
Â 
See âCertain Legal Aspects of Mortgage
LoansâBankruptcy Lawsâ.
Â 
Leased Fee Properties Have
Special Risks
Â 
Land subject to a ground lease presents
special risks. In such cases, where the borrower owns the fee interest but not the related improvements, such borrower will only
receive the rental income from the ground lease and not from the operation of any related improvements. Any default by the ground
lessee would adversely affect the borrowerâs ability to make payments on the related mortgage loan. While ground leases may
contain certain restrictions on the use and operation of the related mortgaged property, the ground lessee generally enjoys the
rights and privileges of a fee owner, including the right to construct, alter and remove improvements and fixtures from the land
and to assign and sublet the ground leasehold interest. However, the borrower has the same risk of interruptions in cash flow if
such ground lessee defaults under its lease as it would on another single tenant commercial property, without the control over
the premises that it
Â 

106
Â 
Â 
would ordinarily have as landlord. In addition, in the event of a condemnation, the borrower would only be
entitled to an allocable share of the condemnation proceeds. Furthermore, the insurance requirements are often governed by the
terms of the ground lease and, in some cases, certain tenants or subtenants may be allowed to self-insure. The ground lessee is
commonly permitted to mortgage its ground leasehold interest, and the leasehold lender will often have notice and cure rights with
respect to material defaults under the ground lease. In addition, leased fee interests are less frequently purchased and sold than
other interests in commercial real property. It may be difficult for the issuing entity, if it became a foreclosing lender, to
sell the fee interests if the tenant and its improvements remain on the land. In addition, if the improvements are nearing the
end of their useful life, there could be a risk that the tenant defaults in lieu of performing any obligations it may otherwise
have to raze the structure and return the land in raw form to the developer. Furthermore, leased fee interests are generally subject
to the same risks associated with the property type of the ground lesseeâs use of the premises because that use is a source
of revenue for the payment of ground rent.
Â 
Increases in Real Estate
Taxes May Reduce Available Funds
Â 
Certain of the mortgaged properties securing
the mortgage loans have or may in the future have the benefit of reduced real estate taxes in connection with a local government
âpayment in lieu of taxesâ program or other tax abatement arrangements. Upon expiration of such program or if such
programs were otherwise terminated, the related borrower would be required to pay higher, and in some cases substantially higher,
real estate taxes. Prior to expiration of such program, the tax benefit to the mortgaged property may decrease throughout the term
of the expiration date until the expiration of such program. An increase in real estate taxes may impact the ability of the borrower
to pay debt service on the mortgage loan.
Â 
See âDescription of the Mortgage
PoolâReal Estate and Other Tax Considerationsâ for descriptions of real estate tax matters relating to certain
mortgaged properties.
Â 
State and Local Mortgage
Recording Taxes May Apply Upon a Foreclosure or Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure and Reduce Net Proceeds
Â 
Many jurisdictions impose recording taxes
on mortgages which, if not paid at the time of the recording of the mortgage, may impair the ability of the lender to foreclose
the mortgage. Such taxes, interest, and penalties could be significant in amount and would, if imposed, reduce the net proceeds
realized by the issuing entity in liquidating the real property securing the related mortgage loan.
Â 
Risks Related to Conflicts
of Interest
Â 
Interests and Incentives
of the Originators, the Sponsors and Their Affiliates May Not Be Aligned With Your Interests
Â 
The originators, the sponsors and their
affiliates (including certain of the underwriters) expect to derive ancillary benefits from this offering and their respective
incentives may not be aligned with those of purchasers of the offered certificates. The sponsors originated or purchased the mortgage
loans in order to securitize the mortgage loans by means of a transaction such as the offering of the offered certificates. The
sponsors will sell the mortgage loans to the depositor (an affiliate of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, one of the sponsors
and originators, the master servicer, the certificate administrator and of Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, one of the underwriters)
on the closing date in exchange for cash, derived from the sale of the offered certificates to investors and/or in exchange for
Â 

107
Â 
Â 
offered certificates. A completed offering would reduce the originatorsâ exposure to the mortgage loans. The originators
made the mortgage loans with a view toward securitizing them and distributing the exposure by means of a transaction such as this
offering of offered certificates. In addition, certain mortgaged properties may have tenants that are affiliated with the related
originator. See âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâTenant IssuesâAffiliated Leasesâ. This offering
of offered certificates will effectively transfer the originatorsâ exposure to the mortgage loans to purchasers of the offered
certificates.
Â 
The originators, the sponsors and their
affiliates expect to receive various benefits, including compensation, commissions, payments, rebates, remuneration and business
opportunities, in connection with or as a result of this offering of offered certificates and their interests in the mortgage loans.
The sponsors and their affiliates will effectively receive compensation, and may record a profit, in an amount based on, among
other things, the amount of proceeds (net of transaction expenses) received from the sale of the offered certificates to investors
relative to their investment in the mortgage loans. The benefits to the originators, the sponsors and their affiliates arising
from the decision to securitize the mortgage loans may be greater than they would have been had other assets been selected.
Â 
Furthermore, the sponsors and/or their affiliates
may benefit from a completed offering of the offered certificates because the offering would establish a market precedent and a
valuation data point for securities similar to the offered certificates, thus enhancing the ability of the sponsors and their affiliates
to conduct similar offerings in the future and permitting them to adjust the fair value of the mortgage loans or other similar
assets or securities held on their balance sheet, including increasing the carrying value or avoiding decreasing the carrying value
of some or all of such similar positions.
Â 
In some cases, the originators or their
affiliates are the holders of the mezzanine loans and/or companion loans related to their mortgage loans. The originators and/or
their respective affiliates may retain existing mezzanine loans and/or companion loans or originate future permitted mezzanine
indebtedness with respect to the mortgage loans. These transactions may cause the originators and their affiliates or their clients
or counterparties who purchase the mezzanine loans and/or companion loans, as applicable, to have economic interests and incentives
that do not align with, and that may be directly contrary to, those of an investor in the offered certificates. In addition, these
transactions or actions taken to maintain, adjust or unwind any positions in the future, may, individually or in the aggregate,
have a material effect on the market for the offered certificates (if any), including adversely affecting the value of the offered
certificates, particularly in illiquid markets. The originators, the sponsors and their affiliates will have no obligation to take,
refrain from taking or cease taking any action with respect to such companion loans or any existing or future mezzanine loans,
based on the potential effect on an investor in the offered certificates, and may receive substantial returns from these transactions.
In addition, the originators, the sponsors or any of their respective affiliates may benefit from certain relationships, including
financial dealings, with any borrower, any non-recourse carveout guarantor or any of their respective affiliates, aside from the
origination of mortgage loans or contribution of mortgage loans into this securitization. Conflicts may also arise because the
sponsors and their respective affiliates intend to continue to actively acquire, develop, operate, finance and dispose of real
estate-related assets in the ordinary course of their businesses. During the course of their business activities, the sponsors
and their respective affiliates may acquire, sell or lease properties, or finance loans secured by properties, which may include
the properties securing the mortgage loans or properties that are in the same markets as the mortgaged properties. Such other properties,
similar to other third-party owned real estate, may compete with the mortgaged properties for existing and potential tenants. The
sponsors may also, from time to time, be among the
Â 

108
Â 
Â 
tenants at the mortgaged properties, and they should be expected to make occupancy-related
decisions based on their self-interest and not that of the issuing entity. We cannot assure you that the activities of these parties
with respect to such other properties will not adversely impact the performance of the mortgaged properties.
Â 
In addition, certain of the mortgage loans
included in the issuing entity may have been refinancings of debt previously held by a sponsor, an originator or one of their respective
affiliates, or a sponsor, an originator or one of their respective affiliates may have or have had equity investments in the borrowers
or mortgaged properties under certain of the mortgage loans included in the issuing entity. Each of the sponsors, the originators
and their respective affiliates have made and/or may make loans to, or equity investments in, affiliates of the borrowers under
the related mortgage loans. In the circumstances described above, the interests of the sponsors, the originators and their respective
affiliates may differ from, and compete with, the interests of the issuing entity.
Â 
Further, various originators, sponsors and
their respective affiliates are acting in multiple capacities in or with respect to this transaction, which may include, without
limitation, acting as one or more transaction parties or a subcontractor or vendor of such party, participating in or contracting
for interim servicing and/or custodial services with certain transaction parties, providing warehouse financing to, or receiving
warehouse financing from, certain other originators or sponsors prior to transfer of the related mortgage loans to the issuing
entity, and/or conducting due diligence on behalf of an investor with respect to the mortgage loans prior to their transfer to
the issuing entity.
Â 
Ladder Capital FinanceÂ LLC is affiliated
with the borrowers under the mortgage loans secured by the mortgaged properties identified on AnnexÂ A-1 to this prospectus
as Reasorâs Foods â Bixby, Harpâs Foods â Grove, Dollar General â Farmington, Dollar General â Rice,
Dollar General â Bloomington, Dollar General - Cape Girardeau and Dollar General - Troy, collectively representing approximately
1.5% of the initial pool balance as of the cut-off date. Ladder Capital FinanceÂ LLC or an affiliate thereof originated each
of those mortgage loans, and Ladder Capital FinanceÂ LLC is the mortgage loan seller with respect to those mortgage loans.
Those mortgage loans may contain provisions and terms that are more favorable to the respective borrowers thereunder than would
otherwise have been the case if the lender and borrower were not affiliated, including: (i)Â the related loan documents permit
transfers of interests in the related borrower without the lenderâs consent by the related borrower and by or to certain
affiliates of Ladder Capital Finance HoldingsÂ LLLP; (ii)Â the related loan documents permit future mezzanine financing;
and (iii)Â there is no separate environmental indemnitor other than the related borrower.
Â 
For a description of certain of the foregoing
relationships and arrangements that exist among the parties to this securitization, see âCertain Affiliations, Relationships
And Related Transactions Involving Transaction Partiesâ and âTransaction Partiesâ.
Â 
These roles and other potential relationships
may give rise to conflicts of interest as described in ââInterests and Incentives of the Underwriter Entities May
Not Be Aligned With Your Interestsâ, ââPotential Conflicts of Interest in the Selection of the Underlying
Mortgage Loansâ and ââOther Potential Conflicts of Interest May Affect Your Investmentâ below.
Each of the foregoing relationships and related interests should be considered carefully by you before you invest in any offered
certificates.
Â 


109
Â 
Â 
Interests and Incentives
of the Underwriter Entities May Not Be Aligned With Your Interests
Â 
The activities and interests of the underwriters
and their respective affiliates (collectively, the âUnderwriter Entitiesâ) will not align with, and may in fact be
directly contrary to, those of the certificateholders. The Underwriter Entities are each part of separate global investment banking,
securities and investment management firms that provide a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client
base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and high-net-worth individuals. As such, they actively make
markets in and trade financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of customers. These financial instruments
include debt and equity securities, currencies, commodities, bank loans, indices, baskets and other products. The Underwriter Entitiesâ
activities include, among other things, executing large block trades and taking long and short positions directly and indirectly,
through derivative instruments or otherwise. The securities and instruments in which the Underwriter Entities take positions, or
expect to take positions, include loans similar to the mortgage loans, securities and instruments similar to the offered certificates
and other securities and instruments. Market making is an activity where the Underwriter Entities buy and sell on behalf of customers,
or for their own account, to satisfy the expected demand of customers. By its nature, market making involves facilitating transactions
among market participants that have differing views of securities and instruments. Any short positions taken by the Underwriter
Entities and/or their clients through marketing or otherwise will increase in value if the related securities or other instruments
decrease in value, while positions taken by the Underwriter Entities and/or their clients in credit derivative or other derivative
transactions with other parties, pursuant to which the Underwriter Entities and/or their clients sell or buy credit protection
with respect to one or more classes of the offered certificates, may increase in value if the offered certificates default, are
expected to default, or decrease in value.
Â 
The Underwriter Entities and their clients
acting through them may execute such transactions, modify or terminate such derivative positions and otherwise act with respect
to such transactions, and may exercise or enforce, or refrain from exercising or enforcing, any or all of their rights and powers
in connection therewith, without regard to whether any such action might have an adverse effect on the offered certificates or
the certificateholders. Additionally, none of the Underwriter Entities will have any obligation to disclose any of these securities
or derivatives transactions to you in your capacity as a certificateholder. As a result, you should expect that the Underwriter
Entities will take positions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of investors in the offered certificates.
Â 
As a result of the Underwriter Entitiesâ
various financial market activities, including acting as a research provider, investment advisor, market maker or principal investor,
you should expect that personnel in various businesses throughout the Underwriter Entities will have and express research or investment
views and make recommendations that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the objectives of investors in the offered certificates.
Â 
If an Underwriter Entity becomes a holder
of any of the certificates, through market-making activity or otherwise, any actions that it takes in its capacity as a certificateholder,
including voting, providing consents or otherwise will not necessarily be aligned with the interests of other holders of the same
class or other classes of the certificates. To the extent an Underwriter Entity makes a market in the certificates (which it is
under no obligation to do), it would expect to receive income from the spreads between its bid and offer prices for the certificates.
The price at which an Underwriter Entity may be willing to purchase certificates, if it makes a market, will depend on market conditions
and
Â 

110
Â 
Â 
other relevant factors and may be significantly lower than the issue price for the certificates and significantly lower than
the price at which it may be willing to sell certificates.
Â 
In addition, none of the Underwriter Entities
will have any obligation to monitor the performance of the certificates or the actions of the parties to the pooling and servicing
agreement and will have no authority to advise any party to the pooling and servicing agreement or to direct their actions.
Â 
Furthermore, each Underwriter Entity expects
that a completed offering will enhance its ability to assist clients and counterparties in the transaction or in related transactions
(including assisting clients in additional purchases and sales of the certificates and hedging transactions). The Underwriter Entities
expect to derive fees and other revenues from these transactions. In addition, participating in a successful offering and providing
related services to clients may enhance the Underwriter Entitiesâ relationships with various parties, facilitate additional
business development, and enable them to obtain additional business and generate additional revenue.
Â 
One of the Underwriter Entities, Wells Fargo
Securities, LLC, together with its affiliates, is playing several roles in this transaction. Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, is an
affiliate of the depositor and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, a sponsor, an originator, a mortgage loan seller, the master
servicer, the certificate administrator, the certificate registrar and the custodian under this securitization. Furthermore, Wells
Fargo Bank, National Association and Deutsche Bank AG, Cayman Islands Branch (an affiliate of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.) are
the purchasers under separate repurchase agreements with separate affiliates of Ladder Capital Finance LLC, for the purpose of
providing short-term warehousing of mortgage loans originated or acquired by Ladder Capital Finance LLC and its affiliates. In
the case of those repurchase facilities, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and Deutsche Bank AG, Cayman Islands Branch have
agreed to purchase mortgage loans from the applicable affiliates of Ladder Capital Finance LLC on a revolving basis. Ladder Capital
Finance Holdings LLLP, Series TRS of Ladder Capital Finance Holdings LLLP and Series REIT of Ladder Capital Finance Holdings LLLP
guarantee certain obligations of such affiliates under those repurchase facilities. As of DecemberÂ 1, 2015, one mortgage loan,
with a principal balance as of the cut-off date of approximately $88,000,000, that Ladder Capital Finance LLC intends to sell to
the depositor in connection with this securitization transaction, was subject to the repurchase facility with Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association, and one mortgage loan, with a principal balance as of the cut-off date of approximately $32,922,772, that
Ladder Capital FinanceÂ LLC intends to sell to the depositor in connection with this securitization transaction, was subject
to the repurchase facility with Deutsche BankÂ AG, Cayman Islands Branch; however, such amounts may change prior to the initial
issuance of the certificates. Proceeds received by Ladder Capital Finance LLC in connection with this securitization transaction
will be used, in part, to repurchase, directly or through its affiliates, from Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and Deutsche
Bank AG, Cayman Islands Branch each of the mortgage loans subject to those repurchase facilities that are to be sold by Ladder
Capital Finance LLC to the depositor in connection with this securitization transaction, which mortgage loans will be transferred
to the depositor free and clear of any liens. As a result, this securitization transaction will reduce the economic exposure of
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. to the mortgage loans that are to be transferred by Ladder
Capital Finance LLC to the depositor.
Â 
In addition, SG Americas Securities, LLC,
one of the initial purchasers and underwriters, is an affiliate of SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale, a sponsor, mortgage
loan seller, originator and the current holder of the Empire Mall companion loans. In addition, Citigroup Global Markets Inc.,
one of the initial purchasers and underwriters, is an affiliate of Citigroup Global Markets Realty Corp., a sponsor, mortgage loan
seller, originator and the current holder of
Â 

111
Â 
Â 
the Harbor Pointe Apartments, Anchorage Marriott Downtown and JW Marriott Santa Monica
Le Merigot companion loans. See âTransaction PartiesâThe Sponsors and Mortgage Loan Sellersâ.
Â 
The Servicing of the Empire
Mall Whole Loan Will Shift to Other Servicers
Â 
The servicing of the Empire Mall whole loan
is expected to be governed by the pooling and servicing agreement for this securitization only temporarily, until such time as
the related controlling pari passu companion loan (designated as Note A-1) is securitized in a separate securitization.
At that time, the servicing and administration of the related whole loan will shift to the master servicer and special servicer
under that other securitization and will be governed exclusively by the pooling and servicing agreement entered into in connection
with that securitization and the related intercreditor agreement. Neither the closing date of such securitization nor the identity
of such other master servicer or special servicer has been determined. In addition, the provisions of the other pooling and servicing
agreement have not yet been determined, although they will be required to satisfy certain requirements set forth in the related
intercreditor agreement described under âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâThe Whole LoansâThe Serviced Pari
Passu Whole LoansâThe Empire Mall Whole Loanâ. Prospective investors should be aware that they will not have any
control over the identity of either of the master servicer or the special servicer under the other pooling and servicing agreement,
nor will they have any assurance as to the particular terms of the other pooling and servicing agreement except to the extent of
compliance with the requirements referred to in the previous sentence. Moreover, the directing certificateholder for this securitization
will not have any consent or consultation rights with respect to the servicing of the Empire Mall whole loan other than those limited
consent and consultation rights as are provided in the related intercreditor agreement, and the holder of the related controlling
pari passu companion loan (i.e., the controlling party in the related securitization of such pari passu companion
loan or such other party specified in the related intercreditor agreement) will likely have rights similar to, or more expansive
than, those granted to the directing certificateholder in this transaction with respect to the other loans in this mortgage pool
that are serviced under the pooling and servicing agreement for this securitization transaction. See âDescription of the
Mortgage PoolâThe Whole LoansâThe Serviced Pari Passu Whole LoansâThe Empire Mall Whole Loanâ.
Â 
Potential Conflicts of Interest
of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer
Â 
The pooling and servicing agreement provides
that the mortgage loans serviced thereunder are required to be administered in accordance with the servicing standard without regard
to ownership of any certificate by the master servicer, the special servicer or any of their respective affiliates. See âPooling
and Servicing AgreementâServicing Standardâ. The pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of a non-serviced
whole loan provides that such non-serviced whole loan is required to be administered in accordance with a servicing standard that
is generally similar to the servicing standard set forth in the pooling and servicing agreement. See âPooling and Servicing
AgreementâServicing of the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loansâ.
Â 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the master
servicer, a sub-servicer, the special servicer or any of their respective affiliates and, as it relates to servicing and administration
of a non-serviced mortgage loan, each applicable master servicer, sub-servicer, special servicer or any of their respective affiliates
under the pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of a non-serviced whole loan, may have interests when dealing
with the mortgage loans that are in conflict with those of holders of the certificates, especially if the master servicer, a sub-servicer,
the special servicer or any of their respective affiliates holds
Â 

112
Â 
Â 
certificates or securities relating to any of the applicable companion
loans, or has financial interests in or financial dealings with a borrower or a borrower sponsor.
Â 
In order to minimize the effect of certain
of these conflicts of interest as they relate to the special servicer, for so long as the special servicer is a borrower party
with respect to an excluded special servicer loan, the special servicer will be required to resign as special servicer with respect
to that mortgage loan and, prior to the occurrence of a control termination event under the pooling and servicing agreement, the
directing certificateholder or the controlling class certificateholder on its behalf will be required to select a separate special
servicer that is not a borrower party (referred to herein as an âexcluded special servicerâ) with respect to any excluded
special servicer loan, unless such excluded special servicer loan is also an excluded loan. After the occurrence and during the
continuance of a control termination event or at any time the applicable excluded special servicer loan is also an excluded loan,
the resigning special servicer will be required to select the related excluded special servicer. See âPooling and Servicing
AgreementâReplacement of Special Servicer Without Causeâ. Any excluded special servicer will be required to perform
all of the obligations of the special servicer with respect to such excluded special servicer loan and will be entitled to all
special servicing compensation with respect to such excluded special servicer loan earned during such time as the related mortgage
loan is an excluded special servicer loan. While the special servicer will have the same access to information related to the excluded
special servicer loan as it does with respect to the other mortgage loans, the special servicer will covenant in the pooling and
servicing agreement that it will not directly or indirectly provide any information related to any excluded special servicer loan
to the related borrower party, any of the special servicerâs employees or personnel or any of its affiliates involved in
the management of any investment in the related borrower party or the related mortgaged property or, to its actual knowledge, any
non-affiliate that holds a direct or indirect ownership interest in the related borrower party, and will maintain sufficient internal
controls and appropriate policies and procedures in place in order to comply with those obligations. Notwithstanding those restrictions,
there can be no assurance that the related borrower party will not obtain sensitive information related to the strategy of any
contemplated workout or liquidation related to an excluded special servicer loan.
Â 
Each of these relationships may create a
conflict of interest. For instance, if the special servicer or its affiliate holds a subordinate class of certificates, the special
servicer might seek to reduce the potential for losses allocable to those certificates from the mortgage loans by deferring acceleration
in hope of maximizing future proceeds. However, that action could result in less proceeds to the issuing entity than would be realized
if earlier action had been taken. In addition, no servicer is required to act in a manner more favorable to the offered certificates
or any particular class of certificates than to the WFCM 2015-P2 non-offered certificates, any serviced companion loan holder or
the holder of any serviced companion loan securities.
Â 
Each of the master servicer and the special
servicer services and is expected to continue to service, in the ordinary course of its business, existing and new mortgage loans
for third parties, including portfolios of mortgage loans similar to the mortgage loans. The real properties securing these other
mortgage loans may be in the same markets as, and compete with, certain of the mortgaged properties securing the mortgage loans.
Consequently, personnel of the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, may perform services, on behalf of the issuing
entity, with respect to the mortgage loans at the same time as they are performing services, on behalf of other persons, with respect
to other mortgage loans secured by properties that compete with the mortgaged properties securing the mortgage loans. In addition,
the mortgage loan sellers will determine who will service mortgage loans that the mortgage loan sellers originate in the future,
and that
Â 

113
Â 
Â 
determination may be influenced by the mortgage loan sellerâs opinion of servicing decisions made by the master
servicer or special servicer under the pooling and servicing agreement including, among their things, the manner in which the master
servicer or special servicer enforces breaches of representations and warranties against the related mortgage loan seller. This
may pose inherent conflicts for the master servicer or the special servicer.
Â 
The special servicer may enter into one
or more arrangements with the directing certificateholder, a controlling class certificateholder, a serviced companion loan holder
or other certificateholders (or an affiliate or a third party representative of one or more of the preceding parties) to provide
for a discount and/or revenue sharing with respect to certain of the special servicer compensation in consideration of, among other
things, the special servicerâs appointment (or continuance) as special servicer under the pooling and servicing agreement
and/or the related intercreditor agreement and limitations on the right of such person to replace the special servicer. See ââOther
Potential Conflicts of Interest May Affect Your Investmentâ below.
Â 
Although the master servicer and the special
servicer will be required to service and administer the mortgage loan pool in accordance with the servicing standard and, accordingly,
without regard to their rights to receive compensation under the pooling and servicing agreement and without regard to any potential
obligation to repurchase or substitute a mortgage loan if the master servicer or special servicer is a mortgage loan seller, the
possibility of receiving additional servicing compensation in the nature of assumption and modification fees, the continuation
of receiving fees to service or specially service a mortgage loan, or the desire to avoid a repurchase demand resulting from a
breach of a representation and warranty or material document default may under certain circumstances provide the master servicer
or the special servicer, as the case may be, with an economic disincentive to comply with this standard.
Â 
Wells Fargo Bank, a sponsor, originator
and mortgage loan seller, is also the master servicer, the certificate administrator, the tax administrator, the custodian and
the certificate registrar under this securitization and an affiliate of Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Securities,Â Inc.,
the depositor, and of Wells Fargo Securities,Â LLC, one of the underwriters.
Â 
Each of the foregoing relationships should
be considered carefully by you before you invest in any certificates.
Â 
Potential Conflicts of Interest
of the Operating Advisor
Â 
Pentalpha Surveillance LLC has been appointed
as the initial operating advisor with respect to all of the mortgage loans other than a non-serviced mortgage loan. See âTransaction
PartiesâThe Operating Advisor and Asset Representations Reviewerâ. In the normal course of conducting its business,
the initial operating advisor and its affiliates may have rendered services to, performed surveillance of, and negotiated with,
numerous parties engaged in activities related to structured finance and commercial mortgage securitization. These parties may
have included institutional investors, the depositor, the sponsors, the mortgage loan sellers, the originators, the certificate
administrator, the trustee, the master servicer, the special servicer or the directing certificateholder, collateral property owners
or affiliates of any of those parties. Each of these relationships, to the extent they exist, may continue in the future and may
involve a conflict of interest with respect to the initial operating advisorâs duties as operating advisor. We cannot assure
you that the existence of these relationships and other relationships in the future will not impact the manner in which the initial
operating advisor performs its duties under the pooling and servicing agreement.
Â 


114
Â 
Â 
The operating advisor or its affiliates
may have duties with respect to existing and new commercial and multifamily mortgage loans for itself, its affiliates or third
parties, including portfolios of mortgage loans similar to the mortgage loans included in the issuing entity. These other mortgage
loans and the related mortgaged properties may be in the same markets as, or have owners, obligors or property managers in common
with, one or more of the mortgage loans in the issuing entity and the related mortgaged properties. As a result of the investments
and activities described above, the interests of the operating advisor and its affiliates and their clients may differ from, and
conflict with, the interests of the issuing entity. Consequently, personnel of any successor operating advisor may perform services,
on behalf of the issuing entity, with respect to the mortgage loans at the same time as they are performing services, on behalf
of other persons, with respect to other mortgage loans secured by properties that compete with the mortgaged properties securing
the mortgage loans. Although the operating advisor is required to consider the servicing standard in connection with its activities
under the pooling and servicing agreement, the operating advisor will not itself be bound by the servicing standard.
Â 
In addition, the operating advisor and its
affiliates may have interests that are in conflict with those of certificateholders if the operating advisor or any of its affiliates
has financial interests in or financial dealings with a borrower, a parent of a borrower or any of their affiliates. Each of these
relationships may also create a conflict of interest.
Â 
Potential Conflicts of Interest
of the Asset Representations Reviewer
Â 
Pentalpha Surveillance LLC has been appointed
as the initial asset representations reviewer with respect to all of the mortgage loans. See âTransaction PartiesâThe
Operating Advisor and the Asset Representations Reviewerâ. In the normal course of conducting its business, the initial
asset representations reviewer and its affiliates have rendered services to, performed surveillance of, and negotiated with, numerous
parties engaged in activities related to structured finance and commercial mortgage securitization. These parties may have included
the depositor, the sponsors, the mortgage loan sellers, the originators, the certificate administrator, the trustee, the master
servicer, the special servicer or the directing certificateholder or affiliates of any of those parties. These relationships may
continue in the future. Each of these relationships, to the extent they exist, may involve a conflict of interest with respect
to the initial asset representations reviewerâs duties as asset representations reviewer. We cannot assure you that the existence
of these relationships and other relationships in the future will not impact the manner in which the initial asset representations
reviewer performs its duties under the pooling and servicing agreement.
Â 
In addition, the asset representations reviewer
and its affiliates may have interests that are in conflict with those of certificateholders if the asset representations reviewer
or any of its affiliates has financial interests in or financial dealings with a borrower, a parent of a borrower or any of their
affiliates. Each of these relationships may also create a conflict of interest.
Â 
Potential Conflicts of Interest
of the Directing Certificateholder and the Companion Holders
Â 
It is expected that Raith Capital Partners,
LLC or an affiliate will be appointed as the initial directing certificateholder. The special servicer may, at the direction of
the directing certificateholder (for so long as a control termination event does not exist and, at all times, other than with respect
to any excluded loan) (or, in the case of the Empire Mall Mortgage Loan, at the direction of the holder of the Empire Mall controlling
pari passu companion loan), take actions with respect to the specially serviced loans administered under the pooling and
servicing agreement that could adversely affect the holders of some or all of the
Â 

115
Â 
Â 
classes of certificates. The directing certificateholder
will be controlled by the controlling class certificateholders.
Â 
The controlling class certificateholders
and the holders of the companion loans or securities backed by such companion loans may have interests in conflict with those of
the other certificateholders. As a result, it is possible that the directing certificateholder on behalf of the controlling class
certificateholders (for so long as a control termination event does not exist and, at all times, other than with respect to any
excluded loan) or the directing certificateholder (or equivalent entity) under the pooling and servicing agreement governing the
servicing of a non-serviced whole loan may direct the special servicer or the special servicer under such pooling and servicing
agreement relating to the other securitization transaction, as the case may be, to take actions that conflict with the interests
of holders of certain classes of the certificates. Set forth below is the identity of the initial directing certificateholder (or
equivalent entity) for each pari passu whole loan, the expected securitization trust holding the controlling note in such
whole loan and the pooling and servicing agreement under which it is expected to be serviced.

(1)Prior to the securitization
  of the Empire Mall controlling pari passu companion loan. After the securitization
  of the Empire Mall controlling pari passu companion loan, the Empire Mall whole
  loan will be serviced under the related pooling and servicing agreement for that securitization
  transaction.
Â 

(2)SociÃ©tÃ©
  GÃ©nÃ©rale will be the initial controlling noteholder with respect to the
  Empire Mall whole loan. After the securitization of the Empire Mall controlling pari
  passu companion loan, the securitization trust holding the Empire Mall controlling
  pari passu companion loan will be the controlling noteholder and the directing
  certificateholder for the Empire Mall whole loan is expected to be the holder of certain
  subordinate certificates issued by such securitization trust.
Â 
The special servicer, upon consultation
with a serviced companion loan holder or its representative, may take actions with respect to the related serviced whole loan that
could adversely affect the holders of some or all of the classes of certificates, to the extent described under âDescription
of the Mortgage PoolâThe Whole Loansâ. In connection with the pari passu whole loans serviced under the
pooling and servicing agreement for this securitization, the serviced companion loan holders do not have any duties to the holders
of any class of certificates, and they may have interests in conflict with those of the certificateholders. As a result, it is
possible that a serviced companion loan holder (solely
Â 

116
Â 
Â 
with respect to the related serviced whole loan) may advise the special
servicer to take actions that conflict with the interests of holders of certain classes of the certificates. However, the special
servicer is not permitted to take actions that are prohibited by law or violate the servicing standard or the terms of the mortgage
loan documents. In addition, except as limited by certain conditions described under âPooling and Servicing AgreementâTermination
of Master Servicer and Special Servicer for CauseâServicer Termination Eventsâ, the special servicer may be replaced
by the directing certificateholder (or, in the case of the Empire Mall Mortgage Loan, prior to the securitization of the Empire
Mall controlling pari passu companion loan, by the holder of such companion loan) for cause at any time and without
cause for so long as a control termination event does not exist (and other than in respect of any excluded loan). See âPooling
and Servicing AgreementâThe Directing Certificateholderâ and ââTermination of Master Servicer and
Special Servicer for CauseâServicer Termination Eventsâ.
Â 
Similarly, the applicable controlling class
related to the securitization trust indicated in the chart above as the controlling noteholder (or, after the securitization thereof,
the securitization trust for the Empire Mall controlling pari passu companion loan) has certain consent and/or consultation
rights with respect to a non-serviced mortgage loan under the pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of that non-serviced
whole loan and have similar conflicts of interest with the holders of other certificates backed by the companion loans. See âPooling
and Servicing AgreementâServicing of the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loansâ.
Â 
The directing certificateholder and its
affiliates (and the directing certificateholder (or equivalent entity) under the pooling and servicing agreement governing the
servicing of a non-serviced whole loan and their respective affiliates) may have interests that are in conflict with those of certain
certificateholders, especially if the applicable directing certificateholder or any of its affiliates holds certificates or companion
loan securities, or has financial interests in or other financial dealings (as lender or otherwise) with a borrower or an affiliate
of a borrower. In order to minimize the effect of certain of these conflicts of interest, for so long as any borrower party is
the directing certificateholder or the holder of the majority of the controlling class (any such loan referred to herein as an
âexcluded loanâ), the directing certificateholder will not have consent or consultation rights solely with respect
to the related excluded loan (however, the directing certificateholder will be provided certain notices and certain information
relating to such excluded loan as described in the pooling and servicing agreement). In addition, for so long as any borrower party
isÂ the directing certificateholder or a controlling class certificateholder, as applicable, the directing certificateholder
or such controlling class certificateholder, as applicable, will not be given access to certain âexcluded informationâ
solely relating to the related excluded loan and/or the related mortgaged properties pursuant to the terms of the pooling and servicing
agreement. Notwithstanding those restrictions, there can be no assurance that the directing certificateholder or any controlling
class certificateholder will not obtain sensitive information related to the strategy of any contemplated workout or liquidation
related to an excluded loan or otherwise seek to exert its influence over the special servicer in the event an excluded loan becomes
subject to a workout or liquidation. See âDescription of the CertificatesâReports to Certificateholders; Certain
Available Informationâ in this prospectus. Each of these relationships may create a conflict of interest.
Â 
The special servicer, in connection with
obtaining the consent of, or upon consultation with, the directing certificateholder or a serviced companion loan holder or its
representative, may take actions with respect to the related serviced whole loan that could adversely affect the holders of some
or all of the classes of certificates, to the extent described under âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâThe Whole
Loansâ. In connection with
Â 

117
Â 
Â 
the serviced whole loan, the serviced companion loan holder does not have any duties to the
holders of any class of certificates, and it may have interests in conflict with those of the certificateholders. As a result,
it is possible that the serviced companion loan holder may advise the special servicer to take actions with respect to the related
serviced whole loan that conflict with the interests of holders of certain classes of the certificates.
Â 
Potential Conflicts of Interest
in the Selection of the Underlying Mortgage Loans
Â 
The anticipated initial investor in the
ClassÂ E, ClassÂ F and ClassÂ G certificates, which is referred to in this prospectus as the âb-piece buyerâ
(see âPooling and Servicing AgreementâThe Directing CertificateholderâGeneralâ), was given the opportunity
by the sponsors to perform due diligence on the mortgage loans originally identified by the sponsors for inclusion in the issuing
entity, and to request the removal, re-sizing or change in the expected repayment dates or other features of some or all of the
mortgage loans. The mortgage pool as originally proposed by the sponsors was adjusted based on certain of these requests. In addition,
the b-piece buyer received or may have received price adjustments or cost mitigation arrangements in connection with accepting
certain mortgage loans in the mortgage pool.
Â 
We cannot assure you that you or another
investor would have made the same requests to modify the original pool as the b-piece buyer or that the final pool as influenced
by the b-piece buyerâs feedback will not adversely affect the performance of your certificates and benefit the performance
of the b-piece buyerâs certificates. Because of the differing subordination levels, the b-piece buyer has interests that
may, in some circumstances, differ from those of purchasers of other classes of certificates, and may desire a portfolio composition
that benefits the b-piece buyer but that does not benefit other investors. In addition, the b-piece buyer may enter into hedging
or other transactions or otherwise have business objectives that also could cause its interests with respect to the mortgage pool
to diverge from those of other purchasers of the certificates. The b-piece buyer performed due diligence solely for its own benefit
and has no liability to any person or entity for conducting its due diligence. The b-piece buyer is not required to take into account
the interests of any other investor in the certificates in exercising remedies or voting or other rights in its capacity as owner
of its certificates or in making requests or recommendations to the sponsors as to the selection of the mortgage loans and the
establishment of other transaction terms. Investors are not entitled to rely on in any way the b-piece buyerâs acceptance
of a mortgage loan. The b-piece buyerâs acceptance of a mortgage loan does not constitute, and may not be construed as, an
endorsement of such mortgage loan, the underwriting for such mortgage loan or the originator of such mortgage loan.
Â 
The b-piece buyer will have no liability
to any certificateholder for any actions taken by it as described in the preceding two paragraphs and the pooling and servicing
agreement will provide that each certificateholder, by its acceptance of a certificate, waives any claims against such buyers in
respect of such actions.
Â 
The b-piece buyer, or an affiliate, will
constitute the initial directing certificateholder. The directing certificateholder will have certain rights to direct and consult
with the special servicer. In addition, the directing certificateholder will generally have certain consultation rights with regard
to a non-serviced mortgage loan under the pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of such non-serviced whole loan
and the related intercreditor agreement. See âPooling and Servicing AgreementâThe Directing Certificateholderâ
and âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâThe Whole LoansâThe Non-Serviced Whole LoansâConsultation and
Controlâ.
Â 


118
Â 
Â 
Because the incentives and actions of the
b-piece buyers may, in some circumstances, differ from or be adverse to those of purchasers of the offered certificates, you are
advised and encouraged to make your own investment decision based on a careful review of the information set forth in this prospectus
and your own view of the mortgage pool.
Â 
Conflicts of Interest May
Occur as a Result of the Rights of the Applicable Directing Certificateholder To Terminate the Special Servicer of the Applicable
Whole Loan
Â 
With respect to each whole loan, the directing
certificateholder exercising control rights over that whole loan will be entitled, under certain circumstances, to remove the special
servicer under the applicable pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of such whole loan and, in such circumstances,
appoint a successor special servicer for such whole loan (or have certain consent rights with respect to such removal or replacement).
The party with this appointment power may have special relationships or interests that conflict with those of the holders of one
or more classes of certificates. In addition, that party does not have any duties to the holders of any class of certificates,
may act solely in its own interests, and will have no liability to any certificateholders for having done so. No certificateholder
may take any action against the directing certificateholder under the pooling and servicing agreement for this securitization or
under the pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of a non-serviced whole loan, or against any other parties for
having acted solely in their respective interests. See âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâThe Whole Loansâ
for a description of these rights to terminate the special servicer.
Â 
Other Potential Conflicts
of Interest May Affect Your Investment
Â 
The managers of the mortgaged properties
and the borrowers may experience conflicts in the management and/or ownership of the mortgaged properties because:
Â 

Â·a substantial number of the mortgaged properties are managed by property managers affiliated with the respective borrowers;
Â 

Â·these property managers also may manage and/or franchise additional properties, including properties that may compete with
the mortgaged properties; and
Â 

Â·affiliates of the managers and/or the borrowers, or the managers and/or the borrowers themselves, also may own other properties,
including competing properties.
Â 
None of the borrowers, property managers
or any of their affiliates or any employees of the foregoing has any duty to favor the leasing of space in the mortgaged properties
over the leasing of space in other properties, one or more of which may be adjacent to or near the mortgaged properties.
Â 
Each of the foregoing relationships should
be considered carefully by you before you invest in any certificates.
Â 
Other Risks Relating
to the Certificates
Â 
The Certificates Are Limited
Obligations
Â 
The certificates, when issued, will only
represent ownership interests in the issuing entity. The certificates will not represent an interest in or obligation of, and will
not be guaranteed by, the sponsors, the depositor, or any other person. The primary assets of the
Â 

119
Â 
Â 
issuing entity will be the mortgage
loans, and distributions on any class of certificates will depend solely on the amount and timing of payments and other collections
in respect of the mortgage loans. We cannot assure you that the cash flow from the mortgaged properties and the proceeds of any
sale or refinancing of the mortgaged properties will be sufficient to pay the principal of, and interest on, the mortgage loans
or to distribute in full the amounts of interest and principal to which the certificateholders will be entitled. See âDescription
of the CertificatesâGeneralâ.
Â 
The Certificates May Have
Limited Liquidity and the Market Value of the Certificates May Decline
Â 
Your certificates will not be listed on
any national securities exchange or traded on any automated quotation systems of any registered securities association, and there
is currently no secondary market for your certificates. The underwriters have no obligation to make a market in the offered certificates.
We cannot assure you that an active secondary market for the certificates will develop. Additionally, one or more investors may
purchase substantial portions of one or more classes of certificates. Accordingly, you may not have an active or liquid secondary
market for your certificates.
Â 
The market value of the certificates will
also be influenced by the supply of and demand for CMBS generally. A number of factors will affect investorsâ demand for
CMBS, including:
Â 

Â·the availability of alternative investments that offer higher yields or are perceived as being a better credit risk than CMBS,
or as having a less volatile market value or being more liquid than CMBS;
Â 

Â·legal and other restrictions that prohibit a particular entity from investing in CMBS or limit the amount or types of CMBS
that it may acquire or require it to maintain increased capital or reserves as a result of its investment in CMBS;
Â 

Â·increased regulatory compliance burdens imposed on CMBS or securitizations generally, or on classes of securitizers, that may
make securitization a less attractive financing option for commercial mortgage loans; and
Â 

Â·investorsâ perceptions of commercial real estate lending or CMBS, which may be adversely affected by, among other things,
a decline in real estate values or an increase in defaults and foreclosures on commercial mortgage loans.
Â 
We cannot assure you that your certificates
will not decline in value.
Â 
Legal and Regulatory Provisions
Affecting Investors Could Adversely Affect the Liquidity of the Offered Certificates
Â 
We make no representation as to the proper
characterization of the offered certificates for legal investment, financial institution regulatory, financial reporting or other
purposes, as to the ability of particular investors to purchase the offered certificates under applicable legal investment or other
restrictions or as to the consequences of an investment in the offered certificates for such purposes or under such restrictions.
We note that regulatory or legislative provisions applicable to certain investors may have the effect of limiting or restricting
their ability to hold or acquire CMBS, which in turn may adversely affect the ability of investors in the offered certificates
who are not subject to those provisions to resell their certificates in the secondary market. For example:
Â 


120
Â 
Â 

Â·Effective January 1, 2014, EU Regulation 575/2013 (the âCRRâ) imposes on European Economic Area (âEEAâ)
credit institutions and investment firms investing in securitizations issued on or after January 1, 2011, or in securitizations
issued prior to that date where new assets are added or substituted after DecemberÂ 31, 2014: (a)Â a requirement (the âRetention
Requirementâ) that the originator, sponsor or original lender of such securitization has explicitly disclosed that it
will retain, on an ongoing basis, a material net economic interest which, in any event, may not be less than 5%; and (b)Â a
requirement (the âDue Diligence Requirementâ) that the investing credit institution or investment firm has undertaken
certain due diligence in respect of the securitization and the underlying exposures and has established procedures for monitoring
them on an ongoing basis.
Â 
National regulators in EEA member states impose penal
risk weights on securitization investments in respect of which the Retention Requirement or the Due Diligence Requirement has not
been satisfied in any material respect by reason of the negligence or omission of the investing credit institution or investment
firm.
Â 
If the Retention Requirement or the Due Diligence Requirement
is not satisfied in respect of a securitization investment held by a non-EEA subsidiary of an EEA credit institution or investment
firm then an additional risk weight may be applied to such securitization investment when taken into account on a consolidated
basis at the level of the EEA credit institution or investment firm.
Â 
Requirements similar to the Retention Requirement and
the Due Diligence Requirement (the âSimilar Requirementsâ): (i)Â apply to investments in securitizations
by investment funds managed by EEA investment managers subject to EU Directive 2011/61/EU; and (ii)Â subject to the adoption
of certain secondary legislation, will apply to investments in securitizations by EEA insurance and reinsurance undertakings and
by EEA undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities. On SeptemberÂ 30, 2015, the European Commission published
a proposal for a new regulation which, if adopted, would recast the Retention Requirement, the Due Diligence Requirement and Similar
Requirements and which would, additionally, apply such requirements to investments in securitizations by EU occupational pension
schemes.
Â 
None of the sponsors, the depositor or the issuing entity
intends to retain a material net economic interest in the securitization constituted by the issue of the offered certificates in
accordance with the Retention Requirement or to take any other action which may be required by EEA-regulated investors for the
purposes of their compliance with the Retention Requirement, the Due Diligence Requirement or Similar Requirements. Consequently,
the offered certificates are not a suitable investment for EEA-credit institutions, EEA-investment firms or the other types of
EEA regulated investors mentioned above. As a result, the price and liquidity of the offered certificates in the secondary market
may be adversely affected. EEA-regulated investors are encouraged to consult with their own investment and legal advisors regarding
the suitability of the offered certificates for investment.
Â 

Â·The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the âDodd-Frank Actâ) enacted in the United
States requires that federal banking agencies amend their regulations to remove reference to or reliance on credit agency ratings,
including, but not limited to, those found in the federal banking agenciesâ 
Â 


121
Â 
Â 
Â 

risk-based capital regulations.
New capital regulations were issued by the banking regulators in July 2013 and began phasing in on January 1, 2014; these regulations
implement the increased capital requirements established under the Basel Accord. These new capital regulations eliminate reliance
on credit ratings and otherwise alter, and in most cases increase, the capital requirements imposed on depository institutions
and their holding companies, including with respect to ownership of asset-backed securities such as CMBS. As a result of these
regulations, investments in commercial mortgage-backed securities like the certificates by institutions subject to the risk based
capital regulations may result in greater capital charges to these financial institutions and these new regulations may otherwise
adversely affect the treatment of commercial mortgage-backed securities for their regulatory capital purposes.
Â 

Â·The issuing entity will be relying on an exclusion or exemption under the Investment Company Act contained in SectionÂ 3(c)(5)
of the Investment Company Act or RuleÂ 3a-7 under the Investment Company Act, although there may be additional exclusions or
exemptions available to the issuing entity. The issuing entity is being structured so as not to constitute a âcovered fundâ
for purposes of the regulations adopted to implement SectionÂ 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act (such statutory provision together
with such implementing regulations, the âVolcker Ruleâ). The Volcker Rule generally prohibits âbanking
entitiesâ (which is broadly defined to include U.S. banks and bank holding companies and many non-U.S. banking entities,
together with their respective subsidiaries and other affiliates) from (i)Â engaging in proprietary trading, (ii)Â acquiring
or retaining an ownership interest in or sponsoring a âcovered fundâ and (iii)Â entering into certain relationships
with such funds. The Volcker Rule became effective on July 21, 2012, and final regulations implementing the Volcker Rule were adopted
on December 10, 2013 and became effective on April 1, 2014. Conformance with the Volcker Rule and its implementing regulations
is required by July 21, 2015 (subject to the possibility of up to two one-year extensions). In the interim, banking entities must
make good faith efforts to conform their activities and investments to the Volcker Rule. Under the Volcker Rule, unless otherwise
jointly determined otherwise by specified federal regulators, a âcovered fundâ does not include an issuer that may
rely on an exclusion or exemption from the definition of âinvestment companyâ under the Investment Company Act other
than the exclusions contained in SectionÂ 3(c)(1) and SectionÂ 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. The general effects
of the Volcker Rule remain uncertain. Any prospective investor in the certificates, including a U.S. or foreign bank or a subsidiary
or other affiliate thereof, should consult its own legal advisors regarding such matters and other effects of the Volcker Rule.
Â 

Â·The Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted changes to the accounting standards for structured products. These changes,
or any future changes, may affect the accounting for entities such as the issuing entity, could under certain circumstances require
an investor or its owner generally to consolidate the assets of the issuing entity in its financial statements and record third
partiesâ investments in the issuing entity as liabilities of that investor or owner or could otherwise adversely affect the
manner in which the investor or its owner must report an investment in CMBS for financial reporting purposes.
Â 

Â·For purposes of the Secondary Mortgage Market Enhancement Act of 1984, as amended, no class of offered certificates will constitute
âmortgage related securitiesâ.
Â 


122
Â 
Â 
Accordingly, all investors whose investment
activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements, or review by regulatory authorities
should consult with their own legal, accounting and other advisors in determining whether, and to what extent, the offered certificates
will constitute legal investments for them or are subject to investment or other restrictions, unfavorable accounting treatment,
capital charges or reserve requirements. See âLegal Investmentâ.
Â 
Nationally Recognized Statistical
Rating Organizations May Assign Different Ratings to the Certificates; Ratings of the Certificates Reflect Only the Views of the
Applicable Rating Agencies as of the Dates Such Ratings Were Issued; Ratings May Affect ERISA Eligibility; Ratings May Be Downgraded
Â 
Ratings assigned to the offered certificates
by the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations engaged by the depositor:
Â 

Â·are based on, among other things, the economic characteristics of the mortgaged properties and other relevant structural features
of the transaction;
Â 

Â·do not represent any assessment of the yield to maturity that a certificateholder may experience;
Â 

Â·reflect only the views of the respective rating agencies as of the date such ratings were issued;
Â 

Â·may be reviewed, revised, suspended, downgraded, qualified or withdrawn entirely by the applicable rating agency as a result
of changes in or unavailability of information;
Â 

Â·may have been determined based on criteria that included an analysis of historical mortgage loan data that may not reflect
future experience;
Â 

Â·may reflect assumptions by such rating agencies regarding performance of the mortgage loans that are not accurate, as evidenced
by the significant amount of downgrades, qualifications and withdrawals of ratings assigned to previously issued CMBS by the hired
rating agencies and other nationally recognized statistical rating organizations during the recent credit crisis; and
Â 

Â·do not consider to what extent the offered certificates will be subject to prepayment or that the outstanding principal amount
of any class of offered certificates will be prepaid.
Â 
The nationally recognized statistical rating
organizations that assign ratings to any class of offered certificates will establish the amount of credit support, if any, for
such class of offered certificates based on, among other things, an assumed level of defaults, delinquencies and losses with respect
to the mortgage loans. Actual losses may, however, exceed the assumed levels. If actual losses on the mortgage loans exceed the
assumed levels, you may be required to bear the additional losses.
Â 
In addition, the rating of any class of
offered certificates below an investment grade rating by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization, whether upon
initial issuance of such class of certificates or as a result of a ratings downgrade, could adversely affect the ability of an
employee benefit plan or other investor to purchase or retain those offered certificates. See âCertain ERISA Considerationsâ
and âLegal Investmentâ.
Â 


123
Â 
Â 
Nationally recognized statistical rating
organizations that were not engaged by the depositor to rate the offered certificates may nevertheless issue unsolicited credit
ratings on one or more classes of offered certificates, relying on information they receive pursuant to Rule 17g-5 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise. If any such unsolicited ratings are issued, we cannot assure you that they will
not be different from any ratings assigned by a rating agency engaged by the depositor. The issuance of unsolicited ratings by
any nationally recognized statistical rating organization on a class of the offered certificates that are lower than ratings assigned
by a rating agency engaged by the depositor may adversely impact the liquidity, market value and regulatory characteristics of
that class.
Â 
As part of the process of obtaining ratings
for the offered certificates, the depositor had initial discussions with and submitted certain materials to 5 nationally recognized
statistical rating organizations. Based on preliminary feedback from those nationally recognized statistical rating organizations
at that time, the depositor selected 3 of those nationally recognized statistical rating organizations to rate certain classes
of the certificates and not the other nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, due in part to their initial subordination
levels for the various classes of the certificates. If the depositor had selected the other nationally recognized statistical rating
organizations to rate the certificates, we cannot assure you that the ratings such other nationally recognized statistical rating
organizations would have assigned to the certificates would not have been lower than the ratings assigned by the nationally recognized
statistical rating organizations engaged by the depositor. Further, in the case of one nationally recognized statistical rating
organization, the depositor only requested ratings for certain classes of rated certificates, due in part to the final subordination
levels provided by that nationally recognized statistical rating organization for the classes of certificates. If the depositor
had selected that nationally recognized statistical rating organization to rate those other classes of rated certificates not rated
by it, its ratings of those other certificates may have been different, and potentially lower, than those ratings ultimately assigned
to those certificates by the other nationally recognized statistical rating organizations hired by the depositor. In addition,
the decision not to engage one or more other rating agencies in the rating of certain classes of certificates to be issued in connection
with this transaction may negatively impact the liquidity, market value and regulatory characteristics of those classes of certificates.
Although unsolicited ratings may be issued by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization, a nationally recognized
statistical rating organization might be more likely to issue an unsolicited rating if it was not selected after having provided
preliminary feedback to the depositor. Neither the depositor nor any other person or entity will have any duty to notify you if
any other nationally recognized statistical rating organization issues, or delivers notice of its intention to issue, consolidated
ratings on one or more classes of certificates after the date of this prospectus.
Â 
Furthermore, the Securities and Exchange
Commission may determine that any or all of the rating agencies engaged by the depositor to rate the certificates no longer qualifies
as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, or is no longer qualified to rate the certificates or may no longer
rate similar securities for a limited period as a result of an enforcement action, and that determination may also have an adverse
effect on the liquidity, market value and regulatory characteristics of the offered certificates. To the extent that the provisions
of any mortgage loan or the pooling and servicing agreement condition any action, event or circumstance on the delivery of a rating
agency confirmation, the pooling and servicing agreement will require delivery or deemed delivery of a rating agency confirmation
only from the rating agencies engaged by the depositor to rate the certificates or, in the case of a serviced whole loan, any related
companion loan securities.
Â 


124
Â 
Â 
We are not obligated to maintain any particular
rating with respect to the certificates, and the ratings initially assigned to the certificates by any or all of the rating agencies
engaged by the depositor to rate the certificates could change adversely as a result of changes affecting, among other things,
the mortgage loans, the mortgaged properties, the parties to the pooling and servicing agreement, or as a result of changes to
ratings criteria employed by any or all of the rating agencies engaged by the depositor to rate the certificates. Although these
changes would not necessarily be or result from an event of default on any mortgage loan, any adverse change to the ratings of
the offered certificates would likely have an adverse effect on the market value, liquidity and/or regulatory characteristics of
those certificates.
Â 
Further, certain actions provided for in
loan agreements may require a rating agency confirmation be obtained from the rating agencies engaged by the depositor to rate
the certificates and, in the case of a serviced whole loan, any companion loan securities as a precondition to taking such action.
In certain circumstances, this condition may be deemed to have been met or waived without such a rating agency confirmation being
obtained. In the event such an action is taken without a rating agency confirmation being obtained, we cannot assure you that the
applicable rating agency will not downgrade, qualify or withdraw its ratings as a result of the taking of such action. See âDescription
of the Mortgage PoolâCertain Terms of the Mortgage LoansââDue-On-Saleâ and âDue-On-Encumbranceâ
Provisionsâ, âPooling and Servicing AgreementâRating Agency Confirmationsâ and âRatingsâ
for additional considerations regarding the ratings, including a description of the process of obtaining confirmations of ratings
for the offered certificates.
Â 
Your Yield May Be Affected
by Defaults, Prepayments and Other Factors
Â 
General The yield to maturity on each class of offered certificates will depend in part on the following:
Â 

Â·the purchase price for the certificates;
Â 

Â·the rate and timing of principal payments on the mortgage loans (both voluntary and involuntary), and the allocation of principal
prepayments to the respective classes of offered certificates with certificate balances; and
Â 

Â·the allocation of shortfalls and losses on the mortgage loans to the respective classes of offered certificates.
Â 
For this purpose, principal payments include
voluntary and involuntary prepayments, such as prepayments resulting from the application of loan reserves, property releases,
casualty or condemnation, defaults and liquidations as well as principal payments resulting from repurchases due to material breaches
of representations and warranties or material document defects or purchases by a companion loan holder or mezzanine lender (if
any) pursuant to a purchase option or sales of defaulted mortgage loans.
Â 
Any changes in the weighted average lives
of your certificates may adversely affect your yield. In general, if you buy a certificate at a premium, and principal distributions
occur faster than expected, your actual yield to maturity will be lower than expected. If principal distributions are very high,
holders of certificates purchased at a premium might not fully recover their initial investment. Conversely, if you buy a certificate
at a discount and principal distributions occur more slowly than expected, your actual yield to maturity will be lower than expected.
Â 


125
Â 
Â 
Prepayments resulting in a shortening of
weighted average lives of your certificates may be made at a time of low interest rates when you may be unable to reinvest the
resulting payment of principal on your certificates at a rate comparable to the effective yield anticipated by you in making your
investment in the certificates, while delays and extensions resulting in a lengthening of those weighted average lives may occur
at a time of high interest rates when you may have been able to reinvest principal payments that would otherwise have been received
by you at higher rates.
Â 
In addition, the extent to which prepayments
on the mortgage loans in the issuing entity ultimately affect the weighted average life of the certificates will depend on the
terms of the certificates, more particularly:
Â 

Â·a class of certificates that entitles the holders of those certificates to a disproportionately larger share of the prepayments
on the mortgage loans increases the âcall riskâ or the likelihood of early retirement of that class if the rate of
prepayment is relatively fast; and
Â 

Â·a class of certificates that entitles the holders of the certificates to a disproportionately smaller share of the prepayments
on the mortgage loans increases the likelihood of âextension riskâ or an extended average life of that class if the
rate of prepayment is relatively slow.
Â 
The Timing of Prepayments and
Repurchases May Change Your Anticipated Yield
Â 
The rate at which voluntary prepayments
occur on the mortgage loans will be affected by a variety of factors, including:
Â 

Â·the terms of the mortgage loans, including, the length of any prepayment lockout period and the applicable yield maintenance
charges and prepayment premiums and the extent to which the related mortgage loan terms may be practically enforced;
Â 

Â·the level of prevailing interest rates;
Â 

Â·the availability of credit for commercial real estate;
Â 

Â·the master servicerâs or special servicerâs ability to enforce yield maintenance charges and prepayment premiums;
Â 

Â·the failure to meet certain requirements for the release of escrows;
Â 

Â·the occurrence of casualties or natural disasters; and
Â 

Â·economic, demographic, tax, legal or other factors.
Â 
Although a yield maintenance charge or other
prepayment premium provision of a mortgage loan is intended to create an economic disincentive for a borrower to prepay voluntarily
a mortgage loan, we cannot assure you that mortgage loans that have such provisions will not prepay.
Â 
The extent to which the special servicer,
if any, forecloses upon, takes title to and disposes of any mortgaged property related to a mortgage loan or sells defaulted mortgage
loans will affect the weighted average lives of your certificates. If the special servicer, if any, forecloses upon a significant
number of the related mortgage loans, and depending
Â 

126
Â 
Â 
upon the amount and timing of recoveries from the related mortgaged properties
or sells defaulted mortgage loans, your certificates may have a shorter weighted average life.
Â 
Delays in liquidations of defaulted mortgage
loans and modifications extending the maturity of mortgage loans will tend to delay the payment of principal on the mortgage loans.
The ability of the related borrower to make any required balloon payment typically will depend upon its ability either to refinance
the mortgage loan or to sell the related mortgaged property. A significant number of the mortgage loans require balloon payments
at maturity or anticipated repayment date and there is a risk that a number of those mortgage loans may default at maturity or
anticipated repayment date, or that the special servicer, if any, may extend the maturity of a number of those mortgage loans in
connection with workouts. We cannot assure you as to the borrowersâ abilities to make mortgage loan payments on a full and
timely basis, including any balloon payments at maturity or anticipated repayment date. Bankruptcy of the borrower or adverse conditions
in the market where the mortgaged property is located may, among other things, delay the recovery of proceeds in the case of defaults.
Losses on the mortgage loans due to uninsured risks or insufficient hazard insurance proceeds may create shortfalls in distributions
to certificateholders. Any required indemnification of a party to the pooling and servicing agreement in connection with legal
actions relating to the issuing entity, the related agreements or the certificates may also result in shortfalls.
Â 
See ââRisks Relating to the
Mortgage LoansâRisks Relating to Enforceability of Yield Maintenance Charges, Prepayment Premiums or Defeasance Provisionsâ
above and âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâCertain Terms of the Mortgage LoansâPrepayment Protections and
Certain Involuntary Prepaymentsâ.
Â 
In addition, if a sponsor repurchases a
mortgage loan from the issuing entity due to a material breach of one or more of its representations or warranties or a material
document defect, the repurchase price paid will be passed through to the holders of the certificates with the same effect as if
the mortgage loan had been prepaid in part or in full, and no yield maintenance charge or other prepayment premium would be payable.
Additionally, any mezzanine lender (if any) may have the option to purchase the related mortgage loan after certain defaults, and
the purchase price may not include any yield maintenance charges or prepayment premiums. As a result of such a repurchase or purchase,
investors in the ClassÂ X-A and ClassÂ X-B certificates and any other certificates purchased at a premium might not fully
recoup their initial investment. A repurchase, a prepayment or the exercise of a purchase option may adversely affect the yield
to maturity on your certificates. In this respect, see âDescription of the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreementsâ
and âPooling and Servicing AgreementâRealization Upon Mortgage Loansâ.
Â 
The certificates with notional amounts will
not be entitled to distributions of principal but instead will accrue interest on their respective notional amounts. Because the
notional amount of the certificates indicated in the table below is based upon the outstanding certificate balances of the related
class of certificates, the yield to maturity on the indicated certificates will be extremely sensitive to the rate and timing of
prepayments of principal, liquidations and principal losses on the mortgage loans to the extent allocated to the related certificates.
Â 


127
Â 
Â 



Interest-Only 
Class of 
CertificatesÂ 
Â 

Underlying ClassÂ 

ClassÂ X-A
Â 
ClassÂ A-1, ClassÂ A-2A, ClassÂ A-2B,
ClassÂ A-3, ClassÂ A-4,
ClassÂ A-SB and ClassÂ A-S certificates

ClassÂ X-B
Â 
ClassÂ B certificates

Â 
A rapid rate of principal prepayments, liquidations
and/or principal losses on the mortgage loans could result in the failure to recoup the initial investment in the ClassÂ X-A
and/or ClassÂ X-B certificates. Investors in the ClassÂ X-A or ClassÂ X-B certificates should fully consider the associated
risks, including the risk that an extremely rapid rate of amortization, prepayment or other liquidation of the Mortgage Loans could
result in the failure of such investors to recoup fully their initial investments. The yield to maturity of the certificates with
notional amounts may be adversely affected by the prepayment of mortgage loans with higher net mortgage loan rates. See âYield
and Maturity ConsiderationsâYield on the Certificates with Notional Amountsâ.
Â 
In addition, with respect to the ClassÂ A-SB
certificates, the extent to which the planned balances are achieved and the sensitivity of the ClassÂ A-SB certificates to
principal prepayments on the mortgage loans will depend in part on the period of time during which the ClassÂ A-1, ClassÂ A-2A,
ClassÂ A-2B, ClassÂ A-3 and ClassÂ A-4 certificates remain outstanding. As such, the ClassÂ A-SB certificates will
become more sensitive to the rate of prepayments on the mortgage loans than they were when the ClassÂ A-1, ClassÂ A-2A,
ClassÂ A-2B, ClassÂ A-3 and ClassÂ A-4 certificates were outstanding.
Â 
Your Yield May Be Adversely
Affected By Prepayments Resulting From Earnout Reserves
Â 
With respect to certain mortgage loans,
earnout escrows may have been established at origination, which funds may be released to the related borrower upon satisfaction
of certain conditions. If such conditions with respect to any such mortgage loan are not satisfied, the amounts reserved in such
escrows may be, or may be required to be, applied to the payment of the mortgage loan, which would have the same effect on the
offered certificates as a prepayment of the mortgage loan, except that such application of funds would not be accompanied by any
prepayment premium or yield maintenance charge. See AnnexÂ A-1. The pooling and servicing agreement will provide that unless
required by the mortgage loan documents, the master servicer will not apply such amounts as a prepayment if no event of default
has occurred.
Â 
Losses and Shortfalls May Change
Your Anticipated Yield
Â 
If losses on the mortgage loans exceed the
aggregate certificate balance of the classes of certificates subordinated to a particular class, that class will suffer a loss
equal to the full amount of the excess (up to the outstanding certificate balance of that class). Even if losses on the mortgage
loans are not borne by your certificates, those losses may affect the weighted average life and yield to maturity of your certificates.
Â 
For example, certain shortfalls in interest
as a result of involuntary prepayments may reduce the funds available to make payments on your certificates. In addition, if the
master servicer, the special servicer or the trustee reimburses itself (or a master servicer, special servicer, trustee or other
party to a pooling and servicing agreement governing the
Â 

128
Â 
Â 
servicing of a non-serviced whole loan) out of general collections on
the mortgage loans included in the issuing entity for any advance that it (or any such other party) has determined is not recoverable
out of collections on the related mortgage loan, then to the extent that this reimbursement is made from collections of principal
on the mortgage loans in the issuing entity, that reimbursement will reduce the amount of principal available to be distributed
on the certificates and will result in a reduction of the certificate balance (or notional amount) of a class of certificates.
See âDescription of the CertificatesâDistributionsâ. Likewise, if the master servicer or the trustee reimburses
itself out of principal collections on the mortgage loans for any workout-delayed reimbursement amounts, that reimbursement will
reduce the amount of principal available to be distributed on the certificates on that distribution date. This reimbursement would
have the effect of reducing current payments of principal on the offered certificates (other than the certificates and the ClassÂ R
certificates with notional amounts) and extending the weighted average lives of the offered certificates with certificate balances.
See âDescription of the CertificatesâDistributionsâ.
Â 
In addition, to the extent losses are realized
on the mortgage loans, first the ClassÂ G certificates, then the ClassÂ F certificates, then the ClassÂ E
certificates, then the ClassÂ D certificates, then the ClassÂ C certificates, then the ClassÂ B
certificates, then the ClassÂ A-S certificates and, then, pro rata, the ClassÂ A-1, ClassÂ A-2A,
ClassÂ A-2B, ClassÂ A-3, ClassÂ A-4 and ClassÂ A-SB certificates, based on their respective certificate balances,
will bear such losses up to an amount equal to the respective outstanding certificate balance of that class. A reduction in the
certificate balance of the ClassÂ A-1, ClassÂ A-2A, ClassÂ A-2B, ClassÂ A-3, ClassÂ A-4, ClassÂ A-SB, ClassÂ A-S
or ClassÂ B certificates will result in a corresponding reduction in the notional amount of the ClassÂ X-A and ClassÂ X-B
certificates. We make no representation as to the anticipated rate or timing of prepayments (voluntary or involuntary) or rate,
timing or amount of liquidations or losses on the mortgage loans or as to the anticipated yield to maturity of any such offered
certificate. See âYield and Maturity Considerationsâ.
Â 
Risk of Early Termination
Â 
The issuing entity is subject to optional
termination under certain circumstances. See âPooling and Servicing AgreementâTermination; Retirement of Certificatesâ.
In the event of this termination, you might receive some principal payments earlier than otherwise expected, which could adversely
affect your anticipated yield to maturity.
Â 
Subordination of the Subordinated
Certificates Will Affect the Timing of Distributions and the Application of Losses on the Subordinated Certificates
Â 
As described in this prospectus, the rights
of the holders of ClassÂ A-S, ClassÂ B and ClassÂ C certificates to receive payments of principal and interest otherwise
payable on the certificates they hold will be subordinated to such rights of the holders of the more senior certificates having
an earlier alphabetical or alphanumeric class designation. If you acquire any ClassÂ A-S, ClassÂ B or ClassÂ C certificates,
then your rights to receive distributions of amounts collected or advanced on or in respect of the mortgage loans will generally
be subordinated to those of the holders of the ClassÂ A-1, ClassÂ A-2A, ClassÂ A-2B, ClassÂ A-3, ClassÂ A-4,
ClassÂ A-SB, ClassÂ X-A, ClassÂ X-B and ClassÂ X-D certificates and, if your certificates are ClassÂ B or ClassÂ C
certificates, to those of the holders of the ClassÂ A-S certificates and, if your certificates are ClassÂ C certificates,
to those of the holders of the ClassÂ B certificates. See âDescription of the Certificatesâ. As a result,
investors in those classes of certificates that are subordinated in whole or part to other classes of certificates will generally
bear the effects of losses on the mortgage loans and unreimbursed expenses of the issuing entity before the holders of those other
classes of certificates. See

you and other certificateholders generally do not have a right to vote and do not have the right to make decisions with respect
to the administration of the issuing entity and the mortgage loans. With respect to mortgage loans (other than mortgage loan that
will be serviced under a separate pooling and servicing agreement), those decisions are generally made, subject to the express
terms of the pooling and servicing agreement for this transaction, by the master servicer, the special servicer, the trustee or
the certificate administrator, as applicable, subject to any rights of the directing certificateholder under the pooling and servicing
agreement for this transaction and the rights of the holders of the related companion loans and mezzanine debt under the related
intercreditor agreement. With respect to a non-serviced mortgage loan, you will generally not have any right to vote or make decisions
with respect a non-serviced mortgage loan, and those decisions will generally be made by the master servicer or the special servicer
under the pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of a non-serviced mortgage loan and the related companion loan,
subject to the rights of the directing certificateholder appointed under such pooling and servicing agreement. See âPooling
and Servicing Agreementâ and âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâThe Whole Loansâ. In particular,
with respect to the risks relating to a modification of a mortgage loan, see ââRisks Relating to Modifications of
the Mortgage Loansâ below.
Â 
In certain limited circumstances where certificateholders
have the right to vote on matters affecting the issuing entity, in some cases, these votes are by certificateholders taken as a
whole and in others the vote is by class. Your interests as an owner of certificates of a particular class may not be aligned with
the interests of owners of one or more other classes of certificates in connection with any such vote. In addition, in all cases
voting is based on the outstanding certificate balance, which is reduced by realized losses. In certain cases with respect to the
termination of the special servicer and the operating advisor, certain voting rights will also be reduced by appraisal reductions,
as described below. These limitations on voting could adversely affect your ability to protect your interests with respect to matters
voted on by certificateholders. See âDescription of the CertificatesâVoting Rightsâ. You will have no
rights to vote on any servicing matters related to the mortgage loan that will be serviced under the pooling and servicing agreement
governing the servicing of a non-serviced whole loan.
Â 
The Rights of the Directing
Certificateholder and the Operating Advisor Could Adversely Affect Your Investment
Â 
The directing certificateholder will have
certain consent and consultation rights with respect to certain matters relating to the mortgage loans (other than any non-serviced
mortgage loan and other than any excluded loan) and the right to replace the special servicer with or without cause, except that
if a control termination event (i.e., an event in which the certificate balance of the most senior class of certificates
that is eligible to be a controlling class, as reduced by the application of appraisal reductions and realized losses, is less
than 25% of its initial certificate balance) occurs and is continuing (other than with respect to the Empire Mall mortgage loan,
with respect to which the directing certificateholder prior to the securitization of the controlling pari passu companion
loan will have the rights and powers of the directing certificateholder under the pooling and servicing
Â 

130
Â 
Â 
agreement), the directing
certificateholder will lose the consent rights and the right to replace the special servicer, and if a consultation termination
event (i.e., an event in which the certificate balance of the most senior class of certificates that is eligible to be a
controlling class (as reduced by the application of realized losses) is less than 25% of its initial certificate balance) occurs,
then the directing certificateholder will lose the consultation rights. See âPooling and Servicing AgreementâThe
Directing Certificateholderâ.
Â 
These actions and decisions with respect
to which the directing certificateholder has consent or consultation rights include, among others, certain modifications to the
mortgage loans or serviced whole loans, including modifications of monetary terms, foreclosure or comparable conversion of the
related mortgaged properties, and certain sales of mortgage loans or REO properties for less than the outstanding principal amount
plus accrued interest, fees and expenses. As a result of the exercise of these rights by the directing certificateholder, the special
servicer may take actions with respect to a mortgage loan that could adversely affect the interests of investors in one or more
classes of offered certificates.
Â 
Similarly, with respect to a non-serviced
mortgage loan, the special servicer under the pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of a non-serviced mortgage
loan may, at the direction or upon the advice of the directing certificateholder (or equivalent) of the related securitization
trust holding the controlling note for a non-serviced whole loan, take actions with respect to such non-serviced mortgage loan
and related companion loan that could adversely affect a non-serviced mortgage loan, and therefore, the holders of some or all
of the classes of certificates. The issuing entity (as the holder of the non-controlling note) will have limited consultation rights
with respect to major decisions relating to a non-serviced whole loan and in connection with a sale of a defaulted loan, and such
rights will be exercised by the directing certificateholder for this transaction so long as no control termination event has occurred
and is continuing and by the special servicer if a control termination event has occurred and is continuing. Additionally, with
respect to each non-serviced whole loan, in circumstances similar to those described above, the directing certificateholder (or
the equivalent) of the related securitization trust will have the right to replace the special servicer of such securitization
with or without cause, and without the consent of the issuing entity. See âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâThe
Whole Loansâ and âPooling and Servicing AgreementâServicing of the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loansâ.
Â 
Although the special servicer under the
pooling and servicing agreement and the special servicer for a non-serviced mortgage loan are not permitted to take actions which
are prohibited by law or violate the servicing standard under the applicable pooling and servicing agreement or the terms of the
related loan documents, it is possible that the directing certificateholder (or equivalent entity) under such pooling and servicing
agreement may direct or advise, as applicable, the related special servicer to take actions with respect to such mortgage loan
that conflict with the interests of the holders of certain classes of the certificates.
Â 
You will be acknowledging and agreeing,
by your purchase of offered certificates, that the directing certificateholder and the directing certificateholder under the pooling
and servicing agreement governing the servicing of a non-serviced mortgage loan:
Â 
(i)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â may have special relationships
and interests that conflict with those of holders of one or more classes of certificates;
Â 
(ii)Â Â Â Â Â Â may act solely in the
interests of the holders of the controlling class (or, in the case of a non-serviced mortgage loan, the controlling class of the
securitization
Â 

131
Â 
Â 
trust formed under the pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of a non-serviced mortgage loan)
Â 
(iii)Â Â Â Â Â does not have any duties
to the holders of any class of certificates other than the controlling class (or, in the case of a non-serviced mortgage loan,
the controlling class of the securitization trust formed under the pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of a
non-serviced mortgage loan);
Â 
(iv)Â Â Â Â Â may take actions that
favor the interests of the holders of the controlling class (or, in the case of a non-serviced mortgage loan, the controlling class
of the securitization trust formed under the pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of a non-serviced mortgage
loan) over the interests of the holders of one or more other classes of certificates; and
Â 
(v)Â Â Â Â Â Â will have no liability
whatsoever (other than to a controlling class certificateholder) for having so acted as set forth in clausesÂ (i) â (iv)
above, and that no certificateholder may take any action whatsoever against the directing certificateholder or the directing certificateholder
under the pooling and servicing agreement governing the servicing of a non-serviced mortgage loan or any of their respective affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, shareholders, members, partners, agents or principals for having so acted.
Â 
In addition, if a control termination event
has occurred and is continuing, the operating advisor will have certain consultation rights with respect to certain matters relating
to the mortgage loans (other than any non-serviced mortgage loan). Further, if a consultation termination event has occurred and
is continuing, the operating advisor will have the right to recommend a replacement of a special servicer, as described under âPooling
and Servicing AgreementâThe Operating Advisorâ. The operating advisor is generally required to act on behalf of
the issuing entity and in the best interest of, and for the benefit of, the certificateholders and, with respect to any serviced
whole loan, for the benefit of the holders of the related companion loan (as a collective whole as if the certificateholders and
companion loan holders constituted a single lender). We cannot assure you that any actions taken by the special servicer as a result
of a recommendation or consultation by the operating advisor will not adversely affect the interests of investors in one or more
classes of certificates. With respect to each non-serviced mortgage loan, the operating advisor appointed under the related pooling
and servicing agreement governing the servicing of such non-serviced mortgage loan will have similar rights and duties under such
pooling and servicing agreement. Further, the operating advisor will generally have no obligations or consultation rights under
the pooling and servicing agreement for this transaction with respect to any non-serviced mortgage loan, the Empire Mall mortgage
loan or any related REO Property. Additionally, with respect to the Empire Mall mortgage loan, in the event the related controlling
pari passu companion loan is not included in a future securitization, the pooling and servicing agreement under this securitization
does not provide for an operating advisor with rights and duties in connection with the servicing and administration of such serviced
whole loan. See âPooling and Servicing AgreementâServicing of the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loansâ.
Â 
You Have Limited Rights to
Replace the Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor or the Asset Representations
Reviewer
Â 
In general, the directing certificateholder
will have the right to terminate and replace the special servicer with or without cause so long as no control termination event
has occurred and is continuing and other than in respect of any excluded loan as described in this
Â 

132
Â 
Â 
prospectus. After the occurrence
and during continuance of a control termination event under the pooling and servicing agreement, the special servicer may also
be removed in certain circumstances (x)Â if a request is made by certificateholders evidencing not less than 25% of the voting
rights (taking into account the application of appraisal reductions to notionally reduce the respective certificate balances) and
(y)Â upon receipt of approval by certificateholders holding at least 75% of a quorum of the certificateholders (which is the
holders of certificates evidencing at least 75% of the voting rights (taking into account the application of realized losses and
the application of appraisal reductions to notionally reduce the respective certificate balances). See âPooling and Servicing
AgreementâReplacement of Special Servicer Without Causeâ.
Â 
The certificateholders will generally have
no right to replace and terminate the master servicer, the trustee and the certificate administrator without cause. The vote of
the requisite percentage of certificateholders may terminate the operating advisor or the asset representations reviewer without
cause. The vote of the requisite percentage of the certificateholders will be required to replace the master servicer, the special
servicer, the operating advisor and the asset representations reviewer even for cause, and certain termination events may be waived
by the vote of the requisite percentage of the certificateholders. With respect to each non-serviced whole loan, in circumstances
similar to those described above, the directing certificateholder (or the equivalent) and the certificateholders of the securitization
trust related to such other pooling and servicing agreement will have the right to replace the special servicer of such securitization
with or without cause, and without the consent of the issuing entity. The certificateholders will have no right to replace the
master servicer or the special servicer of the pooling and servicing agreement relating to a non-serviced mortgage loan. We cannot
assure that your lack of control over the replacement of these parties will not have an adverse impact on your investment.
Â 
The Rights of Companion Holders
and Mezzanine Debt May Adversely Affect Your Investment
Â 
The holders of a serviced pari passu
companion loan relating to a serviced pari passu mortgage loan (other than the holder of the Empire Mall controlling pari
passu companion loan) will have certain consultation rights (on a non-binding basis) with respect to major decisions relating
to the related whole loan under the related intercreditor agreement. Such companion loan holder and its representative may have
interests in conflict with those of the holders of some or all of the classes of certificates, and may advise the special servicer
to take actions that conflict with the interests of the holders of certain classes of the certificates. Although any such consultation
is non-binding and the special servicer may not be required to consult with the companion loan holder unless required to do so
under the servicing standard, we cannot assure you that the exercise of the rights of such companion loan holder will not delay
any action to be taken by the special servicer and will not adversely affect your investment.
Â 
The holder of the controlling Empire Mall
pari passu companion loans will have certain consent and consultation rights with respect to certain matters relating to
the Empire Mall mortgage loan and the right to replace the special servicer with or without cause, solely with respect to the Empire
Mall whole loan. These actions and decisions include, among others, the right, in certain circumstances, to modify or waive any
of the terms of the Empire Mall mortgage loan documents, call or waive any event of default under the Empire Mall mortgage loan
documents and consent to any action or failure to act by any party to the Empire Mall mortgage loan documents. The exercise of
these rights may cause the special servicer to take actions with respect to the Empire Mall whole loan that could adversely affect
the interests of investors in one or more classes of offered certificates.
Â 


133
Â 
Â 
With respect to mortgage loans that have
mezzanine debt, the related mezzanine lender will have the right under certain limited circumstances to (i)Â cure certain defaults
with respect to, and under certain default scenarios, purchase (without payment of any yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium)
the related mortgage loan and (ii)Â so long as no event of default with respect to the related mortgage loan continues after
the mezzanine lenderâs cure right has expired, approve certain modifications and consent to certain actions to be taken with
respect to the related mortgage loan. See âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâMortgage Pool Characteristicsâ
and ââAdditional Indebtednessâ.
Â 
The purchase option that the holder of mezzanine
debt holds pursuant to the related intercreditor agreement generally permits such holder to purchase its related defaulted mortgage
loan for a purchase price generally equal to the outstanding principal balance of the related defaulted mortgage loan, together
with accrued and unpaid interest (exclusive of default interest) on, and unpaid servicing expenses, protective advances and interest
on advances related to, such defaulted mortgage loan. However, in the event such holder is not obligated to pay some or all of
those fees and additional expenses, including any liquidation fee payable to the special servicer under the terms of the pooling
and servicing agreement, then the exercise of such holderâs rights under the intercreditor agreement to purchase the related
mortgage loan from the issuing entity may result in a loss to the issuing entity in the amount of those fees and additional expenses.
In addition, such holderâs right to cure defaults under the related defaulted mortgage loan could delay the issuing entityâs
ability to realize on or otherwise take action with respect to such defaulted mortgage loan.
Â 
In addition, with respect to a non-serviced
mortgage loan, you will generally not have any right to vote or consent with respect to any matters relating to the servicing and
administration of a non-serviced mortgage loan, however, the directing certificateholder (or equivalent) of the related securitization
trust holding the controlling note for the related non-serviced whole loan, will have the right to vote or consent with respect
to certain specified matters relating to the servicing and administration of such non-serviced mortgage loan. The interests of
the securitization trust holding the controlling note may conflict with those of the holders of some or all of the classes of certificates,
and accordingly the directing certificateholder (or the equivalent) of such securitization trust may direct or advise the special
servicer for the related securitization trust to take actions that conflict with the interests of the holders of certain classes
of the certificates. See âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâThe Whole LoansâThe Non-Serviced Pari Passu Whole
Loansâ and âPooling and Servicing AgreementâServicing of the Non-Servicing Mortgage Loanâ.
Â 
You will be acknowledging and agreeing,
by your purchase of offered certificates, that the companion loan holders:
Â 

Â·may have special relationships and interests that conflict with those of holders of one or more classes of certificates;
Â 

Â·may act solely in its own interests, without regard to your interests;
Â 

Â·do not have any duties to any other person, including the holders of any class of certificates;
Â 

Â·may take actions that favor its interests over the interests of the holders of one or more classes of certificates; and
Â 

Â·will have no liability whatsoever for having so acted and that no certificateholder may take any action whatsoever against
the companion loan holder or its 
Â 


134
Â 
Â 


 representative or any director, officer, employee, agent or principal of the companion loan holder
or its representative for having so acted.
Â 
Risks Relating to Modifications
of the Mortgage Loans
Â 
As delinquencies or defaults occur, the
special servicer will be required to utilize an increasing amount of resources to work with borrowers to maximize collections on
the mortgage loans serviced by it. This may include modifying the terms of such mortgage loans that are in default or whose default
is reasonably foreseeable. At each step in the process of trying to bring a defaulted mortgage loan current or in maximizing proceeds
to the issuing entity, the special servicer will be required to invest time and resources not otherwise required when collecting
payments on performing mortgage loans. Modifications of mortgage loans implemented by the special servicer in order to maximize
ultimate proceeds of such mortgage loans to the issuing entity may have the effect of, among other things, reducing or otherwise
changing the mortgage rate, forgiving or forbearing payments of principal, interest or other amounts owed under the mortgage loan,
extending the final maturity date of the mortgage loan, capitalizing or deferring delinquent interest and other amounts owed under
the mortgage loan, forbearing payment of a portion of the principal balance of the mortgage loan or any combination of these or
other modifications.
Â 
Any modified mortgage loan may remain in
the issuing entity, and the modification may result in a reduction in (or may eliminate) the funds received in respect of such
mortgage loan. In particular, any modification to reduce or forgive the amount of interest payable on the mortgage loan will reduce
the amount cash flow available to make distributions of interest on the certificates, which will likely impact the most subordinated
classes of certificates that suffer the shortfall. To the extent the modification defers principal payments on the mortgage loan
(including as a result of an extension of its stated maturity date), certificates entitled to principal distributions will likely
be repaid more slowly than anticipated, and if principal payments on the mortgage loan are forgiven, the reduction will cause a
write-down of the certificate balances of the certificates in reverse order of seniority. See âDescription of the CertificatesâSubordination;
Allocation of Realized Lossesâ.
Â 
The ability to modify mortgage loans by
the special servicer may be limited by several factors. First, if the special servicer has to consider a large number of modifications,
operational constraints may affect the ability of the special servicer to adequately address all of the needs of the borrowers.
Furthermore, the terms of the related servicing agreement may prohibit the special servicer from taking certain actions in connection
with a loan modification, such as an extension of the loan term beyond a specified date such as a specified number of years prior
to the rated final distribution date. You should consider the importance of the role of the special servicer in maximizing collections
for the transaction and the impediments the special servicer may encounter when servicing delinquent or defaulted mortgage loans.
In some cases, failure by a special servicer to timely modify the terms of a defaulted mortgage loan may reduce amounts available
for distribution on the certificates in respect of such mortgage loan, and consequently may reduce amounts available for distribution
to the related certificates. In addition, even if a loan modification is successfully completed, we cannot assure you that the
related borrower will continue to perform under the terms of the modified mortgage loan.
Â 
Modifications that are designed to maximize
collections in the aggregate may adversely affect a particular class of certificates. The pooling and servicing agreement obligates
the special servicer not to consider the interests of individual classes of certificates. You should note that in connection with
considering a modification or other type of loss mitigation, the special servicer may incur or bear related out-of-pocket expenses,
such as appraisal fees, which would be reimbursed to the special servicer from the transaction as servicing
Â 

135
Â 
Â 
advances and paid from
amounts received on the modified loan or from other mortgage loans in the mortgage pool but in each case, prior to distributions
being made on the certificates.
Â 
Sponsors May Not Make Required
Repurchases or Substitutions of Defective Mortgage Loans or Pay Any Loss of Value Payment Sufficient to Cover All Losses on a Defective
Mortgage Loan
Â 
Each sponsor is the sole warranting party
in respect of the mortgage loans sold by such sponsor to us. Neither we nor any of our affiliates (except Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association in its capacity as a sponsor) is obligated to repurchase or substitute any mortgage loan or make any payment to compensate
the issuing entity in connection with a breach of any representation or warranty of a sponsor or any document defect, if the sponsor
defaults on its obligation to do so. We cannot assure you that the sponsors will effect such repurchases or substitutions or make
such payment to compensate the issuing entity. Although a loss of value payment may only be made to the extent that the special
servicer deems such amount to be sufficient to compensate the issuing entity for such material defect or material breach, we cannot
assure you that such loss of value payment will fully compensate the issuing entity for such material defect or material breach
in all respects. In addition, the sponsors may have various legal defenses available to them in connection with a repurchase or
substitution obligation or an obligation to pay the loss of value payment. In particular, in the case of a non-serviced whole loan
that is serviced under the related non-serviced pooling and servicing agreement entered into in connection with the securitization
of the related pari passu companion loan, the asset representations reviewer under that pooling and servicing agreement
(if any) may review the diligence file relating to such pari passu companion loan concurrently with the review of the asset
representations reviewer of the related mortgage loan for this transaction, and their findings may be inconsistent, and such inconsistency
may allow the related mortgage loan seller to challenge the findings of the asset representations reviewer of the affected mortgage
loan. Any mortgage loan that is not repurchased or substituted and that is not a âqualified mortgageâ for a REMIC may
cause designated portions of the issuing entity to fail to qualify as a REMIC or cause the issuing entity to incur a tax. See âDescription
of the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreementsâ.
Â 
Risks Relating to Interest
on Advances and Special Servicing Compensation
Â 
To the extent described in this prospectus,
the master servicer, the special servicer and the trustee will each be entitled to receive interest on unreimbursed advances made
by it at the âPrime Rateâ as published in The Wall Street Journal. This interest will generally accrue from
the date on which the related advance is made or the related expense is incurred to the date of reimbursement. In addition, under
certain circumstances, including delinquencies in the payment of principal and/or interest, a mortgage loan will be specially serviced
and the special servicer will be entitled to compensation for special servicing activities. The right to receive interest on advances
or special servicing compensation is senior to the rights of certificateholders to receive distributions on the offered certificates.
The payment of interest on advances and the payment of compensation to the special servicer may lead to shortfalls in amounts otherwise
distributable on your certificates.
Â 
Bankruptcy of a Servicer
May Adversely Affect Collections on the Mortgage Loans and the Ability to Replace the Servicer
Â 
The master servicer or the special servicer
may be eligible to become a debtor under the federal bankruptcy code or enter into receivership under the Federal Deposit Insurance
Act
Â 

136
Â 
Â 
(âFDIAâ). If a master servicer or special servicer, as applicable, were to become a debtor under the federal
bankruptcy code or enter into receivership under the FDIA, although the pooling and servicing agreement provides that such an event
would entitle the issuing entity to terminate the master servicer or special servicer, as applicable, the provision would most
likely not be enforceable. However, a rejection of the pooling and servicing agreement by a master servicer or special servicer,
as applicable, in a bankruptcy proceeding or repudiation of the pooling and servicing agreement in a receivership under the FDIA
would be treated as a breach of the pooling and servicing agreement and give the issuing entity a claim for damages and the ability
to appoint a successor master servicer or special servicer, as applicable. An assumption under the federal bankruptcy code would
require the master servicer or special servicer, as applicable, to cure its pre-bankruptcy defaults, if any, and demonstrate that
it is able to perform following assumption. The bankruptcy court may permit the master servicer or special servicer, as applicable,
to assume the servicing agreement and assign it to a third party. An insolvency by an entity governed by state insolvency law would
vary depending on the laws of the particular state. We cannot assure you that a bankruptcy or receivership of the master servicer
or special servicer, as applicable, would not adversely impact the servicing of the mortgage loans or the issuing entity would
be entitled to terminate the master servicer or special servicer, as applicable, in a timely manner or at all.
Â 
If any master servicer or special servicer,
as applicable, becomes the subject of bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the issuing entity claim to collections in that master
servicer or special servicerâs, as applicable, possession at the time of the bankruptcy filing or other similar filing may
not be perfected. In this event, funds available to pay principal and interest on your certificates may be delayed or reduced.
Â 
The Sponsors, the Depositor
and the Issuing Entity Are Subject to Bankruptcy or Insolvency Laws That May Affect the Issuing Entityâs Ownership of the
Mortgage Loans
Â 
In the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency
of a sponsor or the depositor, it is possible the issuing entityâs right to payment from or ownership of the mortgage loans
could be challenged, and if such challenge were successful, delays, reductions in payments and/or losses on the certificates could
occur.
Â 
The transfer of the mortgage loans by the
sponsors in connection with this offering is not expected to qualify for the securitization safe harbor adopted by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (the âFDICâ) for securitizations sponsored by insured depository institutions.
However, the safe harbor is non-exclusive.
Â 
In the case of each sponsor, an opinion
of counsel will be rendered on the closing date, based on certain facts and assumptions and subject to certain qualifications,
to the effect that the transfer of the related mortgage loans by such sponsor to the depositor would generally be respected in
the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency of such sponsor. A legal opinion is not a guaranty as to what any particular court would
actually decide, but rather an opinion as to the decision a court would reach if the issues are competently presented and the court
followed existing precedent as to legal and equitable principles applicable in bankruptcy cases. In any event, we cannot assure
you that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a bankruptcy trustee or another interested party, as applicable, would not
attempt to assert that such transfer was not a sale. Even if a challenge were not successful, it is possible that payments on the
certificates would be delayed while a court resolves the claim.
Â 


137
Â 
Â 
In addition, since the issuing entity is
a common law trust, it may not be eligible for relief under the federal bankruptcy laws, unless it can be characterized as a âbusiness
trustâ for purposes of the federal bankruptcy laws. Bankruptcy courts look at various considerations in making this determination,
so it is not possible to predict with any certainty whether or not the issuing entity would be characterized as a âbusiness
trustâ. Regardless of whether a bankruptcy court ultimately determines that the issuing entity is a âbusiness trustâ,
it is possible that payments on the offered certificates would be delayed while the court resolved the issue.
Â 
Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act provides
for an orderly liquidation authority (âOLAâ) under which the FDIC can be appointed as receiver of certain systemically
important non-bank financial companies and their direct or indirect subsidiaries in certain cases. We make no representation as
to whether this would apply to any of the sponsors. In January 2011, the then-acting general counsel of the FDIC issued a letter
(the âActing General Counselâs Letterâ) in which he expressed his view that, under then-existing regulations,
the FDIC, as receiver under the OLA, would not, in the exercise of its OLA repudiation powers, recover as property of a financial
company assets transferred by the financial company, provided that the transfer satisfies the conditions for the exclusion
of assets from the financial companyâs estate under the federal bankruptcy code. The letter further noted that, while the
FDIC staff may be considering recommending further regulations under OLA, the acting general counsel would recommend that such
regulations incorporate a 90-day transition period for any provisions affecting the FDICâs statutory power to disaffirm or
repudiate contracts. If, however, the FDIC were to adopt a different approach than that described in the Acting General Counselâs
Letter, delays or reductions in payments on the offered certificates would occur.
Â 
The Requirement of the Special
Servicer to Obtain FIRREA-Compliant Appraisals May Result in an Increased Cost to the Issuing Entity
Â 
Each appraisal obtained pursuant to the
pooling and servicing agreement is required to contain a statement, or is accompanied by a letter from the appraiser, to the effect
that the appraisal was performed in accordance with the requirements of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement
Act of 1989 (âFIRREAâ), as in effect on the date such appraisal was obtained. Any such appraisal is likely to
be more expensive than an appraisal that is not FIRREA compliant. Such increased cost could result in losses to the issuing entity.
Additionally, FIRREA compliant appraisals are required to assume a value determined by a typically motivated buyer and seller,
and could result in a higher appraised value than one not prepared assuming a forced liquidation or other distress situation. In
addition, because a FIRREA compliant appraisal may result in a higher valuation than a non-FIRREA compliant appraisal, there may
be a delay in calculating and applying appraisal reductions, which could result in the holders of a given class of certificates
continuing to hold the full non-notionally reduced amount of such certificates for a longer period of time than would be the case
if a non-FIRREA compliant appraisal were obtained.
Â 
Tax Matters and Changes
in Tax Law May Adversely Impact the Mortgage Loans or Your Investment
Â 
Tax Considerations Relating
to Foreclosure
Â 
If the issuing entity acquires a mortgaged
property (or, in the case of a non-serviced mortgage loan, a beneficial interest in a mortgaged property) subsequent to a default
on the related mortgage loan pursuant to a foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, the special servicer (or, in the case of
a non-serviced mortgage loan, the related non-serviced special servicer) would be required to retain an independent contractor
to operate and
Â 

138
Â 
Â 
manage such mortgaged property. Among other items, the independent contractor generally will not be able to perform
construction work other than repair, maintenance or certain types of tenant build-outs, unless the construction was more than 10%
completed when the mortgage loan defaulted or when the default of the mortgage loan became imminent. Generally, any (i)Â net
income from such operation (other than qualifying ârents from real propertyâ) (ii)Â rental income based on the
net profits of a tenant or sub-tenant or allocable to a service that is non-customary in the area and for the type of property
involved and (iii)Â rental income attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property, if
the rent attributable to the personal property exceeds 15% of the total rent for the taxable year, will subject the Lower-Tier
REMIC to federal tax (and possibly state or local tax) on such income at the highest marginal corporate tax rate. No determination
has been made whether any portion of the income from the mortgaged properties constitutes ârent from real propertyâ.
Any such imposition of tax will reduce the net proceeds available for distribution to certificateholders. The special servicer
(or, in the case of a non-serviced mortgage loan, the related non-serviced special servicer) may permit the Lower-Tier REMIC to
earn ânet income from foreclosure propertyâ that is subject to tax if it determines that the net after-tax benefit
to holders of certificates and any related companion loan holders, as a collective whole, could reasonably be expected to be greater
than under another method of operating or leasing the mortgaged property. See âPooling and Servicing AgreementâRealization
Upon Mortgage Loansâ. In addition, if the issuing entity were to acquire one or more mortgaged properties (or, in the
case of a non-serviced mortgage loan, a beneficial interest in a mortgaged property) pursuant to a foreclosure or deed-in-lieu
of foreclosure, upon acquisition of those mortgaged properties (or, in the case of a non-serviced mortgage loan, a beneficial interest
in a mortgaged property), the issuing entity may in certain jurisdictions, particularly in New York, be required to pay state or
local transfer or excise taxes upon liquidation of such properties. Such state or local taxes may reduce net proceeds available
for distribution to the certificateholders.
Â 
REMIC Status
Â 
If an entity intended to qualify as a REMIC
fails to satisfy one or more of the REMIC provisions of the Code during any taxable year, the Code provides that such entity will
not be treated as a REMIC for such year and any year thereafter. In such event, the relevant entity would likely be treated as
an association taxable as a corporation under the United States internal revenue code. If designated portions of the issuing entity
are so treated, the offered certificates may be treated as stock interests in an association and not as debt instruments.
Â 
Material Federal Tax Considerations
Regarding Original Issue Discount
Â 
One or more classes of offered certificates
may be issued with âoriginal issue discountâ for federal income tax purposes, which generally would result in the holder
recognizing taxable income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to that income. Accordingly, investors must have sufficient
sources of cash to pay any federal, state or local income taxes with respect to the original issue discount. In addition, such
original issue discount will be required to be accrued and included in income based on the assumption that no defaults will occur
and no losses will be incurred with respect to the mortgage loans. This could lead to the inclusion of amounts in ordinary income
early in the term of the certificate that later prove uncollectible, giving rise to a bad debt deduction. In the alternative, an
investor may be required to treat such uncollectible amount as a capital loss under Code SectionÂ 166.

Description
of the Mortgage Pool
Â 
General
Â 
The assets of the issuing entity will consist
of a pool of 71 fixed rate mortgage loans (the âMortgage Loansâ or, collectively, the âMortgage Poolâ)
with an aggregate principal balance as of the Cut-off Date of $1,002,201,025 (the âInitial Pool Balanceâ). The
âCut-off Dateâ means the respective due dates for such Mortgage Loans in December 2015 (or, in the case of any
Mortgage Loan that has its first due date in January 2016, the date that would have been its due date in December 2015 under the
terms of such Mortgage Loan if a monthly debt service payment were scheduled to be due in that month).
Â 
Six (6) of the Mortgage Loans, representing
approximately 26.7% of the Initial Pool Balance, are each part of a larger whole loan, each of which is comprised of the related
Mortgage Loan and one or more loans that are pari passu in right of payment to the related Mortgage Loan (collectively referred
to in this prospectus as âCompanion Loansâ or âPari Passu Companion Loansâ or each, a âCompanion
Loanâ or âPari Passu Companion Loanâ, as applicable). Each such Mortgage Loan and any related Companion
Loan is collectively referred to as a âWhole Loanâ. Each Companion Loan is secured by the same mortgage and
the same single assignment of leases and rents securing the related Mortgage Loan. See ââThe Whole Loansâ
below for more information regarding the rights of the holders of the Companion Loans and the servicing and administration of the
Whole Loans that will not be serviced under the PSA (as defined in âDescription of the CertificatesâGeneralâ
in this prospectus) for this transaction.
Â 
The Mortgage Loans and Whole Loans were
originated or acquired by the mortgage loan sellers set forth in the following chart and such entities will sell their respective
Mortgage Loans to the depositor, which will in turn sell the Mortgage Loans to the issuing entity:

(1)Principal Commercial
  Capital is the lending platform jointly formed by Macquarie US Trading LLC and Principal
  Real Estate Investors, LLC to originate and securitize commercial mortgage loans. The
  mortgage loans to be transferred to the depositor by Macquarie US Trading LLC d/b/a Principal
  Commercial Capital were originated by either (i) Macquarie Investments US Inc. d/b/a
  Principal Commercial Capital, in the case of one mortgage loan, secured by the mortgaged
  property identified on Annex A-1 to this prospectus as Hawthorne Business Center, representing
  approximately 1.2% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as
  of the cut-off date, which will transfer such mortgage loan to Macquarie US Trading LLC
  d/b/a Principal Commercial Capital on or prior to the closing date, or (ii) Macquarie
  US Trading LLC d/b/a Principal Commercial Capital, in the case of all other mortgage
  loans to be transferred to the depositor by Macquarie US Trading LLC d/b/a Principal
  Commercial Capital.
Â 

(2)Wells
Fargo Bank, National Association delegated certain of its underwriting and origination functions in connection with one Mortgage
Loan, secured by the Mortgaged Property identified on Annex A-1 to this 
Â 


140
Â 
Â 
prospectus as University Center South, representing approximately 0.3%
  of the Initial Pool Balance, to Principal Real Estate Investors,Â LLC (an affiliate
  of Principal Life Insurance Company) pursuant to a program of agreed upon underwriting
  and closing procedures, as described under âTransaction PartiesâThe Sponsors
  and Mortgage Loan SellersâWells Fargo Bank, National AssociationâWells Fargo
  Bankâs Commercial Mortgage Loan Underwritingâ in this prospectus.
Â 
Each of the Mortgage Loans or Whole Loans
is evidenced by one or more promissory notes or similar evidence of indebtedness (each a âMortgage Noteâ) and,
in each case, secured by (or, in the case of an indemnity deed of trust, backed by a guaranty that is secured by) a mortgage, deed
of trust or other similar security instrument (a âMortgageâ) creating a first lien on a fee simple and/or leasehold
interest in a commercial, multifamily or manufactured housing community real property (each, a âMortgaged Propertyâ).
Â 
The Mortgage Loans are generally non-recourse
loans. In the event of a borrower default on a non-recourse Mortgage Loan, recourse may be had only against the specific Mortgaged
Property and the other limited assets securing such Mortgage Loan, and not against the related borrowerâs other assets. The
Mortgage Loans are not insured or guaranteed by the sponsors, the mortgage loan sellers or any other person or entity unrelated
to the respective borrower. You should consider all of the Mortgage Loans to be nonrecourse loans as to which recourse in the case
of default will be limited to the specific property and other assets, if any, pledged to secure the related Mortgage Loan.
Â 
Certain Calculations
and Definitions
Â 
This prospectus sets forth certain information
with respect to the Mortgage Loans and the Mortgaged Properties. The sum in any column of the tables presented in AnnexÂ A-2
or AnnexÂ A-3 may not equal the indicated total due to rounding. The information in AnnexÂ A-1 with respect to the Mortgage
Loans (or Whole Loans, if applicable) and the Mortgaged Properties is based upon the pool of the Mortgage Loans as it is expected
to be constituted as of the close of business on DecemberÂ 23, 2015 (the âClosing Dateâ), assuming that
(i)Â all scheduled principal and interest payments due on or before the Cut-off Date will be made and (ii)Â there will
be no principal prepayments on or before the Closing Date. The statistics in AnnexÂ A-1, AnnexÂ A-2 and AnnexÂ A-3
were primarily derived from information provided to the depositor by each sponsor, which information may have been obtained from
the borrowers.
Â 
All percentages of the Mortgage Loans and
Mortgaged Properties, or of any specified group of Mortgage Loans and Mortgaged Properties, referred to in this prospectus without
further description are approximate percentages of the Initial Pool Balance by Cut-off Date Balances and/or the allocated loan
amount allocated to such Mortgaged Properties as of the Cut-off Date.
Â 
All information presented in this prospectus
with respect to each Mortgage Loan with one or more Pari Passu Companion Loans is calculated in a manner that reflects the aggregate
indebtedness evidenced by that Mortgage Loan and the related Pari Passu Companion Loan(s), unless otherwise indicated.
Â 
Definitions
Â 
For purposes of this prospectus, including
the information presented in the Annexes, the indicated terms have the following meanings:
Â 
âADRâ means, for any
hotel property, average daily rate.
Â 


141
Â 
Â 
âAnnual Debt Serviceâ
generally means, for any Mortgage Loan, 12 times the average of the principal and interest payments for the first 12 payment periods
of the Mortgage Loan following the Cut-off Date, provided that:
Â 

Â·in the case of a Mortgage Loan that provides for interest-only payments through maturity, the aggregate interest payments scheduled
to be due on the Due Date following the Cut-off Date and the 11 Due Dates thereafter for such Mortgage Loan; and
Â 

Â·in the case of a Mortgage Loan that provides for an initial interest-only period and provides for scheduled amortization payments
after the expiration of such interest-only period prior to the maturity date or the Anticipated Repayment Date, as applicable,
12 times the monthly payment of principal and interest payable during the amortization period. Monthly debt service and the debt
service coverage ratios are also calculated using the average of the principal and interest payments for the first twelve payment
periods of the Mortgage Loan following the Cut-off Date, subject to the proviso to the prior sentence. In the case of any Whole
Loan, Annual Debt Service is calculated with respect to the Mortgage Loan including any related Companion Loan. Annual Debt Service
is calculated with regard to the related Mortgage Loan included in the issuing entity only, unless otherwise indicated.
Â 
âAppraised Valueâ means,
for any Mortgaged Property, the appraiserâs adjusted value of such Mortgaged Property as determined by the most recent third
party appraisal of the Mortgaged Property available to the related mortgage loan seller as set forth under âAppraised
Valueâ on AnnexÂ A-1. The Appraised Value set forth on AnnexÂ A-1 is the âas-isâ value unless otherwise
specified in this prospectus, on AnnexÂ A-1 and/or the related footnotes. In certain cases, the appraisals state an âas-stabilizedâ,
âas-completeâ, âas-repairedâ, âhypotheticalâ, or âas-renovatedâ value as well as
the âas-isâ value for the related Mortgaged Property that assume that certain events will occur with respect to the
re-tenanting, construction, renovation or repairs at such Mortgaged Property. In most such cases, the related mortgage loan seller
has taken reserves sufficient to complete such re-tenanting, construction, renovation or repairs. We make no representation that
sufficient amounts have been reserved or that the appraised value would approximate either the value that would be determined in
a current appraisal of the related Mortgaged Property or the amount that would be realized upon a sale. In addition, with respect
to Mortgage Loans secured by portfolios of Mortgaged Properties, the Appraised Value may represent the âas-isâ, âas-completeâ,
âas-renovatedâ or âas-stabilizedâ value for the related portfolio of Mortgaged Properties as a collective
whole, which is generally higher than the aggregate of the âas-isâ, âas-completeâ, âas-renovatedâ
or âas-stabilizedâ appraised values of the related individual Mortgaged Properties. For example, in the case of the
Mortgage Loan identified as Heritage Industrial Portfolio on AnnexÂ A-1 to this prospectus, representing approximately 4.1%
of the Initial Pool Balance, the âas-isâ appraised value of $116,500,000 reflects a premium attributed to the value
of the related Mortgaged Properties as a whole. The sum of the individual appraised values of each of the related Mortgaged Properties
is $108,500,000. In the case of certain of the Mortgage Loans, the LTV Ratio for such Mortgage Loans has been calculated based
on the âas-completeâ or âas-stabilizedâ Appraised Value of the related Mortgaged Property, and in certain
other cases, based on an Appraised Value that includes certain property that does not qualify as real property. With respect to
any Mortgage Loan that is a part of a Whole Loan, the Appraised Value is based on the appraised value of the related Mortgaged
Property that secures the entire Whole Loan.
Â 
âBalloon Balanceâ means,
with respect to any Mortgage Loan, the principal amount that will be due at maturity (or, in the case of any ARD Loan, at the related
Anticipated
Â 

142
Â 
Â 
Repayment Date) for such Mortgage Loan, assuming no payment defaults or principal prepayments.
Â 
âCash Flow Analysisâ
is, with respect to one or more of the Mortgaged Properties securing a Mortgage Loan among the 15 largest Mortgage Loans or groups
of cross-collateralized Mortgage Loans, a summary presentation of certain adjusted historical financial information provided by
the related borrower, and a calculation of the Underwritten Net Cash Flow expressed as (a)Â âEffective Gross Incomeâ
minus (b)Â âTotal Expensesâ and underwritten replacement reserves and (if applicable) tenant improvements
and leasing commissions. For this purpose:
Â 

Â·âEffective Gross Incomeâ means, with respect to any Mortgaged Property, the revenue derived from the use
and operation of that property, less allowances for vacancies, concessions and credit losses. The ârevenueâ component
of such calculation was generally determined on the basis of the information described with respect to the ârevenueâ
component described under âUnderwritten Net Cash Flowâ below. In general, any non-recurring revenue items and
non-property related revenue are eliminated from the calculation of Effective Gross Income.
Â 

Â·âTotal Expensesâ means, with respect to any Mortgaged Property, all operating expenses associated with that
property, including, but not limited to, utilities, administrative expenses, repairs and maintenance, management fees, advertising
costs, insurance premiums, real estate taxes and (if applicable) ground rent. Such expenses were generally determined on the basis
of the same information as the âexpenseâ component described under âUnderwritten Net Cash Flowâ
below.
Â 
To the extent available, selected historical
income, expenses and net income associated with the operation of the related Mortgaged Property securing each Mortgage Loan appear
in each cash flow summary contained in AnnexÂ A-3 to this prospectus. Such information is one of the sources (but not the only
source) of information on which calculations of Underwritten Net Cash Flow are based. The historical information presented is derived
from audited and/or unaudited financial statements provided by the borrowers. The historical information in the cash flow summaries
reflects adjustments made by the mortgage loan seller to exclude certain items contained in the related financial statements that
were not considered in calculating Underwritten Net Cash Flow and is presented in a different format from the financial statements
to show a comparison to the Underwritten Net Cash Flow. In general, solely for purposes of the presentation of historical financial
information, the amount set forth under the caption âgross incomeâ consists of the âtotal revenuesâ set
forth in the applicable financial statements (including (as and to the extent stated) rental revenues, tenant reimbursements and
recovery income (and, in the case of hospitality properties and certain other property types, parking income, telephone income,
food and beverage income, laundry income and other income), with adjustments to exclude amounts recognized on the financial statements
under a straight-line method of recognizing rental income (including increases in minimum rents and rent abatements) from operating
leases over their lives and items indicated as extraordinary or one-time revenue collections or considered nonrecurring in property
operations. The amount set forth under the caption âexpensesâ in the historical financial information consists of the
total expenses set forth in the applicable financial statements, with adjustments to exclude allocated parent company expenses,
restructuring charges and charges associated with employee severance and termination benefits, interest expenses paid to company
affiliates or unrelated third parties, charges for depreciation and amortization and items indicated as extraordinary or one-time
losses or considered nonrecurring in property operations.
Â 


143
Â 
Â 
The selected historical information presented
in the cash flow summaries is derived from audited and/or unaudited financial statements furnished by the respective borrowers
which have not been verified by the Depositor, any underwriters, the mortgage loan sellers or any other person. Audits or other
verification of such financial statements could result in changes thereto, which could in turn result in the historical net income
presented herein being overstated or understated.
Â 
âCut-off Date Balanceâ
of any Mortgage Loan, will be the unpaid principal balance of that Mortgage Loan, as of the Cut-off Date for such Mortgage Loan,
after application of all payments due on or before that date, whether or not received.
Â 
An âLTV Ratioâ for any
Mortgage Loan, as of any date of determination, is a fraction, expressed as a percentage, the numerator of which is the scheduled
principal balance of the Mortgage Loan as of that date (assuming no defaults or prepayments on the Mortgage Loan prior to that
date), and the denominator of which is the âas isâ Appraised Value as determined by an appraisal of the Mortgaged Property
obtained at or about the time of the origination of the related Mortgage Loan (or, in the case of the Mortgage Loans identified
as Harbor Pointe Apartments, Anchorage Marriott Downtown, Aloft Nashville West End and Westgate Shopping Center on AnnexÂ A-1
to this prospectus and as shown in the table below, the âas-completeâ or âas-stabilized value).

  of DecemberÂ 15, 2015.
Â 

(2)Reflects an appraisal
  on an âas-stabilizedâ basis, subject to an anticipated stabilization date
  of September 1, 2017.
Â 

(3)Reflects an appraisal
  on an âas-completeâ basis, based upon a projected completion date of October
9, 2015 for the $2,100,000 of property improvement plan renovations and capital improvements
  which are anticipated to be performed at the related Mortgaged Property. The actual anticipated
  completion date of such renovations and capital improvements is the first half of 2016.
  The appraisal also provides a hypothetical âwhen-stabilizedâ value for the
  Mortgaged Property of $44,200,000 as of NovemberÂ 1, 2017. The appraised values and
  LTV Ratios used in this prospectus for such Mortgage Loan are (or are based on) the âas-completeâ
  value, except where otherwise expressly specified.
Â 

(4)Reflects an appraisal
  on an âas-completed/as-stabilizedâ basis, subject to an anticipated stabilization
  date of JulyÂ 1, 2016.
Â 
In the case of the Mortgage Loan identified
as Heritage Industrial Portfolio on AnnexÂ A-1 to this prospectus, the âas-isâ appraised value reflects a premium
attributed to the value of the related Mortgaged Properties as a whole. The sum of the individual appraised values of each of the
related Mortgaged Properties is $108,500,000, which results in a Cut-Off Date LTV Ratio of 75.0%.
Â 
In the event that a Mortgage Loan comprises
a portion of a cross-collateralized group of Mortgage Loans, the related LTV Ratio is the fraction, expressed as a percentage,
the numerator of which is the scheduled principal balance of all the Mortgage Loans in the
Â 

144
Â 
Â 
cross-collateralized group and the denominator
of which is the aggregate of the Appraised Values of all the Mortgaged Properties related to the cross-collateralized group. The
LTV Ratio as of the related maturity date or, if applicable, the Anticipated Repayment Date, set forth in AnnexÂ A-2 was calculated
based on the principal balance of the related Mortgage Loan on the related maturity date or Anticipated Repayment Date, as the
case may be, assuming all principal payments required to be made on or prior to the related maturity date or, if applicable, the
Anticipated Repayment Date (in either case, not including the balloon payment) are made. In addition, because it is based on the
value of a Mortgaged Property determined as of loan origination, the information set forth in this prospectus in AnnexÂ A-1
and in AnnexÂ A-2 is not necessarily a reliable measure of the related borrowerâs current equity in each Mortgaged Property.
In a declining real estate market, the appraised value of a Mortgaged Property could have decreased from the appraised value determined
at origination and the current actual LTV Ratio of a Mortgage Loan and the LTV Ratio at maturity or anticipated repayment date
may be higher than its LTV Ratio at origination even after taking into account amortization since origination. See âRisk
FactorsâRisks Relating to the Mortgage LoansâAppraisals May Not Reflect Current or Future Market Value of Each Propertyâ.
Â 
The characteristics described above and
in AnnexÂ A-2, along with certain additional characteristics of the Mortgage Loans presented on a loan-by-loan basis, are set
forth in AnnexÂ A-1.
Â 
âCut-off Date Loan-to-Value Ratioâ
or âCut-off Date LTV Ratioâ generally means the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the Cut-off Date Balance
of a Mortgage Loan to the Appraised Value of the related Mortgaged Property or Properties determined as described under ââAppraised
Valueâ in this prospectus. See also the footnotes to AnnexÂ A-1 in this prospectus. Because the Appraised Values
of the Mortgaged Properties were determined prior to origination, the information set forth in this prospectus, including the Annexes
hereto, is not necessarily a reliable measure of property value or the related borrowerâs current equity in each Mortgaged
Property. In a declining real estate market, the appraised value of a Mortgaged Property may have decreased from the appraised
value determined at origination and the current actual cut-off date loan-to-value ratio of a Mortgage Loan may be higher than the
Cut-off Date LTV Ratio that we present in this prospectus, even after taking into account any amortization since origination. No
representation is made that any Appraised Value presented in this prospectus would approximate either the value that would be determined
in a current appraisal of the related Mortgaged Property or the amount that would be realized upon a sale of that property. See
âRisk FactorsâRisks Relating to the Mortgage LoansâAppraisals May Not Reflect Current or Future Market Value
of Each Propertyâ in this prospectus. In the case of a Mortgage Loan that is part of a Whole Loan, such LTV Ratio was
calculated based on the aggregate principal balance of the Pari Passu Mortgage Loan and the related Pari Passu Companion Loan as
of the Cut-off Date. Unless clearly indicated otherwise, the Cut-off Date Loan-to-Value Ratio for each of the Mortgage Loans that
is part of any group of cross-collateralized Mortgage Loans is calculated on the basis of the aggregate Cut-off Date Balance of
all those Mortgage Loans and the aggregate Appraised Value of all the related Mortgaged Properties securing the group. On an individual
basis, without regard to the cross-collateralization feature, any particular Mortgage Loan that is part of a group of cross-collateralized
Mortgage Loans may have a higher (and perhaps substantially higher) Cut-off Date LTV Ratio than is shown on Annex A-1 to this prospectus.
Â 
âDebt Service Coverage Ratioâ,
âDSCRâ, âUnderwritten Debt Service Coverage Ratioâ âU/W NCF DSCRâ or âU/W
DSCRâ generally means the ratio of the Underwritten Net Cash
Â 

145
Â 
Â 
Flow for the related Mortgaged Property or Mortgaged Properties
to the Annual Debt Service as shown on AnnexÂ A-1 to this prospectus.
Â 
In the case of a Mortgage Loan that is part
of a Whole Loan, such debt service coverage ratio was calculated based on the aggregate Annual Debt Service of the Pari Passu Mortgage
Loan and the related Pari Passu Companion Loan.
Â 
Unless clearly indicated otherwise, the
Underwritten Debt Service Coverage Ratio for each of the Mortgage Loans that is part of any group of cross-collateralized Mortgage
Loans is calculated on the basis of the aggregate Underwritten Net Cash Flow generated by all the Mortgaged Properties securing
the group and the aggregate Annual Debt Service payable under all of those Mortgage Loans. On an individual basis, without regard
to the cross-collateralization feature, any particular Mortgage Loan that is part of a group of cross-collateralized Mortgage Loans
may have a lower (and perhaps substantially lower) Underwritten Debt Service Coverage Ratio than is shown on Annex A-1 to this
prospectus.
Â 
In general, debt service coverage ratios
are used by income property lenders to measure the ratio of (a)Â cash currently generated by a property or expected to be generated
by a property based upon executed leases that is available for debt service to (b)Â required debt service payments. However,
debt service coverage ratios only measure the current, or recent, ability of a property to service mortgage debt. If a property
does not possess a stable operating expectancy (for instance, if it is subject to material leases that are scheduled to expire
during the loan term and that provide for above-market rents and/or that may be difficult to replace), a debt service coverage
ratio may not be a reliable indicator of a propertyâs ability to service the mortgage debt over the entire remaining loan
term. See âUnderwritten Net Cash Flowâ below.
Â 
The Underwritten Debt Service Coverage Ratios
presented in this prospectus appear for illustrative purposes only and, as discussed above, are limited in their usefulness in
assessing the current, or predicting the future, ability of a Mortgaged Property or Mortgaged Properties to generate sufficient
cash flow to repay the related Mortgage Loan. No representation is made that the Underwritten Debt Service Coverage Ratios presented
in this prospectus accurately reflect that ability.
Â 
âGLAâ means gross leasable
area.
Â 
âIn-Place Cash Managementâ
means, for funds directed into a lockbox, such funds are generally not made immediately available to the related borrower, but
instead are forwarded to a cash management account controlled by the lender and the funds are disbursed according to the related
Mortgage Loan documents with any excess remitted to the related borrower (unless an event of default under the Mortgage Loan documents
or one or more specified trigger events have occurred and are outstanding) generally on a daily basis.
Â 
âLoan Per Unitâ means
the principal balance per unit of measure (as applicable) as of the Cut-off Date. With respect to any Mortgage Loan that is part
of a split loan structure, the Loan Per Unit is calculated with regard to both the related Pari Passu Companion Loan and the related
Mortgage Loan included in the issuing entity, unless otherwise indicated. With respect to any Mortgage Loan contained in any group
of cross-collateralized Mortgage Loans, the Loan Per Unit is calculated on the basis of the aggregate principal balances of all
Mortgage Loans comprising such group.
Â 
âLTV Ratio at Maturity or ARDâ,
âLTV Ratio at Maturity or Anticipated Repayment Dateâ and âBalloon or ARD LTV Ratioâ generally
means the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of
Â 

146
Â 
Â 
(a)Â the principal balance of a balloon Mortgage Loan scheduled to be outstanding
on the stated maturity date (or, in the case of an ARD Loan, scheduled to be outstanding on the Anticipated Repayment Date), assuming
(among other things) no prepayments or defaults, to (b)Â the Appraised Value of the related Mortgaged Property or Mortgaged
Properties determined as described under ââAppraised Valueâ. Each Mortgage Loan requires that a regular
monthly debt service payment be made on the stated maturity date or Anticipated Repayment Date, as applicable, and accordingly
the principal balance referenced in clauseÂ (a) of the immediately preceding sentence will be net of the principal portion,
if any, of the monthly debt service payment due on such date. Because the Appraised Values of the Mortgaged Properties were determined
prior to origination, the information set forth in this prospectus, including the Annexes hereto, is not necessarily a reliable
measure of the related borrowerâs current equity in each Mortgaged Property. In a declining real estate market, the appraised
value of a Mortgaged Property may have decreased from the appraised value determined at origination and the actual loan-to-value
ratio at maturity of a Mortgage Loan may be higher than the LTV Ratio at Maturity or ARD that we present in this prospectus. See
âRisk FactorsâRisks Relating to the Mortgage LoansâAppraisals May Not Reflect Current or Future Market Value
of Each Propertyâ in this prospectus. In the case of each Mortgage Loan that is part of a Whole Loan, unless otherwise
indicated, such loan-to-value ratio was calculated based on the aggregate principal balance that will be due at maturity with respect
to such Pari Passu Mortgage Loan and the related Pari Passu Companion Loan. Unless clearly indicated otherwise, the LTV Ratio at
Maturity or ARD for each of the Mortgage Loans that is part of any group of cross-collateralized Mortgage Loans is calculated on
the basis of the aggregate principal balance of all those Mortgage Loans scheduled to be outstanding on the stated maturity date,
assuming (among other things) no prepayments or defaults, and the aggregate Appraised Value of all the related Mortgaged Properties
securing the group. On an individual basis, without regard to the cross-collateralization feature, any particular Mortgage Loan
that is part of a group of cross-collateralized Mortgage Loans may have a higher (and perhaps, substantially higher) LTV Ratio
at Maturity or ARD than is shown on Annex A-1 to this prospectus.
Â 
âMaturity Date Balloon or ARD Paymentâ
or âBalloon or ARD Paymentâ means, for any balloon Mortgage Loan or ARD Loan, the payment of principal due upon
its stated maturity date or Anticipated Repayment Date. Each Mortgage Loan requires that a regular monthly debt service payment
be made on the stated maturity date or Anticipated Repayment Date, as applicable, and accordingly the payment of principal referenced
in the immediately preceding sentence will be net of the principal portion, if any, of the monthly debt service payment due on
such date.
Â 
âNet Operating Incomeâ
generally means, for any given period (ending on the âNOI Dateâ), the total operating revenues derived from
a Mortgaged Property during that period, minus the total operating expenses incurred in respect of that Mortgaged Property during
that period other than:
Â 

Â·non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization,
Â 

Â·capital expenditures, and
Â 

Â·debt service on the related Mortgage Loan or on any other loans that are secured by that Mortgaged Property.
Â 
âNRAâ means net rentable
area.
Â 
âOccupancy Rateâ means
(i)Â in the case of multifamily rental properties (other than residential cooperative properties) and manufactured housing
community properties, the
Â 

147
Â 
Â 
percentage of rental units or pads, as applicable, that are rented (generally without regard to the length
of the lease or rental period) as of the date of determination; (ii)Â in the case of office, retail and industrial/warehouse
properties, the percentage of the net rentable square footage rented as of the date of determination (subject to, in the case of
certain Mortgage Loans, one or more of the additional lease-up assumptions); (iii)Â in the case of hospitality properties,
the percentage of available rooms occupied for the trailing 12-month period ending on the date of determination; (iv)Â in the
case of self storage facilities, either the percentage of the net rentable square footage rented or the percentage of units rented
as of the date of determination, depending on borrower reporting; and (v)Â in the case of residential cooperative properties,
the property vacancy assumption reflected in the related appraisal for purposes of determining the appraised value of the related
Mortgaged Property as a multifamily rental property (i.e., the âCoop-Rental Valueâ reflected in AnnexÂ A-1
to this prospectus); such vacancy assumption for residential cooperative properties does not reflect actual occupancy. In the case
of some of the Mortgage Loans, the calculation of Occupancy Rate for one or more related properties was based on assumptions regarding
occupancy, such as: the assumption that a particular tenant at the subject Mortgaged Property that has executed a lease, but has
not yet taken occupancy and/or has not yet commenced paying rent, will take occupancy on a future date generally expected to occur
within 12Â months of the Cut-off Date; assumptions regarding the renewal of particular leases and/or the re-leasing of certain
space at the subject Mortgaged Property; and certain additional lease-up assumptions as may be described in the footnotes to AnnexÂ A-1
to this prospectus.
Â 
âOccupancy As Of Dateâ
means the date of determination of the Occupancy Rate of a Mortgaged Property. With respect to a residential cooperative mortgage
loan, the Occupancy As Of Date is the date of the related appraisal from which the Occupancy Rate is derived.
Â 
âPrepayment Provisionsâ
denotes a general summary of the provisions of a Mortgage Loan that restrict the ability of the related borrower to voluntarily
prepay the Mortgage Loan. In each case, some exceptions may apply that are not described in the general summary, such as provisions
that permit a voluntary partial prepayment in connection with the release of a portion of a Mortgaged Property, or require the
application of tenant holdback reserves to a partial prepayment, in each case notwithstanding any lockout period or yield maintenance
charge that may otherwise apply. In describing Prepayment Provisions, we use the following symbols with the indicated meanings:
Â 

Â·âD(#)âmeans, with respect to any Mortgage Loan, a specified number of monthly payment periods (which number
is denoted by a numeric value #) during which voluntary prepayments of principal are prohibited, but the related borrower is permitted
to defease that Mortgage Loan in order to obtain a release of the related Mortgaged Property.
Â 

Â·âL(#)âmeans, with respect to any Mortgage Loan, a specified number of monthly payment periods (which number
is denoted by a numeric value #) during which voluntary prepayments of principal are prohibited and defeasance is not permitted.
Â 

Â·âO(#)âmeans, with respect to any Mortgage Loan, a specified number of monthly payment periods (which number
is denoted by a numeric value #) during which prepayments of principal are permitted without the payment of any Prepayment Premium
or Yield Maintenance Charge and the lender is not entitled to require a defeasance in lieu of prepayment.
Â 

Â·âYM(#)âmeans, with respect to any Mortgage Loan, a specified number of monthly payment periods (which number
is denoted by a numeric value #) during which 
Â 


148
Â 
Â 


prepayments of
principal are permitted with the payment of a Yield Maintenance Charge and the lender is not entitled to require a defeasance
in lieu of prepayment.
Â 

Â·âD or @%(#)â means, with respect to any Mortgage Loan, a specified number of monthly payment periods (which
number is denoted by a numeric value #) during which the related borrower is permitted to defease that Mortgage Loan in order to
obtain a release of the related Mortgaged Property and during which prepayments of principal are permitted with the payment of
a Prepayment Premium (equal to @% of the prepaid amount).
Â 

Â·âD or YM(#)âmeans, with respect to any Mortgage Loan, a specified number of monthly payment periods (which
number is denoted by a numeric value #) during which the related borrower is permitted to defease that Mortgage Loan in order to
obtain a release of the related Mortgaged Property and during which prepayments of principal are permitted with the payment of
a Yield Maintenance Charge.
Â 

Â·âD or GRTR of @% or YM(#)âmeans, with respect to any Mortgage Loan, a specified number of monthly payment
periods (which number is denoted by a numeric value #) during which the related borrower is permitted to defease that Mortgage
Loan in order to obtain a release of the related Mortgaged Property and during which prepayments of principal are permitted with
the payment of the greater of a Yield Maintenance Charge and a Prepayment Premium (equal to @% of the prepaid amount).
Â 

Â·âGRTR of @% or YM(#)âmeans, with respect to any Mortgage Loan, a specified number of monthly payment periods
(which number is denoted by a numeric value #) during which prepayments of principal are permitted with the payment of the greater
of a Yield Maintenance Charge and a Prepayment Premium (equal to @% of the prepaid amount) and the lender is not entitled to require
a defeasance in lieu of prepayment.
Â 
âRemaining Term to Maturity or
ARDâ means, with respect to any Mortgage Loan, the number of months from the Cut-off Date to the related stated maturity
date or Anticipated Repayment Date.
Â 
âRevPARâ means, with
respect to any hotel property, revenue per available room.
Â 
âSquare Feetâ, âSFâ
or âSq. Ft.â means, in the case of a Mortgaged Property operated as a retail center, office, industrial/warehouse
facility, combination retail/office or other single purpose property, the square footage of the net rentable or leasable area.
Â 
âT-12â and âTTMâ
each means trailing 12 months.
Â 
âTerm to Maturityâ means,
with respect to any Mortgage Loan, the remaining term, in months, from the Cut-off Date for such Mortgage Loan to the related maturity
date or, in the case of an ARD Loan, the related Anticipated Repayment Date, as applicable. AnnexÂ A-1 indicates which Mortgage
Loans are ARD Loans.
Â 
âUnderwritten Expensesâ
or âU/W Expensesâ means, with respect to any Mortgage Loan or Mortgaged Property, an estimate of (a) operating
expenses (such as utilities, administrative expenses, repairs and maintenance, management and franchise fees and advertising);
and (b) estimated fixed expenses (such as insurance, real estate taxes and, if applicable, ground, space or air rights lease payments),
as determined by the related Mortgage Loan seller and generally derived from historical expenses at the Mortgaged Property, the
borrowerâs budget or appraiserâs estimate, in some cases adjusted for
Â 

149
Â 
Â 
significant occupancy increases and a market
rate management fee and subject to certain assumptions and subjective judgments of each Mortgage Loan seller as described under
the definition of âUnderwritten Net Operating Incomeâ above.
Â 
âUnderwritten Net Cash Flowâ,
âUnderwritten NCFâ or âU/W NCFâ means an amount based on assumptions relating to cash flow
available for debt service. In general, it is the Underwritten Net Operating Income less all reserves for capital expenditures,
including tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions. Underwritten Net Cash Flow generally does not reflect interest expenses,
non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization and other non-reoccurring expenses.
Â 
In determining the ârevenueâ
component of Underwritten Net Cash Flow for each Mortgaged Property (other than a residential cooperative property), the related
mortgage loan seller generally relied on a rent roll and/or other known, signed tenant leases, executed extension options, property
financial statements, estimates in the related appraisal, or other indications of anticipated income (generally supported by market
considerations, cash reserves or letters of credit) supplied by the related borrower and, where the actual vacancy shown thereon
and, if available, the market vacancy was less than 5%, assumed a minimum 5% vacancy in determining revenue from rents (in certain
cases, inclusive of rents under master leases with an affiliate of the borrower that relate to space not used or occupied by the
master lease tenant, or, in the case of a hotel property, room rent, food and beverage revenues and other hotel property income),
except that in the case of certain non-multifamily and non-manufactured housing community properties, space occupied by such anchor
or single tenants or other large creditworthy tenants may have been disregarded (or a rate of less than 5% has been assumed) in
performing the vacancy adjustment due to the length of the related leases or creditworthiness of such tenants. Where the actual
or market vacancy was greater than 5%, the mortgage loan seller determined revenue from rents (in certain cases, inclusive of rents
under master leases with an affiliate of the borrower that relate to space not used or occupied by the master lease tenant, or,
in the case of a hotel property, room rent, food and beverage revenues and other hotel property income) by generally relying on
a rent roll and/or other known, signed leases, executed lease extension options, property financial statements, estimates in the
related appraisal, or other indications of anticipated income (generally supported by market considerations, cash reserves or letters
of credit) supplied and generally (but not in all cases) the greatest of (a)Â actual current vacancy at the related Mortgaged
Property or a vacancy otherwise based on performance of the related Mortgaged Property (e.g., an economic vacancy based
on actual collections for a specified trailing period), (b)Â if available, current vacancy according to third-party-provided
market information or at comparable properties in the same or similar market as the related Mortgaged Property, subject to adjustment
to address special considerations (such as where market vacancy may have been ignored with respect to space covered by long-term
leases or because it was deemed inapplicable by reason of, among other things, below market rents at or unique characteristics
of the subject Mortgaged Property) and/or to reflect the appraiserâs conclusion of a supportable or stabilized occupancy
rate, and (c)Â subject to the discussion above, 5%. In some cases involving a multi-property Mortgage Loan, the foregoing vacancy
assumptions may be applied to the portfolio of the related Mortgaged Properties in the entirety, but may not apply to each related
Mortgaged Property. In addition, for some Mortgaged Properties, the actual vacancy may reflect the average vacancy over the course
of a year (or trailing 12-month period). In determining revenue for multifamily, manufactured housing community and self storage
properties, the mortgage loan sellers generally reviewed rental revenue shown on the rolling one-to-twelve month (or some combination
thereof) operating statements or annualized the rental revenue and reimbursement of expenses shown on rent rolls or operating statements
with respect to the
Â 

150
Â 
Â 
prior one-to-twelve-month periods. In the case of hospitality
properties, gross receipts were generally determined based upon the average occupancy not to exceed 80% and daily rates based
on third-party-provided market information or average daily rates achieved during the prior one-to-three year annual reporting
period.
Â 
In
determining the âexpenseâ component of Underwritten Net Cash Flow for each Mortgaged Property, the related mortgage
loan seller generally relied on, to the extent available, historical operating statements, full-year or year-to-date financial
statements, rolling 12-month operating statements, year-to-date financial statements and/or budgets supplied by the related borrower,
as well as estimates in the related appraisal, except that: (i)Â if tax or insurance expense information more current than
that reflected in the financial statements was available and verified, the newer information was generally used; (ii)Â property
management fees were generally assumed to be 1% to 6% (depending on the property type) of effective gross revenue (or, in the
case of a hospitality property, gross receipts); (iii)Â in general, depending on the property type, assumptions were made
with respect to the average amount of reserves for leasing commissions, tenant improvement expenses and capital expenditures;
(iv)Â expenses were assumed to include annual replacement reserves; and (v)Â recent changes in circumstances at the Mortgaged
Properties were taken into account (for example, physical changes that would be expected to reduce utilities costs). Annual replacement
reserves were generally underwritten to the suggested replacement reserve amount from an independent, third-party property condition
or engineering report, or minimum requirements by property type designated by the mortgage loan seller, and are: (a)Â in the
case of retail, office, self storage and industrial/warehouse properties, generally not more than $0.40 per square foot of net
rentable commercial area (and may be zero); (b)Â in the case of multifamily rental apartments, generally not more than approximately
$400 per residential unit per year, depending on the condition of the property (and may be zero); (c)Â in the case of manufactured
housing community properties, generally not more than approximately $80 per pad per year, depending on the condition of the property
(and may be zero); and (d)Â in the case of hospitality properties, generally 4% to 5%, inclusive, of gross revenues (and may
be zero). In addition, in some cases, the mortgage loan seller recharacterized as capital expenditures items that are reported
by borrowers as operating expenses (thus increasing the ânet cash flowâ).
Â 
Historical
operating results may not be available for Mortgaged Properties with newly constructed improvements, Mortgaged Properties with
triple-net leases, Mortgaged Properties that have recently undergone substantial renovations and newly acquired Mortgaged Properties.
In such cases, items of revenue and expense used in calculating Underwritten Net Cash Flow were generally derived from rent rolls,
estimates set forth in the related appraisal, leases with tenants, other third-party-provided market information or from other
borrower-supplied information. We cannot assure you with respect to the accuracy of the information provided by any borrowers,
or the adequacy of the procedures used by the related mortgage loan seller in determining the presented operating information.
Â 
For
purposes of calculating Underwritten Net Cash Flow for Mortgage Loans where leases have been executed by one or more affiliates
of the borrower, the rents under some of such leases, if applicable, have been adjusted downward to reflect market rents for similar
properties if the rent actually paid under the lease was significantly higher than the market rent for similar properties.
Â 
The
amounts described as revenue and expense above are often highly subjective values. In the case of some of the Mortgage Loans,
the calculation of Underwritten Net Cash Flow for the related Mortgaged Properties was based on assumptions regarding projected
rental income, expenses and/or occupancy, including, without limitation, one or more of the
Â 


151
Â 
Â 
following: (i)Â the assumption
that a particular tenant at a Mortgaged Property that has executed a lease or letter of intent, but has not yet taken occupancy
and/or has not yet commenced paying rent, will take occupancy and commence paying rent on a future date generally expected to
occur within 12Â months of the cut-off date; (ii)Â the assumption that certain rental income that is to be payable commencing
on a future date under a signed lease, but where the subject tenant is in an initial rent abatement or free rent period, will
be paid commencing on such future date; (iii)Â assumptions regarding the probability of renewal or extension of particular
leases and/or the re-leasing of certain space at a Mortgaged Property and the anticipated effect on capital and re-leasing expenditures;
(iv)Â assumptions regarding the costs and expenses, including leasing commissions and tenant improvements, associated with
leasing vacant space or releasing occupied space at a future date; and (v)Â assumptions regarding future increases or decreases
in expenses, or whether certain expenses are capital expenses or should be treated as expenses which are not recurring. In addition,
in the case of some commercial properties, the underwritten revenues were adjusted upward to account for a portion or average
of the additional rents provided for under any rent step-ups scheduled to occur over the terms of the executed leases. We cannot
assure you that the assumptions made with respect to any Mortgage Loan will, in fact, be consistent with actual property performance.
Actual annual net cash flow for a Mortgaged Property may be less than the Underwritten Net Cash Flow presented with respect to
that property in this prospectus. In addition, the underwriting analysis of any particular Mortgage Loan as described herein by
a particular Mortgage Loan seller may not conform to an analysis of the same property by other persons or entities.
Â 
See
âRisk FactorsâRisks Relating to the Mortgage LoansâUnderwritten Net Cash Flow Could Be Based On Incorrect
or Failed Assumptionsâ in this prospectus. See also AnnexÂ A-1 and the footnotes thereto.
Â 
The
âUnderwritten Net Cash Flow Debt Service Coverage Ratioâ
or âU/W NCF DSCRâ for any Mortgage Loan for any period, as presented in this prospectus, including the tables
presented on AnnexÂ A-1 and AnnexÂ A-2 attached hereto, is the ratio of Underwritten Net Cash Flow calculated for the
related Mortgaged Property to the amount of total Annual Debt Service on such Mortgage Loan except that the Underwritten Net Cash
Flow Debt Service Coverage Ratios for all partial interest-only loans, if any, was calculated based on the first principal and
interest payment required to be made to the issuing entity during the term of the Mortgage Loan. However, in the case of a Mortgage
Loan that is part of a Whole Loan, unless otherwise indicated, such debt service coverage ratio was calculated based on the aggregate
Annual Debt Service of the Pari Passu Mortgage Loan and each related Pari Passu Companion Loan as of the Cut-off Date. The Underwritten
Net Cash Flow Debt Service Coverage Ratio for all interest-only loans were calculated based on the sum of the first 12 interest
payments following the Cut-off Date. Unless clearly indicated otherwise, the Underwritten Net Cash Flow Debt Service Coverage
Ratio for each Mortgage Loan that is part of any group of cross-collateralized Mortgage Loans is equal to the Underwritten NCF
of all the Mortgaged Properties securing the group divided by the aggregate Annual Debt Service of all the Mortgage Loans in the
group. On an individual basis, without regard to the cross-collateralization feature, any particular Mortgage Loan that is part
of a group of cross-collateralized Mortgage Loans may have a lower (and perhaps substantially lower) Underwritten Net Cash Flow
Debt Service Coverage Ratio than is shown on AnnexÂ A-1 to this prospectus.
Â 
âUnderwritten
NCF Debt Yieldâ or âU/W NCF Debt Yieldâ
generally means, with respect to any Mortgage Loan, the related Underwritten NCF divided by the Cut-off Date Balance of
that Mortgage Loan. However, in the case of a Mortgage Loan that is part of a Whole Loan, unless otherwise indicated, such debt
yield was calculated based on the aggregate principal
Â 


152
Â 
Â 
balance of the Pari Passu Mortgage Loan and each related Pari Passu Companion
Loan as of the Cut-off Date. Unless clearly indicated otherwise, the Underwritten NCF Debt Yield for each Mortgage Loan that is
part of any group of cross-collateralized Mortgage Loans is equal to the Underwritten NCF of all the Mortgaged Properties securing
the group divided by the aggregate Initial Pool Balance of all the Mortgage Loans in the group. On an individual basis, without
regard to the cross-collateralization feature, any particular Mortgage Loan that is part of a group of cross-collateralized Mortgage
Loans may have a lower (and perhaps substantially lower) Underwritten NCF Debt Yield than is shown on Annex A-1 to this prospectus.
Â 
No
Mortgage Loan included in the Trust has an Underwritten NCF Debt Yield calculated based on the related Cut-off Date Balance less
a related earnout or holdback reserve.
Â 
âUnderwritten
Net Operating Incomeâ, âUnderwritten NOIâ
or âU/W NOIâ means an amount based on assumptions of the cash flow available for debt service before deductions
for capital expenditures, including replacement reserves, tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions. In general, Underwritten
Net Operating Income is the assumed revenue derived from the use and operation of a Mortgaged Property, consisting primarily of
rental income, less the sum of (a)Â assumed operating expenses (such as utilities, administrative expenses, repairs and maintenance,
management fees and advertising) and (b)Â fixed expenses, such as insurance, real estate taxes and, if applicable, ground
lease payments. Underwritten Net Operating Income is generally estimated in the same manner as Underwritten Net Cash Flow, except
that no deduction is made for capital expenditures, including replacement reserves, tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions.
See âRisk FactorsâRisks Relating to the Mortgage LoansâUnderwritten Net Cash Flow Could Be Based On Incorrect
or Failed Assumptionsâ in this prospectus.
Â 
The
âUnderwritten Net Operating Income Debt Service Coverage
Ratioâ or âU/W NOI DSCRâ for any Mortgage Loan for any period, as presented in this prospectus, including
the tables presented on AnnexÂ A-1 and AnnexÂ A-2, is the ratio of Underwritten NOI calculated for the related Mortgaged
Property to the amount of total Annual Debt Service on such Mortgage Loan except that the Underwritten Net Operating Income Debt
Service Coverage Ratio for all partial interest-only loans, if any, was calculated based on the first principal and interest payment
required to be made to the issuing entity during the term of the Mortgage Loan. However, in the case of a Mortgage Loan that is
part of a Whole Loan, unless otherwise indicated, such debt service coverage ratio was calculated based on the aggregate Annual
Debt Service of the Pari Passu Mortgage Loan and each related Pari Passu Companion Loan as of the Cut-off Date. The Underwritten
Net Operating Income Debt Service Coverage Ratios for all interest-only Mortgage Loans were calculated based on the sum of the
first 12 interest payments following the Cut-off Date. Unless clearly indicated otherwise and as set forth below, the Underwritten
Net Operating Income Debt Service Coverage Ratio for each Mortgage Loan that is part of any group of cross-collateralized Mortgage
Loans is equal to the Underwritten NOI of all the Mortgaged Properties securing the group divided by the aggregate Annual Debt
Service of all the Mortgage Loans in the group. On an individual basis, without regard to the cross-collateralization feature,
any particular Mortgage Loan that is part of a group of cross-collateralized Mortgage Loans may have a lower (and perhaps substantially
lower) Underwritten Net Operating Income Debt Service Coverage Ratio than is shown on AnnexÂ A-1 to this prospectus.
Â 
âUnderwritten
NOI Debt Yieldâ or âU/W NOI Debt Yieldâ
means, with respect to any Mortgage Loan, the related Underwritten NOI divided by the Cut-off Date Balance of that Mortgage
Loan. In the case of a Mortgage Loan that is part of a Whole Loan, unless otherwise indicated, such debt yield was calculated
based on the aggregate principal balance of the Pari Passu Mortgage Loan and the related Pari Passu Companion Loan as of
Â 


153
Â 
Â 
the cut-off
date. Unless clearly indicated otherwise and as set forth below, the Underwritten NOI Debt Yield for each Mortgage Loan that is
part of any group of cross-collateralized Mortgage Loans is equal to the Underwritten NOI of all the Mortgaged Properties securing
the group divided by the aggregate Cut-off Date Balance of all the Mortgage Loans in the group. On an individual basis, without
regard to the cross-collateralization feature, any particular Mortgage Loan that is part of a group of cross-collateralized Mortgage
Loans may have a lower (and perhaps substantially lower) Underwritten NOI Debt Yield than is shown on Annex A-1 to this prospectus.
Â 
âUnderwritten
Revenuesâ or âU/W Revenuesâ with respect
to any Mortgage Loan means the gross potential rent (in certain cases, inclusive of rents under master leases with an affiliate
of the borrower that relate to space not used or occupied by the master lease tenant, or, in the case of a hotel property, room
rent, food and beverage revenues and other hotel property income), subject to the assumptions and subjective judgments of each
mortgage loan seller as described under the definition of âUnderwritten Net Operating Incomeâ above.
Â 
âUnitsâ,
âRoomsâ, âBedsâ or âPadsâ means (a) in the case of a Mortgaged Property
operated as multifamily housing, the number of apartments, regardless of the size of or number of rooms in such apartment, (b)
in the case of a Mortgaged Property operated as a hotel property, the number of guest rooms, or (c) in the case of a Mortgaged
Property operated as a manufactured housing community property, the number of pads for manufactured homes.
Â 
âWeighted
Average Mortgage Rateâ means the weighted average of
the Mortgage Rates as of the Cut-off Date.
Â 
You
should review the footnotes to AnnexÂ A-1 in this prospectus for information regarding certain other loan-specific adjustments
regarding the calculation of debt service coverage ratio information, loan-to-value ratio information, debt yield information
and/or loan per net rentable square foot or unit with respect to certain of the Mortgage Loans.
Â 
Except
as otherwise specifically stated, the Cut-off Date LTV Ratio, Underwritten Debt Service Coverage Ratio, LTV Ratio at Maturity
or ARD, Underwritten NCF Debt Yield, Underwritten NOI Debt Yield and loan per net rentable square foot or unit statistics with
respect to each Mortgage Loan are calculated and presented without regard to any indebtedness other than the Mortgage Loan, whether
or not secured by the related Mortgaged Property, ownership interests in the related borrower or otherwise, that currently exists
or that may be incurred by the related borrower or its owners in the future.
Â 
References
to âweighted averagesâ of the Mortgage Loans in the Mortgage Pool or any particular sub-group of the mortgage loans
are references to averages weighted on the basis of the Cut-off Date Balances of the subject Mortgage Loans.
Â 
If
we present a debt rating for some tenants and not others in the tables, you should assume that the other tenants are not rated
and/or have below-investment grade ratings. If a tenant has a rated parent or affiliate, we present the rating of that parent
or affiliate, notwithstanding that the parent or affiliate may itself have no obligations under the lease. Presentation of a rating
opposite a tenant should not be construed as a statement that the relevant tenant will perform or be able to perform its obligations.
Â 
The
sum in any column of any of the tables in AnnexÂ A-2 may not equal the indicated total due to rounding.

In the case of four (4) mortgaged properties identified as Harbor
  Pointe Apartments, Anchorage Marriott Downtown, Aloft Nashville West End and Westgate Shopping Center on AnnexÂ A-1 to
  this prospectus, securing or partially securing four (4) mortgage loans representing approximately 13.4% of the Initial Pool
  Balance, the loan-to-value ratio was calculated based upon a hypothetical valuation other than an âas-isâ value.
  The loan-to-value ratios of the remaining mortgage loans were calculated using âas-isâ values as described under
  ââCertain Calculations and Definitionsâ above. In the case of the Mortgage Loan identified as Heritage
  Industrial Portfolio on AnnexÂ A-1 to this prospectus, the âas-isâ appraised value reflects a premium attributed
  to the value of the related Mortgaged Properties as a whole. For further information, see AnnexÂ A-1 to this prospectus.
  See also âRisk FactorsâAppraisals May Not Reflect Current or Future Market Value of Each Propertyâ
  and ââAppraised Valueâ in this prospectus.

Â 


(5)
In the case of the six (6) mortgage loans, collectively representing
  approximately 26.7% of the Initial Pool Balance, each of which has one or more pari passu companion loans that are
  not included in the issuing entity, the debt service coverage ratios, loan-to-value ratios and debt yield have been calculated
  including the related pari passu companion loans. In the case of cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted mortgage
  loans, the debt service coverage ratios, loan-to-value ratios and debt yields have been calculated on an aggregate basis,
  as described in this prospectus. On an individual basis, without regard to the cross-collateralization feature, a related
  mortgage loan may have a higher loan-to-value ratio, lower debt service coverage ratio and/or lower debt yield than is presented
  herein.

Â 


(6)
Debt service coverage ratios are calculated using the average of
  the principal and interest payments for the first twelve payment periods of the mortgage loan following the cut-off date,
  provided that (i)Â in the case of a mortgage loan that provides for interest-only payments through maturity or
  its anticipated repayment date, as applicable, such items are calculated based on the interest payments scheduled to be due
  on the first due date following the cut-off date and the 11 due dates thereafter for such mortgage loan and (ii)Â in the
  case of a mortgage loan that provides for an initial interest-only period that ends prior to maturity or its anticipated repayment
  date, as applicable, and provides for scheduled amortization payments thereafter, such items are calculated based on the monthly
  payment of principal and interest payable for the twelve payment periods immediately following the expiration of the interest-only
  period.

Â 
The
issuing entity will include 10 Mortgage Loans, representing approximately 33.5% of the Initial Pool Balance, that represent the
obligations of multiple borrowers that are liable on a joint and several basis for the repayment of the entire indebtedness evidenced
by the related Mortgage Loan and/or represent separate obligations of each borrower that are cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted
with each other.
Â 
See
also ââCertain Calculations and Definitionsâ above for important general and specific information regarding
the manner of calculation of the underwritten debt service coverage ratios and loan-to-value ratios. See also ââCertain
Terms of the Mortgage Loansâ below for important information relating to certain payment and other terms of the Mortgage
Loans.

In the case of each of the Mortgage Loans that is part of a Whole
  Loan, the calculation of the Loan per Unit, U/W NCF DSCR and Cut-off Date LTV Ratio for each such Mortgage Loan is calculated
  based on the principal balance, debt service payment and Underwritten Net Cash Flow for the Mortgage Loan included in the
  issuing entity and the related Pari Passu Companion Loan in the aggregate.

Â 


(2)
Adler Office and Adler Industrial, which together have a Cut-off
  Date Balance of $57,000,000, are cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted. The Loan per Unit, U/W NCF DSCR and Cut-off Date
  LTV Ratio are based on the ratios for the aggregate indebtedness represented by both Mortgage Loans.

Â 
See
ââAssessment of Property Value and Conditionâ below for additional information.
Â 
For
more information regarding the 15 largest Mortgage Loans or groups of cross-collateralized Mortgage Loans and/or loan concentrations
and related Mortgaged Properties, see the individual Mortgage Loan and portfolio descriptions in AnnexÂ A-3. Other than with
respect to the top 15 Mortgage Loans or groups of cross-collateralized Mortgage Loans identified in the table above, each of the
other Mortgage Loans represents no more than 1.9% of the Initial Pool Balance.

Â 
The
pool of Mortgage Loans will include the Pineapple Hotel Portfolio, Heritage Industrial Portfolio, Harvey Building Products Portfolio
and Amsdell Michigan Pool Mortgage Loans, set forth in the table below entitled âCross-Collateralized/Multi-Property
Mortgage Loansâ, representing approximately 14.8% of the Initial Pool Balance, which are each secured by two or more
properties. The Mortgage Pool also includes the Adler Office and Adler Industrial Mortgage Loans that are cross-collateralized
and cross-defaulted with one another, collectively representing approximately 5.7% of the Initial Pool Balance. See the footnotes
to the table below. In some cases, however, the amount of the mortgage lien encumbering a particular property or group of those
properties may be less than the full amount of indebtedness under the Mortgage Loan, generally to minimize recording tax. In such
instances, the mortgage amount may equal a specified percentage (generally ranging from 100% to 150%, inclusive) of the appraised
value or allocated loan amount for the particular Mortgaged Property. This would limit the extent to which proceeds from that
property would be available to offset declines in value of the other Mortgaged Properties securing the same Mortgage Loan or group
of cross-collateralized Mortgage Loans.

In
some cases, an individual Mortgaged Property may be comprised of two or more parcels that may not be contiguous or may be owned
by separate borrowers. For example:
Â 


Â·
With
  respect to the Mortgage Loan secured by the Mortgaged Property identified as Marley Manor
  Apartments on Annex A-1, representing approximately 1.2% of the Initial Pool Balance,
  the related Mortgaged Property is comprised of two separate parcels, each of which is
  owned by a separate borrower.

Because this table presents information relating to Mortgaged Properties
  and not the Mortgage Loans, the information for any Mortgaged Property that is one of multiple Mortgaged Properties securing
  a particular Mortgage Loan is based on an allocated loan amount as stated in AnnexÂ A-2.

Â 
The
remaining Mortgaged Properties are located throughout 24 other states, with no more than 5.0% of the Initial Pool Balance by allocated
loan amount secured by Mortgaged Properties located in any such jurisdiction.
Â 
In
addition, with respect to the Mortgaged Properties in the Mortgage Pool, we note the following in respect of their geographic
concentration:
Â 


Â·
Sixteen
  (16) Mortgaged Properties securing approximately 24.8% of the Initial Pool Balance by
  allocated loan amount, are located in areas that are considered a high earthquake risk
  (seismic zones 3 or 4), and seismic reports were prepared with respect to these Mortgaged
  Properties, and based on those reports, no Mortgaged Property has a seismic expected
  loss greater than 18.0%.

of the Gulf of Mexico or the Atlantic Ocean, which are more susceptible to hurricanes. See representation and warranty no.Â 16
in AnnexÂ D-1 and the exceptions thereto in AnnexÂ D-2 to this prospectus (subject to the limitations and qualifications
set forth in the preamble in AnnexÂ D-1 to this prospectus).Â 
Â 
Mortgaged
Properties With Limited Prior Operating History
Â 
Sixteen
(16) of the Mortgage Loans representing approximately 25.0% of the Initial Pool Balance, are secured by Mortgaged Properties that
were acquired within the 12-month period preceding the origination of the Mortgage Loan and underwriting was based on a limited
prior operating history and limited historical financial figures and information.
Â 
See

Â 
Six
(6) Mortgaged Properties identified as Rolling Brook Village, Harbor Pointe Apartments, Heritage Industrial Portfolio, Hawthorne
Business Center, Parkway Commons and CSS Lafayette on AnnexÂ A-1, representing 20.5% of the Initial Pool Balance, have one
or more borrowers that own all or a portion of the related Mortgaged Property as tenants-in-common, and the respective tenants-in-common
have agreed to a waiver of their rights of partition. âRisk FactorsâRisks Relating to the Mortgage LoansâThe

Because this table presents information relating to Mortgaged Properties
  and not Mortgage Loans, the information for Mortgage Loans secured by more than one Mortgaged Property is based on allocated
  loan amounts as set forth in AnnexÂ A-2.

Â 


(2)
For purposes of this prospectus, an encumbered interest will be characterized
  as a âfee interestâ and not a leasehold interest if (i)Â the borrower has a fee interest in all or substantially
  all of the Mortgaged Property (provided that if the borrower has a leasehold interest in any portion of the Mortgaged
  Property, such portion is not, individually or in the aggregate, material to the use or operation of the Mortgaged Property),
  or (ii)Â the Mortgage Loan is secured by the borrowerâs leasehold interest in the Mortgaged Property as well as
  the borrowerâs (or other fee ownerâs) overlapping fee interest in the related Mortgaged Property.

Â 


(3)
The related Mortgages create a first lien on a combination of fee
  simple estates and leasehold estates in one or more commercial properties.

Â 


167
Â 
Â 
In
general, unless the related fee interest is also encumbered by the related Mortgage, each of the ground leases has a term that
extends at least 20 years beyond the maturity date of the Mortgage Loan (taking into account all freely exercisable extension
options) and, except as noted below or in the exceptions to representation and warranty no.Â 34 in AnnexÂ D-1 indicated
on AnnexÂ D-2, contains customary mortgagee protection provisions, including notice and cure rights and the right to enter
into a new lease with the applicable ground lessor in the event a ground lease is rejected or terminated. The Mortgaged Property
identified on Annex A-1 to this prospectus as Home Depot Jamaica, which secures a Mortgage Loan representing approximately 2.5%
of the Initial Pool Balance, includes nine parcels of real property, of which three are ground leasehold interests and the remainder
are fee interests. With respect to the three ground leasehold parcels, each has an expiration date (taking into account optional
renewal terms that can be exercised by the borrower or by lender) of 20 years after the maturity date of the related Mortgage
Loan. However, with respect to one such ground leasehold parcel, known as the Kimaqu ground lease, the lender has the right to
exercise optional renewal terms only if there is an event of default under the Kimaqu ground lease.
Â 
Mortgage
loans secured by ground leases present certain bankruptcy and foreclosure risks not present with Mortgage Loans secured by fee
simple estates. See âRisk FactorsâRisks Relating to the Mortgage LoansâRisks Related to Ground Leases and
Other Leasehold Interestsâ and ââLeased Fee Properties Have Special Risksâ, âCertain
Legal Aspects of Mortgage LoansâForeclosureâ and âCertain Legal Aspects of Mortgage LoansâBankruptcy
Lawsâ.
Â 
As
regards ground leases, see representation and warranty no.Â 34 in AnnexÂ D-1 and the exceptions thereto in AnnexÂ D-2
to this prospectus (subject to the limitations and qualifications set forth in the preamble to AnnexÂ D-1 to this prospectus).
Â 
Environmental
Considerations
Â 
An
environmental report was prepared for each Mortgaged Property securing a Mortgage Loan no more than eight months prior to the
Cut-off Date with the exception of one Mortgage Loan identified as University Center South on Annex A-1 to this prospectus and
representing 0.3% of the Initial Pool Balance. See AnnexÂ A-1 for the date of the environmental report for each Mortgaged
Property. The environmental reports were generally prepared pursuant to the American Society for Testing and Materials standard
for a âPhase Iâ environmental site assessment (the âESAâ).
In addition to the Phase I standards, some of the environmental reports will include additional research, such as limited sampling
for asbestos-containing material, lead-based paint, radon or water damage with limited areas of potential or identified mold,
depending on the property use and/or age. Additionally, as needed pursuant to American Society for Testing and Materials standards,
supplemental âPhase IIâ site investigations have been completed for some Mortgaged Properties to further evaluate
certain environmental issues, including certain recognized environmental conditions (each, a âRECâ). A Phase
II investigation generally consists of sampling and/or testing.
Â 
See
âRisk FactorsâRisks Relating to the Mortgage LoansâAdverse Environmental Conditions at or Near Mortgaged
Properties May Result In Lossesâ in this prospectus. See also representation and warranty no.Â 40 in AnnexÂ D-1
and the exceptions thereto in AnnexÂ D-2 to this prospectus (subject to the limitations and qualifications set forth in the
preamble to AnnexÂ D-1 to this prospectus).
Â 
Described
below is certain additional information regarding environmental issues at the Mortgaged Properties securing the Mortgage Loans:
Â 
Â 

168
Â 

Â 


Â·
With
  respect to the Mortgage Loan secured by the Mortgaged Property identified as Empire Mall,
  representing 7.5% of the Initial Pool Balance, the related ESA and an Opinion
  of Probable Cost letter from the ESA consultant reported that three in-ground hydraulic
  lifts previously were removed from the tenant facility with no action-level impacts identified.
  The consultant recommended removing eleven additional out-of-service in-ground hydraulic
  lifts, including investigation and disposal of surrounding soils, at total estimated
  cost range of $95,000 to $150,000 based on the assumption on available evidence that
  no active groundwater remediation is likely to be required. Sears, RoebuckÂ &
  Co. has been identified as the party responsible for liability and costs associated with
  ground-water monitoring and remediation, if required. We cannot assure you that the recommended
  actions will not cost more than the estimated costs or that no further action will be
  required.

Â 


Â·
With
  respect to the Mortgage Loan secured by the Mortgaged Property identified on Annex A-1
  to this prospectus as Harbor Pointe Apartments, representing 5.0% of the Initial Pool
  Balance, the ESA identifies the Mortgaged Property as being located within the former
  Military Ocean Terminal, Bayonne (âMOTBYâ). MOTBY was, at separate
  times, utilized by the United States Navy and the United States Army whose various operations
  caused impacts to the larger MOTBY site. Multiple site investigations of MOTBY identified
  impacts to soil on various portions of the MOTBY site, including the Mortgaged Property.
  These impacts were remediated and/or capped by the Bayonne Local Redevelopment Authority.
  In 2006, the soil remediated and capped areas received a No Further Action letter (âNFAâ)
  from the governing authority, which restricted the capped areas, including portions of
  the Mortgaged Property, to non-residential use. This restriction was later modified in
  June 2007 to allow for multifamily use. In 2006, the larger MOTBY site, including the
  Mortgaged Property, also received an NFA from the governing authority related to groundwater,
  which created a groundwater classification exception area and well restriction area.
  The City of Bayonne has assumed the responsibilities associated with groundwater monitoring
  and reporting for the larger MOTBY site.

With
  respect to the portfolio of Mortgaged Properties identified on Annex A-1 to this prospectus
  as the Harvey Building Products Portfolio, which secures a Mortgage Loan representing
  approximately 3.3% of the Initial Pool Balance, the related Phase I ESAs recommended
  the following: (i) limited subsurface investigation be conducted at the Waltham Corporate
  Mortgaged Property related to historical auto body repair and manufacturing activities
  conducted at the Mortgaged Property; (ii) secondary containment structures be installed
  at the Woburn Mortgaged Property beneath four above ground storage tanks in order to
  contain potential spills or releases and that a limited subsurface investigation be conducted
  in the vicinity of the former underground storage tanks; (iii) the oil water separator
  in place at the Dartmouth Mortgaged Property be serviced, which separator is in place
  due to a hydraulic oil leak from a solid waste compactor and that such compactor be repaired;
  (iv) phase II ESA be conducted at the Bethlehem Mortgaged Property related to soil and
  groundwater contamination; (v) that closure documentation for the former underground
  storage tank with respect to the Woburn CPD Mortgaged Property be provided for review
  and, if unavailable, a geophysical survey, including a ground penetrating radar be conducted
  in the reported former location of such underground storage tank; (vi) ongoing monitoring
  at the Manchester, NH Mortgaged Property with respect to soil contamination; (vii) a
  limited subsurface investigation be conducted in the vicinity of the former underground
  storage tank at the Fitchburg Mortgaged Property and 

Â 


169
Â 
Â 
(viii)
if underground storage tank closure documentation is unavailable for review, a limited subsurface investigation be conducted with
respect to potential soil contamination. The related borrower obtained an environmental insurance policy from XL Catlin Insurance
(with a rating of âAâ by S&P and âA:XVâ by A.M.Â Best Company,Â Inc.), with coverage limit
of $6,000,000, in the aggregate and $2,000,000 per incident having a term of five years with a three year tail and a deductible
of $25,000.
Â 


Â·
With
  respect to the Mortgaged Property identified on Annex A-1 to this prospectus as Westgate
  Shopping Center which secures a Mortgage Loan representing approximately 2.2% of the
  Initial Pool Balance, the ESA identifies impacts to soil and groundwater associated with
  a dry-cleaning operation formerly located on-site. Subsurface investigations conducted
  at the Mortgaged Property in 2000 determined that, given identified concentration levels,
  impacts to soil and groundwater did not pose a significant risk to human health in the
  outdoor environment. To address any potential vapor intrusion issues associated with
  the impacts, a sub-slab depressurization system (SSDS) was installed at the Mortgaged
  Property. Indoor air sampling in 2013 and June 2015 confirmed that the SSDS is successfully
  mitigating any potential health hazard risk to building occupants. Periodic air quality
  testing on an annual basis has been recommended to monitor the ongoing effectiveness
  of the SSDS.

Â 


Â·
With
  respect to the Mortgage Loan secured by the Mortgaged Property identified on Annex A-1
  to this prospectus as 2200 Harbor Boulevard, representing approximately 1.4% of the Initial
  Pool Balance, the ESA identified a recognized environmental condition associated with
  former on-site dry cleaners, including related soil and groundwater contamination. In
  lieu of a Phase II environmental site assessment, the lender obtained a $2 million lender
  environmental collateral protection and liability-type environmental insurance policy
  from Steadfast Insurance Company, a member company of Zurich North America, with a 10-year
  term (equivalent to loan term) and 3-year policy tail, and having a $50,000 deductible
  (which was reserved at loan closing). The policy premium was pre-paid at closing, and
  the loan documents provide for personal liability to the borrower and guarantor for losses
  related to the failure to pay such policy deductible. Zurich North America has an S&P
  rating of âAA-â.

Â 


Â·
With
  respect to the Mortgaged Property identified on Annex A-1 to this prospectus as Golf
  Plaza, which secures a Mortgage Loan representing approximately 0.6% of the Initial Pool
  Balance, the related ESA reported that previous onsite dry cleaning had impacted soil
  and groundwater and the facility was enrolled in the Illinois Site Remediation Program.
  A Remedial Action Completion Report (âRACRâ) was prepared in September
  2015 to request a Focused No Further Remediation (âNFRâ) determination
  from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (âIEPAâ). The proposed
  NFR would include a deed restriction that includes: industrial/commercial usage only;
  maintaining engineered barriers and a sub-slab depressurization system beneath the former
  dry cleaner space; groundwater usage restrictions; and a plan for appropriate care during
  any excavation. The ESA recommended that upon issuance of an NFR the deed restrictions
  and any additional requirement that might be imposed by the IEPA should be followed.
  We cannot assure you that the NFR will be issued on a timely basis or that no further
  action will be required.

Â 


Â·
With
  respect to the Mortgaged Property identified on Annex A-1 to this prospectus as Oak Valley
  Apartments, which secures a Mortgage Loan representing approximately 0.4% of the Initial
  Pool Balance, the ESA discusses limited radon 

Â 


170
Â 
Â 
sampling conducted at the Mortgaged Property,
  which detected radon above the Environmental Protection Agencyâs (EPA) Action Level
  of 4.0 picoCuries per Liter (pCi/L) in seven of eleven samples collected. Based on the
  analytical results, the consultant has recommended additional radon sampling in the Mortgaged
  Property units which tested above the EPA Action Level as well as additional radon testing
  in the previously untested buildings at the Mortgaged Property, including those with
  radon mitigation systems, in order to establish an average radon level. To address the
  consultantâs recommendation, an environmental escrow of $50,000 was established
  at origination. If within 90 days of origination the lender has not received evidence
  that the recommended testing and any mitigation, if necessary, has been completed, the
  related borrower is required to deposit $100,000 less any amounts disbursed for such
  work in the environmental escrow.
Â 


Â·
With
  respect to the Mortgaged Property identified on Annex A-1 to this prospectus as Alpha
  Corners, which secures a Mortgage Loan representing approximately 0.2% of the Initial
  Pool Balance, the related ESA reported that a previous onsite gas station was razed during
  redevelopment in 2014 and two leaking underground storage tank (âLUSTâ)
  incidents received regulatory closure. A third LUST incident that impacted soil and groundwater
  remains open with an agency-identified viable responsible party. The ESA ruled out potential
  indoor vapor intrusion concerns and recommended monitoring the status of the responsible
  partyâs remediation work until regulatory closure is achieved. At origination of
  the Mortgage Loan, a reserve in the amount $125,000 was established as security for the
  performance of the remedial work. We cannot assure you that any remaining required work
  will not exceed the escrowed funds or that regulatory closure will be achieved in a timely
  manner.

Â 
Redevelopment,
Renovation and Expansion
Â 
Certain
of the Mortgaged Properties are properties which are currently undergoing or are expected to undergo redevelopment, renovation
or expansion, including with respect to hotel properties, executing property improvement plans (âPIPsâ)
required by the franchisors. Below are descriptions of certain
of such Mortgaged Properties.
Â 


Â·
With
  respect to the Mortgaged Properties identified on Annex A-1 as Pineapple Hotel Portfolio,
  which secure a Mortgage loan representing approximately 6.1% of the initial Pool Balance,
  the Mortgaged Property identified as University Inn is expected to undergo an FF&E
  renovation in its original wing commencing in 2015, which is anticipated to cost approximately
  $800,000. No reserve was required for such renovations.

Â 
Certain
risks related to redevelopment, renovation and expansion at a Mortgaged Property are described in âRisk FactorsâRisks
Relating to the Mortgage LoansâRisks Related to Redevelopment, Expansion and Renovation at Mortgaged Propertiesâ.
Â 
Assessment
of Property Value and Condition
Â 
In
connection with the origination or acquisition of each Mortgage Loan or otherwise in connection with this offering, an appraisal
was conducted in respect of the related Mortgaged Property by an independent appraiser that was state certified and/or a member
of the Appraisal Institute or an update of an existing appraisal was obtained. In each case, the appraisal complied, or the appraiser
certified that it complied, with the real estate appraisal regulations issued jointly by the federal bank regulatory agencies
under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, as amended. In
Â 


171
Â 
Â 
general, those appraisals represent
the analysis and opinion of the person performing the appraisal and are not guarantees of, and may not be indicative of, present
or future value. We cannot assure you that another person would not have arrived at a different valuation, even if such person
used the same general approach to and same method of valuing the property or that different valuations would not have been reached
separately by the mortgage loan sellers based on their internal review of such appraisals. The appraisals obtained as described
above sought to establish the amount a typically motivated buyer would pay a typically motivated seller. Such amount could be
significantly higher than the amount obtained from the sale of a Mortgaged Property under a distress or liquidation sale.
Â 
In
addition, in general, a licensed engineer, architect or consultant inspected the related Mortgaged Property, in connection with
the origination or acquisition of each of the Mortgage Loans or otherwise in connection with this offering, to assess the condition
of the structure, exterior walls, roofing, interior structure and mechanical and electrical systems. Engineering reports by licensed
engineers, architects or consultants generally were prepared, except for newly constructed properties, certain manufactured housing
community properties âand properties for which the borrowerâs interest consists of a fee interest solely on the land
and not any improvements, for the Mortgaged Properties in connection with the origination of the related Mortgage Loan or in connection
with this offering. None of these engineering reports are more than 8 months old as of the Cut-off Date. In certain cases where
material deficiencies were noted in such reports, the related borrower was required to establish reserves for replacement or repair
or remediate the deficiency.
Â 
Litigation
and Other Considerations
Â 
There
may be material pending or threatened legal proceedings against, or other past or present material criminal or material adverse
regulatory circumstances experienced by, the borrowers, their sponsors and managers of the Mortgaged Properties and their respective
affiliates. In addition, the Mortgaged Property may be subject to ongoing litigation. For example:
Â 


Â·
With
  respect to the Mortgage Loan secured by the Mortgaged Property identified on Annex A-1
  to this prospectus as Empire Mall, representing 7.5% of the Initial Pool Balance, the
  borrower is involved in an action by a tenant seeking specific performance and declaratory
  judgment to enforce an option to renew its lease of an outparcel at the Mortgaged Property.
  The tenant filed this lawsuit in July 2015 after receiving the borrowerâs letter stating
  that the tenant did not timely exercise its option to renew and is required to vacate
  the premises no later than December 31, 2015. The action is still pending.

Â 


Â·
With
  respect to the Mortgage Loans secured by the Mortgaged Properties identified on Annex
  A-1 to this prospectus as Anchorage Marriott Downtown and JW Marriott Santa Monica Le
  Merigot, collectively representing approximately 6.9% of the Initial Pool Balance, one
  of the related sponsors acquired an unrelated entity that owned certain casinos. The
  unrelated entity was denied a gaming license with respect to one casino and the related
  sponsor was unable to operate the property. As a result, the related sponsor placed the
  casino-owning entity into Chapter 11 bankruptcy and defaulted on the loan used to acquire
  the entity. The entityâs assets were sold out of bankruptcy to unaffiliated parties.
  The sponsor is currently a defendant in litigation relating to the acquisition of the
  casino-owning entity; the plaintiffs, bondholders in the transaction, allege breaches
  of fiduciary duty, contract, and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

Â 
Â 


Â·
With
  respect to the Mortgage Loan secured by the Mortgaged Property identified on AnnexÂ A-1
  to this prospectus as Huntington Park Shopping Center, representing approximately 1.8%
  of the Initial Pool Balance, one of the guarantors (Daniel D. Crosser) is the defendant
  in a pending lawsuit filed by his former partners alleging that Mr.Â Crosser failed
  to make distributions in the amount of $302,000. Mr.Â Crosser has filed an answer
  to the complaint denying all claims. As of OctoberÂ 1, 2015, Mr.Â Crosser had
  stated net worth of approximately $32.9 million. There is no requirement under the Mortgage
  Loan documents that the guarantor maintain a specific net worth and there can be no assurances
  made as to what the guarantorâs net worth currently is or may be in the future.

Fifty-five
  (55) of the Mortgage Loans, representing 75.0% of the Initial Pool Balance, were originated
  in connection with the borrowerâs refinancing of a previous mortgage loan.

Â 


Â·
Sixteen
  (16) of the Mortgage Loans, representing approximately 25.0% of the Initial Pool Balance,
  were originated in connection with the borrowerâs acquisition of the related Mortgaged
  Property.

Â 
Certain
of the borrowers, principals of the borrowers and other entities under the control of such principals or single tenants at the
related Mortgaged Properties or in certain cases a Mortgaged Property that secures a Mortgage Loan are, or previously have been,
parties to bankruptcy proceedings, foreclosure proceedings, deed in lieu of foreclosure transactions and/or mortgage loan workouts
resulting from mortgage loan defaults, which in some cases involved a Mortgaged Property that secures a Mortgage Loan to be included
in the Trust. For example:

  approximately 45.2% of the Initial Pool Balance by allocated loan amount, (a)Â within
  approximately the last 10Â years, related borrowers, sponsors and/or key principals
  (or affiliates thereof) have previously (i)Â sponsored, been a key principal with
  respect to, or been a payment or non-recourse carveout guarantor on mortgage loans secured
  by, real estate projects (including in some such cases, the particular Mortgaged Property
  or Properties referenced above in this sentence) that became the subject of foreclosure
  proceedings or a deed in lieu of foreclosure or bankruptcy proceedings or directly or
  indirectly secured a real estate loan or a real estate related mezzanine loan that was
  the subject of a discounted payoff or modification, or (ii)Â been the subject of
  personal bankruptcy proceedings, (b)Â the related Mortgage Loan refinanced a prior
  loan secured by, or a mezzanine loan secured by interests in the owner of, the Mortgaged
  Property which prior loan was the subject of a maturity default, a maturity extension
  or a discounted payoff, short sale or other restructuring, (c)Â the Mortgaged Property
  was acquired by the related borrower or

Â Â 
an
affiliate thereof from a foreclosing lender or through foreclosure or a deed in lieu of foreclosure, as part of an REO transaction,
at a foreclosure sale or out of receivership, or (d)Â the Mortgaged Property has been or currently is involved in a borrower,
principal or tenant bankruptcy.
Â 
In
particular, with respect to the 15 largest Mortgage Loans or groups of cross-collateralized Mortgage Loans we note the following:
Â 


Â·
With
  respect to the Mortgage Loan secured by the Mortgaged Property identified on AnnexÂ A-1
  to this prospectus as Rolling Brook Village, representing approximately 8.8% of the Initial
  Pool Balance, the sponsor was also the sponsor of another mortgage loan, which loan was
  modified in 2014 to provide for a full payoff of the loan with a waiver of prepayment
  penalties.

Â 


Â·
With
  respect to the Mortgage Loan secured by the Mortgaged Property identified as Empire Mall,
  representing approximately 7.5% of the Initial Pool Balance, the related sponsor, Simon
  Property Group, LP, has sponsored other real estate projects over the last 10 years that
  have been the subject of mortgage loan defaults, foreclosure proceedings and deeds-in-lieu
  of foreclosure.

Â 


Â·
With
  respect to the Mortgage Loans secured by the Mortgaged Properties identified on Annex
  A-1 to this prospectus as Anchorage Marriott Downtown and JW Marriott Santa Monica Le
  Merigot, collectively representing approximately 6.9% of the Initial Pool Balance, one
  of the related sponsors acquired an unrelated entity that owned certain casinos. The
  unrelated entity was denied a gaming license with respect to one casino and the related
  sponsor was unable to operate the property. As a result, the related sponsor placed the
  casino-owning entity into Chapter 11 bankruptcy and defaulted on the loan used to acquire
  the entity. The entityâs assets were sold out of bankruptcy to unaffiliated parties.

Â 


Â·
With
  respect to the Mortgage Loans secured by the Mortgaged Properties identified on AnnexÂ A-1
  to this prospectus as Adler Office and Adler Industrial, respectively, which Mortgage
  Loans are cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted, and represent in the aggregate approximately
  5.7% of the Initial Pool Balance, the related non-recourse carve-out guarantor for such
  Mortgage Loans disclosed prior foreclosures, deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure, and receiverships
  with respect to seven properties in which such guarantor was a sponsor or investor, all
  of which took place during the period from 2013 to the present.

Â 


Â·
With

Â 


Â·
With
  respect to the Mortgage Loan secured by the Mortgaged Property identified on Annex A-1
  to this prospectus as Aloft Nashville West End, representing approximately 2.5% of the
  Initial Pool Balance, the proceeds of such Mortgage Loan were used by the borrower to
  acquire the related Mortgaged Property (in

  turn refinanced a prior securitized loan to an affiliate of the borrower, which securitized
  loan, which was secured by a portion of the Mortgaged Property and by adjacent parcels,
  experienced a maturity default in 2014. The borrower also reported two prior foreclosure
  actions and a prior deed-in-lieu of foreclosure with respect to properties in which the
  related sponsor was a sponsor and/or investor.

Â 
Expirations
Â 
Certain
of the Mortgaged Properties are subject to tenant leases that expire before the maturity date of the related Mortgage Loan. For
tenant lease expiration information in the form of a lease rollover chart relating to each of the top 15 Mortgage Loans or groups
of cross-collateralized Mortgage Loans, see the related summaries attached as AnnexÂ A-3 to this prospectus. In addition,
see AnnexÂ A-1 for tenant lease expiration dates for the 5 largest tenants (based on net rentable area leased) at each retail,
office, mixed use and industrial Mortgaged Property. Whether or not any of the 5 largest tenants at a particular Mortgaged Property
have leases that expire before, or shortly after, the maturity of the related Mortgage Loan, there may be a significant percentage
of leases at a particular Mortgaged Property that expire in a single calendar year, a rolling 12-month period or prior to, or
shortly after, the maturity of a Mortgage Loan. Furthermore, some of the Mortgaged Properties have significant leases or a significant
concentration of leases that expire before,
Â 


175
Â 
Â 
or shortly following, the maturity of the related Mortgage Loan. In addition, certain
other Mortgaged Properties may have a significant portion of the leases that expire or can be terminated in a particular year,
or portion thereof, at the related Mortgaged Property. Prospective investors are encouraged to review the charts entitled âMajor

  of the Mortgaged Properties, identified on AnnexÂ A-1 to this prospectus as Westgate
  Shopping Center, Columbine Place, 2200 Harbor Boulevard, 2700 Blankenbaker and University
  Center South, collectively representing approximately 6.7% of the Initial Pool Balance
  in the aggregate by allocated loan amount, have, among the 5 largest tenants at such
  Mortgaged Property (by net rentable area leased), tenants that have renewed leases or
  have taken possession of the space demised under the related lease with the related borrower,
  but have not yet commenced payments of rent under the related lease, or have tenants
  that have executed leases, but have not taken possession or commenced payment of rent,
  have tenants that are in a buildout phase and have not taken occupancy, have tenants
  that are expanding their space but have not commenced payment of the additional rent,
  have tenants that renewed leases that provide free rent and have not commenced payment
  of rent, have tenants that are entitled to free rent periods in the future, or have subleases
  in place that can increase vacancy risks. In certain circumstances, an escrow reserve
  related to free rent periods and tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions due
  in connection with such leases was funded at closing. See AnnexÂ A-1 to this prospectus

  Balance in the aggregate by allocated loan amount, have certain tenants at the related
  Mortgaged Properties, hotel franchisors, homeownerâs associations, other condominium
  unit owners or other third parties that hold purchase options, rights of first refusal
  or rights of first offer to purchase their related pad site or, in some cases, the related
  Mortgaged Property. See âYield and Maturity Considerationsâ in this
  prospectus. See also representation and warranty no.Â 6 in AnnexÂ D-1 and the
  exceptions thereto in AnnexÂ D-2 to this prospectus (subject to the limitations and
  qualifications set forth in the preamble to AnnexÂ D-1 to this prospectus).

In
addition, with respect to the 15 largest loans presented on Annex A-3
to this prospectus, we note the following:
Â 


Â·
With
  respect to the Mortgage Loan secured by the Mortgaged Properties identified on Annex
  A-1 to this prospectus as Heritage Industrial Portfolio, representing approximately 4.1%
  of the Initial Pool Balance, Midwest Express Inc., the sole tenant at the 16725 Square
  Drive Mortgaged Property, has the right to purchase such Mortgaged Property at any time
  after the 25th payment date after the securitization of the Heritage Industrial
  Portfolio Whole Loan, for a purchase price equal to $4,000,000 plus all applicable defeasance
  costs. Pursuant to such tenantâs lease, if for any reason, other than the intentional
  or arbitrary acts of the borrower, the borrower is unable to convey such Mortgaged Property
  in accordance with the lease, the sole obligation and liability of the borrower will
  be to refund the deposit provided by tenant in connection with the anticipated sale.

on the Performance of Tenants and Tenant LeasesâLeases That Are Not Subordinated to the Lien of the Mortgage or Do Not Contain
Attornment Provisions May Have an Adverse Impact at Foreclosureâ.
Â 
Affiliated
Leases
Â 
Certain
of the Mortgaged Properties are leased in whole or in part by borrowers or borrower affiliates. Set forth below are examples of
Mortgaged Properties or portfolios of Mortgaged Properties at which at least 20% of (i)Â the gross income at the Mortgaged
Property or portfolio of Mortgaged Properties relates to leases between the borrower and an affiliate of the borrower or (ii)Â the
net rentable area at the Mortgaged Property or portfolio of Mortgaged Properties is leased to an affiliate of the borrower:

Â 
Â 


Â·
With
  respect to the Mortgaged Property identified on AnnexÂ A-1 to this prospectus as
  Harvey Building Products Portfolio, which secures a Mortgage Loan representing approximately
  3.3% of the Initial Pool Balance, Harvey Industries, Inc., the sole tenant at each Mortgaged
  Property, is an affiliate of the related borrower.

Â 


Â·
In
  addition, it may be possible that the master lease for the Mortgage Loan secured by the
  portfolio of Mortgaged Properties identified on Annex A-1 to this prospectus as Harvey
  Building Products Portfolio, which represents approximately 3.3% of the Initial Pool
  Balance (the âHarvey Building Products Portfolio Master Leaseâ) could
  be construed in a bankruptcy as a financing lease or other arrangement under which the
  related master lessee (and/or its affiliates) would be deemed as effectively the owner
  of the Harvey Building Products Portfolio properties, rather than a tenant, with potentially
  adverse consequences for the holder of the Harvey Building Products Portfolio Mortgage
  Loan, including a potentially greater risk of an unfavorable plan of reorganization and
  competing claims of creditors of the related master lessee and/or its affiliates. However,
  the Harvey Building Products Portfolio Master Lease includes no option on the part of
  the related master lessee to purchase the Harvey Building Products Portfolio properties,
  and the related borrower has delivered a âtrue leaseâ opinion with respect
  to the Harvey Building Products Portfolio Master Lease, which is a reasoned opinion of
  outside counsel to the related borrower to the effect that, in a federal bankruptcy proceeding,
  and subject to certain qualifications and limitations set forth therein, the Harvey Building
  Products Portfolio Master Lease would be construed as a true lease rather than being
  characterized as a financing lease. The âtrue leaseâ opinion is subject to
  certain assumptions and qualifications regarding the related borrower, the related master
  lessee, their respective affiliates and the lender and regarding the Harvey Building
  Products Portfolio properties and the Harvey Building Products Portfolio Master Lease,
  including assumptions that the Harvey Building Products Portfolio properties have a useful
  life beyond the term of the Harvey Building Products Portfolio Master Lease and that
  the rent under the Harvey Building Products Portfolio Master Lease is reflective of a
  fair rental value for the Harvey Building Products Portfolio properties.

Â 
The
Harvey Building Products Portfolio Master Lease is drafted as a single, unitary, indivisible, non-severable lease of all the Harvey
Building Products Portfolio properties and not to constitute separate leases contained in one document that are each governed
by similar terms. The related borrower delivered a âunitary lease opinionâ with respect to the Harvey Building Products
Portfolio Master Lease which is a reasoned opinion of outside counsel to the related borrower to the effect that, subject to certain
qualifications and limitations set forth therein, the Harvey Building Products Portfolio Master Lease would be construed as a
unitary, non-severable lease. The âunitary leaseâ opinion is subject to certain assumptions and qualifications regarding
future actions of the related borrower, the related master lessee, their respective affiliates and the lender and regarding the
Harvey Building Products Portfolio properties and the Harvey Building Products Portfolio Master Lease.
Â 
Reasoned
opinions, in general, do not provide any guaranty as to what any particular court would actually decide, but rather an opinion
as to the decision a court would reach if the issues were competently presented and the court followed existing precedent as to
legal and equitable principles applicable in the bankruptcy cases. Therefore, the result described in such âtrue leaseâ
and âunitary leaseâ opinions are not a guarantee.
Â

Â 
Â 


Â·
With
  respect to the Mortgaged Property identified on AnnexÂ A-1 to this prospectus as
  Hawthorn Suites Philadelphia, which secures a Mortgage Loan representing approximately
  0.5% of the Initial Pool Balance, the Mortgaged Property is subject to a ground lease
  between Lessor, Phileo RI,Â Inc., a borrower affiliate, as lessor, and the borrower
  as lessee. The mortgage is also secured by the fee ownerâs interest in the Mortgaged
  Property. The mortgage gives the lender the right to foreclose on both the fee and leasehold
  interests in the event of a default.

Â 
Insurance
Considerations
Â 
The
Mortgage Loans generally require that each Mortgaged Property be insured by a hazard insurance policy in an amount (subject to
an approved deductible) at least equal to the lesser of the outstanding principal balance of the related Mortgage Loan and 100%
of the replacement cost of the improvements located on the related Mortgaged Property, and if applicable, that the related hazard
insurance policy contain appropriate endorsements or have been issued in an amount sufficient to avoid the application of co-insurance
and not permit reduction in insurance proceeds for depreciation; provided that, in the case of certain of the Mortgage
Loans, the hazard insurance may be in such other amounts as was required by the related originators.
Â 
In
general, the standard form of hazard insurance policy covers physical damage to, or destruction of, the improvements on the Mortgaged
Property by fire, lightning, explosion, smoke, windstorm and hail, riot or strike and civil commotion, subject to the conditions
and exclusions set forth in each policy. Each Mortgage Loan generally also requires the related borrower to maintain comprehensive
general liability insurance against claims for personal and bodily injury, death or property damage occurring on, in or about
the related Mortgaged Property in an amount generally equal to at least $1,000,000. Each Mortgage Loan generally further requires
the related borrower to maintain business interruption insurance in an amount not less than approximately 100% of the gross rental
income from the related Mortgaged Property for not less than 12 months. In general, the Mortgage Loans (including those secured
by Mortgaged Properties located in California) do not require earthquake insurance. Sixteen (16) of the Mortgaged Properties,
securing 24.8% of the Initial Pool Balance, are located in areas that are considered a high earthquake risk. These areas include
all or parts of the states of California, Arizona, Arkansas, Utah, Tennessee, Washington, Idaho, Missouri or Oregon. Seismic
reports were prepared with respect to these Mortgaged Properties, and based on those reports, no Mortgaged Property has a seismic
expected loss greater than 18%.
Â 
In
the case of 52 Mortgaged Properties which secure in whole or in part 21 Mortgage Loans, representing approximately 33.2% of the
Initial Pool Balance by allocated loan amount, the related borrowers (or, in some cases, tenants which are permitted to maintain
insurance in lieu of the related borrowers) maintain insurance under blanket policies.
Â 
Certain
of the Mortgaged Properties may be insured by, or subject to self-insurance on the part of, a sole or significant tenant or the
property manager as described below:
Â 


Â·
With
  respect to the Mortgage Loans secured by the Mortgaged Properties identified on AnnexÂ A-1
  as Home Depot Jamaica, Merritt Creek Farm Shopping Center, Reasorâs Foods- Bixby,
  OSH San Leandro, LA Fitness â Euless, LA Fitness â Grand Prairie, LA Fitness
  â Pearland, Walgreens-York, Walgreens-Reynoldsburg, Harpâs Foods-Grove, Walgreens-Dyersburg,
  Dollar General â Farmington, Dollar General â Rice, Dollar General â
  Bloomington, Dollar General â Cape Girardeau and Dollar General - Troy, representing
  approximately 10.2% of the Initial Pool Balance, the related borrower may rely on the
  single tenantâs or a ground lease tenantâs 

Â 


180
Â 

Â 
insurance
or self-insurance, so long as the single tenantâs or ground lease tenantâs lease is in effect and no default has occurred
under the lease and the tenantâs insurance or self-insurance meets the requirements under the related loan documents or
(in certain cases) of the related lease. If the tenant fails to provide acceptable insurance coverage or self-insurance, the borrower
generally must obtain or provide supplemental coverage to meet the requirements under the loan documents. See representation and
warranty no.Â 16 on AnnexÂ D-1 to this prospectus and the exceptions thereto on AnnexÂ D-2 to this prospectus (subject
to the limitations and qualifications set forth in the preamble to AnnexÂ D-1 to this prospectus).
Â 
Further,
with respect to Mortgaged Properties that are part of condominium regimes, the insurance may be maintained by the condominium
association rather than the related borrower. Many Mortgage Loans contain limitations on the obligation to obtain terrorism insurance.
See âRisk FactorsâRisks Relating to the Mortgage LoansâTerrorism Insurance May Not Be Available for All Mortgaged
Propertiesâ.
Â 
See
âRisk FactorsâRisks Relating to the Mortgage LoansâRisks Associated with Blanket Insurance Policies or Self-Insuranceâ.
Â 
Use
Restrictions
Â 
Certain
of the Mortgaged Properties are subject to restrictions that restrict the use of such Mortgaged Properties to its current use,
place other use restrictions on such Mortgaged Property or limit the related borrowerâs ability to make changes to such
Mortgaged Property. For example:
Â 


Â·
With
  respect to the portfolio of Mortgaged Properties identified on Annex A-1 to this prospectus
  as the Harvey Building Products Portfolio, which secures a Mortgage Loan representing
  approximately 3.3% of the Initial Pool Balance, the Bethlehem Mortgaged Property is legal,
  non-conforming as to use. Following a casualty or condemnation, the Bethlehem Mortgaged
  Property may be rebuilt if the exterior structure is properly secured following the damage
  or destruction and reconstruction begins within 12 months of the date of such damage
  or destruction. In addition, the Norwalk II Mortgaged Property is legal, non-conforming
  as to use. If 50% or more of the Norwalk II Mortgaged Property is destroyed, such Mortgaged
  Property could only be rebuilt with a special use permit. The borrower is required pursuant
  to the related Mortgage Loan documents to maintain law or ordinance insurance coverage
  if any of the improvements or the use of a Mortgaged Property constitutes a legal non-conforming
  structure or use, including coverage for loss to the undamaged portion of such property,
  demolition costs and the increased cost of construction, all in amounts acceptable to
  the lender. Law and ordinance insurance coverage has been obtained with respect to each
  such Mortgaged Property in an amount covering up to (i) $10,000,000 for losses to undamaged
  portions of the structure and (ii) $1,000,000 for demolition costs and increased costs
  of construction.

Â 


Â·
With
  respect to the Mortgaged Property identified on Annex A-1 to this prospectus as JW Marriott
  Santa Monica Le Merigot, representing approximately 3.1% of the Initial Pool Balance,
  the related Mortgaged Property is located in an area currently zoned as residential with
  limited commercial use, and its current use as a hospitality property is considered legal
  non-conforming. Following a casualty, the borrower has the right to continue to use the
  Mortgaged Property as a hotel (provided that such use is not abandoned or expanded),
  provided, however, that if 

Â 


181
Â 
Â 
the
casualty is greater than 50% of the Mortgaged Property, the reconstruction is subject to zoning board review and approval relating
to the Mortgaged Propertyâs legal nonconforming status. Law and ordinance coverage was obtained in an amount covering up
to $150,000,000 for the loss of use of the undamaged portion of the Mortgaged Property, demolition costs and increased costs of
construction.
Â 


Â·
With
  respect to the Mortgage Loan secured by the Mortgaged Property identified on AnnexÂ A-1
  to this prospectus as Keeperâs Self Storage Manhattan, representing approximately
  3.1% of the Initial Pool Balance, the related Mortgaged Property is designated a landmark
  site and is therefore subject to certain oversight by the New York City Landmarks Preservation
  Commission with respect to physical changes to the Mortgaged Property. In addition, the
  related Mortgaged Propertyâs current use of self storage is a legal non-conforming
  use. If over 50% of the Mortgaged Property is damaged or destroyed, the Mortgaged Property
  may only be reconstructed in compliance with current zoning requirements. Law and ordinance
  coverage was obtained in an amount covering up to $25,592,847 for the loss of use of
  the undamaged portion of the Mortgaged Property, $1,500,000 for demolition costs and
  $1,500,000 for increased costs of construction.

See
âRisk FactorsâRisks Relating to the Mortgage LoansâRisks Related to Zoning Non-Compliance and Use Restrictionsâ.
Â 
Appraised
Value
Â 
In
certain cases, appraisals may reflect both âas-stabilizedâ, âas-completeâ, and âas-isâ values.
However, the Appraised Value reflected in this prospectus with respect to each Mortgaged Property reflects only the âas-isâ
value, except as set forth in the table below. The âas-stabilizedâ or âas-completeâ, value may be based
on certain assumptions, such as future construction completion, projected re-tenanting or increased tenant occupancies. The table
below shows the LTV Ratio and appraised value for Mortgage Loans using âas-stabilizedâ and/or âas-completeâ
values, as well as the corresponding LTV Ratio and appraised value for such Mortgage Loans using âas-isâ values.

  of such renovations and capital improvements is the first half of 2016. The appraisal also provides a hypothetical âwhen-stabilizedâ
  value for the Mortgaged Property of $44,200,000 as of NovemberÂ 1, 2017. The appraised values and LTV Ratios used in this
  prospectus for such Mortgage Loan are (or are based on) the âas-completeâ value, except where otherwise expressly

In
the case of the Mortgage Loan identified as Heritage Industrial Portfolio on Annex A-1 to this prospectus, the âas-isâ
appraised value of $116,500,000 reflects a premium attributed to the value of the related Mortgaged Properties as a whole. The
sum of the individual appraised values of each of the related Mortgaged Properties is $108,500,000, which results in a Cut-off
Date LTV Ratio of 75.0%.

See
âRisk FactorsâRisks Relating to the Mortgage LoansâAppraisals May Not Reflect Current or Future Market Value
of Each Propertyâ.
Â 
Non-Recourse
Carveout Limitations
Â 
While
the Mortgage Loans generally contain non-recourse carveouts for liabilities such as a result of fraud by the borrower, certain
voluntary insolvency proceedings or other matters, certain of the Mortgage Loans may not contain such carveouts or contain limitations
to such carveouts. In general, the liquidity and net worth of a non-recourse guarantor under a Mortgage Loan will be less, and
may be materially less, than the outstanding principal amount of that Mortgage Loan. In addition, certain Mortgage Loans have
additional limitations to the non-recourse carveouts. See representation
and warranty no. 26 on AnnexÂ D-1 to this prospectus and the exceptions thereto on AnnexÂ D-2 to this prospectus (subject
to the limitations and qualifications set forth in the preamble to AnnexÂ D-1 to this prospectus).
Â 


Â·
With
  respect to the Mortgaged Property identified on Annex A-1 to this prospectus as Empire
  Mall, representing approximately 7.5% of the Initial Pool Balance, the guarantorâs
  liability is limited to $38,000,000 plus all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
  incurred in the enforcement of the guaranty or preservation of the lenderâs rights
  under the guaranty. The borrower is permitted to replace the existing guarantor for liabilities
  under the guaranty accruing after the date of such replacement with an entity controlled
  by any key principal of the guarantor.

Â 


Â·
The
  Mortgage Loan secured by the Mortgaged Property identified on Annex A-1 as Aloft Nashville
  West End, representing approximately 2.5% of the Initial Pool Balance, provides that
  so long as certain entities affiliated with American International Group,Â Inc. own
  and control the borrower, the non-recourse carve-out guarantor and environmental indemnitor
  have no obligation or liability under the related guaranty or environmental indemnity
  to the extent the same first arises after the earliest of (1) the date the borrower has
  tendered a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure satisfying certain requirements in the loan agreement
  and a title company is unconditionally prepared to record the deed and issue a title
  policy in the unpaid principal amount of the loan, subject only to permitted encumbrances,
  (2) the date all amounts then due under the loan documents and environmental indemnity
  have been paid in full, or if earlier, the date of any collateral release under the loan
  documents, and (3) the date that title to the Mortgaged Property is transferred pursuant
  to a foreclosure sale or deed-in-lieu. The release of liability described above applies
  to all matters covered by the non-recourse carveout guaranty (including full recourse
  items such as voluntary bankruptcy and non-permitted transfers) and the environmental
  indemnity. The guarantor and environmental indemnitor is currently AIG Global Real Estate
  Investment Corp., which is the non-member manager of the borrower and a sister company
  of the borrower; both such guarantor/indemnitor and the borrower are indirectly owned
  by American International Group, Inc.

Â

Â 

Â 
Farmington,
Dollar General â Rice, Dollar General â Bloomington, Dollar General - Cape Girardeau and Dollar General â Troy,
collectively representing approximately 1.5% of the Initial Pool Balance, there is no separate environmental indemnitor other
than the related borrower.
Â 
In
addition, there may be impediments and/or difficulties in enforcing some or all of the non-recourse carveout liability obligations
of individual guarantors depending on the domicile or citizenship of the guarantor.
Â 
See
âRisk FactorsâRisks Relating to the Mortgage LoansâMortgage Loans Are Non-Recourse and Are Not Insured or
Guaranteedâ.
Â 
Real
Estate and Other Tax Considerations
Â 
Below
are descriptions of real estate tax matters relating to certain Mortgaged Properties.
Â 


Â·
With respect to the property identified on Annex A-1 to this prospectus
  as Harbor Pointe Apartments, representing approximately 5.0% of the Initial Pool Balance, the related Mortgaged Property is
  subject to a payment-in-lieu-of-taxes agreement with the City of Bayonne (âPILOT Agreementâ) whereby the
  related borrower makes payments in lieu of real estate taxes. These payments are lower than what real estate taxes would likely
  be if the Mortgaged Property were not subject to the PILOT Agreement. The PILOT Agreement may be transferred to a successor
  owner (including a mortgagee in foreclosure) only upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, which include, among other
  things: (1) the transferee does not own or lease any other project subject to long term tax exemption at the time of transfer,
  (2) the transferee is formed and eligible to operate under New Jerseyâs Long Term Tax Exemption Law, (3) the related
  borrower is not in default under the PILOT Agreement or New Jerseyâs Long Term Tax Exemption Law, (4) the related borrowerâs
  obligations under the PILOT Agreement are fully assumed by the transferee, (5) the transferee agrees to abide by all terms
  and conditions of the PILOT Agreement, (6) the principal owners of the transferee possess the same business reputation, financial
  qualifications and credit worthiness as the related borrower and are otherwise reputable and (7)Â the transfer is approved
  by the City of Bayonne. We cannot assure you that a similar program would be available in the event of foreclosure or transfer
  in lieu of foreclosure to a subsequent owner not meeting the transfer requirements of the PILOT Agreement. Additionally, the
  related borrower is required to offer 13 units as affordable rental units under the PILOT Agreement.

Â 


Â·
With respect to the Mortgaged Property identified on AnnexÂ A-1
  to this prospectus as Dollar Self Storage, representing approximately 0.9% of the Initial Pool Balance, the Mortgaged Property
  is located in a local improvement district (the âLIDâ) in Henderson, Nevada and the borrower is required
  to pay a special assessment that, together with other assessments on properties located in the LID, is used to pay debt service
  on certain bonds that were issued to refinance bonds that financed certain infrastructure projects in the LID. The remaining
  unbilled principal amount of the special assessment was $184,421 as of DecemberÂ 1, 2015, with semi-annual payments due
  on JuneÂ 1 and DecemberÂ 1 of each year through DecemberÂ 1, 2021. The special assessment is senior to the lien
  of the Mortgage, however, the lender required the borrower to escrow $2,600 per month to cover the special assessment.

Â 
Delinquency
Information
Â 
As
of the Cut-off Date, none of the Mortgage Loans will be 30 days or more delinquent and none of the Mortgage Loans have been 30
days or more delinquent since origination. A Mortgage Loan will be treated as 30 days delinquent if the scheduled payment for
a due date is not received from the related borrower by the immediately following due date.
Â 
None
of the Mortgage Loans were 30 days or more delinquent as of the Cut-off Date, and no Mortgage Loan has been 30 days or more delinquent
during the 12 months preceding the Cut-off Date (or since the date of origination if such Mortgage Loan has been originated within
the past 12 months).

Â 
Twenty-seven
(27) Mortgage Loans, representing approximately 48.0% of the Initial Pool Balance, provide for payments of interest-only for the
first 24 to 84 months following the cut-off date and thereafter provide for regularly scheduled payments of interest and principal
based on an amortization period longer than the remaining term of the related Mortgage Loan and therefore have an expected Balloon
Balance at the related maturity date.
Â 
Twenty-five
(25) Mortgage Loans (excluding interest-only and partial interest-only Mortgage Loans), representing approximately 23.6% of the
Initial Pool Balance, provide for payments of interest and principal and then have an expected Balloon Balance at the maturity
date.
Â 
Twelve
(12) Mortgage Loans, representing approximately 26.9% of the Initial Pool Balance, provide for interest only payments for the
entire term to stated maturity, with no scheduled amortization prior to that date.
Â 
Seven
(7) Mortgage Loans, representing approximately 1.5% of the Initial Pool Balance, provide for interest-only payments prior to a
specified Anticipated Repayment Date, occurring approximately 10 years following the related origination date, with no scheduled
amortization prior to that date.

(1)
Includes one (1) Mortgage Loan, representing approximately 2.5% of
  the Initial Pool Balance, which has a 5-day grace period after written notice with a maximum notice requirement of once per
  year after default occurs without such notice.

Â 
As
used in this prospectus, âgrace periodâ is the number of days before a payment default is an event of default under
the terms of each Mortgage Loan. See AnnexÂ A-1 for information on the number of days before late payment charges are due
under the Mortgage Loans. The information on AnnexÂ A-1 regarding the number of days before a late payment charge is due is
based on the express terms of the Mortgage Loans. Some jurisdictions may impose a statutorily longer period.
Â 
All
of the Mortgage Loans are secured by first liens on fee simple and/or leasehold interests in the related Mortgaged Properties,
subject to the permitted exceptions reflected in the related title insurance policy. All of the Mortgage Loans bear fixed interest
rates.
Â 
All
of the Mortgage Loans accrue interest on the basis of the actual number of days in a month, assuming a 360-day year (âActual/360
Basisâ).
Â 
ARD
Loan
Â 
Seven
(7) Mortgage Loans securing the Mortgaged Properties or portfolio of Mortgaged Properties identified as Reasorâs Foods-Bixby,
Harpâs Foods-Grove, Dollar General-Farmington, Dollar General-Rice, Dollar General-Bloomington, Dollar General-Cape Girardeau
and Dollar General-Troy, on Annex A-1 (the âARD Loanâ), collectively representing approximately 1.5% of the
Initial Pool Balance, provides that, after a certain date (the âAnticipated Repayment Dateâ), if the related
borrower has not prepaid the ARD Loan in full, any principal outstanding on that date will accrue interest at an increased interest
rate (the âRevised Rateâ) rather than the stated Mortgage Rate (the âInitial Rateâ). See
Annex A-1 for the Anticipated Repayment Date and the Revised Rate for the ARD Loan.

Â 


186
Â 
Â 
After
its Anticipated Repayment Date, the ARD Loan further requires that all cash flow available from the related Mortgaged Properties
after payment of the monthly debt service payments required under the terms of the related Mortgage Loan documents and all escrows
and property expenses required under the related Mortgage Loan documents be used to accelerate amortization of principal (without
payment of any Yield Maintenance Charge or Prepayment Premium) on the ARD Loan. While interest at the Initial Rate continues to
accrue and be payable on a current basis on the ARD Loan after its Anticipated Repayment Date, the payment of Excess Interest,
to the extent actually collected, will be deferred and will be required to be paid, only after the outstanding principal balance
of the ARD Loan has been paid in full, at which time the Excess Interest will be paid to the holders of the ClassÂ V certificates.
See âRisk FactorsâRisks Relating to the Mortgage LoansâRisks of Anticipated Repayment Date Loansâ.
Â 
Prepayment
Protections and Certain Involuntary Prepayments
Â 
All
of the Mortgage Loans have a degree of voluntary prepayment protection in the form of defeasance or prepayment lockout provisions
and/or yield maintenance provisions. Voluntary prepayments, if permitted, generally require the payment of a Yield Maintenance
Charge or a Prepayment Premium unless the Mortgage Loan (or Whole Loan, if applicable) is prepaid within a specified period (ranging
from approximately 3 to 7 payments) up to and including the stated maturity date. See AnnexÂ A-1 and AnnexÂ A-2 for more
information on the prepayment protections attributable to the Mortgage Loans on a loan-by-loan basis and a pool basis.
Â 
Additionally,
certain Mortgage Loans may provide that in the event of the exercise of a purchase option by a tenant or the sale of real property
or the release of a portion of the Mortgaged Property, that the related Mortgage Loans may be prepaid in part prior to the expiration
of a prepayment/defeasance lockout provision. See ââPartial Releasesâ below.
Â 
Generally,
no Yield Maintenance Charge will be required for prepayments in connection with a casualty or condemnation, unless, in the case
of most of the Mortgage Loans, an event of default has occurred and is continuing. See âRisk FactorsâRisks Relating
to the Mortgage LoansâRisks Relating to Enforceability of Yield Maintenance Charges, Prepayment Premiums or Defeasance Provisionsâ
in the prospectus. In addition, certain of the Mortgage Loans permit the related borrower, after a total or partial casualty or
partial condemnation, to prepay the remaining principal balance of the Mortgage Loan (after application of the related insurance
proceeds or condemnation award to pay the principal balance of the Mortgage Loan), which may not be accompanied by any prepayment
consideration.
Â 
Certain
of the Mortgage Loans are secured in part by letters of credit and/or cash reserves that in each such case:
Â 


Â·
will be released to the related borrower upon satisfaction by the
  related borrower of certain performance related conditions, which may include, in some cases, meeting debt service coverage
  ratio levels and/or satisfying leasing conditions; and

Â 


Â·
if not so released, may, at the discretion of the lender, prior
  to loan maturity (or earlier loan default or loan acceleration), be drawn on and/or applied to prepay the subject Mortgage
  Loan if such performance related conditions are not satisfied within specified time periods.

Â 
See
AnnexÂ A-1 and A-3 for more information on reserves relating to the largest 15 Mortgage Loans.
Â 


187
Â 
Â 
Voluntary
Prepayments
Â 
As
of origination, the following prepayment restrictions and defeasance provisions applied to the Mortgage Loans:
Â 


Â·
Fifty-two (52) of the Mortgage Loans, representing approximately
  81.3% of the Initial Pool Balance, each prohibit voluntary principal prepayments during a specified period of time (each,
  a âLock-out Periodâ) but permit the related borrower (after an initial period of at least two years following
  the date of initial issuance of the Offered Certificates) for a specified period to defease the related Mortgage Loan by pledging
  non-callable United States Treasury obligations and other non-callable government securities within the meaning of SectionÂ 2(a)(16)
  of the Investment Company Act, as amended (âGovernment Securitiesâ) that provide for payment on or prior
  to each Due Date through and including the maturity date or Anticipated Repayment Date, as applicable (or, in some cases,
  such earlier Due Date on which the Mortgage Loan becomes freely prepayable), of amounts at least equal to the amounts that
  would have been payable on those dates under the terms of the subject Mortgage Loan and obtaining the release of the related
  Mortgaged Property from the lien of the related mortgage, and thereafter such Mortgage Loan is freely prepayable.

Â 


Â·
Six (6) of the Mortgage Loans representing approximately 8.7% of
  the Initial Pool Balance, each prohibit voluntary principal prepayments during a Lock-out Period, and following such Lock-out
  Period, for a specified period of time, permit the related borrower to make voluntary principal prepayments upon the payment
  of the greater of a Yield Maintenance Charge or Prepayment Premium, and thereafter such Mortgage Loan is freely prepayable.

Â 


Â·
Five (5) of the Mortgage Loans, representing approximately 5.3%
  of the Initial Pool Balance, each prohibit voluntary principal prepayments during a Lock-out Period, and following such Lock-out
  Period, for a specified period of time, permit the related borrower to make voluntary principal prepayments upon the payment
  of the greater of a Yield Maintenance Charge or Prepayment Premium or to defease the related Mortgage Loan by pledging Government
  Securities that provide for payment on or prior to each Due Date through and including the maturity date or Anticipated Repayment
  Date, as applicable (or, in some cases, such earlier Due Date on which the Mortgage Loan becomes freely prepayable), of amounts
  at least equal to the amounts that would have been payable on those dates under the terms of the subject Mortgage Loan and
  obtaining the release of the related Mortgaged Property from the lien of the related mortgage, and thereafter such Mortgage
  Loan is freely prepayable.

Â 


Â·
One (1) Mortgage Loan, representing approximately 3.1% of the Initial
  Pool Balance, prohibits voluntary principal prepayments during a Lock-out Period, and following such Lock-out Period, for
  a specified period of time, permits the related borrower to make voluntary principal prepayments upon the payment of the greater
  of a Yield Maintenance Charge or Prepayment Premium, and following such specified period of time, for a further specified
  period of time permits the related borrower to make voluntary principal prepayments upon the payment of the greater of a Yield
  Maintenance Charge or Prepayment Premium or to defease such Mortgage Loan by pledging Government Securities that provide for
  payment on or prior to each Due Date through and including the maturity date or Anticipated Repayment Date, as applicable
  (or, in some cases, such earlier Due Date on which the Mortgage Loan becomes freely prepayable), of amounts at least equal
  to the 

Â 


188
Â 

Â 
amounts that would have been payable on those dates under the terms of the subject Mortgage Loan and obtaining the
  release of the related Mortgaged Property from the lien of the related mortgage, and thereafter such Mortgage Loan is freely
  prepayable.
Â 


Â·
Seven (7) of the Mortgage Loans, representing approximately 1.5%
  of the Initial Pool Balance, each permit voluntary principal prepayments upon the payment of a Yield Maintenance Charge for
  a period and thereafter permit prepayment upon the payment of a Yield Maintenance Charge or to defease the related Mortgage
  Loan by pledging Government Securities that provide for payment on or prior to each Due Date through and including the maturity
  date or Anticipated Repayment Date, as applicable (or, in some cases, such earlier Due Date on which the Mortgage Loan becomes
  freely prepayable), of amounts at least equal to the amounts that would have been payable on those dates under the terms of
  the subject Mortgage Loan and obtaining the release of the related mortgage, a period and thereafter such Mortgage Loan is
  freely prepayable.

Â 
The
Mortgage Loans generally permit voluntary prepayment without payment of a Yield Maintenance Charge or any Prepayment Premium during
a limited âopen periodâ immediately prior to and including the stated maturity date, as follows:

Charges, Prepayment Premiums or Defeasance Provisionsâ.
Â 
âDue-On-Saleâ
and âDue-On-Encumbranceâ Provisions
Â 
The
Mortgage Loans generally contain âdue-on-saleâ and âdue-on-encumbranceâ clauses, which in each case permits
the holder of the Mortgage Loan to accelerate the maturity of the related Mortgage Loan if the related borrower sells or otherwise
transfers or encumbers (subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Mortgage Loan documents) the related Mortgaged Property
or a controlling interest in the borrower without the consent of the mortgagee (which, in some cases, may not be unreasonably
withheld). Many of the Mortgage Loans place certain restrictions (subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Mortgage Loan
documents) on the transfer and/or pledging of general partnership and managing member equity interests in a borrower such as specific
percentage or control limitations. The terms of the mortgages generally permit, subject to certain limitations, affiliate, estate
planning and family transfers, transfers at death, transfers of interest in a public company, the transfer or pledge of less than
a controlling portion of the partnership, membersâ or other equity interests in a borrower, the transfer or pledge of passive
equity interests in a borrower (such as limited partnership interests and non-managing member interests in a limited liability
company) and transfers to persons specified in or satisfying qualification criteria set forth in the related loan documents. Certain
of the Mortgage Loans do not restrict the pledging of direct or indirect ownership interests in the related borrower, but do restrict
the transfer of ownership interests in the related borrower by imposing a
Â 


189
Â 
Â 
specific percentage, a control limitation or requiring
the consent of the mortgagee to any such transfer. Generally, the Mortgage Loans do not prohibit transfers of non-controlling
interests so long as no change of control results or, with respect to Mortgage Loans to tenant-in-common borrowers, transfers
to new tenant-in-common borrowers. Certain of the Mortgage Loans do not prohibit the pledge by direct or indirect owners of the
related borrower of equity distributions that may be made from time to time by the borrower to its equity owners.
Â 
Additionally,
certain of the Mortgage Loans provide that transfers of the Mortgaged Property are permitted if certain conditions are satisfied,
which may include one or more of the following:
Â 


Â·
no event of default has occurred;

Â 


Â·
the proposed transferee is creditworthy and has sufficient experience
  in the ownership and management of properties similar to the Mortgaged Property;

Â 


Â·
a Rating Agency Confirmation has been obtained from each of the
  Rating Agencies;

Â 


Â·
the transferee has executed and delivered an assumption agreement
  evidencing its agreement to abide by the terms of the Mortgage Loan together with legal opinions and title insurance endorsements;
  and

Â 


Â·
the assumption fee has been received (which assumption fee will
  be paid as described under âPooling and Servicing AgreementâServicing and Other Compensation and Payment of
  Expensesâ, but will in no event be paid to the Certificateholders); however, certain of the Mortgage Loans allow
  the borrower to sell or otherwise transfer the related Mortgaged Property a limited number of times without paying an assumption
  fee.

Â 
Transfers
resulting from the foreclosure of a pledge of the collateral for a mezzanine loan (if any) will also result in a permitted transfer.
See ââAdditional Indebtednessâ below.
Â 
Defeasance
Â 
The
terms of sixty-five (65) of the Mortgage Loans (the âDefeasance Loansâ), representing approximately 91.2% of
the Initial Pool Balance, permit the applicable borrower at any time (provided that no event of default exists) after a
specified period (the âDefeasance Lock-Out Periodâ) to obtain a release of a Mortgaged Property from the lien
of the related Mortgage (a âDefeasance Optionâ) in connection with a defeasance. With respect to all of the
Defeasance Loans, the Defeasance Lock-Out Period ends at least two years after the Closing Date.
Â 
Exercise
of a Defeasance Option is also generally conditioned on, among other things, (a)Â the borrower providing the mortgagee with
at least 30 days prior written notice of the date on which such defeasance will occur (such date, the âRelease Dateâ),
and (b)Â the borrower (A)Â paying on any Release Date (i)Â all accrued and unpaid interest on the principal balance
of the Mortgage Loan (or, the related Whole Loan) up to and including the Release Date, (ii)Â all other sums (excluding scheduled
interest or principal payments due following the Release Date), due under the Mortgage Loan (or Whole Loan, if applicable) and
under all other loan documents executed in connection with the Defeasance Option, (iii)Â an amount (the âDefeasance
Depositâ) that will be sufficient to (x)Â purchase non-callable obligations of, or backed by the full faith and
credit of, the United States of America or, in certain cases, other âgovernment securitiesâ (within the meaning of
SectionÂ 2(a)(16) of the
Â 


190
Â 
Â 
Investment Company Act of 1940 and otherwise satisfying REMIC requirements for defeasance collateral),
that provide payments (1)Â on or prior to, but as close as possible to, all successive scheduled due dates occurring during
the period from the Release Date to the related maturity date (or to the first day of the open period for such Mortgage Loan)
(or Whole Loan, if applicable) and (2)Â in amounts equal to the scheduled payments due on such due dates under the Mortgage
Loan (or Whole Loan, if applicable), or under the defeased portion of the Mortgage Loan (or Whole Loan, if applicable) in the
case of a partial defeasance, including in the case of a Mortgage Loan with a balloon payment due at maturity or anticipated repayment
date, the balloon payment, and (y)Â pay any costs and expenses incurred in connection with the purchase of such government
securities, and (B)Â delivering a security agreement granting the issuing entity a first priority lien on the Defeasance Deposit
and, in certain cases, the government securities purchased with the Defeasance Deposit and an opinion of counsel to such effect.
Â 
For
additional information on Mortgage Loans that permit partial defeasance, see ââPartial Releasesâ below.
Â 
In
general, if consistent with the related loan documents, a successor borrower established, designated or approved by the master
servicer will assume the obligations of the related borrower exercising a Defeasance Option and the borrower will be relieved
of its obligations under the Mortgage Loan. If a Mortgage Loan (or Whole Loan, if applicable) is partially defeased, if consistent
with the related loan documents, generally the related promissory note will be split and only the defeased portion of the borrowerâs
obligations will be transferred to the successor borrower.
Â 
Partial
Releases
Â 
The
Mortgage Loans described below permit the release of one or more of the Mortgaged Properties or a portion of a single Mortgaged
Property in connection with a partial defeasance, a partial prepayment or a partial substitution, subject to the satisfaction
of certain specified conditions, including the REMIC requirements. Additionally, certain Mortgage Loans permit the addition of
real property to the Mortgage Loan collateral.
Â 
With
respect to the Mortgage Loan secured by the Mortgaged Properties identified on Annex A-1 to this prospectus as Pineapple Hotel
Portfolio, which represents approximately 6.1% of the Initial Pool Balance, the borrowers may obtain the release of any individual
Mortgaged Property from the lien of such Mortgage Loan upon a third-party sale of such Mortgaged Property provided that certain
conditions are satisfied, including: (i) defeasance or prepayment of 120% of the allocated loan amount for such property being
sold and, in the case of a prepayment, payment of the greater of a Yield Maintenance Premium or Prepayment Premium on the principal
amount being repaid; (ii) no event of default then exists under the loan documents; (iii) after giving effect to such release,
the amortizing debt service coverage ratio for the remaining Mortgaged Properties will be no less than the greater of (x) the
amortizing debt service coverage ratio immediately preceding such release and (y) 1.95x; (iv) after giving effect to such release,
the loan-to-value ratio of the remaining Mortgaged Properties will not be greater than the lesser of (a) the loan-to-value ratio
on the premises immediately preceding such partial release and (b) 60.0%, (v) receipt of a REMIC opinion and (vi) at the lenderâs
option, receipt of a rating agency confirmation from each rating agency rating the certificates that such partial release will
not result in a requalification, reduction or withdrawal of the rating assigned to the certificates by such rating agency. In
the event of a prepayment in connection with a partial release, the Mortgage Loan documents provide that the monthly debt service
payment will be reamortized based on the then remaining portion of the original 30-year amortization period.
Â 


191
Â 
Â 
With
respect to the Mortgage Loans secured by the Mortgaged Properties identified on Annex A-1 to this prospectus as Adler Office and
Adler Industrial, respectively, which Mortgage Loans are cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted, and represent in the aggregate
approximately 5.7% of the Initial Pool Balance, each such Mortgage Loan permits the release of specified parcels of land and improvements
securing such Mortgage Loan (each such parcel, a âRelease Parcelâ) in connection with a bona fide sale of any
such Release Parcel to a third party, provided that certain conditions are satisfied, including: (i)Â defeasance of
an amount equal to the greater of 115% of the allocated loan amount of such Release Parcel and 100% of the proceeds received by
the borrower in connection with such partial release, net of closing costs with respect to the partial release, (ii)Â a combined
amortizing debt service coverage ratio for both such Mortgage Loans following such partial release of not less than the greater
of (a)Â the combined amortizing debt service coverage ratio for both such Mortgage Loans immediately preceding the partial
release and (b)Â 1.25x; (iii)Â a combined loan-to-value ratio for both such Mortgage Loans following such partial release
not greater than the lesser of (a)Â the combined loan-to-value ratio for both such Mortgage Loans immediately preceding the
release and (b)Â 64.0%; (iv)Â the lease rollover for the remaining Mortgaged Property securing the applicable Mortgage
Loan after the partial release must not be greater than 30% of net rentable area in any given year, (v)Â receipt of a REMIC
opinion and (vi)Â at the lenderâs option, receipt of rating agency confirmation.
Â 
In
addition, each of the Adler Office Mortgage Loan and Adler Industrial Mortgage Loan may be separately defeased in full, without
full defeasance of the other such Mortgage Loan; provided that such other Mortgage Loan must be partially defeased in an
amount equal to 15% of the original principal balance of the Mortgage Loan that is being fully defeased (but without any corresponding
release of the non-fully-defeased Mortgage Loanâs related Mortgaged Properties). A defeasance in full of either such Mortgage
Loan is conditioned upon satisfaction of conditions similar to those described above, except that the debt service coverage ratio
and loan-to-value ratio conditions will be based solely on the remaining Mortgage Loan after such defeasance. Upon the full defeasance
of either the Adler Office Mortgage Loan or Adler Industrial Mortgage Loan, the related Mortgaged Properties securing the defeased
Mortgage Loan will be released. In addition, the related Mortgage Loan documents provide that any funds remaining in the upfront
reserve for future tenant improvement and leasing commissions under the defeased Mortgage Loan are to be retained by the lender
as security for the remaining Mortgage Loan.
Â 
With
respect to the Mortgage Loan secured by the Mortgaged Properties identified on Annex A-1 to this prospectus as Heritage Industrial
Portfolio, representing approximately 4.1% of the Initial Pool Balance, a release of individual Mortgaged Properties is permitted
subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including: (i)Â defeasance of a principal balance equal to the greater
of (a)Â 120% of the allocated loan amount for the Mortgaged Properties located in Pennsylvania (2294 Molly Pitcher Highway
and 1001 & 1011 Air Park Drive) and Guilderland, New York (8 Northeastern Industrial Park, 21 Northeastern Industrial Park
and 22 Northeastern Industrial Park) or 110% of the allocated loan amount for all other Mortgaged Properties; and (b)Â an
amount equal to 100% of the net proceeds of the sale of the released Mortgaged Property; (ii)Â the remaining Mortgaged Properties,
following release, would have (x)Â an amortizing debt service coverage ratio utilizing annual net operating income (without
deduction for tenant improvements, leasing commissions or replacement reserves) from leases on the remaining premises that have
remaining terms of at least 18 months of at least 1.25x and (y)Â a loan-to-value ratio of not more than 75.0%; (iv)Â at
the lenderâs option, the lender has received confirmation from each rating agency rating the Offered Certificates that such
release will not result in a downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of its ratings assigned to the Offered Certificates, along
with similar
Â 


192
Â 
Â 
confirmations from each rating agency rating any securities backed by the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Companion
Loan; and (v)Â receipt of a REMIC opinion. Certain of the Mortgaged Properties are located on the same tax parcel as certain
of the other Mortgaged Properties. With respect to such Mortgaged Properties, separate partial release is permitted so long as
the borrower furnishes evidence that the released Mortgaged Property is either separately assessed or that separate assessment
procedures have been initiated.
Â 
With
respect to the Mortgage Loan secured by the Mortgaged Properties identified on Annex A-1 to this prospectus as the Harvey Building
Products Portfolio, representing approximately 3.3% of the Initial Pool Balance, the borrower may obtain the release of one or
more individual Mortgaged Properties at the expiration of the lockout period, provided that, among other things, (i)Â no
event of default has occurred and is continuing, (ii)Â the borrower partially defeases the Mortgage Loan in an amount equal
to the greater of (x)Â the net sales proceeds with respect to such individual Mortgaged Property and (y)Â 125% of the
Allocated Loan Amount for such individual Mortgaged Property and (iii)Â if, after such release, at least $11,000,000 of the
principal amount of the Mortgage Loan has been repaid or defeased, the loan-to-value ratio for the remaining Mortgaged Properties
is no greater than 60.0%.
Â 
Furthermore,
some of the Mortgage Loans permit the release or substitution of specified parcels of real estate or improvements that secure
the Mortgage Loans but were not assigned any material value or considered a source of any material
cash flow for purposes of determining the related Appraised Value or Underwritten Net Cash Flow or considered material to the
use or operation of the property. Such real estate may be permitted to be released, subject to certain REMIC rules, without payment
of a release price and consequent reduction of the principal balance of the subject Mortgage Loan or substitution of additional
collateral if zoning and other conditions are satisfied.

Charges, Prepayment Premiums or Defeasance Provisionsâ.
Â 
Escrows
Â 
Fifty-four
(54) of the Mortgage Loans, representing approximately 79.1% of the Initial Pool Balance, provide for monthly or upfront escrows
to cover property taxes on the Mortgaged Properties.
Â 
Forty-six
(46) of the Mortgage Loans, representing approximately 72.9% of the Initial Pool Balance, provide for monthly or upfront escrows
to cover ongoing replacements and capital repairs.
Â 
Thirty-six
(36) of the Mortgage Loans, representing approximately 60.7% of the Initial Pool Balance, provide for monthly or upfront escrows
to cover insurance premiums on the Mortgaged Properties.
Â 
Two
(2) of the Mortgage Loans, representing approximately 3.0% of the Initial Pool Balance, provide for monthly or upfront escrows
to cover planned capital expenditures or franchise-mandated property improvement plans.
Â 
Twenty-four
(24) of the Mortgage Loans, representing approximately 76.3% of the Initial Pool Balance, are secured in whole or in part by office,
retail, industrial and mixed use properties, provide for upfront or monthly escrows (or credit) for the full term or a portion
of the term of the related Mortgage Loan to cover anticipated re-leasing costs, including tenant improvements and leasing commissions
or other lease termination or occupancy
Â 


193
Â 
Â 
issues. Such escrows are typically considered for office, retail, industrial and mixed
use properties only.
Â 
Certain
of the Mortgage Loans described above permit the related borrower to post a letter of credit in lieu of maintaining cash reserves.
In addition, in certain cases, the related borrower may not be required to maintain the escrows described above until the occurrence
of a specified trigger.
Â 
Many
of the Mortgage Loans provide for other escrows and reserves, including, in certain cases, reserves for debt service, operating
expenses, vacancies at the related Mortgaged Property and other shortfalls or reserves to be released under circumstances described
in the related Mortgage Loan documents.

Â 
The
following is a description of the types of cash management provisions to which the borrowers under the Mortgage Loans are subject:
Â 


Â·
Hard/Upfront Cash Management. The related borrower is required
  to instruct the tenants and other payors (including any third party property managers) to pay all rents and other revenue
  directly to a lockbox account controlled by the applicable servicer on behalf of the issuing entity. Funds are then swept
  into a cash management account controlled by the applicable servicer on behalf of the issuing entity and then applied by the
  applicable servicer in accordance with the related Mortgage Loan documents. This typically includes the payment of debt service
  and, in some cases, expenses at the related Mortgaged Property. Generally, excess funds may then be remitted to the related
  borrower.

Â 


Â·
Hard/Springing Cash Management. The related borrower is required
  to instruct the tenants and other payors (including any third party property managers) to pay all rents and other revenue
  directly to a lockbox account controlled by the applicable servicer on behalf of the issuing entity. Until the occurrence
  of a âtriggerâ event, which typically includes an event of default under the Mortgage Loan documents, such funds
  are forwarded to an account controlled by the related borrower or are 

Â Â 

194
Â 

Â 
otherwise
made available to the related borrower. From and after the occurrence of such a âtriggerâ event, only the portion
of such funds remaining after the payment of current debt service, the funding of reserves and, in some cases, expenses at the
related Mortgaged Property are to be forwarded or otherwise made available to the related borrower or, in some cases, maintained
in an account controlled by the servicer as additional collateral for the loan until the âtriggerâ event ends or terminates
in accordance with the loan documentation.
Â 


Â·
Soft/Upfront Cash Management. Revenue from the related Mortgaged
  Property is generally paid by the tenants and other payors to the related borrower or the property manager. The related borrower
  or property manager, as applicable, then forwards such funds to a lockbox account controlled by the applicable servicer on
  behalf of the issuing entity. Funds are then swept into a cash management account controlled by the applicable servicer on
  behalf of the issuing entity and applied by the servicer in accordance with the related Mortgage Loan documents. This typically
  includes the payment of debt service and, in some cases, expenses at the related Mortgaged Property. Generally, excess funds
  may then be remitted to the related borrower.

Â 


Â·
Soft/Springing Cash Management. Revenue from the related
  Mortgaged Property is generally paid by the tenants and other payors (including any third party property managers) to the
  related borrower or the property manager. The related borrower or property manager, as applicable, then forwards such funds
  to a lockbox account controlled by the applicable servicer on behalf of the issuing entity. Until the occurrence of a âtriggerâ
  event, which typically includes an event of default under the Mortgage Loan documents, such funds are forwarded to an account
  controlled by the related borrower or is otherwise made available to the related borrower. In some cases, upon the occurrence
  of such a âtriggerâ event, the Mortgage Loan documents will require the related borrower to instruct tenants and/or
  other payors to pay directly into an account controlled by the applicable servicer on behalf of the issuing entity. All funds
  held in such lockbox account controlled by the applicable servicer following such âtriggerâ event will be applied
  by the applicable servicer in accordance with the related Mortgage Loan documents. From and after the occurrence of such a
  trigger event, only the portion of such funds remaining after the payment of current debt service and, in some cases, expenses
  at the related Mortgaged Property are to be forwarded or otherwise made available to the related borrower.

Â 


Â·
Springing. A lockbox account is established at origination
  or upon the occurrence of certain âtriggerâ events. Revenue from the related Mortgaged Property is generally paid
  by the tenants and other payors to the related borrower or property manager. The Mortgage Loan documents provide that, upon
  the occurrence of a âtriggerâ event, which typically includes an event of default under the Mortgage Loan documents,
  the related borrower would be required to instruct tenants to pay directly into such lockbox account or, if tenants are directed
  to pay to the related borrower or the property manager, the related borrower or property manager, as applicable, would then
  forward such funds to a lockbox account controlled by the applicable servicer on behalf of the issuing entity. Funds are then
  swept into a cash management account controlled by the servicer on behalf of the issuing entity and applied by the servicer
  in accordance with the related Mortgage Loan documents. This typically includes the payment of debt service and, in some cases,
  expenses at the related Mortgaged Property. Excess funds may then be remitted to the related borrower.

Â 

Â 


Â·
None. Revenue from the related Mortgaged Property is paid
  to the related borrower and is not subject to a lockbox account as of the Closing Date, and no lockbox account is required
  to be established during the term of the related Mortgage Loan.

Â 
In
connection with any hard lockbox cash management, income deposited directly into the related lockbox account may not include amounts
paid in cash and/or checks that are paid directly to the related property manager, notwithstanding requirements to the contrary.
Furthermore, with respect to certain multifamily and hospitality properties considered to have a hard lockbox, cash, checks and
âover-the-counterâ receipts may be deposited into the lockbox account by the property manager. Mortgage Loans whose
terms call for the establishment of a lockbox account require that the amounts paid to the property manager will be deposited
into the applicable lockbox account on a regular basis. Lockbox accounts will not be assets of the issuing entity. See the footnotes
to AnnexÂ A-1 to this prospectus for more information regarding lockbox provisions for the Mortgage Loans.

Â 


Â·
With respect to the Mortgage Loan secured by the portfolio of Mortgaged
  Properties identified on Annex A-1 to this prospectus as Pineapple Hotel Portfolio, representing approximately 6.1% of the
  Initial Pool Balance, underwritten occupancy (89.1%) is greater than 80.0%, which represents an exception to the underwriting
  guidelines for Principal Commercial Capital. Inclusion of this Mortgage Loan in this securitization transaction notwithstanding
  this exception was supported by the following: (a) the Mortgage Loan has an U/W NOI Debt Yield and U/W NCF DSCR of 13.6% and
  1.96x, respectively, as well as a Cut-Off Date LTV and Balloon or ARD LTV Ratio of 60.0% and 51.8%, respectively; (b) if the

  of Washington Medical Center. In addition, the property condition report identified Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990
  (the âADAâ) deficiencies for two out of the three Mortgaged Properties in the portfolio. Principal Commercial
  Capital did not require the related borrower to complete all recommended ADA compliance items, however the Mortgage Loan agreement
  contains a non-recourse carveout for any loss or 

Â Â 

196
Â 

Â Â 
damage
arising from the Mortgaged Properties not being ADA accessible. Certain characteristics of the Mortgage Loan are set forth on
Annex A-1 to this prospectus. Based on the foregoing factors and Principal Commercial Capitalâs evaluation of the quality
of the portfolio of Mortgaged Properties, Principal Commercial Capital approved the inclusion of the Mortgage Loan in this securitization
transaction.

Â 
Additional
Indebtedness
Â 
General
Â 
The
Mortgage Loans generally prohibit borrowers from incurring any additional debt secured by their Mortgaged Property without the
consent of the lender. However:
Â 


Â·
substantially all of the Mortgage Loans permit the related borrower
  to incur limited indebtedness in the ordinary course of business that is not secured by the related Mortgaged Property;

Â 


Â·
the borrowers under certain of the Mortgage Loans have incurred
  and/or may incur in the future unsecured debt other than in the ordinary course of business;

Â 


Â·
any borrower that is not required pursuant to the terms of the related
  Mortgage Loan documents to meet single purpose entity criteria may not be restricted from incurring unsecured debt or mezzanine
  debt;

Â 


Â·
the terms of certain Mortgage Loans permit the borrowers to post
  letters of credit and/or surety bonds for the benefit of the mortgagee under the Mortgage Loans, which may constitute a contingent
  reimbursement obligation of the related borrower or an affiliate. The issuing bank or surety will not typically agree to subordination
  and standstill protection benefiting the mortgagee;

Â 


Â·
although the Mortgage Loans generally place certain restrictions
  on incurring mezzanine debt by the pledging of general partnership and managing member equity interests in a borrower, such
  as specific percentage or control limitations, the terms of the Mortgage Loan documents generally permit, subject to certain
  limitations, the pledge of the limited partnership or non-managing membership equity interests in a borrower or less than
  a controlling interest of any other equity interests in a borrower; and

Â 


Â·
certain of the Mortgage Loans do not restrict the pledging of ownership
  interests in the borrower, but do restrict the transfer of ownership interests in a borrower by imposing limitations on transfer
  of control or a specific percentage of ownership interests.

Â 


198
Â 
Â 


Â 
Whole Loans
Â 
Certain Mortgage Loans are subject
to the rights of a related Companion Loan holder, as further described in ââThe Whole Loansâ below.
Â 
Mezzanine Indebtedness
Â 
Although the Mortgage Loans generally
place certain restrictions on incurring mezzanine debt by the pledging of general partnership and managing member equity interests
in a borrower, such as specific percentage or control limitations, the terms of the Mortgage Loan documents generally permit, subject
to certain limitations, the pledge of less than a controlling portion of the limited partnership or non-managing membership equity
interests in a borrower. Certain Mortgage Loans described below permit the incurrence of mezzanine debt subject to satisfaction
of certain conditions including a certain maximum combined loan-to-value ratio and/or a minimum combined debt service coverage
ratio, and in some cases mezzanine debt is already in place. Also, certain of the Mortgage Loans do not restrict the pledging of
ownership interests in the related borrower, but do restrict the transfer of ownership interests in a borrower by imposing limitations
on transfer of control or a specific percentage of ownership interests. In addition, in general, a borrower (or its direct or indirect
owners) that does not meet single-purpose entity criteria may not be restricted in any way from incurring mezzanine debt.

In addition, in the case of one (1) Mortgaged
Property identified on Annex A-1 to this prospectus as Haydenâs Crossing, representing approximately 1.4% of the Initial
Pool Balance, Redwood Acquisition LLC, an affiliate of the borrower, obtained a loan in the amount of $4 million from Next Sparc
LLC, a 10% member of the borrower, secured by a pledge of the membership interests in the borrower and in an affiliate of the borrower.
Redwood Acquisition LLC and Next Sparc LLC executed a subordination and standstill agreement which prohibits Next Sparc LLC from
exercising its ability to foreclose on the membership interests in the borrower at any time during the term of the Mortgage Loan.
Â 
In each case, the mezzanine indebtedness
is coterminous with the related Mortgage Loan.

Â 
Â 
Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot, representing approximately 11.9% of the Initial Pool Balance, is subject to an intercreditor
agreement between the holder of the related mezzanine loan and the related lender under the related Mortgage Loan that, in each
case, sets forth the relative priorities between the related Mortgage Loan and the related mezzanine loan. Each intercreditor agreement
provides, among other things, generally that (a)Â all payments due under the related mezzanine loan are subordinate after an
event of default under the related Mortgage Loan to any and all payments required to be made under the related Mortgage Loan (except
for any payments from funds other than the mortgaged property or proceeds of any enforcement upon the mezzanine loan collateral
and any mezzanine loan guarantees), (b)Â so long as there is no event of default under the related Mortgage Loan, the related
mezzanine lender may accept payments on and prepayments of the related mezzanine loan; provided, however, that prepayment
of the mezzanine loan is not permitted prior to the prepayment in full of the related Mortgage Loan, (c)Â the related mezzanine
lender will have certain rights to receive notice of and cure defaults under the related Mortgage Loan prior to any acceleration
or enforcement of the related Mortgage Loan, (d)Â the related mezzanine lender may amend or modify the related mezzanine loan
in certain respects without the consent of the related mortgage lender, and the mortgage lender must obtain the mezzanine lenderâs
consent to amend or modify the Mortgage Loan in certain respects, (e)Â upon the occurrence of an event of default under the
related mezzanine loan documents, the related mezzanine lender may foreclose upon the membership interests in the related Mortgage
Loan borrower, which could result in a change of control with respect to the related Mortgage Loan borrower and a change in the
management of the related Mortgaged Properties, (f)Â if the related Mortgage Loan is accelerated or, in some cases, becomes
specially serviced or if a monetary or material non-monetary default occurs and continues for a specified period of time under
the related Mortgage Loan or if the Mortgage Loan borrower becomes a debtor in a bankruptcy or if the related Mortgage Loan lender
exercises any enforcement action under the related Mortgage Loan documents with respect to the related Mortgage Loan borrower or
the related Mortgaged Properties, the related mezzanine lender has the right to purchase the related Mortgage Loan, in whole but
not in part, for a price generally equal to the outstanding principal balance of the related Mortgage Loan, together with all accrued
interest and other amounts due thereon, plus any advances made by the related Mortgage Loan lender or its servicer and any interest
thereon plus, subject to certain limitations, any Liquidation Fees and Special Servicing Fees payable under the PSA, but generally
excluding any late charges, default interest, exit fees, special maintenance charges payable in connection with a prepayment or
Yield Maintenance Charges and Prepayment Premiums and (g) an event of default under the related Mortgage Loan will trigger an event
of default under the mezzanine loan.
Â 
The Mortgage Loans generally place certain
restrictions on the transfer and/or pledging of general partnership and managing member equity interests in a borrower such as
specific percentage or control limitations as described under ââCertain Terms of the Mortgage LoansââDue-On-Saleâ
and âDue-On-Encumbranceâ Provisionsâ above. Certain of the Mortgage Loans do not prohibit the pledge by direct
or indirect owners of the related borrower of equity distributions that may be made from time to time by the borrower to its equity
owners.
Â 
With respect to the Mortgage Loan secured
by the Mortgaged Properties identified on Annex A-1 to this prospectus as Pineapple Hotel Portfolio, which represents approximately
6.1% of the Initial Pool Balance, there are two borrowers, the fee owner of the Mortgaged Properties and an operating lessee of
the Mortgaged Properties. A family trust of which Michelle Foreman Barnet, the non-recourse carveout guarantor, is a trustee (the
âMFB Family Trustâ), owns a 49% equity ownership interest in an entity named Dream Legacy LLC
Â 

200
Â 
Â 
(âFee
Borrower Parentâ), which owns 100% of the equity ownership interest in the fee owner borrower, Dream Legacy PRU SPE LLC.
The other 51% equity ownership interest in Fee Borrower Parent is owned by a family trust of which Diane Foreman, Michelle Foreman
Barnetâs mother, is a trustee. The MFB Family Trust obtained its 49% equity ownership interest in Fee Borrower Parent from
Diane Foreman and, in connection therewith executed a promissory note in favor of Diane Foreman. The MFB Family Trust has pledged
its equity ownership interest in Fee Borrower Parent to Diane Foreman to secure such promissory note. There is no intercreditor
agreement relating to such promissory note and pledge.
Â 
With respect to the Mortgage Loans listed
in the following chart, the direct and indirect equity owners of the borrower are permitted to incur future mezzanine debt, subject
to the satisfaction of conditions contained in the related loan documents, including, among other things, a combined maximum loan-to-value
ratio, a combined minimum debt service coverage ratio and/or a combined minimum debt yield, as listed in the following chart and

(1)Indicates
  the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Mortgage Loan and the related mezzanine
  loan (if any) that is specifically stated in the loan documents and does not take account
  of any restrictions that may be imposed at any time by operation of any debt yield, debt
  service coverage ratio or loan-to-value ratio conditions.
Â 

(2)Debt
  service coverage ratios, loan-to-value ratios and debt yields are to be calculated in
  accordance with definitions set forth in the related loan documents. Except as otherwise
  noted in connection with a Mortgage Loan, the determination of the loan-to-value ratio
  must be, or may be required by the lender to be, based on a recent appraisal.
Â 

(3)Indicates
  whether the conditions to the financing include (a)Â delivery of Rating Agency confirmation
  that the proposed financing will not, in and of itself, result in the downgrade, withdrawal
  or qualification of the then-current rating assigned to any class of certificates and/or
  (b)Â acceptability of any related intercreditor or mezzanine loan documents to the
  Rating Agencies.
Â 

(4)The
  loan documents provide that an affiliate of the lender or an affiliate of Principal Real
  Estate Investors, LLC will have the first opportunity to provide the mezzanine financing,
  which election is required to be made within ten days of delivery of all requested information.
Â 

(5)Mortgage
  lender is allowed to require rating agency confirmation only if specifically required
  by the procedures promulgated by any rating agency rating the Offered Certificates.
Â 
The
specific rights of the related mezzanine lender with respect to any such future mezzanine loan will be specified in the related
intercreditor agreement and may include rights substantially similar to the cure and repurchase rights described above. The intercreditor
agreement required to be entered into in connection with any future mezzanine loan will be subject to receipt of a Rating Agency
Confirmation or to the related lenderâs approval. The direct and/or indirect owners of a borrower under a Mortgage Loan
are also generally permitted to pledge their interest in such borrower as security for a mezzanine loan in circumstances where
the ultimate transfer of such interest to the mezzanine lender would be a permitted transfer under the related Mortgage Loan documents.
Â 
Generally,
upon a default under a mezzanine loan, subject to the terms of any applicable intercreditor or subordination agreement, the holder
of the mezzanine loan would be entitled to foreclose upon the equity in the related borrower, which has been pledged to secure
payment of such debt. Although this transfer of equity may not trigger the due on sale clause under the related Mortgage Loan,
it could cause a change in control of the borrower and/or cause the obligor under the mezzanine loan to file for bankruptcy, which
Â 


202
Â 
Â 
could
negatively affect the operation of the related Mortgaged Property and the related borrowerâs ability to make payments on
the related Mortgage Loan in a timely manner.
Â 
With
respect to the Mortgage Loan secured by the portfolio of Mortgaged Properties identified on Annex A-1 to this prospectus as the
Harvey Building Products Portfolio, representing approximately 3.3% of the Initial Pool Balance, the related loan documents allow
for the pledge of direct or indirect interests in the guarantor of the Mortgage Loan to secure corporate level financing, provided
that the value of the Mortgaged Properties are not more than 25% of the value of all security for such financing. There is
no requirement for an intercreditor agreement in connection with such pledges.

Entails Riskâ.
Â 
Other
Unsecured Indebtedness
Â 
The
Mortgage Loans generally permit a pledge of the same direct and indirect ownership interests in any borrower that could be transferred
without the lender consent. See ââCertain Terms of the Mortgage LoansââDue-on-Saleâ and âDue-on-Encumbranceâ
Provisionsâ above.
Â 
Some
of the Mortgage Loans permit certain affiliates of the related borrower to pledge their indirect ownership interests in the borrower
including, but not limited to, pledges to an institutional lender providing a corporate line of credit or corporate credit facility
as collateral for such corporate line of credit or corporate credit facility. In connection with those pledges, the Mortgage Loan
documents for such Mortgage Loans may: (i)Â contain limitations on the amounts that such collateral may secure and prohibit
foreclosure of such pledges unless such foreclosure would represent a transfer otherwise permitted under the Mortgage Loan documents
but do not prohibit a change in control in the event of a permitted foreclosure; or (ii)Â require that such financing be secured
by at least a certain number of assets other than such ownership interests in the related borrower.
Â 
In
addition, the borrowers under some of the Mortgage Loans or group of cross-collateralized Mortgage Loans have incurred or are
permitted to incur unsecured subordinate debt (in addition to trade payables, equipment financing and other debt incurred in the
ordinary course) subject to the terms of the related Mortgage Loan documents. For example, with respect to the 15 largest loans
presented on AnnexÂ A-3 to this prospectus:
Â 

Â·The
  Mortgaged Properties identified on Annex A-1 to this prospectus as the Harvey Building
  Products Portfolio, which secure a Mortgage Loan representing approximately 3.3% of the
  Initial Pool Balance, are held by the borrower, Harvey Propco, LLC, while ongoing manufacturing
  and distribution operations will be owned by Harvey Industries, Inc., a subsidiary of
  the borrowerâs indirect parent company, which is the sole tenant at the Mortgaged
  Properties pursuant to a master lease. In connection with the sponsorâs acquisition
  of Harvey Industries, Inc., Harvey Industries, Inc. obtained (i)Â a $30,000,000 revolving
  line of credit and (ii)Â a $70,000,000 term loan secured by all of the assets and
  stock of Harvey Industries, Inc. The revolver and term loan lenders do not have a direct
  or indirect lien on the Mortgaged Properties or on the equity of the borrower.
Â 

Â·With
  respect to the Mortgaged Property identified on Annex A-1 to this prospectus as Aloft
  Nashville West End, which secures a Mortgage Loan representing approximately 2.5% of
  the Initial Pool Balance, the related borrower acquired the
Â 


203
Â 
Â 

Mortgaged
  Property from a seller which had received âkey moneyâ from its franchisor.
  In connection with the issuance of a new franchise agreement, the borrower assumed the
  obligation to pay the balance of the unamortized key money (which is currently $1,104,167)
  if the franchise agreement is terminated prior to its stated expiration date. The borrowerâs
  obligation to pay such funds, if any, is unsecured and no ongoing payments are required
  to be made by the borrower to the franchisor. If the obligation to repay the financing
  is triggered, the unamortized portion of the key money financing will be payable to
  the franchisor. The parent company of the borrower (which is not the guarantor of the
  Mortgage Loan) has guaranteed the borrowerâs obligation to the franchisor to pay
  the unamortized portion of the key money financing. No subordination and standstill agreement
  or intercreditor agreement has been entered into in connection with the key money financing.
  The loan documents include a nonrecourse carve-out to the borrower and guarantor for
  any losses associated with this obligation.
Â 
Prospective
investors should assume that all or substantially all of the Mortgage Loans permit their borrowers to incur a limited amount (generally
in an amount not more than 5% of the original Mortgage Loan balance or an amount otherwise normal and reasonable under the circumstances)
of trade payables, equipment financing and/or other unsecured indebtedness in the ordinary course of business or an unsecured
credit line to be used for working capital purposes. In addition, certain of the Mortgage Loans allow the related borrower to
receive unsecured loans from equity owners, provided that such loans are subject to and subordinate to the applicable Mortgage
Loan.
Â 
Certain
risks relating to additional debt are described in âRisk FactorsâRisks Relating to the Mortgage LoansâOther
Financings or Ability to Incur Other Indebtedness Entails Riskâ.

The
Empire Mall Whole Loan
Â 
General.
One Mortgage Loan, identified as âEmpire Mallâ (the âEmpire Mall Mortgage Loanâ) on AnnexÂ A-1,
representing approximately 7.5% of the Initial Pool Balance, is part of a split loan structure comprised of five mortgage notes,
each of which is secured by the same mortgage instrument on the same underlying Mortgaged Property
Â 
The
Empire Mall Mortgage Loan is evidenced by a promissory note, NoteÂ A-2, with a Cut-off Date Balance of $75,000,000. The related
Companion Loans (the âEmpire Mall Companion Loansâ) are evidenced by four promissory notes, Note A-1 (the âEmpire
Mall Controlling Pari Passu Companion Loanâ), Note A-3, Note A-4 and Note A-5 (collectively, the âEmpire Mall
Non-Controlling Companion Loansâ and, together with the Empire Mall Controlling Pari Passu Companion Loan, the âEmpire
Mall Companion Loansâ), with respective Cut-off Date Balances of $40,000,000, $40,000,000, $25,000,000 and $10,000,000)
that are not included in the issuing entity. Only the Serviced Pari Passu Mortgage Loan is included in the issuing entity. The
Empire Mall Mortgage Loan and the Empire Mall Companion Loans are pari passu with each other in terms of priority and are
collectively referred to in this prospectus as the âEmpire Mall Whole Loanâ. It is anticipated that the Empire
Mall Companion Loans will be included in one or more future securitizations. However, we cannot assure you that this will ultimately
occur. The rights of the issuing entity as the holder of the Empire Mall Mortgage Loan and the rights of the holder(s) of the
Empire Mall Companion Loans are subject to an Intercreditor Agreement (the âEmpire Mall Intercreditor Agreementâ).
The following summaries describe certain provisions of the Empire Mall Intercreditor Agreement.
Â 
Servicing.
Pursuant to the terms of the Empire Mall Intercreditor Agreement, the Empire Mall Whole Loan will be initially serviced and administered
pursuant to the terms of the PSA by the master servicer and the special servicer, as the case may be, according to the Servicing
Standard until the Empire Mall Companion Loan Securitization Date, after which the Empire Mall Whole Loan will be serviced and
administered pursuant to the pooling and servicing agreement (the âEmpire Mall Pooling and Servicing Agreementâ)
entered into in connection with such other securitization and the Empire Mall Intercreditor Agreement. The Empire Mall Intercreditor
Agreement provides that expenses, losses and shortfalls relating to the Empire Mall Whole Loan will be allocated on a pro rata
basis to the holders thereof.
Â 
Advances.
Until the Empire Mall Companion Loan Securitization Date, the master servicer or the trustee, as applicable, under the PSA will
be responsible for making any
Â 


207
Â 
Â 
required
P&I Advance on the Empire Mall Mortgage Loan (but not any advances of principal and/or interest on the Empire Mall Companion
Loans) pursuant to the terms of the PSA and the master servicer, the special servicer (with respect to emergency servicing advances)
or the trustee, as applicable, under the PSA will be responsible for making any required Servicing Advances with respect to the
Empire Mall Whole Loan, in each case unless the master servicer or the trustee, as applicable, or the special servicer under the
PSA determines that such an advance would not be recoverable from collections on the Empire Mall Mortgage Loan (in the case of
a P&I Advance) or the Empire Mall Whole Loan (in the case of a Servicing Advance).
Â 
On
and after the Empire Mall Companion Loan Securitization Date, (i)Â the master servicer or the trustee, as applicable, under
the PSA will be responsible for making any required P&I Advance on the Empire Mall Mortgage Loan (but not any advances of
principal and/or interest on the Empire Mall Companion Loans) pursuant to the terms of the PSA, unless the master servicer or
the trustee, as applicable, or the special servicer under the PSA determines that such an advance would not be recoverable from
collections on the Empire Mall Mortgage Loan and (ii)Â the related Non-Serviced Master Servicer or Non-Serviced Trustee, as
applicable, will be responsible for making (A)Â any required principal and interest advances on the Empire Mall Controlling
Pari Passu Companion Loan as required under the terms of the Empire Mall Pooling and Servicing Agreement (but not on the Empire
Mall Mortgage Loan or the Empire Mall Non-Controlling Companion Loans) and (B)Â any required property protection advances
with respect to the Empire Mall Whole Loan, unless in the case of clauseÂ (A) or (B) above, a similar determination of nonrecoverability
is made under the Empire Mall Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
Â 
Application
of Payments. The Empire Mall Intercreditor Agreement sets forth the respective rights of the holder of the Empire Mall Mortgage
Loan and the holder of the related Empire Mall Companion Loans with respect to distributions of funds received in respect of the
Empire Mall Whole Loan, and provides, in general, that:
Â 

Â·the
  Empire Mall Mortgage Loan and the Empire Mall Companion Loans are of equal priority with
  each other and no portion of any of them will have priority or preference over any portion
  of the other or security therefor;
Â 

Â·all
  payments, proceeds and other recoveries on or in respect of the Empire Mall Whole Loan
  or the related Mortgaged Property will be applied to the Empire Mall Mortgage Loan and
  the related Empire Mall Companion Loans on a pro rata and pari passu basis
  according to their respective outstanding principal balances (subject, in each case,
  to the payment of amounts for required reserves or escrows required by the related Mortgage
  Loan documents and payment and reimbursement rights of the master servicer, the special
  servicer, the operating advisor, the asset representations reviewer, the certificate
  administrator, the depositor and the trustee) in accordance with the terms of the Empire
  Mall Intercreditor Agreement and the PSA and any pooling and servicing agreement related
  to a future securitization that includes the Empire Mall Controlling Pari Passu Companion
  Loan, as applicable; and
Â 

Â·costs,
  fees, expenses, losses and shortfalls relating to the Empire Mall Whole Loan will be
  allocated, on a pro rata and pari passu basis, to the Empire Mall Mortgage
  Loan and the related Empire Mall Companion Loans in accordance with the terms of the
  Empire Mall Intercreditor Agreement.

more information regarding the allocation of collections and expenses in respect of the Empire Mall Whole Loan, see âPooling
and Servicing AgreementâAdvancesâ and ââWithdrawals from the Collection Accountâ.
Â 
Consultation
and Control. The controlling noteholder under the Empire Mall Intercreditor Agreement will initially be SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale as the holder of the Empire Mall Controlling Pari Passu Companion Loan, which from and after the Empire
Mall Companion Loan Securitization Date, is expected to be the controlling class representative or such other party specified
in the Empire Mall Pooling and Servicing Agreement (such party, the âEmpire Mall Directing Holderâ); provided
that if at any time 50% or more of the NoteÂ A-1 is held by the borrower or an affiliate of the borrower under the Empire
Mall Whole Loan, the NoteÂ A-1 holder will not be entitled to exercise any rights of the Empire Mall Directing Holder and
the NoteÂ A-2 holder will be the Empire Mall Directing Holder unless 50% or more of NoteÂ A-2 is held by the borrower
or an affiliate of the borrower under the Empire Mall Mortgage Loan; provided, further, that if at any time 50%
or more of each of NoteÂ A-1 and NoteÂ A-2 is held by the borrower or an affiliate of the borrower under the Empire Mall
Mortgage Loan, neither the holder of NoteÂ A-1 nor the holder of NoteÂ A-2 will be entitled to exercise any rights of
the Empire Mall Directing Holder and the NoteÂ A-3 holder will be the Empire Mall Directing Holder unless 50% or more of NoteÂ A-3
is held by the borrower or an affiliate of the borrower under the Empire Mall Mortgage Loan; provided, further,
that if at any time 50% or more of each of NoteÂ A-1, NoteÂ A-2 and NoteÂ A-3 is held by the borrower or an affiliate
of the borrower under the Empire Mall Mortgage Loan, none of the holder of NoteÂ A-1, the holder of NoteÂ A-2 and the
holder of NoteÂ A-3 will be entitled to exercise any rights of the Empire Mall Directing Holder and the NoteÂ A-4 holder
will be the Empire Mall Directing Holder unless 50% or more of NoteÂ A-4 is held by the borrower or an affiliate of the borrower
under the Empire Mall Mortgage Loan; and provided, further, that if at any time 50% or more of each of NoteÂ A-1,
NoteÂ A-2, NoteÂ A-3 and NoteÂ A-4 is held by the borrower or an affiliate of the borrower under the Empire Mall Mortgage
Loan, none of the holder of NoteÂ A-1, the holder of NoteÂ A-2, the holder of NoteÂ A-3 and the holder of NoteÂ A-4
will be entitled to exercise any rights of the Empire Mall Directing Holder and the NoteÂ A-5 holder will be the Empire Mall
Directing Holder unless 50% or more of NoteÂ A-5 is held by the borrower or an affiliate of the borrower under the Empire
Mall Mortgage Loan. If 50% or more of each of NoteÂ A-1, NoteÂ A-2, NoteÂ A-3, NoteÂ A-4 and NoteÂ A-5 is
held by the borrower or an affiliate of the borrower under the Empire Mall Mortgage Loan, no person will be entitled to exercise
the rights of the Empire Mall Directing Holder. In its capacity as the controlling noteholder under the Empire Mall Intercreditor
Agreement, the Empire Mall Directing Holder will be entitled to exercise rights similar to those of the Directing Certificateholder
as set forth under âPooling and Servicing AgreementâThe Directing Certificateholderâ with respect to
the Empire Mall Whole Loan.
Â 
In
addition, pursuant to the terms of the Empire Mall Intercreditor Agreement, the issuing entity as holder of the Empire Mall Mortgage
Loan (or prior to the occurrence and continuance of a Control Termination Event, the Directing Certificateholder) will (i)Â have,
after the Empire Mall Companion Loan Securitization Date, the right to receive copies of all notices, information and reports
that the related Non-Serviced Master Servicer or Non-Serviced Special Servicer is required to provide to the Empire Mall Directing
Holder (within the same time frame such notices, information and reports are or would have been required to be provided to the
Empire Mall Directing Holder under the Empire Mall Pooling and Servicing Agreement without regard to the occurrence of any control
event or consultation termination event) with respect to any major decisions to be taken with respect to the Empire Mall Whole
Loan or the implementation of any recommended action outlined in an Asset Status Report relating to the Empire Mall Whole Loan
and (ii)Â have the right to be consulted on a strictly non-binding basis with respect to certain major decisions to be taken
Â 


209
Â 
Â 
with
respect to the Empire Mall Whole Loan or the implementation of any recommended action outlined in an Asset Status Report relating
to the Empire Mall Whole Loan. The consultation right of the holder of the Empire Mall Mortgage Loan (or its representative) will
expire 10 business days following the delivery of written notice and information relating to the matter subject to consultation
whether or not the holder of the Empire Mall Mortgage Loan (or its representative) has responded within such period; provided
that if the related Non-Serviced Master Servicer or Non-Serviced Special Servicer, as applicable, proposes a new course of
action that is materially different from the actions previously proposed, the 10 business-day consultation period will be deemed
to begin anew from the date of delivery of such new proposal and delivery of all information related to such new proposal. Prior
to the Empire Mall Companion Loan Securitization Date, the holder of the Empire Mall Non-Controlling Companion Loans (or their
representatives) will be entitled to the same information and consultation rights set forth above. Notwithstanding the consultation
rights of the holder of the Empire Mall Mortgage Loan (or its representative) described above, the related Non-Serviced Master
Servicer or Non-Serviced Special Servicer, as applicable, is permitted to take any material action or any action set forth in
the Asset Status Report before the expiration of the aforementioned 10 business-day period if it determines that immediate action
with respect to such decision is necessary to protect the interests of the holders of the Empire Mall Mortgage Loan and the Empire
Mall Companion Loans. Prior to the Empire Mall Companion Loan Securitization Date, the master servicer and special servicer will
be entitled to take such action after making such a determination as set forth in the preceding sentence. Neither the related
Non-Serviced Master Servicer or Non-Serviced Special Servicer, as applicable, will be obligated at any time to follow or take
any alternative actions recommended by the holder of the Empire Mall Mortgage Loan (or its representative, including the Directing
Certificateholder) and neither the master servicer nor the special servicer for this transaction will be obligated at any time
to follow or take any alternative actions recommended by the holders of the Empire Mall Mortgage Loan or the Empire Mall Non-Controlling
Companion Loans (or their representatives, including the directing certificateholder under the Empire Mall Pooling and Servicing
Agreement).
Â 
After
the Empire Mall Companion Loan Securitization Date, in addition to the consultation rights of the issuing entity (or its representative)
described above, pursuant to the terms of the Empire Mall Intercreditor Agreement, the issuing entity (or its representative)
will have the right to attend (in-person or telephonically in the discretion of the related Non-Serviced Master Servicer or Non-Serviced
Special Servicer, as applicable) annual meetings with the related Non-Serviced Master Servicer or Non-Serviced Special Servicer,
as applicable, upon reasonable notice and at times reasonably acceptable to the related Non-Serviced Master Servicer or Non-Serviced
Special Servicer, as applicable, for the purpose of discussing servicing issues related to the Empire Mall Whole Loan.
Â 
Sale
of Defaulted Empire Mall Whole Loan. Pursuant to the terms of the Empire Mall Intercreditor Agreement, if the Empire Mall
Mortgage Loan becomes a Defaulted Loan, and if the special servicer (or, after the Empire Mall Companion Loan Securitization Date,
the related Non-Serviced Special Servicer) determines pursuant to the PSA (or the Empire Mall Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
as the case may be) and the Empire Mall Intercreditor Agreement to pursue a sale of the Empire Mall Mortgage Loan (or the Empire
Mall Companion Loans, as the case may be), the special servicer or related Non-Serviced Special Servicer, as applicable, will
be required to sell the Empire Mall Mortgage Loan together with the Empire Mall Companion Loans as a single whole loan, subject
to the satisfaction of certain notice and information delivery requirements and the trusteeâs (or any third party hired
by the trustee in accordance with the PSA) or the related Non-Serviced Trusteeâs (or any third party hired by such Non-Serviced
Trustee in accordance with the Empire Mall Pooling and Servicing Agreement), as applicable, obligation to review whether any offer
Â 


210
Â 
Â 
from
an Interested Person received for the Empire Mall Mortgage Loan and the Empire Mall Companion Loans constitutes a fair price.
In connection with any such sale, the applicable special servicer will be required to follow the procedures set forth under âPooling
and Servicing AgreementâRealization Upon Mortgage Loansâ or similar procedures.
Â 
Notwithstanding
the foregoing, on and after the Empire Mall Companion Loan Securitization Date, the related Non-Serviced Special Servicer will
not be permitted to sell the Empire Mall Mortgage Loan together with the Empire Mall Companion Loans if the loan becomes a defaulted
whole loan without the written consent of the holder of the Empire Mall Mortgage Loan (provided that such consent is not
required if the holder of the Empire Mall Mortgage Loan is the borrower or an affiliate of the borrower) unless the related Non-Serviced
Special Servicer has delivered to the holder of the Empire Mall Mortgage Loan: (a)Â at least 15 business days prior written
notice of any decision to attempt to sell the related Whole Loan; (b)Â at least 10 days prior to the proposed sale date, a
copy of each bid package (together with any material amendments to such bid packages) received by the related Non-Serviced Special
Servicer in connection with any such proposed sale; (c)Â at least 10 days prior to the proposed sale date, a copy of the most

Special
Servicer Appointment Rights. Prior to the Empire Mall Companion Loan Securitization Date, the holder of the Empire Mall Controlling
Pari Passu Companion Loan will have the right to replace the special servicer then acting with respect to the Empire Mall Whole
Loan and appoint a replacement special servicer, solely with respect to the Empire Mall Whole Loan. On and after the Empire Mall
Companion Loan Securitization Date, pursuant to the terms of the Empire Mall Intercreditor Agreement, the Empire Mall Directing
Holder (which, unless a control termination event or consultation termination event exists under the Empire Mall Pooling and Servicing

Loan and appoint a replacement special servicer without the consent of the holder of the Empire Mall Mortgage Loan. The directing
certificateholder under the Empire Mall Pooling and Servicing Agreement (so long as no control termination event has occurred
and is continuing), and the applicable certificateholders with the requisite percentage of voting rights (if a control termination
event has occurred and is continuing) will exercise the rights of the issuing entity as controlling noteholder, and will have
the right, with or without cause, to replace the related Non-Serviced Special Servicer then acting with respect to the Empire
Mall Whole Loan and appoint a replacement special servicer, pursuant to terms substantially similar to those as described under

The
Heritage Industrial Portfolio Whole Loan
Â 
General
Â 
OneÂ (1)
Mortgage Loan, secured by a portfolio of Mortgaged Properties identified on AnnexÂ A-1 to this prospectus as âHeritage
Industrial Portfolioâ (the âHeritage Industrial Portfolio Mortgage Loanâ), representing approximately
4.1% of the Initial Pool Balance, is part of a split loan structure comprised of two mortgage notes, each of which is secured
by the same mortgage instruments on the same underlying Mortgaged Properties.
Â 
The
Heritage Industrial Portfolio Mortgage Loan is evidenced by a promissory note with a Cut-off Date Balance of $41,000,000. The
related Companion Loan (the âHeritage Industrial Portfolio Companion Loanâ) is evidenced by a promissory note
with a Cut-off Date Balance of $40,375,000 that is not included in the issuing entity. The Heritage Industrial Portfolio Mortgage
Loan and the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Companion Loan are collectively referred to in this prospectus as the âHeritage
Industrial Portfolio Whole Loanâ. It is anticipated that the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Companion Loan will be included
in one or more future securitizations, however, we cannot assure you that this will ultimately occur.
Â 
Servicing
Â 
The
Heritage Industrial Portfolio Whole Loan and any related REO Property will be serviced and administered by the master servicer
and, if necessary, the special servicer, pursuant to the PSA, in the manner described under âPooling and Servicing Agreementâ
in this prospectus, but subject to the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreement. In servicing the Heritage Industrial Portfolio
Whole Loan, the Servicing Standard set forth in the PSA will require the master servicer and the special servicer to take into
account the interests of the Certificateholders and the related Companion Holder as a collective whole.
Â 
Amounts
payable to the issuing entity as holder of the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Mortgage Loan pursuant to the related Intercreditor
Agreement will be included in the Available Funds for the related Distribution Date to the extent described in this prospectus
and amounts payable to the related Companion Holder will be distributed to such holder net of certain fees and expenses on the
Heritage Industrial Portfolio Companion Loan as provided in the related Intercreditor Agreement.
Â 
Application
of Payments
Â 
The
related Intercreditor Agreement sets forth the respective rights of the holder of the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Mortgage Loan
and the holder of the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Companion Loan with respect to distributions of funds received in respect
of the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Whole Loan, and provides, in general, that:
Â 

Â·the
  Heritage Industrial Portfolio Mortgage Loan and Heritage Industrial Portfolio Companion
  Loan are of equal priority with each other and no portion of either of them will have
  priority or preference over any portion of the other or security therefor;
Â 

Â·all
payments, proceeds and other recoveries on or in respect of the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Whole Loan or the related Mortgaged
Property will be applied to the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Mortgage Loan and the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Companion Loan
on a pro rata and pari passu basis according to their respective outstanding principal balances (subject, in each case, to the
payment and reimbursement rights of the master servicer, the special servicer, the operating
Â 


212
Â 
Â 


advisor, the certificate administrator and the trustee)
  in accordance with the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreement and the PSA; and

Â 

Â·costs,
  fees, expenses, losses and shortfalls relating to the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Whole
  Loan will, in general, be allocated, on a pro rata and pari passu basis,
  to the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Mortgage Loan and Heritage Industrial Portfolio
  Companion Loan in accordance with the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreement.
Â 
Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if a P&I Advance is made with respect to the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Mortgage Loan, then that P&I
Advance, together with interest thereon, may only be reimbursed out of future payments and collections on the Heritage Industrial
Portfolio Mortgage Loan or, as and to the extent described under âPooling and Servicing AgreementâAdvancesâ
in this prospectus, on other Mortgage Loans, but not out of payments or other collections on the Heritage Industrial Portfolio
Companion Loan.
Â 
Certain
costs and expenses (such as a pro rata share of a Servicing Advance) allocable to the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Companion
Loan may be paid or reimbursed out of payments and other collections on the Mortgage Pool, subject to the issuing entityâs
right to reimbursement from future payments and other collections on the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Companion Loan or from
general collections with respect to the securitization of the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Companion Loan. This may result in
temporary (or, if not ultimately reimbursed, permanent) shortfalls to the Certificateholders.
Â 
Consultation
and Control
Â 
Pursuant
to the related Intercreditor Agreement, the controlling note holder with respect to the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Whole Loan,
as of any date of determination, will be the trustee on behalf of the issuing entity, as holder of the Mortgage Loan; provided
that, unless a Control Termination Event exists or the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Whole Loan is an Excluded Loan, the Directing
Certificateholder will be entitled to exercise the rights of the controlling note holder with respect to the Heritage Industrial
Portfolio Whole Loan. In such capacity, the Directing Certificateholder will be entitled to exercise all of the rights of the
Directing Certificateholder set forth under âPooling and Servicing AgreementâThe Directing Certificateholderâ
in this prospectus with respect to the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Whole Loan, including consent and/or consultation rights
regarding Major Decisions and approval rights regarding the implementation of any recommended actions outlined in an asset status
report with respect to the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Whole Loan as and to the extent described under âPooling and
Servicing AgreementâThe Directing CertificateholderâMajor Decisionsâ and ââAsset
Status Reportâ in this prospectus. Pursuant to the terms of the PSA, the Directing Certificateholder will have the same
consent and/or consultation rights with respect to the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Whole Loan as it does, and for so long as
it does have similar rights, with respect to the other Mortgage Loans (exclusive of the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans and any Excluded
Loan) included in the issuing entity that do not have Companion Loans.
Â 
In
addition, pursuant to the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreement, the related Companion Holder (or its representative) will
(i)Â have a right to receive copies of all notices, information and reports that the master servicer or the special servicer,
as applicable, is required to provide to the Directing Certificateholder (within the same time frame such notices, information
and reports are or would have been required to be provided to the Directing Certificateholder under the PSA without regard to
the occurrence of a Control Termination Event or Consultation Termination Event) with respect to certain Major Decisions to be
taken with respect to the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Whole Loan or the
Â 


213
Â 
Â 
implementation
of any recommended action outlined in an asset status report relating to the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Whole Loan and (ii)Â have
the right to be consulted on a strictly non-binding basis with respect to certain Major Decisions to be taken with respect to
the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Whole Loan or the implementation of any recommended action outlined in an asset status report
relating to the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Whole Loan. The consultation right of the related Companion Holder (or its representative)
will expire 10 business days following the delivery to such Companion Holder of written notice of a proposed action, together
with copies of the notices, information and reports required to be provided to the Directing Certificateholder, whether or not
the related Companion Holder (or its representative) has responded within such period; provided that if the master servicer
(or the special servicer, as applicable) proposes a new course of action that is materially different from the action previously
proposed, the 10 business day consultation period will be deemed to begin anew. Notwithstanding the related Companion Holderâs
(or its representativeâs) consultation rights described above, the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable,
is permitted to make such Major Decision or take any action set forth in the asset status report before the expiration of the
aforementioned 10 business day period if it determines that immediate action with respect to such decision is necessary to protect
the interests of the holders of the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Whole Loan. Neither the master servicer nor the special servicer
will be obligated at any time to follow or take any alternative actions recommended by the related Companion Holder (or its representative).
Â 
The
PSA provides that no direction or disapproval of the Companion Holder will (a)Â require the master servicer or the special
servicer to violate the terms of the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Whole Loan, applicable law, or any provision of the PSA, including
the master servicerâs or special servicerâs obligation to act in accordance with the Servicing Standard and to maintain
the REMIC status of each Trust REMIC and the grantor trust status of the Grantor Trust, (b)Â result in the imposition of a
âprohibited transactionâ or prohibited contributionâ tax under the REMIC provisions or (c)Â materially expand
the scope of the special servicerâs, trusteeâs, certificate administratorâs or master servicerâs responsibilities
under the PSA.
Â 
In
addition to the consultation rights of the related Companion Holder (or its representative) described above, pursuant to the terms
of the related Intercreditor Agreement, the related Companion Holder (or its representative) will have the right to attend annual
meetings (which may be held telephonically or in person, at the discretion of the master servicer or the special servicer, as
applicable) with the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, upon reasonable notice and at times reasonably acceptable
to the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, in which servicing issues related to the Heritage Industrial Portfolio
Whole Loan are discussed.
Â 
Application
of Penalty Charges
Â 
The
related Intercreditor Agreement provides that penalty charges paid on the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Whole Loan will first,
be used to reduce, on a pro rata basis, the amounts payable on each of the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Mortgage Loan
and Heritage Industrial Portfolio Companion Loan by the amount necessary to pay the master servicer, the trustee or the special
servicer for any interest accrued on any Servicing Advances and reimbursement of any Servicing Advances in accordance with the
terms of the PSA, second, be used to reduce the respective amounts payable on each of the Heritage Industrial Portfolio
Mortgage Loan and the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Companion Loan by the amount necessary to pay the master servicer and the
trustee, and the master servicer and the trustee for the securitization of the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Companion Loan, for
any interest accrued on any P&I Advance (or analogous P&I advance made pursuant to the
Â 


214
Â 
Â 
document
governing the securitization of the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Companion Loan) made with respect to such loan by such party
(if and as specified in the PSA or the document governing the securitization of the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Companion Loan,
as applicable), third, be used to reduce, on a pro rata basis, the amounts payable on each of the Heritage Industrial
Portfolio Mortgage Loan and the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Companion Loan by the amount necessary to pay additional trust fund
expenses (other than Special Servicing Fees, unpaid Workout Fees and Liquidation Fees) incurred with respect to Heritage Industrial
Portfolio Whole Loan (as specified in the PSA) and, finally, (i)Â in the case of the remaining amount of penalty charges
allocable to the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Mortgage Loan, be paid to the master servicer and/or the special servicer as additional
servicing compensation as provided in the PSA and (ii)Â in the case of the remaining amount of penalty charges allocable to
the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Companion Loan, be paid, (x)Â prior to the securitization of the Heritage Industrial Portfolio
Companion Loan, to the related Companion Holder and (y)Â following the securitization of the Heritage Industrial Portfolio
Companion Loan, to the master servicer and/or the special servicer as additional servicing compensation as provided in the PSA.
Â 
Sale
of Defaulted Whole Loan
Â 
Pursuant
to the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreement, if the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Whole Loan becomes a Defaulted Loan,
and if the special servicer determines to sell the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Mortgage Loan in accordance with the PSA, then
the special servicer will be required to sell the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Companion Loan together with the Heritage Industrial
Portfolio Mortgage Loan as one whole loan in accordance with the procedures set forth under âPooling and Servicing AgreementâSale
of Defaulted Loans and REO Propertiesâ in this prospectus.

the foregoing, the special servicer will not be permitted to sell the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Whole Loan if it becomes a
Defaulted Loan without the written consent of the related Companion Holder (provided that such consent is not required
if the related Companion Holder is the borrower or an affiliate of the borrower) unless the special servicer has delivered to
the related Companion Holder (or its representative): (a)Â at least 15 business daysâ prior written notice of any decision
to attempt to sell the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Whole Loan, (b)Â at least 10Â days prior to the proposed sale date,

the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Whole Loan, and any documents in the servicing file reasonably requested by the related Companion
Holder that are material to the price of the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Whole Loan; and (d)Â until the sale is completed,
and a reasonable period of time (but no less time than is afforded to other offerors and the Directing Certificateholder) prior
to the proposed sale date, all information and other documents being provided to other offerors and all leases or other documents
that are approved by the master servicer or the special servicer in connection with the proposed sale; provided that the
related Companion Holder (or its representative) may waive any of the delivery or timing requirements set forth in this sentence.

the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Whole Loan unless the related Companion Holder is the borrower or an agent or affiliate of the
borrower.

consultation rights with respect to the Anchorage Marriott Downtown Whole Loan as it does, and for so long as it does have similar

(or its representativeâs) consultation rights described above, the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Master Servicer or the CGCMT 2015-GC35
Special Servicer, as applicable, is permitted to make such major decisions or take any action set forth in the asset status report
before the expiration of the aforementioned 10 business day period if it determines that immediate action with respect to such
decision is necessary to protect the interests of the holders of the Anchorage Marriott Downtown Whole Loan. Neither the CGCMT
2015-GC35 Master Servicer nor the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Special Servicer will be obligated at any time to follow or take any alternative
actions recommended by the issuing entity (or its representative).
Â 
Neither
the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Master Servicer nor the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Special Servicer may take or refrain from taking any action pursuant
to instructions from the issuing entity (or its representative) that would cause the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Master Servicer or the CGCMT
2015-GC35 Special Servicer, as applicable, to violate applicable law, the terms of the Anchorage Marriott Downtown Whole Loan,
the related Intercreditor Agreement, the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, including the servicing standard under
the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, or the REMIC provisions or that would (i) expose the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Master
Servicer, the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Special Servicer, the CGCMT 2015-GC35 depositor, a mortgage loan seller with respect to the CGCMT
2015-GC35 securitization, the CGCMT 2015-GC35 issuing entity, the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Trustee, the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Operating Advisor,
the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Certificate Administrator or their respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees or agents to any
claim, suit or liability, (ii) materially expand the scope of the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Master Servicerâs or the CGCMT 2015-GC35
Special Servicerâs responsibilities, or (iii) cause the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Master Servicer or the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Special Servicer
to act, or fail to act, in a manner that is not in the best interests of the CGCMT 2015-GC35 certificateholders.
Â 
In

related Intercreditor Agreement, the issuing entity (or its representative) will have the right to attend annual meetings (which
may be held telephonically or in person, at the discretion of the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Master Servicer or the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Special
Servicer, as applicable) with the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Master Servicer or the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Special Servicer, as applicable, upon
reasonable notice and at times reasonably acceptable to the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Master Servicer or the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Special Servicer,

and reports that the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Master Servicer or the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Special Servicer, as applicable, is required to provide

of the issuing entity (or its representative) will expire 10 business days following the delivery of written notice of the proposed
action, together with copies of the notices, information and reports required to be provided to the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Controlling

that if the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Master Servicer or the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Special Servicer, as applicable, proposes a new course
of action that is materially different from the action previously proposed, the 10 business day consultation period will be deemed
to begin anew. Notwithstanding the issuing entityâs (or its representativeâs) consultation rights described above,
the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Master Servicer or the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Special Servicer, as applicable, is permitted to make such major decisions
or take any action set forth in the asset status report before the expiration of the aforementioned 10 business day period if

Â 
Neither
the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Master Servicer nor the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Special Servicer may take or refrain from taking any action pursuant
to instructions from the issuing entity (or its representative) that would cause the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Master Servicer or the CGCMT
2015-GC35 Special Servicer, as applicable, to violate applicable law, the terms of the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Whole
Loan, the related Intercreditor Agreement, the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, including the
Â 


233
Â 
Â 
servicing
standard under the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, or the REMIC provisions or that would (i) expose the CGCMT
2015-GC35 Master Servicer, the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Special Servicer, the CGCMT 2015-GC35 depositor, a mortgage loan seller with respect
to the CGCMT 2015-GC35 securitization, the CGCMT 2015-GC35 issuing entity, the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Trustee, the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Operating
Advisor, the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Certificate Administrator or their respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees or agents
to any claim, suit or liability, (ii) materially expand the scope of the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Master Servicerâs or the CGCMT
2015-GC35 Special Servicerâs responsibilities, or (iii) cause the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Master Servicer or the CGCMT 2015-GC35
Special Servicer to act, or fail to act, in a manner that is not in the best interests of the CGCMT 2015-GC35 certificateholders.
Â 
In
addition to the consultation rights of the issuing entity (or its representative) described above, pursuant to the terms of the
related Intercreditor Agreement, the issuing entity (or its representative) will have the right to attend annual meetings (which
may be held telephonically or in person, at the discretion of the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Master Servicer or the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Special
Servicer, as applicable) with the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Master Servicer or the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Special Servicer, as applicable, upon

Additional
Information
Â 
Each
of the tables presented in AnnexÂ A-2 sets forth selected characteristics of the pool of Mortgage Loans as of the Cut-off
Date, if applicable. For a detailed presentation of certain additional characteristics of the Mortgage Loans and the Mortgaged
Properties on an individual basis, see AnnexÂ A-1. For a brief summary of the largest 15 Mortgage Loans in the pool of Mortgage
Loans, see AnnexÂ A-3.
Â 
The
description in this prospectus, including AnnexÂ A-1, A-2 and A-3, of the Mortgage Pool and the Mortgaged Properties is based
upon the Mortgage Pool as expected to be constituted at the close of business on the Cut-off Date, as adjusted for the scheduled
principal payments due on the Mortgage Loans on or before the Cut-off Date. Prior to the issuance of the Offered Certificates,
a Mortgage Loan may be removed from the Mortgage Pool if the depositor deems such removal necessary or appropriate or if it is
prepaid. This may cause the range of Mortgage Rates and maturities as well as the other characteristics of the Mortgage Loans
to vary from those described in this prospectus.
Â 
A
Current Report on Form 8-K containing detailed information regarding the Mortgage Loans will be available to persons (including
beneficial owners of the Offered Certificates) who receive this prospectus and will be filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the âExchange Actâ), together with the PSA, with the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (the âSECâ) on or prior to the date of the filing of this prospectus.

General
Â 
Macquarie
US Trading LLC d/b/a Principal Commercial Capital (âPrincipal Commercial Capitalâ), a Delaware limited liability
company, is a sponsor of, and a seller of certain Mortgage Loans (the âPCC Mortgage Loansâ) into, the securitization
described in this prospectus. Macquarie US Trading LLC (âMacquarieâ) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Macquarie
Investments US Inc., a Delaware corporation. Each of Macquarie Investments US Inc. d/b/a Principal Commercial Capital and Macquarie
US Trading LLC d/b/a Principal Commercial Capital is an originator of the PCC Mortgage Loans, and Macquarie Investments US Inc.
d/b/a Principal Commercial Capital will transfer the PCC Mortgage Loans that it originated to Macquarie US Trading LLC d/b/a Principal
Commercial Capital on or prior to the Closing Date. Macquarie Investments US Inc. d/b/a Principal Commercial Capital originated
one (1) PCC Mortgage Loan identified on Annex A-1 to this prospectus as Hawthorne Business Center, representing approximately
1.2% of the Initial Pool Balance, and Macquarie US Trading LLC d/b/a Principal Commercial Capital originated the other eight (8)
PCC Mortgage Loans. Each of Macquarie Investments US Inc. and Macquarie is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Macquarie Group
Limited (âMGLâ), which is an Australian Securities Exchange-listed diversified financial services holding company.
MGL is a global provider of banking, financial, advisory, investment and funds management services.
Â 
Principal
Real Estate Investors, LLC (âPrincipalâ) and Macquarie jointly formed a lending platform, known as Principal
Commercial Capital, in September 2014 to originate and securitize commercial mortgage loans. The executive offices of Principal
Commercial Capital are located at 125 West 55th Street, New York, New York 10019.
Â 
The
Principal Commercial Capital lending platform operates as a line of business established and owned by Macquarie but is jointly
managed by both Principal and Macquarie. Principal provides services relating to the sourcing, underwriting, closing and securitization
of loans for Principal Commercial Capital. Macquarie and its affiliates provide services relating to the pricing, hedging and
securitization of loans for Principal Commercial Capital. PCC Mortgage Loans are funded by either Macquarie Investments US Inc.
d/b/a Principal Commercial Capital or Macquarie US Trading LLC d/b/a Principal Commercial Capital. Principal and Macquarie (and
certain of Macquarieâs affiliates) jointly participate in material decisions, including joint representation on an investment
committee which evaluates and approves all PCC Mortgage Loans prior to origination.
Â 
Principal
Commercial Capitalâs Securitization Program
Â 
The
primary business plan of the Principal Commercial Capital lending platform is to originate, acquire and securitize commercial
real estate loans secured by stabilized income-producing properties. Principal Commercial Capital may also invest in bridge loans
and mezzanine loans. This is the third commercial mortgage-backed securitization to which Principal Commercial Capital is contributing
loans. However, Principal, through its affiliates, was an active seller of commercial real estate loans into commercial mortgage-backed
securitizations from 1999 through 2008, contributing approximately 2,000 loans totaling approximately $16 billion. In addition,
certain members of Macquarie staff who are active in the management of Principal Commercial Capital previously held senior positions
in commercial mortgage-backed securities platforms at other investment banking firms.
Â 
All
of the PCC Mortgage Loans were sourced and underwritten by Principal and funded by either Macquarie Investments US Inc. d/b/a
Principal Commercial Capital or Macquarie
Â 


237
Â 
Â 
US
Trading LLC d/b/a Principal Commercial Capital, and each PCC Mortgage Loan was closed either by Principalâs closing staff
or third party origination counsel.
Â 
Wells
Fargo Bank, National Association acts as interim custodian for the loan files with respect to all of the PCC Mortgage Loans prior
to securitization.
Â 
In
connection with this commercial mortgage securitization transaction, Principal Commercial Capital will transfer the PCC Mortgage
Loans to the depositor, who will then transfer the PCC Mortgage Loans to the issuing entity. In return for the transfer by the
depositor to the issuing entity of the PCC Mortgage Loans (together with the other mortgage loans being securitized), the issuing
entity will issue commercial mortgage pass-through certificates that are, in whole or in part, backed by, and supported by the
cash flows generated by, the mortgage loans being securitized. In coordination with underwriters and initial purchasers engaged
by the depositor, Principal Commercial Capital will work with rating agencies, investors, servicers and other mortgage loan sellers
and will participate in structuring the securitization transaction to maximize the overall value and capital structure, taking
into account numerous factors including without limitation, geographic and property type diversity and rating agency criteria.
Â 
Pursuant
to an MLPA, Macquarie US Trading LLC d/b/a Principal Commercial Capital will make certain representations and warranties, subject
to certain exceptions set forth therein, and undertake certain loan document delivery requirements with respect to the PCC Mortgage
Loans. In the event of an uncured material breach of any such representation and warranty or an uncured material document defect
or omission, Macquarie US Trading LLC d/b/a Principal Commercial Capital, and no other party, will be responsible for curing a
breach or defect, repurchasing an affected PCC Mortgage Loan from the trust fund, substituting the affected PCC Mortgage Loan
with another mortgage loan or making a loss of value payment with respect to such defect or breach. In addition, Macquarie US
Trading LLC d/b/a Principal Commercial Capital has agreed to indemnify the depositor and the underwriters and certain of their
respective affiliates with respect to certain liabilities arising in connection with the issuance and sale of the Offered Certificates.
Â 
Principal
Commercial Capitalâs Underwriting Guidelines and Processes
Â 
Underwriting
guidelines and processes were established by Principal and Macquarie for Principal Commercial Capital. Set forth below is a general
description of these guidelines and processes.
Â 
Notwithstanding
the discussion below, given the unique nature of commercial properties, the underwriting and origination procedures and the credit
analysis with respect to any particular commercial mortgage loan may significantly differ from one asset to another, and will
be driven by circumstances particular to that property, including, among others, the property type, current use, size, location,
market conditions, reserve requirements and additional collateral, tenants and leases, borrower identity, sponsorship, performance
history and/or other factors. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the underwriting of any particular commercial or multifamily
mortgage loan originated or acquired by Principal Commercial Capital will conform to the general guidelines described below. For
important information about the circumstances that have affected the underwriting of the PCC Mortgage Loans, see the âRisk
Factorsâ section of this prospectus, the other subsections of this âTransaction PartiesâThe Sponsors
and Mortgage Loan SellersâPrincipal Commercial Capitalâ section and âExceptions to Mortgage Loan Representations
and Warrantiesâ in AnnexÂ D-2 to this prospectus.
Â 


238
Â 
Â 
If
a mortgage loan exhibits any one of the following characteristics, variances from general underwriting/origination procedures
described below may be considered acceptable under the circumstances indicated: (i)Â low loan-to-value ratio; (ii)Â high
debt service coverage ratio; (iii)Â experienced sponsor(s)/guarantor(s) with financial wherewithal; (iv)Â additional in-place,
ongoing or springing reserves; (v)Â cash flow sweeps; and (vi)Â elements of recourse included in the mortgage loan.
Â 
Loan
Analysis. Loans will be underwritten, not only from a real estate perspective, but also on a credit/cash flow basis. All underwriting
is required to include the development and analysis of cash flow from the collateral and determination of value for the improvements.
The underwriting function will incorporate the following factors into the overall analysis of a transaction:
Â 

Â·Quality
  of the improvements, location and competitiveness of the subject property. Macro
  and sub-market research is reviewed to determine desirability of the location. Site inspections
  are completed to assess the propertyâs functionality, condition, access/visibility
  and overall competitiveness. Review of third party appraisal reports, physical condition
  assessments and environmental reports is also performed by Principalâs in-house
  appraisers and engineers, and results are incorporated into the loan underwriting as
  deemed appropriate.
Â 

Â·Overall
  sustainability of the cash flow from the collateral. Due diligence includes review
  of rent rolls, leases, historical operating statements and occupancy levels. Analysis
  of key tenants is also performed, including financial strength, sales/occupancy cost,
  tenant investment in space, etc. Underwriting considers potential capital outlays for
  tenant improvements, leasing commissions and capital expenditures.
Â 

Â·Sponsorshipâs
  experience and financial capacity. A thorough evaluation of the investment philosophy,
  real estate experience and financial statements of the principal(s) of the borrower is
  conducted on all transactions. Background and credit checks are performed on the borrower
  and key principals to identify any liens, judgments, bankruptcies or pending litigation.
  Borrowers are generally required to be special purpose entities.
Â 
Loan
Approval. All loans originated or acquired for Principal Commercial Capital must be approved by the Principal Commercial Capital
investment committee which consists of representatives from both Principal and Macquarie experienced in commercial real estate
lending. The Principal Commercial Capital investment committee may approve a loan as recommended, request additional due diligence,
modify the loan terms or decline a loan transaction.
Â 
Debt
Service Coverage Ratios and Loan-To-Value Ratios. Generally, the debt service coverage ratios for the PCC Mortgage Loans will
be equal to or greater than 1.20x for all property types except hospitality and self storage properties which will generally have
debt service coverage ratios equal to or greater than 1.30x. Variances may be allowed in circumstances deemed warranted by Principal
Commercial Capital, such as for loans with rapid amortization schedules, higher quality tenant revenue streams or additional collateral
in the form of reserves, letters of credit or guaranties. Debt service coverage ratios are calculated in accordance with Principal
Commercial Capitalâs property-specific underwritten cash flow guidelines.
Â 
Generally,
the loan-to-value ratio for PCC Mortgage Loans will be equal to or less than 80%. Variances may be allowed in circumstances deemed
warranted by Principal
Â 


239
Â 
Â 
Commercial
Capital, such as for loans with rapid amortization schedules, higher quality tenant revenue streams or additional collateral in
the form of reserves, letters of credit or guaranties.
Â 
Additional
Debt. Additional debt in the form of mezzanine debt, B-notes or preferred equity may be permitted either at the time of loan
origination or during the loan term subject to certain loan-to-value constraints or debt service coverage requirements. When underwriting
an asset, Principal Commercial Capital will review terms of such additional debt and will analyze the likely effect of that additional
debt on repayment of the subject mortgage loan. It is possible that Macquarie or Principal or affiliates of either firm will be
the lender on such additional debt and may either sell such debt to an unaffiliated third party or hold it in inventory.
Â 
Assessments
of Property Condition. As part of the underwriting process, Principal Commercial Capital will analyze the condition of the
real property collateral for a prospective multifamily or commercial mortgage loan. Principal will generally perform site inspections
of the subject property or, in limited instances, engage a third party to complete the inspection. In most cases Principal Commercial
Capital will obtain the independent assessments and reports described below.
Â 
Appraisal
Reports. Principal Commercial Capital will in most cases require that the real property collateral for a prospective multifamily
or commercial mortgage loan be appraised by an appraiser who is a member of the Appraisal Institute, a membership association
of professional real estate appraisers or an otherwise qualified appraiser. In certain situations, an update to an existing independent
appraisal may be acceptable. The appraisal reports are required to be conducted in accordance with the Uniform Standards of Professional
Appraisal Practices developed by The Appraisal Foundation, a not-for-profit organization established by the appraisal profession.
The appraisal will include or be accompanied by a separate letter that includes a statement by the appraiser that the appraisal
was prepared in conformity with FIRREA.
Â 
Environmental
Assessments. Principal Commercial Capital will in most cases require a Phase I environmental assessment with respect to the
real property collateral for a prospective multifamily or commercial mortgage loan; however, when circumstances warrant, Principal
Commercial Capital may utilize an update of a previously conducted environmental assessment. Furthermore, an environmental assessment
conducted at any particular real property collateral will not necessarily cover all potential environmental issues, such as an
analysis of radon, lead-based paint and lead in drinking water, which will usually be conducted only at multifamily properties.
Depending on the findings of the Phase I environmental assessment, any of the following may be required: additional environmental
testing, such as a Phase II environmental assessment with respect to the real property collateral, an environmental insurance
policy, cash reserves for any recommended remediation action and/or a guaranty with respect to environmental matters.
Â 
Engineering
Assessments. Principal Commercial Capital will in most cases require that an engineering firm inspect the real property collateral
for any multifamily or commercial mortgage loan to assess the structure, exterior walls, roofing, interior structure and/or mechanical
and electrical systems; however, when circumstances warrant, Principal Commercial Capital may utilize an update of a previously
conducted engineering assessment. Based on the findings of the engineering assessment, Principal Commercial Capital will determine
the appropriate response, if any, to any recommended repairs, corrections or replacements and any identified deferred maintenance.
In some instances, repairs or maintenance may be completed prior to closing and/or reserves may be established to fund any deferred
maintenance or replacement items.
Â 


240
Â 
Â 
Seismic
Reports. Principal Commercial Capital will in most cases require a seismic report with respect to all multifamily or commercial
mortgage loans located in seismic zones 3 or 4 to provide an estimate of damage based on the percentage of the replacement cost
of the building in an earthquake scenario. This percentage of the replacement cost is expressed in terms of probable maximum loss
(âPMLâ) or scenario expected loss (âSELâ). Generally, any mortgage loans as to which the
mortgaged property was estimated to have PML or SEL in excess of 20% of the estimated replacement cost will be subject to seismic
upgrading, have adequate reserves in place for retrofitting, satisfactory earthquake insurance or be structured with recourse
to a guarantor.
Â 
Zoning
and Building Code Compliance. With respect to each mortgage loan, Principal Commercial Capital will generally consider whether
the use and occupancy of the related real property collateral is in material compliance with zoning, land-use, building rules,
regulations and orders then applicable to that property. Evidence of this compliance may be in the form of one or more of the
following: legal opinions; surveys; recorded documents; temporary or permanent certificates of occupancy; letters from governmental
officials or agencies; title insurance endorsements; third party prepared zoning reports; and/or representations by the related
borrower. Where a mortgaged property as currently operated is a permitted nonconforming use and/or the structure and the improvements
may not be rebuilt to the same dimensions or used in the same manner in the event of a major casualty, Principal Commercial Capital
will consider whether to require the related borrower to obtain law and ordinance coverage and/or whether an alternative mitigating
factor is in place.
Â 
Title
Insurance. Each borrower is required to provide, and Principal Commercial Capital or its origination counsel typically will
review, a title insurance policy for each mortgaged property. The title insurance policies typically must (i)Â be written
by a title insurer licensed to do business in the jurisdiction where the mortgaged property is located, (ii)Â be in an amount
at least equal to the original principal balance of the mortgage loan, (iii)Â provide protection and benefits that run to
the mortgagee and its successors and assigns, (iv)Â be written on an American Land Title Association form or equivalent policy
promulgated in the jurisdiction where the mortgaged property is located and (v)Â if a survey was prepared, have a legal description
of the mortgaged property in the title policy that conforms to that shown on the survey.
Â 
Hazard,
Liability and Other Insurance. Mortgaged properties are typically required to be insured by a hazard insurance policy with
a lender approved deductible and in an amount at least equal to the lesser of the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage
loan and 100% of the full insurable replacement cost of the improvements located on the mortgaged property.
Â 
Flood
insurance, if available, must be in effect for any mortgaged property that at the time of origination included material improvements
in any area identified in the Federal Register by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as having special hazards. The flood
insurance policy must meet the requirements of the then-current guidelines of the Federal Insurance Administration, to be provided
by a generally acceptable insurance carrier in an amount that is generally consistent with currently prevailing capital market
standards.
Â 
The
standard form of hazard insurance policy typically covers physical damage or destruction of improvements on the mortgaged property
caused by fire, lighting, explosion, smoke, windstorm and hail, riot or strike and civil commotion. The policies may contain some
conditions and exclusions from coverage, including exclusions related to acts of terrorism. Generally, each of the mortgage loans
requires that the related property have coverage for terrorism or terrorist acts, if such coverage is available at commercially
Â 


241
Â 
Â 
reasonable
rates; in some cases, there is a cap on the amount that the related borrower will be required to expend on terrorism insurance.
Â 
Each
mortgage loan typically also requires the borrower to maintain comprehensive general liability insurance against claims for personal
and bodily injury, death or property damage occurring on, in or about the property in an amount that is generally consistent with
currently prevailing capital market standards.
Â 
Each
mortgage loan typically further requires the related borrower to maintain business interruption or rent loss insurance in an amount
not less than 100% of the projected rental income from the related property for not less than 12Â months.
Â 
The
mortgaged properties are typically not insured for earthquake risk unless a seismic report indicates a PML or SEL of greater than
20%.
Â 
Escrow
Requirements. Principal Commercial Capital may require borrowers to fund various escrows for taxes and insurance, tenant improvements
and leasing commissions, capital expenses and replacement reserves. Generally, the required escrows for mortgage loans originated
by Principal Commercial Capital are as follows:
Â 

Â·Taxes:
  Typically, an initial deposit and monthly escrow deposits equal to 1/12 of the estimated
  annual property taxes (based on the most recent property assessment and the current millage
  rate) are required. Such escrows may not be required under certain circumstances, including,
  but not limited to (i) if there is an institutional sponsor or the sponsor is a high
  net worth individual, (ii) if and to the extent that a single or major tenant (which
  may be a ground tenant) at the related mortgaged property is required to pay taxes directly,
  and (iii) if there is a low loan-to-value ratio; provided that in each case the
  borrower will generally be required to submit evidence of payment of annual property
  taxes.
Â 

Â·Insurance:
  Typically, if the mortgaged property is insured under an individual policy, an initial
  deposit and monthly escrow deposits equal to 1/12 of the annual property insurance premium
  are required. Such escrows may not be required under certain circumstances, including,
  but not limited to (i) if the borrower maintains a blanket insurance policy, (ii) if
  the mortgaged property is a single tenant property (which may include ground leased tenants)
  and the tenant is required to maintain property insurance, and (iii) if there is a low
  loan-to-value ratio; provided that in each case the borrower will generally be
  required to submit evidence of payment of annual property insurance premiums.
Â 

Â·Replacement
  Reserves: Replacement reserves are generally calculated in accordance with the expected
  useful life of the components of the mortgaged property during the term of the mortgage
  loan. Annual replacement reserves are generally underwritten to the suggested replacement
  reserve amount from a third party property condition or engineering report or to certain
  minimum requirements by property type. Such escrows may not be required under certain
  circumstances, including, but not limited to (i) if a single or investment grade tenant
  (which may be a ground lease tenant) is responsible for all repairs and maintenance under
  the terms of its lease, and (ii) if there is a low loan-to-value ratio.
Â 

Â·Completion
Repair/Environmental Remediation: Typically, a completion repair or remediation reserve is required where an environmental
or property condition report suggests that a reserve is necessary. Upon funding of the mortgage loan, Principal Commercial Capital
generally requires that at least 110-125% of the
Â 


242
Â 
Â 


estimated
cost identified in the environmental or property condition report be reserved and that repairs or replacements be completed within
one year after the funding of the applicable mortgage loan. Such escrows may not be required under certain circumstances, including,
but not limited to (i) if the sponsor of the borrower delivers a guarantee to complete the immediate repairs in a specified amount
of time, (ii) if the deferred maintenance amount does not materially impact the related mortgaged propertyâs function, performance
or value, (iii) if a single or major tenant (which may be a ground lease tenant) at the related mortgaged property is responsible
for the repairs, and (iv) if a secured creditor insurance policy or borrower insurance policy is in place.

Â 

Â·Tenant
  Improvement/Leasing Commissions: In most cases, various tenants have lease expirations
  within the mortgage loan term. To mitigate this risk with respect to industrial, retail
  and office properties, special reserves may be required to be funded either at closing
  of the mortgage loan and/or during the related mortgage loan term or a letter of credit
  and/or a cash flow sweep or a combination of any of the aforementioned alternatives may
  be used to cover certain anticipated leasing commissions or tenant improvement costs
  that might be associated with re-leasing the space occupied by such tenants. Such escrows
  may not be required under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to (i) if
  rent at the mortgaged property is considered below market, and (ii) if no material leases
  expire within the mortgage loan term.
Â 
Furthermore,
Principal Commercial Capital may accept an alternative to a cash escrow or reserve from a borrower, such as a letter of credit
or a guarantee from the borrower, its sponsor or an affiliate, or periodic evidence that the items for which the escrow or reserve
would have been established are being addressed. In addition, under certain circumstances, where (i) positive credit characteristics
exist, (ii) the amounts involved are relatively minimal, or (iii) Principal Commercial Capital has determined the mortgaged property,
the borrower or its owners will likely be able to bear the related expenses without the escrow or reserve, an escrow or reserve
may not be required.
Â 
Exceptions.
One or more of the mortgage loans originated by Macquarie Investments US Inc. d/b/a Principal Commercial Capital or Macquarie
US Trading LLC d/b/a Principal Commercial Capital may vary from the specific Principal Commercial Capital underwriting guidelines
described herein when additional credit positive characteristics are present. In addition, in the case of one or more of the mortgage
loans originated by Macquarie Investments US Inc. d/b/a Principal Commercial Capital or Macquarie US Trading LLC d/b/a Principal
Commercial Capital, such originator may not have applied each of the specific underwriting guidelines described above as the result
of case-by-case permitted flexibility based upon other compensating factors. For any material exceptions to Principal Commercial
Capitalâs underwriting guidelines described above in respect of the PCC Mortgage Loans, see âDescription of the
Mortgage PoolâExceptions to Underwriting Guidelinesâ in this prospectus.
Â 
Review
of PCC Mortgage Loans
Â 
Overview.
Principal Commercial Capital, in its capacity as the sponsor of the PCC Mortgage Loans, has conducted a review of the PCC
Mortgage Loans in connection with the securitization described in this prospectus designed and effected to provide reasonable
assurance that the disclosure related to the PCC Mortgage Loans is accurate in all material respects. Principal Commercial Capital
determined the nature, extent and timing of the review and the level of assistance provided by any third parties. The review of
the PCC Mortgage Loans was performed by a deal team comprised of real estate and securitization
Â 


243
Â 
Â 
professionals
who are employees of Principal and Macquarie (collectively, the âPCC Deal Teamâ) with the assistance of certain
third parties. Principal Commercial Capital has ultimate authority and control over, and assumes all responsibility for and attributes
to itself, the review of the PCC Mortgage Loans and the reviewâs findings and conclusions. The review procedures described
below were employed with respect to all of the PCC Mortgage Loans (rather than relying on sampling procedures), except that certain
review procedures were solely relevant to the large loan disclosures in this prospectus, as further described below.
Â 
Database.
To prepare for securitization, members of the PCC Deal Team created a database of loan-level and property-level information relating
to each PCC Mortgage Loan. The database was compiled from, among other sources, the related mortgage loan documents, third party
reports (appraisals, environmental site assessments, property condition reports, zoning reports and applicable seismic studies),
insurance policies, borrower-supplied information (including, to the extent available, rent rolls, leases, operating statements
and budgets) and information collected by Principal Commercial Capital during the underwriting process. Prior to securitization
of each PCC Mortgage Loan, the PCC Deal Team may have updated the information in the database with respect to such PCC Mortgage
Loan based on current information provided by the related servicer relating to loan payment status and escrows, updated operating
statements, rent rolls and leasing activity, and information otherwise brought to the attention of the PCC Deal Team. Such updates
were not intended to be, and do not serve as, a re-underwriting of any PCC Mortgage Loan.
Â 
A
data tape (the âPCC Data Tapeâ) containing detailed information regarding each PCC Mortgage Loan was created
from the information in the database referred to in the prior paragraph. The PCC Data Tape was used by the PCC Deal Team to provide
the numerical information regarding the PCC Mortgage Loans in this prospectus.
Â 
Data
Comparisons and Recalculation. The depositor, on behalf of Principal Commercial Capital, engaged a third-party accounting
firm to perform certain data comparison and recalculation procedures, which were designed or provided by Principal Commercial
Capital relating to information in this prospectus regarding the PCC Mortgage Loans. These procedures included:
Â 

Â·comparing
  the information in the PCC Data Tape against various source documents provided by Principal
  Commercial Capital;
Â 

Â·comparing
  numerical information regarding the PCC Mortgage Loans and the related mortgaged properties
  disclosed in this prospectus against the information contained in the PCC Data Tape;
  and
Â 

Â·recalculating
  certain percentages, ratios and other formulae relating to the PCC Mortgage Loans disclosed
  in this prospectus.
Â 
Legal
Review. In anticipation of the securitization of each PCC Mortgage Loan, counsel to Principal Commercial Capital prepared
a form of legal summary to be completed by Principalâs internal closing staff or third party origination counsel that, among
other things, set forth certain material terms and property diligence information and elicited information concerning potentially
outlying attributes of the mortgage loans, as well as any related mitigating considerations. Principal Commercial Capitalâs
counsel reviewed the legal summaries for each PCC Mortgage Loan, together with pertinent parts of the mortgage loan documentation
and property diligence materials, in connection with preparing or corroborating the accuracy of certain loan disclosure in this
prospectus. In addition, Principal
Â 


244
Â 
Â 
Commercial
Capitalâs counsel reviewed Principal Commercial Capitalâs representations and warranties set forth on AnnexÂ D-1
to this prospectus and, if applicable, identified exceptions to those representations and warranties.
Â 
Securitization
counsel was also engaged to assist in the review of the PCC Mortgage Loans. Such assistance included, among other things, a review
of a due diligence questionnaire completed by the PCC Deal Team. Securitization counsel also reviewed the property release provisions,
if any, for each PCC Mortgage Loan with multiple mortgaged properties for compliance with the REMIC provisions.
Â 
Principal
Commercial Capitalâs counsel or securitization counsel also assisted in the preparation of the mortgage loan summaries set
forth in AnnexÂ A-3 to this prospectus, based on their respective reviews of pertinent sections of the related mortgage loan
documents and other loan information.
Â 
Other
Review Procedures. Prior to securitization, Principal Commercial Capital confirmed with the related servicer for the PCC Mortgage
Loans that, to the best of such servicerâs knowledge and except as previously identified, material events concerning the
related mortgage loan, the mortgaged property and the borrower and guarantor had not occurred since origination, including, but
not limited to: (i)Â loan modifications or assumptions, or releases of the related borrower or mortgaged property; (ii)Â damage
to the mortgaged property that materially and adversely affects its value as security for the mortgage loan; (iii)Â pending
condemnation actions; (iv)Â litigation, regulatory or other proceedings against the mortgaged property, borrower or guarantor,
or notice of non-compliance with environmental laws; (v)Â bankruptcies involving any borrower or guarantor, or any tenant
occupying a single tenant property; and (vi)Â any existing or incipient material defaults.
Â 
The
PCC Deal Team also consulted with Principal Commercial Capital personnel responsible for the origination and closing of the PCC
Mortgage Loans to confirm that the PCC Mortgage Loans were originated in compliance with the origination and underwriting criteria
described above under ââPrincipal Commercial Capitalâs Underwriting Guidelines and Processesâ as
well as to identify any material deviations from those origination and underwriting criteria. See also ââPrincipal
Commercial Capitalâs Underwriting Guidelines and ProcessesâExceptionsâ above.
Â 
Findings
and Conclusions. Based on the foregoing review procedures, Principal Commercial Capital determined that the disclosure regarding
the PCC Mortgage Loans in this prospectus is accurate in all material respects. Principal Commercial Capital also determined that
the PCC Mortgage Loans were originated in accordance with Principal Commercial Capitalâs origination procedures and underwriting
criteria described above under ââPrincipal Commercial Capitalâs Underwriting Guidelines and Processesâ,
except as described under âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâExceptions to Underwriting Guidelinesâ. Principal
Commercial Capital attributes to itself all findings and conclusions resulting from the foregoing review procedures.
Â 
Review
Procedures in the Event of a Mortgage Loan Substitution. Macquarie US Trading LLC d/b/a Principal Commercial Capital will
perform a review of any mortgage loan that it elects to substitute for a PCC Mortgage Loan in the pool in connection with a material
breach of a representation or warranty or a material document defect. Macquarie US Trading LLC d/b/a Principal Commercial Capital,
and if appropriate its legal counsel, will review the mortgage loan documents and servicing history of the substitute mortgage
loan to confirm it meets each of the criteria required under the terms of the related MLPA and the PSA (the âQualification
Criteriaâ). Macquarie US Trading LLC d/b/a Principal Commercial Capital may engage a third party accounting firm to
compare the Qualification Criteria
Â 


245
Â 
Â 
against
the underlying source documentation to verify the accuracy of the review by Principal Commercial Capital and to confirm any numerical
and/or statistical information to be disclosed in any required filings under the Exchange Act. Legal counsel will also be engaged
by Macquarie US Trading LLC d/b/a Principal Commercial Capital to render any tax opinion required in connection with the substitution.
Â 
Servicing
Â 
Interim
servicing for all PCC Mortgage Loans prior to securitization is typically performed by Principal Global Investors, LLC. Generally,
servicing responsibilities with respect to the PCC Mortgage Loans will be transferred from the interim servicer to the Master
Servicer on the Closing Date; however, Principal Global Investors, LLC is expected to retain certain sub-servicing responsibilities
with respect to all of the PCC Mortgage Loans.
Â 
Compliance

Â 
Macquarie
US Trading LLC d/b/a Principal Commercial Capital most recently filed a Form ABS-15G pursuant to Rule 15Ga-1 under the Exchange
Act on MayÂ 14, 2015. Principal Commercial Capitalâs Central Index Key Number is 0001634437. With respect to the period
from and including OctoberÂ 1, 2012 to SeptemberÂ 30, 2015, Principal Commercial Capital does not have any activity to

breaches of representations and warranties made by it as a sponsor of commercial mortgage securitizations.
Â 
Retained
Interests in This Securitization
Â 
Neither
Principal Commercial Capital nor any of its affiliates (including Macquarie Investments USÂ Inc. d/b/a Principal Commercial
Capital) will retain on the Closing Date any certificates issued by the issuing entity or any other economic interest in this
securitization. However, Principal Commercial Capital or its affiliates may own in the future certain classes of certificates.
Any such party will have the right to dispose of any such certificates at any time.

Ladder
Capital Finance LLC
Â 
General
Â 
Ladder
Capital FinanceÂ LLC (âLCFâ) is a sponsor of, and a seller of certain Mortgage Loans (the âLCF
Mortgage Loansâ) into, the securitization described in this prospectus. LCF is a limited liability company organized
under the laws of the State of Delaware and an indirect subsidiary of Ladder Capital Finance HoldingsÂ LLLP (âLadder
Holdingsâ), a limited liability limited partnership organized under the laws of the State of Delaware. Series TRS of
Ladder Capital Finance Holdings LLLP (âTRS LLLPâ) and Series REIT of Ladder Capital Finance Holdings LLLP (âREIT
LLLPâ) are each a Delaware series of Ladder Holdings. Ladder Capital Corp. (NYSE: LADR) holds a controlling interest
in Ladder Holdings.
Â 
Ladder
Holdings commenced operations in October 2008. Ladder Holdings, together with its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including
LCF, are collectively referred to in this prospectus as the âLadder Capital Groupâ. The Ladder Capital Group
is a vertically integrated, full-service commercial real estate finance and investment management company that primarily originates,
underwrites, structures, acquires, manages and
Â 


246
Â 
Â 
distributes
commercial, multifamily and manufactured housing community mortgage loans and other real estate debt instruments. The executive
offices of the Ladder Capital Group are located at 345Â Park Avenue, 8thÂ Floor, NewÂ York, NewÂ York 10154.
Â 
Deutsche
Bank AG, Cayman Islands Branch (an affiliate of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., one of the underwriters), Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association and certain other third party lenders provide warehouse financing to certain affiliates of LCF (the âLCF
Financing Affiliatesâ) through various repurchase facilities, borrowing base facilities or other financing arrangements.
Ladder Holdings, TRS LLLP and REIT LLLP guarantee certain obligations of the LCF Financing Affiliates under certain of those financing
arrangements. Some or all of the LCF Mortgage Loans are (or, as of the Closing Date, may be) subject to those financing arrangements.
If such is the case at the time the certificates are issued, then LCF will use the proceeds from its sale of the LCF Mortgage
Loans to the depositor to, among other things, acquire the warehoused LCF Mortgage Loans from the LCF Financing Affiliates, and
the LCF Financing Affiliates will, in turn, use the funds that they receive from LCF to, among other things, reacquire or obtain
the release of, as applicable, the warehoused LCF Mortgage Loans from the repurchase agreement counterparties/lenders free and
clear of any liens. As of December 1, 2015, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association was the repurchase agreement counterparty with
respect to one (1) LCF Mortgage Loan, with an aggregate Cut-off Date Balance of approximately $88,000,000. As of DecemberÂ 1,
2015, Deutsche BankÂ AG, Cayman Islands Branch was the repurchase agreement counterparty with respect to oneÂ (1) LCF
Mortgage Loan, with an aggregate Cut-off Date Balance of approximately $32,922,772.
Â 
In
addition, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association is (or, as of the Closing Date, is expected to be) the interim custodian with
respect to the loan files for all of the LCF Mortgage Loans. However, in the case of the Harvey Building Products Portfolio Mortgage
Loan, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association is holding most of the related Mortgage Loan documents in its capacity as custodian
for the COMM 2015-LC23 commercial mortgage securitization.
Â 
LCF
and/or its affiliates may acquire certificates from time to time, including upon initial issuance or in the secondary market.
Â 
Ladder
Capital Groupâs Securitization Program
Â 
During
2010, LCF contributed approximately $329.76Â million of commercial, multifamily and manufactured housing community mortgage
loans to two commercial mortgage securitizations. During 2011, LCF contributed approximately $1.02 billion of commercial, multifamily
and manufactured housing community mortgage loans to three commercial mortgage securitizations. During 2012, LCF contributed approximately
$1.6Â billion of commercial, multifamily and manufactured housing community mortgage loans to 6Â commercial mortgage securitizations.
During 2013, LCF contributed approximately $2.23Â billion of commercial, multifamily and manufactured housing community mortgage
loans to 6Â commercial mortgage securitizations. During 2014, LCF contributed approximately $3.49 billion of commercial, multifamily
and manufactured housing community mortgage loans to 10Â commercial mortgage securitizations. During the first 6Â calendar
months of 2015, LCF contributed approximately $1.12 billion of commercial, multifamily and manufactured housing community mortgage
loans to 10Â commercial mortgage securitizations. LCF began securitizing such types of mortgage loans in 2010 and has not
been involved in the securitization of any other types of financial assets.

  activity from and including January 1, 2015 through and including September 30, 2015.
Â 
In
connection with commercial mortgage securitization transactions in which it participates as a sponsor, LCF will generally transfer
the subject mortgage loans to the applicable depositor, who will then transfer those mortgage loans to the issuing entity for
the related securitization. In return for the transfer by the applicable depositor to the issuing entity of those mortgage loans
(together with any other mortgage loans being securitized), the issuing entity will issue commercial mortgage pass-through certificates
that are, in whole or in part, backed by, and supported by the cash flows generated by, the mortgage loans being securitized.
In coordination with underwriters or initial purchasers and the applicable depositor, LCF works with rating agencies, other loan
sellers, servicers and investors and participates in structuring a securitization transaction to maximize the overall value and
capital structure, taking into account numerous factors, including without limitation geographic and property type diversity and
rating agency criteria.
Â 
LCF
will generally make certain representations and warranties and undertake certain loan document delivery requirements with respect
to the mortgage loans that it contributes to a commercial mortgage securitization; and, in the event of an uncured material breach
of any such representation and warranty or an uncured material document defect or omission, LCF will generally be obligated to
repurchase or replace the affected mortgage loan or, in some cases, pay an amount estimated to cover the approximate loss associated
with such breach, defect or omission. LCF has limited assets with which to effect any such repurchase or substitution or make
any such estimated loss reimbursement payment. However, as is the case in this securitization, Ladder Holdings, TRS LLLP and REIT
LLLP will often guarantee LCFâs payment obligations in connection with a repurchase or substitution of a defective mortgage
loan resulting from, or the making of an estimated loss reimbursement payment related to, any such breach of representation or
warranty or defective or missing loan documentation. As of SeptemberÂ 30, 2015, based on unaudited financial statements, Ladder
Holdings had total assets of $5,809,683,418, total liabilities of $4,316,712,521 and total capital of $1,492,970,897. Notwithstanding
the existence of any such guarantee, no assurance can be provided that Ladder Holdings, TRS LLLP, REIT LLLP or LCF will have the
financial ability to effect or cause a repurchase or substitution, or to make an estimated loss reimbursement payment with respect
to, a defective mortgage loan, and no other member of the Ladder Capital Group will be responsible for doing so if Ladder Holdings,
TRS LLLP, REIT LLLP and LCF fail with respect to their obligations.
Â 


248
Â 
Â 
No
member of the Ladder Capital Group acts as a servicer of the commercial, multifamily and manufactured housing community mortgage
loans that LCF or its affiliates originates, acquires or securitizes. Instead, LCF sells the right to be appointed servicer of
its securitized loans to unaffiliated third party servicers and utilizes unaffiliated third party servicers as interim servicers.
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association acts as interim servicer with respect to 22 of the LCF Mortgage Loans, having an aggregate
Cut-off Date Balance of $210,891,484, representing approximately 21.0% of the Initial Pool Balance. Wells Fargo Bank has been
servicing the Harvey Building Products Portfolio Mortgage Loan in its capacity as master servicer for the COMM 2015-LC23 commercial
mortgage securitization.
Â 
Ladder
Capital Groupâs Underwriting Guidelines and Processes
Â 
Each
of the LCF Mortgage Loans was originated by LCF or one of its affiliates. Set forth below is a discussion of certain general underwriting
guidelines and processes with respect to commercial, multifamily and manufactured housing community mortgage loans originated
by LCF and its affiliates for securitization.
Â 
Notwithstanding
the discussion below, given the unique nature of commercial, multifamily and manufactured housing community mortgaged properties,
the underwriting and origination procedures and the credit analysis with respect to any particular commercial, multifamily or
manufactured housing community mortgage loan may significantly differ from one loan to another, and will be driven by circumstances
particular to that property, including, among others, its type, current use, size, location, market conditions, reserve requirements
and additional collateral, tenants and leases, borrower identity, sponsorship, performance history and/or other factors. Consequently,
there can be no assurance that the underwriting of any particular commercial, multifamily or manufactured housing community mortgage
loan originated by LCF or one of its affiliates will conform to the general guidelines and processes described below. For important
information about the circumstances that have affected the underwriting of particular LCF Mortgage Loans, see âDescription
of the Mortgage PoolâExceptions to Underwriting Guidelinesâ in this prospectus and âAnnexÂ D-2âExceptions
to Mortgage Loan Representations and Warrantiesâ in this prospectus.
Â 
Loan
Analysis. Generally both a credit analysis and a collateral analysis are conducted with respect to each commercial, multifamily
and manufactured housing community mortgage loan. The credit analysis of the borrower generally includes a review of third party
credit reports or judgment, lien, bankruptcy and pending litigation searches. Such searches are limited in the time periods that
they cover, and often cover no more than the prior 10-year period. Furthermore, in the case of equity holders in the borrowers,
such searches would generally be conducted only as to equity holders with at least a 20% interest in the subject borrower or that
control the subject borrower. The collateral analysis generally includes a review of, in each case to the extent available and
applicable, the historical property operating statements, rent rolls and certain significant tenant leases. The credit underwriting
also generally includes a review of third party appraisals, as well as environmental reports, engineering assessments and seismic
reports, if applicable and obtained. Generally, the originator also conducts or causes a third party to conduct a site inspection
to ascertain the overall quality, functionality and competitiveness of the property, including its neighborhood and market, accessibility
and visibility, and to assess the tenancy of the property. The submarket in which the property is located is assessed to evaluate
the competitive or comparable properties as well as market trends.
Â 
Loan
Approval. Prior to commitment, each commercial, multifamily and manufactured housing community mortgage loan to be originated
must be approved by a loan committee
Â 


249
Â 
Â 
that
includes senior personnel from the Ladder Capital Group. The committee may approve a mortgage loan as recommended, request additional
due diligence, modify the loan terms or decline a loan transaction.
Â 
Debt
Service Coverage Ratio and Loan-to-Value Ratio. The underwriting includes a calculation of the debt service coverage ratio
and loan-to-value ratio in connection with the origination of a loan. With respect to loans originated for securitization, the
Ladder Capital Groupâs underwriting standards generally require, without regard to any other debt, a debt service coverage
ratio of not less than 1.20x and a loan-to-value ratio of not more than 80.0%.
Â 
A
debt service coverage ratio will generally be calculated based on the underwritten net cash flow from the property in question
as determined by the Ladder Capital Group and payments on the loan based on actual (or, in some cases, assumed) principal and/or
interest due on the loan. However, underwritten net cash flow is often a highly subjective number based on a variety of assumptions
regarding, and adjustments to, revenues and expenses with respect to the related real property collateral. For example, when calculating
the debt service coverage ratio for a commercial, multifamily or manufactured housing community mortgage loan, annual net cash
flow that was calculated based on assumptions regarding projected future rental income, expenses and/or occupancy may be utilized.
There is no assurance that the foregoing assumptions made with respect to any prospective commercial, multifamily or manufactured
housing community mortgage loan will, in fact, be consistent with actual property performance. Such underwritten net cash flow
may be higher than historical net cash flow reflected in recent financial statements. Additionally, certain mortgage loans may
provide for only interest payments prior to maturity, or for an interest-only period during a portion of the term of the mortgage
loan. A loan-to-value ratio, in general, is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the then-outstanding principal balance of
the mortgage loan divided by the estimated value of the related property based on an appraisal.
Â 
Additional
Debt. Certain mortgage loans originated by LCF or one of its affiliates may have or permit in the future certain additional
subordinate debt, whether secured or unsecured, and/or mezzanine debt. It is possible that a member of the Ladder Capital Group
may be the lender on that additional subordinate debt and/or mezzanine debt.
Â 
The
debt service coverage ratios described above will be lower based on the inclusion of the payments related to such additional debt
and the loan-to-value ratios described above will be higher based on the inclusion of the amount of any such additional subordinate
debt and/or mezzanine debt.
Â 
Assessments
of Property Condition. As part of the underwriting process, the property assessments and reports described below will typically
be obtained:
Â 

Â·Appraisals.
  Independent appraisals or an update of an independent appraisal will generally be required
  in connection with the origination of each mortgage loan that meets the requirements
  of the âUniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practiceâ as adopted
  by the Appraisal Standards Board of the Appraisal Foundation, or the guidelines in TitleÂ XI
  of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989. In some cases,
  however, the value of the subject real property collateral may be established based on
  a cash flow analysis, a recent sales price or another method or benchmark of valuation.
Â 

Â·Environmental
  Assessment. In most cases, a Phase I environmental assessment will be required with
  respect to the real property collateral for a prospective
Â 

250
Â 
Â 
 commercial, multifamily
or manufactured housing community mortgage loan. However, when circumstances warrant, an update of a prior environmental assessment,
a transaction screen or a desktop review may be utilized. Alternatively, in limited circumstances, an environmental assessment
may not be required, such as when the benefits of an environmental insurance policy or an environmental guarantee have been obtained.
Furthermore, an environmental assessment conducted at any particular real property collateral will not necessarily cover all potential
environmental issues. For example, an analysis for radon, lead-based paint, mold and lead in drinking water will usually be conducted
only at multifamily rental properties and only when the originator or an environmental consultant believes that such an analysis
is warranted under the circumstances. Depending on the findings of the initial environmental assessment, any of the following
may be required: additional environmental testing, such as a PhaseÂ II environmental assessment with respect to the subject
real property collateral; an environmental insurance policy; that the borrower conduct remediation activities or establish an
operations and maintenance plan; and/or a guaranty or reserve with respect to environmental matters.
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â Engineering Assessment. In connection with the origination process, in most cases, it will be required that an engineering
firm inspect the real property collateral for any prospective commercial, multifamily or manufactured housing community mortgage
loan to assess the structure, exterior walls, roofing, interior structure and/or mechanical and electrical systems. Based on the
resulting report, the appropriate response will be determined to any recommended repairs, corrections or replacements and any identified
deferred maintenance. An engineering assessment may not be conducted with respect to a mortgaged property that lacks material improvements
owned by the related borrower.
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â Seismic Report. Generally, a seismic report is required for all properties located in seismic zonesÂ 3 orÂ 4.
A seismic study may not be conducted with respect to a mortgaged property that lacks material improvements owned by the related
borrower.
Â 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, engineering
inspections and seismic reports will generally not be required or obtained by the originator in connection with the origination
process in the case of mortgage loans secured by real properties that are subject to a ground lease, triple-net lease or other
long term lease, or in the case of mortgage loans that are not collateralized by any material improvements on the real property
collateral.
Â 
Title Insurance. The borrower is
required to provide, and the Ladder Capital Group or its origination counsel typically will review, a title insurance policy for
each property. The title insurance policies provided typically must meet the following requirements: (i)Â written by a title
insurer licensed to do business in the jurisdiction where the mortgaged property is located, (ii)Â in an amount at least equal
to the original principal balance of the mortgage loan, (iii)Â protection and benefits run to the mortgagee and its successors
and assigns, (iv)Â written on an American Land Title Association form or equivalent policy promulgated in the jurisdiction
where the mortgaged property is located and (v)Â if a survey was prepared, the legal description of the mortgaged property
in the title policy conforms to that shown on the survey.
Â 
Casualty Insurance. Except in certain
instances where sole or significant tenants (which may include ground tenants) are permitted to obtain insurance or self-insure,
or where another third party unrelated to the applicable borrower (such as a condominium association, franchisor or third party
property manager, if applicable) is permitted to obtain
Â 


251
Â 
Â Â 
insurance, or the subject mortgaged property is covered by a blanket policy
(which may have been obtained by an affiliate of the related borrower), the Ladder Capital Group typically requires that the related
mortgaged property be insured by a hazard insurance policy with a customary deductible and in an amount at least equal to the lesser
of the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loan and 100% of the full insurable replacement cost of the improvements located
on the property. If applicable, the policy contains appropriate endorsements to avoid the application of coinsurance and does not
permit reduction in insurance proceeds for depreciation, except that the policy may permit a deduction for depreciation in connection
with a cash settlement after a casualty if the insurance proceeds are not being applied to rebuild or repair the damaged improvements.
Â 
Flood insurance, if available, must be
in effect for any mortgaged property that at the time of origination included material borrower-owned improvements in any area
identified in the Federal Register by the Federal Emergency Management Agency a special flood hazard area. The flood insurance
policy must meet the requirements of the then-current guidelines of the Federal Insurance Administration, be provided by a generally
acceptable insurance carrier and be in an amount representing coverage not less than the least of (i)Â the outstanding principal
balance of the mortgage loan, (ii)Â the full insurable value of the material borrower-owned improvements at the property or,
in cases where only a portion of the property is in the flood zone, the full insurable value of the material borrower-owned improvements
at the portion of the property contained therein, and (iii)Â the maximum amount of insurance available under the National Flood
Insurance Program, except in some cases where self-insurance was permitted.
Â 
The standard form of hazard insurance
policy typically covers physical damage or destruction of the improvements on the mortgaged property caused by fire, lightning,
explosion, smoke, windstorm and hail, riot or strike and civil commotion. The policies may contain some conditions and exclusions
to coverage, including exclusions related to acts of terrorism.
Â 
Generally, except in certain instances
where sole or significant tenants (which may include ground tenants) are permitted to obtain insurance or self-insure, or where
another third party unrelated to the applicable borrower (such as a condominium association, franchisor or third party property
manager, if applicable) is permitted to obtain insurance, or the subject mortgaged property is covered by a blanket policy (which
may have been obtained by an affiliate of the related borrower), each of the mortgage loans requires that the related borrower
maintain: (i)Â coverage for terrorism or terrorist acts, if such coverage is available at commercially reasonable rates (although
in many cases, there is a cap on the amount that the related borrower will be required to expend on terrorism insurance); (ii)Â comprehensive
general liability insurance against claims for personal and bodily injury, death or property damage occurring on, in or about the
property in an amount customarily required by institutional lenders; and (iii)Â business interruption or rent loss insurance
in an amount not less than 100% of the projected rental income from the related property for not less than 12Â months.
Â 
Although properties are typically not
insured for earthquake risk, a borrower will be required to obtain earthquake insurance if the property has material improvements
and the seismic report indicates that the probable maximum loss (âPMLâ) or scenario expected loss (âSELâ)
is greater than 20%.
Â 
Zoning and Building Code Compliance.
In connection with the origination of a commercial, multifamily or manufactured housing community mortgage loan, the originator
will generally examine whether the use and occupancy of the related real property collateral is in material compliance with zoning,
land-use, building rules, regulations and orders then
Â 


252
Â 
Â 
applicable to that property. Evidence of this compliance may be in the form
of one or more of the following: legal opinions, surveys, recorded documents, temporary or permanent certificates of occupancy,
letters from government officials or agencies, title insurance endorsements, engineering or consulting reports, zoning reports
and/or representations by the related borrower.
Â 
In some cases, a mortgaged property may
constitute a legal non-conforming use or structure. In such cases, the Ladder Capital Group may require an endorsement to the title
insurance policy or the acquisition of law and ordinance insurance or a non-recourse carveout in the related loan documents with
respect to the particular non-conformity unless it determines that: (i)Â the non-conformity should not have a material adverse
effect on the ability of the borrower to rebuild; or (ii)Â if the improvements are rebuilt in accordance with currently applicable
law, the value and performance of the property would be acceptable; or (iii)Â any major casualty that would prevent rebuilding
has a sufficiently remote likelihood of occurring; or (iv)Â a cash reserve, a letter of credit or an agreement from a principal
of the borrower is provided to cover losses.
Â 
If a material violation exists with respect
to a mortgaged property, the Ladder Capital Group may require the borrower to remediate such violation and, subject to the discussion
under ââEscrow Requirementsâ below, to establish a reserve to cover the cost of such remediation, unless
a cash reserve, a letter of credit or an agreement from a principal of the borrower is provided to cover losses.
Â 
Escrow Requirements. Based on the
originatorâs analysis of the real property collateral, the borrower and the principals of the borrower, a borrower under
a commercial, multifamily or manufactured housing community mortgage loan may be required to fund various escrows for taxes, insurance,
replacement reserves, tenant improvements/leasing commissions (depending on the property type), deferred maintenance and/or environmental
remediation. A case-by-case analysis will be conducted to determine the need for a particular escrow or reserve. Consequently,
the aforementioned escrows and reserves are not established for every commercial, multifamily and manufactured housing community
mortgage loan originated by a member of the Ladder Capital Group. In certain cases, these reserves may be released to the borrower
upon satisfaction of certain conditions in the related loan documents that may include, but are not limited to, achievement of
leasing matters, achieving a specified debt service coverage ratio or debt yield or satisfying other conditions. Furthermore, the
Ladder Capital Group may accept an alternative to a cash escrow or reserve from a borrower, such as a letter of credit or a guarantee
from the borrower or an affiliate of the borrower or periodic evidence that the items for which the escrow or reserve would have
been established are being paid or addressed. In some cases, the Ladder Capital Group may determine that establishing an escrow
or reserve is not warranted given the amounts that would be involved and the Ladder Capital Groupâs evaluation of the ability
of the property, the borrower or a holder of direct or indirect ownership interests in the borrower to bear the subject expense
or cost absent creation of an escrow or reserve. In some cases, the Ladder Capital Group may determine that establishing an escrow
or reserve is not warranted because a tenant or other third party has agreed to pay the subject cost or expense for which the escrow
or reserve would otherwise have been established.
Â 
Generally, subject to the discussion in
the prior paragraph, the required escrows for commercial, multifamily and manufactured housing community mortgage loans originated
by the Ladder Capital Group are as follows:
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â TaxesâMonthly escrow deposits equal to 1/12th of the annual property taxes (based on the most recent property assessment
and the current millage rate) are
Â 


253
Â 
Â 
typically required to satisfy real estate taxes and assessments, except that such escrows are not required
in certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, (i)Â if there is an institutional property sponsor or high net worth
individual property sponsor, (ii)Â if and to the extent that a sole or major tenant (which may include a ground tenant) at
the related mortgaged property is required to pay taxes directly or to reimburse the landlord/borrower for the payment of such
taxes or to deliver to the landlord/borrower funds for purposes of paying such taxes in advance of their due date, (iii)Â in
the case of a hospitality property, the franchisor or a third-party property manager is maintaining such an escrow or reserve or
(iv)Â if a sponsor, a key principal or an affiliate of the borrower delivers a guarantee relating to the payment of real estate
taxes.
Â Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â InsuranceâMonthly escrow deposits equal to 1/12th of the annual property insurance premium are typically required
to pay insurance premiums, except that such escrows are not required in certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, (i)Â if
there is an institutional property sponsor or high net worth individual property sponsor, (ii)Â if the related borrower or
an affiliate maintains a blanket insurance policy covering the subject mortgaged property, (iii)Â if and to the extent that
a sole or major tenant (which may include a ground tenant) at the related mortgaged property is permitted to maintain the insurance
or to self-insure, (iv)Â if and to the extent that another third party unrelated to the applicable borrower (such as a condominium
association, franchisor or third party property manager, if applicable) is permitted to maintain the insurance, (v)Â in the
case of a hospitality property, the franchisor or a third-party property manager is maintaining such an escrow or reserve or (vi)Â if
a sponsor, a key principal or an affiliate of the borrower delivers a guarantee relating to the payment of insurance premiums.
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â Replacement ReservesâReplacement reserves are generally calculated in accordance with the expected useful life of
the components of the property during the term of the mortgage loan and may be required to be funded either at loan origination
and/or during the related mortgage loan term and/or after the occurrence and during the continuance of a specified trigger event.
Annual replacement reserves are generally underwritten to the suggested replacement reserve amount from an independent, third-party
property condition or engineering report, or to certain minimum requirements by property type, except that such escrows are not
required in certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, (i)Â if and to the extent a tenant (which may include a ground
tenant) at the related mortgaged property or other third party is responsible for all repairs and maintenance, (ii)Â if a sponsor,
a key principal or an affiliate of the borrower delivers a guarantee agreeing to take responsibility and pay for the related costs
and expenses, (iii)Â if the Ladder Capital Group determines that establishing an escrow or reserve is not warranted given the
amounts that would be involved and the Ladder Capital Groupâs evaluation of the ability of the property, the borrower or
a holder of direct or indirect ownership interests in the borrower to bear the cost of repairs and maintenance absent creation
of an escrow or reserve, or (iv)Â in the case of a hospitality property, the franchisor or a third-party property manager is
maintaining such an escrow or reserve.

improvement costs which might be associated with re-leasing the space occupied by significant tenants,
except that such escrows are not required in certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, (i)Â if the related tenantâs
lease extends beyond the loan term, (ii)Â if a sponsor, a key principal or an affiliate of the borrower delivers a guarantee

or a holder of direct or indirect ownership interests in the borrower to bear the anticipated leasing commissions or tenant improvement
costs absent creation of an escrow or reserve.
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â Deferred MaintenanceâA deferred maintenance reserve may be required to be funded at loan origination in an amount
typically equal to 100% to 125% of the estimated cost of material immediate repairs or replacements identified in the property
condition or engineering report, except that such escrows are not required in certain circumstances, including, but not limited
to, (i)Â if the sponsor, a key principal or an affiliate of the borrower delivers a guarantee to complete the immediate repairs
in a specified amount of time, (ii)Â if the deferred maintenance amount does not materially impact the function, performance
or value of the property, (iii)Â if a tenant (which may include a ground tenant) at the related mortgaged property or other

RemediationâAn environmental remediation reserve may be required at loan origination in an amount typically equal to 100%
to 125% of the estimated remediation cost identified in the environmental report, except that such escrows are not required in
certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, (i)Â if the sponsor, a key principal or an affiliate of the borrower
delivers a guarantee agreeing to take responsibility and pay for the identified environmental issues, (ii)Â if environmental
insurance is obtained or already in place, (iii)Â if a third party unrelated to the borrower is identified as the responsible
party or (iv)Â if the Ladder Capital Group determines that establishing an escrow or reserve is not warranted given the amounts

Â 
Review of LCF Mortgage Loans
Â 
Overview. LCF has conducted a review
of the LCF Mortgage Loans in connection with the securitization described in this prospectus. The review of the LCF Mortgage Loans
was performed by a team comprised of real estate and securitization professionals who are employees of Ladder Capital Group (the
âLadder Capital Review Teamâ). The review procedures described below were employed with respect to all of the
LCF Mortgage Loans, except that certain review procedures only were relevant to the large loan disclosures in this prospectus.
No sampling procedures were used in the review process.
Â 
Database. To prepare for securitization,
members of the Ladder Capital Review Team created a database of loan-level and property-level information, and prepared an asset
summary report, relating to each LCF Mortgage Loan. The database and the respective asset summary reports were compiled from, among
other sources, the related loan documents, appraisals, environmental assessment reports, property condition reports, seismic studies,
zoning reports, insurance review summaries, borrower-supplied information (including, but not limited to, rent rolls, leases, operating
statements and budgets) and information collected by the Ladder Capital Review Team during the underwriting process. After origination
of each LCF Mortgage Loan, the Ladder Capital Review Team updated the information in the database and the related asset summary
report with respect to such LCF Mortgage Loan based on updates provided by the related servicer relating to loan payment status
and escrows, updated operating statements, rent rolls and leasing activity, and information otherwise brought to the attention
of the Ladder Capital Review Team.
Â 
A data tape (the âLCF Data Tapeâ)
containing detailed information regarding each LCF Mortgage Loan was created from the information in the database referred to in
the prior paragraph. The LCF Data Tape was used to provide the numerical information regarding the LCF Mortgage Loans in this prospectus.
Â 
Data Comparisons and Recalculation.
The depositor, on behalf of LCF, engaged a third party accounting firm to perform certain data comparison and recalculation procedures
designed by LCF, relating to information in this prospectus regarding the LCF Mortgage Loans. These procedures included:
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â comparing the information in the LCF Data Tape against various source documents provided by LCF;
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â comparing
numerical information regarding the LCF Mortgage Loans and the related Mortgaged Properties disclosed in this prospectus against
the LCF Data Tape; and
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â recalculating
certain percentages, ratios and other formulae relating to the LCF Mortgage Loans disclosed in this prospectus.
Â 
Legal Review. The Ladder Capital
Group engaged various law firms to conduct certain legal reviews of the LCF Mortgage Loans for disclosure in this prospectus. In
anticipation of the securitization of the LCF Mortgage Loans, the Ladder Capital Groupâs origination counsel for each LCF
Mortgage Loan reviewed the representations and warranties set forth on AnnexÂ D-1 to this prospectus and, if applicable, identified
exceptions to those representations and warranties.
Â 


256
Â 
Â 
Legal counsel was also engaged in connection
with this securitization to assist in the review of the LCF Mortgage Loans. Such assistance included, among other things, (i)Â a
review of the Ladder Capital Groupâs credit memo or asset summary report or a draft thereof for each LCF Mortgage Loan with
a Cut-off Date Balance of $10 million or more, (ii)Â a review of a due diligence questionnaire regarding the LCF Mortgage Loans
prepared by the Ladder Capital Group, (iii)Â a review of various statistical data tapes prepared by the Ladder Capital Group,
(iv)Â a review of the representation and warranty exception reports referred to above relating to certain of the LCF Mortgage
Loans prepared by origination counsel, and (v)Â the review of select provisions in certain loan documents with respect to certain
of the LCF Mortgage Loans.
Â 
Origination counsel or securitization
counsel also assisted in the preparation of the individual LCF Mortgage Loan summaries set forth on AnnexÂ A-3 to this prospectus
based on their respective reviews of the related asset summary reports and the pertinent sections of the related Mortgage Loan
documents.
Â 
Other Review Procedures. With respect
to any material pending litigation of which the Ladder Capital Group was aware at the origination of any LCF Mortgage Loan, the
Ladder Capital Group requested updates from the related borrower, origination counsel and/or borrowerâs litigation counsel.
If the Ladder Capital Group became aware of a significant natural disaster in the vicinity of the Mortgaged Property securing any
LCF Mortgage Loan, the Ladder Capital Group obtained information on the status of the Mortgaged Property from the related borrower
to confirm no material damage to the Mortgaged Property.
Â 
The Ladder Capital Review Team also reviewed
the LCF Mortgage Loans to determine, with the assistance of counsel engaged in connection with this securitization, whether any
LCF Mortgage Loan materially deviated from the underwriting guidelines described under ââLadder Capital Groupâs
Underwriting Guidelines and Processesâ above.
Â 
Findings and Conclusions. Based
on the foregoing review procedures, Ladder Capital Group determined that the disclosure regarding the LCF Mortgage Loans in this
prospectus is accurate in all material respects. Ladder Capital Group also determined that the LCF Mortgage Loans were originated
in accordance with Ladder Capital Groupâs origination procedures and underwriting criteria described under ââLadder
Capital Groupâs Underwriting Guidelines and ProcessesâExceptionsâ above, except as described under âDescription
of the Mortgage PoolâExceptions to Underwriting Guidelinesâ in this prospectus. LCF attributes to itself all findings
and conclusions resulting from the foregoing review procedures.
Â 
Review Procedures in the Event of a
Mortgage Loan Substitution. The Ladder Capital Group will perform a review of any LCF Mortgage Loan that it elects to substitute
for a LCF Mortgage Loan in the pool in connection with material breach of a representation or warranty or a material document defect.
The Ladder Capital Group, and if appropriate its legal counsel, will review the mortgage loan documents and servicing history of
the substitute mortgage loan to confirm it meets each of the criteria required under the terms of the related mortgage loan purchase
agreement and the related pooling and servicing agreement (the âQualification Criteriaâ). The Ladder Capital
Group will engage a third party accounting firm to compare the Qualification Criteria against the underlying source documentation
to verify the accuracy of the review by the Ladder Capital Group and to confirm any numerical and/or statistical information to
be disclosed in any required filings under the Exchange Act. Legal counsel will also be engaged by the Ladder Capital Group to
render any tax opinion required in connection with the substitution.

in this prospectus.
Â 
CGMRCâs Commercial
Mortgage Origination and Securitization Program
Â 
CGMRC, directly or through correspondents
or affiliates, originates multifamily and commercial mortgage loans throughout the United States and abroad. CGMRC has been engaged
in the origination of multifamily and commercial mortgage loans for securitization since 1996 and has been involved in the securitization
of residential mortgage loans since 1987. The multifamily and commercial mortgage loans originated by CGMRC include both fixed
rate loans and floating rate loans. Most of the multifamily and commercial mortgage loans included by CGMRC in commercial mortgage
securitizations sponsored by CGMRC have been originated, directly or through correspondents, by CGMRC or an affiliate. CGMRC securitized
approximately $1.25Â billion, $1.49Â billion, $2.60Â billion, $4.27Â billion,
Â 


258
Â 
Â 
$7.02Â billion, $6.35Â billion,
$1.08Â billion, $0, $517Â million, $1.25Â billion, $1.73Â billion, $4.75Â billion and $5.23 billion of multifamily
and commercial mortgage loans in public and private offerings during the calendar years 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008,
2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.
Â 
In addition, in the normal course of its
business, CGMRC may also acquire multifamily and commercial mortgage loans from various third-party originators. These mortgage
loans may have been originated using underwriting guidelines not established by CGMRC.
Â 
CGMRC has also sponsored, in private placement
transactions, multifamily and commercial mortgage loans which it either originated or acquired from third-party originators that
underwrote them to their own underwriting criteria.
Â 
In connection with the commercial mortgage
securitization transactions in which it participates, CGMRC generally transfers the subject mortgage assets to a depositor, who
then transfers those mortgage assets to the issuing entity for the related securitization. In return for the transfer of the subject
mortgage assets by the depositor to the issuing entity, the issuing entity issues commercial mortgage pass-through certificates
that are in whole or in part backed by, and supported by the cash flows generated by, those mortgage assets.
Â 
CGMRC generally works with rating agencies,
unaffiliated mortgage loan sellers, servicers, affiliates and underwriters in structuring a securitization transaction. CGMRC will
generally act as a sponsor, originator or mortgage loan seller in the commercial mortgage securitization transactions in which
it participates. In such transactions there may be a co-sponsor and/or other mortgage loan sellers and originators. Generally CGMRC
and/or the related depositor contract with other entities to service the multifamily and commercial mortgage loans following their
transfer into a trust fund for a series of certificates.
Â 
CGMRCâs Underwriting
Guidelines and Processes
Â 
Overview. CGMRCâs commercial
mortgage loans are primarily originated in accordance with the procedures and underwriting criteria described below. However, variations
from the procedures and criteria described below may be implemented as a result of various conditions including each loanâs
specific terms, the quality or location of the underlying real estate, the propertyâs tenancy profile, the background or
financial strength of the borrower/sponsor or any other pertinent information deemed material by CGMRC. Therefore, this general
description of CGMRCâs origination procedures and underwriting criteria is not intended as a representation that every commercial
mortgage loan originated by it or on its behalf complies entirely with all criteria set forth below.
Â 
Process. The credit underwriting
process for each CGMRC loan is performed by a deal team comprised of real estate professionals which typically includes an originator,
an underwriter, a commercial closer and a third party due diligence provider operating under the review of CGMRC. This team conducts
a thorough review of the related mortgaged property, which in most cases includes an examination of the following information,
to the extent both applicable and available: historical operating statements, rent rolls, tenant leases, current and historical
real estate tax information, insurance policies and/or schedules, and third party reports pertaining to appraisal/valuation, zoning,
environmental status and physical condition/seismic condition/engineering (see ââEscrow Requirementsâ,
ââTitle Insurance Policyâ, ââProperty Insuranceâ, ââThird Party
ReportsâAppraisalâ, ââThird Party ReportsâEnvironmental Reportâ and ââThird
Party ReportsâProperty Condition Reportâ below). In some cases (such as a property having a limited operating history
or having been recently acquired by its current owner), historical operating statements may not be available. Rent rolls would
not be examined for certain property types, such as
Â 


259
Â 
Â 
hospitality properties or single tenant properties, and tenant leases would
not be examined for certain property types, such as hospitality, self storage, multifamily and manufactured housing community properties.
Â 
A member of the CGMRC deal team or one
of its agents performs an inspection of the property as well as a review of the surrounding market environment, including demand
generators and competing properties (if any), in order to confirm tenancy information, assess the physical quality of the collateral,
determine visibility and access characteristics, and evaluate the propertyâs competitiveness within its market.
Â 
The CGMRC deal team or one of its agents
also performs a detailed review of the financial status, credit history, credit references and background of the borrower and certain
key principals using financial statements, income tax returns, credit reports, criminal/background investigations, and specific
searches for judgments, liens, bankruptcy and pending litigation. Circumstances may also warrant an examination of the financial
strength and credit of key tenants as well as other factors that may impact the tenantsâ ongoing occupancy or ability to
pay rent.
Â 
After the compilation and review of all
documentation and other relevant considerations, the deal team finalizes its detailed underwriting analysis of the propertyâs
cash flow in accordance with CGMRCâs property-specific, cash flow underwriting guidelines. Determinations are also made regarding
the implementation of appropriate loan terms to structure around risks, resulting in features such as ongoing escrows or up-front
reserves, letters of credit, lockboxes/cash management agreements or guarantees. A complete credit committee package is prepared
to summarize all of the above referenced information.
Â 
Credit Approval. All commercial
mortgage loans must be presented to one or more credit committees that include senior real estate professionals among others. After
a review of the credit committee package and a discussion of the loan, the committee may approve the loan as recommended or request
additional due diligence, modify the terms, or reject the loan entirely.
Â 
Debt Service Coverage and Loan-to-Value
Requirements. CGMRCâs underwriting standards generally require a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.20x and a maximum
loan-to-value ratio of 80%. However these thresholds are guidelines and exceptions are permitted under the guidelines on the merits
of each individual loan, such as reserves, letters of credit and/or guarantees and CGMRCâs assessment of the propertyâs
future prospects. Property and loan information is not updated for securitization unless CGMRC determines that information in its
possession has become stale.
Â 
Certain properties may also be encumbered
by subordinate debt secured by such property and/or mezzanine debt secured by direct or indirect ownership interests in the borrower
and when such mezzanine or subordinate debt is taken into account, may result in aggregate debt that does not conform to the aforementioned
debt service coverage ratio and loan-to-value ratio parameters.
Â 
Amortization Requirements. While
CGMRCâs underwriting guidelines generally permit a maximum amortization period of 30Â years, certain loans may provide
for interest-only payments through maturity or for a portion of the loan term. If the loan entails only a partial interest-only
period, the monthly debt service, annual debt service and DSCR set forth in this prospectus and AnnexÂ A-1 to this prospectus
reflect a calculation on the future (larger) amortizing loan payment. See âDescription of the Mortgage Poolâ
in this prospectus.
Â 


260
Â 
Â 
Escrow Requirements. CGMRC may
require borrowers to fund escrows for taxes, insurance, capital expenditures and replacement reserves. In addition, CGMRC may identify
certain risks that warrant additional escrows or holdbacks for items to be released to the borrower upon the satisfaction of certain
conditions. Such escrows or holdbacks may cover tenant improvements/leasing commissions, deferred maintenance, environmental remediation
or unfunded obligations, among other things. Springing escrows may also be structured for identified risks such as specific rollover
exposure, to be triggered upon the non-renewal of one or more key tenants. In some cases, the borrower may be allowed to post a
letter of credit or guaranty in lieu of a cash reserve, or provide periodic evidence of timely payment of a typical escrow item.
Escrows are evaluated on a case-by-case basis and are not required for all CGMRC commercial mortgage loans.
Â 
Generally, CGMRC requires escrows as follows:
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â TaxesâAn initial deposit and monthly escrow deposits equal to 1/12th of the annual property taxes (based on the most
recent property assessment and the current millage rate) are typically required to satisfy all taxes and assessments, except that
such escrows are not required in certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, (i)Â if there is an institutional sponsor
or the sponsor is a high net worth individual or (ii)Â if and to the extent that a single or major tenant (which may be a ground
tenant) at the related mortgaged property is required to pay taxes directly.
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â InsuranceâAn initial deposit and monthly escrow deposits equal to 1/12th of the annual property insurance premium
are typically required to pay all insurance premiums, except that such escrows are not required in certain circumstances, including,
but not limited to, (i)Â if the related borrower maintains a blanket insurance policy, (ii)Â if and to the extent that
a single or major tenant (which may be a ground tenant) at the related mortgaged property is obligated to maintain the insurance
or is permitted to self-insure, or (iii)Â if and to the extent that another third party unrelated to the borrower (such as
a condominium board, if applicable) is obligated to maintain the insurance.
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â Replacement ReservesâReplacement reserves are generally calculated in accordance with the expected useful life of
the components of the mortgaged property during the term of the mortgage loan. Annual replacement reserves are generally underwritten
to the suggested replacement reserve amount from an independent, third-party property condition or engineering report, or to certain
minimum requirements depending on the property type, except that such escrows are not required in certain circumstances, including,
but not limited to, if and to the extent that a single or major tenant (which may be a ground tenant) at the related mortgaged
property is responsible for all repairs and maintenance, including those required with respect to the roof and structure of the
improvements.
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â Tenant Improvement/Leasing CommissionsâIn the case of retail, office and industrial properties, a tenant improvement/leasing
commission reserve may be required to be funded either at loan origination and/or during the term of the mortgage loan to cover
anticipated leasing commissions or tenant improvement costs that might be associated with re-leasing certain space involving major
tenants, except that such escrows are not required in certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, (i)Â if the tenantâs
lease extends beyond the loan term or (ii)Â if the rent for the space in question is considered below market.
Â 


261
Â 
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â Deferred
MaintenanceâA deferred maintenance reserve may be required to be funded at loan origination in an amount equal to 125% of
the estimated cost of material immediate repairs or replacements identified in the property condition report, except that such
escrows are not required in certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, (i)Â if the sponsor of the borrower delivers
a guarantee to complete the immediate repairs in a specified amount of time, (ii)Â if the deferred maintenance amount does
not materially impact the related mortgaged propertyâs function, performance or value or (iii)Â if a single or major
tenant (which may be a ground tenant) at the related mortgaged property is responsible for the repairs.
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â Environmental
RemediationâAn environmental remediation reserve may be required to be funded at loan origination in an amount equal to
100% to 125% of the estimated remediation cost identified in the environmental report, except that such escrows are not required
in certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, (i)Â if the sponsor of the borrower delivers a guarantee wherein
it agrees to take responsibility and pay for the identified environmental issues, (ii)Â if environmental insurance is obtained
or already in place or (iii)Â if a third party unrelated to the borrower is identified as the responsible party.
Â 
For a description of the escrows collected
with respect to the CGMRC Mortgage Loans, please see AnnexÂ A-1 to this prospectus.
Â 
Title Insurance Policy. The borrower
is required to provide, and CGMRC or its counsel typically will review, a title insurance policy for each property. The provisions
of the title insurance policy are required to comply with the sponsor representation and warranty no.Â 6 on AnnexÂ D-1
to this prospectus without any exceptions that CGMRC deems material.
Â 
Property Insurance. CGMRC requires
the borrower to provide, or authorizes the borrower to rely on a tenant or other third party to obtain, insurance policies meeting
the requirements set forth in the sponsor representations and warranties no.Â 16 and no.Â 29 on AnnexÂ D-1 to this
prospectus without any exceptions that CGMRC deems material (other than with respect to deductibles and allowing a tenant to self-insure).
Â 
Third Party Reports. In addition
to or as part of applicable origination guidelines or reviews described above, in the course of originating the CGMRC Mortgage
Loans, CGMRC generally considered the results of third party reports as described below. In many instances, however, one or more
provisions of the guidelines were waived or modified in light of the circumstances of the relevant loan or property.
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â Appraisal.
CGMRC obtains an appraisal meeting the requirements described in the sponsor representation and warranty no.Â 41 on AnnexÂ D-1
to this prospectus without any exceptions that CGMRC deems material. In addition, the appraisal (or a separate letter) includes
a statement by the appraiser that the guidelines in TitleÂ XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement
Act of 1989, as amended, were followed in preparing the appraisal.
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â Environmental
Report. CGMRC generally obtains a PhaseÂ I site assessment or an update of a previously obtained site assessment for each
mortgaged property prepared by an environmental firm approved by CGMRC. CGMRC or its designated agent typically reviews the PhaseÂ I
site assessment to verify the presence or absence of potential adverse environmental conditions. In cases in which the PhaseÂ I
site assessment identifies any such conditions, CGMRC generally requires that the condition be addressed in a manner that complies
with the sponsor
Â 


262
Â 

Â 
representation and warranty no.Â 40 on AnnexÂ D-1 to this prospectus without any exceptions that
CGMRC deems material.
Â Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â Property
Condition Report. CGMRC generally obtains a current property condition report (a âPCRâ) for each mortgaged
property prepared by a structural engineering firm approved by CGMRC. CGMRC or an agent typically reviews the PCR to determine
the physical condition of the property and to determine the anticipated costs of necessary repair, replacement and major maintenance
or capital expenditure over the term of the mortgage loan. In cases in which the PCR identifies an immediate need for material
repairs or replacements with an anticipated cost that is over a certain minimum threshold or percentage of loan balance, CGMRC
often requires that funds be put in escrow at the time of origination of the mortgage loan to complete such repairs or replacements
or obtains a guarantee from a sponsor of the borrower in lieu of reserves. See ââEscrow Requirementsâ
above.
Â 
Servicing. Interim servicing for
all CGMRC loans prior to securitization is typically performed by a nationally recognized rated third party interim servicer. In
addition, primary servicing is occasionally retained by certain qualified mortgage brokerage firms under established sub-servicing
agreements with CGMRC, which firms may continue primary servicing certain loans following the securitization closing date. Otherwise,
servicing responsibilities are transferred from the interim servicer to the master servicer of the securitization trust (and a
primary servicer when applicable) at closing of the securitization. From time to time, the interim servicer may retain primary
servicing.
Â 
Exceptions. None of the CGMRC Mortgage
Loans have material exceptions to the related underwriting criteria.

General. In connection with the
preparation of this prospectus, CGMRC conducted a review of the Mortgage Loans that it is selling to the depositor. The review
was conducted as set forth below and was conducted with respect to each of the CGMRC Mortgage Loans. No sampling procedures were
used in the review process.
Â 
Database. First, CGMRC created
a database of information (the âCGMRC Securitization Databaseâ) obtained in connection with the origination
of the CGMRC Mortgage Loans, including:
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â certain information from the CGMRC Mortgage Loan documents;
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â certain
information from the rent rolls and operating statements for, and certain leases relating to, the related Mortgaged Properties
(in each case to the extent applicable);
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â 
insurance information for the related Mortgaged Properties;
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â 
information from third party reports such as the appraisals, environmental and property condition reports, seismic reports,
zoning reports and other zoning information;
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â bankruptcy searches with respect to the related borrowers; and
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â certain
information and other search results obtained by the CGMRC deal team for each of the CGMRC Mortgage Loans during the underwriting
process.
Â 


263
Â 
Â 
CGMRC also included in the CGMRC Securitization
Database certain updates to such information received by the CGMRC securitization team after origination, such as information from
the interim servicer regarding loan payment status and current escrows, updated rent rolls and leasing activity information provided
pursuant to the Mortgage Loan documents, and information otherwise brought to the attention of the CGMRC securitization team. Such
updates were not intended to be, and do not serve as, a re-underwriting of any Mortgage Loan.
Â 
Using the information in the CGMRC Securitization
Database, CGMRC created a Microsoft Excel file (the âCGMRC Data Fileâ) and provided that file to the depositor
for the inclusion in this prospectus (particularly in AnnexesÂ A-1 and A-2 to this prospectus) of information regarding the
CGMRC Mortgage Loans.
Â 
Data Comparison and Recalculation.
The depositor, on behalf of CGMRC, engaged a third-party accounting firm to perform certain data comparison and recalculation procedures
designed by CGMRC, relating to information in this prospectus regarding the CGMRC Mortgage Loans. These procedures included:
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â comparing
the information in the CGMRC Data File against various source documents provided by CGMRC that are described above under ââDatabaseâ;
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â comparing
numerical information regarding the CGMRC Mortgage Loans and the related Mortgaged Properties disclosed in this prospectus against
the CGMRC Data File; and
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â recalculating certain percentages, ratios and other formulae relating to the CGMRC Mortgage Loans disclosed in this prospectus.
Â 
Legal Review. CGMRC also reviewed
and responded to a Due Diligence Questionnaire (as defined below) relating to the CGMRC Mortgage Loans, which questionnaire was
prepared by the depositorâs legal counsel for use in eliciting information relating to the CGMRC Mortgage Loans and including
such information in this prospectus to the extent material.
Â 
Although the Due Diligence Questionnaire
may be revised from time to time, it typically contains various questions regarding the CGMRC Mortgage Loans, the related Mortgaged
Properties, the related borrowers, sponsors and tenants, and any related additional debt. For example, the due diligence questionnaire
(a âDue Diligence Questionnaireâ) may seek to elicit, among other things, the following information:
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â whether any mortgage loans were originated by third party originators and the names of such originators, and whether such
mortgage loans were underwritten or re-underwritten in accordance with CGMRCâs (or the related mortgage loan sellerâs)
criteria;
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â whether any mortgage loans are not first liens, or have a loan-to-value ratio greater than 80%;
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â whether any mortgage loans are 30Â days or more delinquent with respect to any monthly debt service payment as of the

Â 
CGMRC also provided to origination counsel
the sponsor representations and warranties attached as AnnexÂ D-1 to this prospectus and requested that origination counsel
identify exceptions to such representations and warranties. CGMRC compiled and reviewed the draft exceptions received from origination
counsel, engaged separate counsel to review the exceptions, revised the exceptions and provided them to the depositor for inclusion
on AnnexÂ D-2 to this prospectus. In addition, for each CGMRC Mortgage Loan originated by CGMRC or its affiliates, CGMRC prepared
and delivered to its securitization counsel for review an asset summary, which summary includes important loan terms and certain
property level information obtained during the origination process. The loan terms included in each asset summary may include,
without limitation, the principal amount, the interest rate, the loan term, the interest calculation method, the due date, any
applicable interest-only period, any applicable amortization period, a summary of any prepayment and/or defeasance provisions,
a summary of any lockbox and/or cash management provisions, a summary of any release provisions, and a summary of any requirement
for the related borrower to fund up-front and/or on-going reserves. The property level information obtained during the origination
process included in each asset summary may include, without limitation, a description of the related Mortgaged Property (including
property type, ownership structure, use, location, size, renovations, age and physical attributes), information relating to the
commercial real estate market in which the Mortgaged Property is located, information relating to the related borrower and sponsor
of the related borrower, an underwriterâs assessment of strengths and risks of the loan transaction, tenant analysis, and
summaries of third party reports such as appraisal, environmental and property condition reports.
Â 


266
Â 
Â 
For each CGMRC Mortgage Loan, if any,
purchased by CGMRC or its affiliates from a third-party originator of such Mortgage Loan, CGMRC reviewed the purchase agreement
and related representations and warranties, and exceptions to those representations and warranties, made by the seller of such
CGMRC Mortgage Loan to CGMRC or its affiliates, reviewed certain provisions of the related Mortgage Loan documents and third party
reports concerning the related Mortgaged Property provided by the originator of such Mortgage Loan, prepared exceptions to the
representations and warranties in the MLPA based upon such review, and provided them to the depositor for inclusion on AnnexÂ D-2
to this prospectus. With respect to any CGMRC Mortgage Loan that is purchased by CGMRC or its affiliates from a third party originator,
the representations and warranties made by the third party originator in the related purchase agreement between CGMRC or its affiliates,
on the one hand, and the third party originator, on the other hand, are solely for the benefit of CGMRC or its affiliates. The
rights, if any, that CGMRC or its affiliates may have under such purchase agreement upon a breach of such representations and warranties
made by the third party originator will not be assigned to the trustee, and the certificateholders and the trustee will not have
any recourse against the third party originator in connection with any breach of the representations and warranties made by such
third party originator. As described above under âDescription of the Mortgage Loan Purchase AgreementsâGeneralâ,
the substitution or repurchase obligation of CGMRC, as mortgage loan seller, with respect to the CGMRC Mortgage Loans under the
related MLPA constitutes the sole remedy available to the Certificateholders and the trustee for any uncured material breach of
any CGMRCâs representations and warranties regarding the CGMRC Mortgage Loans, including any CGMRC Mortgage Loans that are
purchased by CGMRC or its affiliates from a third party originator.
Â 
In addition, with respect to each CGMRC
Mortgage Loan, CGMRC reviewed, and in certain cases requested that its counsel review, certain Mortgage Loan document provisions
as necessary for disclosure of such provisions in this prospectus, such as property release provisions and other provisions specifically
disclosed in this prospectus.
Â 
Certain Updates. Furthermore, CGMRC
requested the borrowers under the CGMRC Mortgage Loans (or the borrowersâ respective counsel) for updates on any significant
pending litigation that existed at origination. Moreover, if CGMRC became aware of a significant natural disaster in the vicinity
of a Mortgaged Property relating to a CGMRC Mortgage Loan, CGMRC requested information on the property status from the related
borrower in order to confirm whether any material damage to the property had occurred.
Â 
Large Loan Summaries. Finally,
CGMRC prepared, and reviewed with originating counsel and/or securitization counsel, the loan summaries for those of the CGMRC
Mortgage Loans included in the 10 largest Mortgage Loans (considering any group of cross-collateralized Mortgage Loans as a single
Mortgage Loan) in the mortgage pool, and the abbreviated loan summaries for those of the CGMRC Mortgage Loans included in the next
5 largest Mortgage Loans (considering any group of cross-collateralized Mortgage Loans as a single Mortgage Loan) in the mortgage
pool, which loan summaries and abbreviated loan summaries are incorporated in the âSummaries of the Fifteen Largest Mortgage
Loansâ in AnnexÂ A-3 to this prospectus.
Â 
Findings and Conclusions. Based
on the foregoing review procedures, CGMRC found and concluded that the disclosure regarding the CGMRC Mortgage Loans in this prospectus
is accurate in all material respects. CGMRC also found and concluded that the CGMRC Mortgage Loans were originated in accordance
with CGMRCâs origination procedures and underwriting criteria described above under ââCGMRCâs Underwriting
Guidelines and Processesâ. CGMRC attributes to itself all findings and conclusions resulting from the foregoing review
procedures.
Â 


267
Â 
Â 

Review Procedures in the Event of a
Mortgage Loan Substitution. CGMRC will perform a review of any mortgage loan that it elects to substitute for a CGMRC Mortgage
Loan in the pool in connection with a material breach of a representation or warranty or a material document defect. CGMRC, and
if appropriate its legal counsel, will review the related mortgage loan documents and servicing history of the substitute mortgage
loan to confirm it meets each of the criteria required under the terms of the related MLPA and the PSA (the âQualification
Criteriaâ). CGMRC may engage a third party accounting firm to compare the Qualification Criteria against the underlying
source documentation to verify the accuracy of the review by CGMRC and to confirm any numerical and/or statistical information
to be disclosed in any required filings under the Exchange Act. Legal counsel will also be engaged by CGMRC to render any tax opinion
required in connection with the substitution.
Â 
Compliance with RuleÂ 15Ga-1
under the Exchange Act
Â 
CGMRC most recently filed a Form ABS-15G
pursuant to Rule 15Ga-1 under the Exchange Act on FebruaryÂ 17, 2015. CGMRCâs Central Index Key is 0001541001. With respect
to the period from and including OctoberÂ 1, 2012 to and including September 30, 2015, CGMRC does not have any activity to
report as required by RuleÂ 15Ga-1 under the Exchange Act with respect to repurchase or replacement requests in connection
with breaches of representations and warranties made by it as a sponsor of commercial mortgage securitizations.
Â 
Retained Interests in This
Securitization
Â 
Neither CGMRC nor any of its affiliates
will retain on the Closing Date any certificates issued by the issuing entity or any other economic interest in this securitization.
In addition, CGMRC or its affiliates may own in the future certain classes of certificates. Any such party will have the right
to dispose of any such certificates at any time.
Â 
The information set forth under ââCitigroup
Global Markets Realty Corp.â relating to CGMRC has been provided by CGMRC.
Â 
Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association
Â 
General
Â 
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association
(âWells Fargo Bankâ), a national banking association, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wells Fargo & Company
(NYSE: WFC). The principal office of Wells Fargo Bankâs commercial mortgage origination division is located at 45 Fremont
Street, 9th Floor, San Francisco, California 94105, and its telephone number is (415) 396-7697. Wells Fargo Bank is engaged in
a general consumer banking, commercial banking, and trust business, offering a wide range of commercial, corporate, international,
financial market, retail and fiduciary banking services. Wells Fargo Bank is a national banking association chartered by the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency (the âOCCâ) and is subject to the regulation, supervision and examination
of the OCC. Wells Fargo Bank is also the successor by merger to Wachovia Bank, National Association (âWachovia Bankâ),
which, together with Wells Fargo Securities,Â LLC (formerly known as Wachovia Capital Markets,Â LLC), was previously a
subsidiary of Wachovia Corporation. On December 31, 2008, Wachovia Corporation merged with and into Wells Fargo & Company.
As a result of this transaction, the depositor, Wachovia Bank and Wells Fargo Securities,Â LLC became wholly-owned subsidiaries
of Wells Fargo & Company, and affiliates of Wells Fargo Bank. On MarchÂ 20, 2010, Wachovia Bank merged with and into Wells
Fargo Bank.
Â 

268
Â 
Â 

Wells Fargo Bank, National
Associationâs Commercial Mortgage Securitization Program
Â 
Prior to its merger with Wachovia Bank,
Wells Fargo Bank was an active participant in securitizations of commercial and multifamily mortgage loans as a mortgage loan seller
and sponsor in securitizations for which unaffiliated entities acted as depositor. Between the inception of its commercial mortgage
securitization program in 1995 and December 2007, Wells Fargo Bank originated approximately 5,360 fixed-rate commercial and multifamily
mortgage loans with an aggregate original principal balance of approximately $32.4 billion, which were included in approximately
61 securitization transactions.
Â 
In the case of the Mortgage Loan identified
on Annex A-1 to this prospectus as University Center South representing approximately 0.3% of the Initial Pool Balance, Wells Fargo
Bank, as mortgage loan seller, delegated certain of its underwriting and origination functions to Principal Real Estate Investors,
LLC, an affiliate of Principal Life Insurance Company pursuant to a program of agreed upon underwriting and closing procedures,
including the preparation of analyses required by such procedures, subject to the oversight and ultimate review and approval by
Wells Fargo Bank. These functions were all performed in accordance with the loan approval procedures described herein in all material
respects. Such Mortgage Loan was funded entirely by and in the name of Wells Fargo Bank using documentation approved by Wells Fargo
Bank for mortgage loans intended for securitization. Principal Global Investors, LLC, an affiliate of Principal Life Insurance
Company, serviced such Mortgage Loan prior to securitization and will continue to act as primary servicer with respect to such
Mortgage Loan after securitization.
Â 
Prior to its merger into Wells Fargo Bank,
one of Wachovia Bankâs primary business lines was the underwriting and origination of mortgage loans secured by commercial
or multifamily properties. With its commercial mortgage lending affiliates and predecessors, Wachovia Bank began originating and
securitizing commercial mortgage loans in 1995. The total amount of commercial mortgage loans originated and securitized by Wachovia
Bank from 1995 through NovemberÂ 2007 was approximately $87.9 billion. Approximately $81.0 billion of such commercial mortgage
loans were securitized by an affiliate of Wachovia Bank acting as depositor, and approximately $6.9 billion were securitized by
an unaffiliated entity acting as depositor.
Â 
Since 2010, and following the merger of
Wachovia Bank into Wells Fargo Bank, Wells Fargo Bank has resumed its active participation in the securitization of commercial
and multifamily mortgage loans. Wells Fargo Bank originates commercial and multifamily mortgage loans and, together with other
mortgage loan sellers and sponsors, participates in the securitization of such mortgage loans by transferring them to the depositor
or to an unaffiliated securitization depositor. In coordination with its affiliate, Wells Fargo Securities,Â LLC, and other
underwriters, Wells Fargo Bank works with rating agencies, mortgage loan sellers, subordinated debt purchasers and master servicers
in structuring securitizations in which it is a sponsor, mortgage loan seller and originator. For the twelve-month period ended
DecemberÂ 31, 2014, Wells Fargo Bank securitized commercial and multifamily mortgage loans with an aggregate original principal
balance of approximately $6.07 billion. Since the beginning of 2010, Wells Fargo Bank originated approximately 1,285 fixed-rate
commercial and multifamily mortgage loans with an aggregate original principal balance of approximately $24.2Â billion, which
were included in 62 securitization transactions. The properties securing these loans include multifamily, office, retail, industrial,
hospitality and self storage properties. Wells Fargo Bank and certain of its affiliates also originate other commercial and multifamily
mortgage loans that are not securitized, including subordinated and mezzanine loans.
Â 


269
Â 
Â 
In addition to commercial and multifamily
mortgage loans, Wells Fargo Bank and its affiliates have originated and securitized residential mortgage loans, auto loans, home
equity loans, credit card receivables and student loans. Wells Fargo Bank and its affiliates have also served as sponsors, issuers,
master servicers, servicers, certificate administrators, custodians and trustees in a wide array of securitization transactions.
Â 
Wells Fargo Bankâs
Commercial Mortgage Loan Underwriting
Â 
General. Wells Fargo Bankâs
commercial real estate finance group has the authority, with the approval from the appropriate credit authority, to originate fixed-rate,
first lien commercial, multifamily or manufactured housing community mortgage loans for securitization. Wells Fargo Bankâs
commercial real estate finance operation is staffed by real estate professionals. Wells Fargo Bankâs loan underwriting group
is an integral component of the commercial real estate finance group which also includes groups responsible for loan origination
and closing mortgage loans.
Â 
Upon receipt of an executed loan application,
Wells Fargo Bankâs loan underwriters commence a review of the borrowerâs financial condition and creditworthiness and
the real property which will secure the loan.
Â 
Notwithstanding the discussion below,
given the unique nature of income-producing real properties, the underwriting and origination procedures and the credit analysis
with respect to any particular multifamily or commercial mortgage loan may differ significantly from one asset to another, and
will be driven by circumstances particular to that property, including, among others, its type, current use, physical quality,
size, environmental condition, location, market conditions, capital reserve requirements and additional collateral, tenants and
leases, borrower identity, borrower sponsorship and/or performance history, and certain other factors. Consequently, we cannot
assure you that the underwriting of any particular multifamily or commercial mortgage loan will conform to each of the general
procedures described in this ââWells Fargo Bankâs Commercial Mortgage Loan Underwritingâ section.
For important information about the circumstances that have affected the underwriting of the mortgage loans in the mortgage pool,
see the âRisk Factorsâ and âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâExceptions to Underwriting Guidelinesâ
sections of this prospectus and the other subsections of this âTransaction Partiesâ section.
Â 
If a mortgage loan exhibits any one of
the following credit positive characteristics, variances from general underwriting/origination procedures described below may be
considered acceptable under the circumstances indicated: (i)Â low loan-to-value ratio; (ii)Â high debt service coverage
ratio; (iii)Â experienced sponsor(s)/guarantor(s) with financial wherewithal; and (iv)Â elements of recourse included in
the loan.
Â 
Loan Analysis. Generally, Wells
Fargo Bank performs both a credit analysis and collateral analysis with respect to a loan applicant and the real estate that will
secure the loan. In general, credit analysis of the borrower and the real estate includes a review of historical financial statements
(or, in the case of acquisitions, often only current financial statements), rent rolls, certain leases, third-party credit reports,
judgments, liens, bankruptcy and pending litigation searches and, if applicable, the loan payment history of the borrower. Wells
Fargo Bank typically performs a qualitative analysis which incorporates independent credit checks and published debt and equity
information with respect to certain principals of the borrower as well as the borrower itself. Borrowers are generally required
to be single-purpose entities. The collateral analysis typically includes an analysis of the following, to the extent available
and applicable based on property type: historical property operating statements, rent rolls, operating budgets, a projection of
future performance, and a review of certain tenant leases. Depending on the type of collateral property and other factors, the
Â 


270
Â 
Â 
credit of key tenants may also be reviewed. Each mortgaged property is generally inspected by a Wells Fargo Bank underwriter or
qualified designee. Wells Fargo Bank generally requires third-party appraisals, as well as environmental and property condition
reports and, if determined by Wells Fargo Bank to be applicable, seismic reports. Each report is reviewed for acceptability by
a staff member of Wells Fargo Bank or a third-party consultant. Generally, the results of these reviews are incorporated into the
underwriting report. In some instances, one or more of the procedures may be waived or modified by Wells Fargo Bank if it is determined
not to adversely affect the mortgage loans originated by it in any material respect.
Â 
Loan Approval. Prior to loan closing,
all mortgage loans to be originated by Wells Fargo Bank must be approved by one or more officers of Wells Fargo Bank (depending
on loan size), who may approve a mortgage loan as recommended, request additional due diligence, modify the loan terms or decline
a loan transaction.
Â 
Debt Service Coverage Ratios and Loan-to-Value
Ratios. Generally, the debt service coverage ratios for Wells Fargo Bank mortgage loans will be equal to or greater than 1.20x;
provided, however, that variances may be made when consideration is given to circumstances particular to the mortgage
loan, the related mortgaged property, loan-to-value ratio, reserves or other factors. For example, Wells Fargo Bank may originate
a mortgage loan with a debt service coverage ratio below 1.20x based on, among other things, the amortization features of the mortgage
loan (for example, if the mortgage loan provides for relatively rapid amortization), the type of tenants and leases at the mortgaged
property, the taking of additional collateral such as reserves, letters of credit and/or guarantees, Wells Fargo Bankâs judgment
of improved property and/or market performance in the future and/or other relevant factors.
Â 
Generally, the loan-to-value ratio for
Wells Fargo Bank mortgage loans will be equal to or less than 80%; provided, however, that variances may be made
when consideration is given to circumstances particular to the mortgage loan, the related mortgaged property, debt service coverage,
reserves or other factors. For example, Wells Fargo Bank may originate a mortgage loan with a loan-to-value ratio above 80% based
on, among other things, the amortization features of the mortgage loan (for example, if the mortgage loan provides for relatively
rapid amortization), the type of tenants and leases at the related mortgaged property, the taking of additional collateral such
as reserves, letters of credit and/or guarantees, Wells Fargo Bankâs judgment of improved property and/or performance in
the future and/or other relevant factors.
Â 
While the foregoing discussion generally
reflects how calculations of debt service coverage ratios are made, it does not necessarily reflect the specific calculations made
to determine the debt service coverage ratio disclosed in this prospectus with respect to the mortgage loans to be sold to us by
Wells Fargo Bank for deposit into the trust fund.
Â 
Additional Debt. When underwriting
a multifamily or commercial mortgage loan, Wells Fargo Bank will take into account whether the mortgaged property and/or direct
or indirect interest in a related borrower are encumbered by additional debt and will analyze the likely effect of that additional
debt on repayment of the subject mortgage loan. It is possible that Wells Fargo Bank or an affiliate will be the lender on that
additional debt, and may either sell such debt to an unaffiliated third party or hold it in inventory.
Â 
The combined debt service coverage ratios
and loan-to-value ratios of a mortgage loan and the related additional debt may be significantly below 1.20x and significantly
above 80%, notwithstanding that the mortgage loan by itself may satisfy such guidelines.
Â 


271
Â 
Â 
Assessments of Property Condition.
As part of the underwriting process, Wells Fargo Bank will analyze the condition of the real property collateral for a prospective
multifamily or commercial mortgage loan. To aid in that analysis, Wells Fargo Bank will typically inspect or retain a third party
to inspect the property and will in most cases obtain the property assessments and reports described below.
Â 
Appraisals. Wells Fargo Bank will,
in most cases, require that the real property collateral for a prospective multifamily or commercial mortgage loan be appraised
by a state-certified appraiser, an appraiser belonging to the âAppraisal Instituteâ, a membership association
of professional real estate appraisers, or an otherwise qualified appraiser. In addition, Wells Fargo Bank will generally require
that those appraisals be conducted in accordance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practices developed by The
Appraisal Foundation, a not-for-profit organization established by the appraisal profession. Furthermore, the appraisal report
will usually include or be accompanied by a separate letter that includes a statement by the appraiser that the guidelines in Title
XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 were followed in preparing the appraisal. In some
cases, however, Wells Fargo Bank may establish the value of the subject real property collateral based on a cash flow analysis,
a recent sales price or another method or benchmark of valuation.
Â 
Environmental Assessments. Wells
Fargo Bank will, in most cases, require a Phase I environmental assessment with respect to the real property collateral for a prospective
multifamily or commercial mortgage loan. However, when circumstances warrant, Wells Fargo Bank may utilize an update of a prior
environmental assessment, a transaction screen or a desktop review. Alternatively, Wells Fargo Bank might forego an environmental
assessment in limited circumstances, such as when it has obtained the benefits of an environmental insurance policy or an environmental
guarantee. Furthermore, an environmental assessment conducted at any particular real property collateral will not necessarily cover
all potential environmental issues. For example, an analysis for radon, lead-based paint and lead in drinking water will usually
be conducted only at multifamily rental properties and only when Wells Fargo Bank or the environmental consultant believes that
special circumstances warrant such an analysis.
Â 
Depending on the findings of the initial
environmental assessment, Wells Fargo Bank may require additional record searches or environmental testing, such as a Phase II
environmental assessment with respect to the real property collateral.
Â 
Engineering Assessments. In connection
with the origination process, Wells Fargo Bank may require that an engineering firm inspect the real property collateral for any
prospective multifamily or commercial mortgage loan to assess the structure, exterior walls, roofing, interior structure and/or
mechanical and electrical systems. Based on the resulting report, Wells Fargo Bank will determine the appropriate response, if
any, to any recommended repairs, corrections or replacements and any identified deferred maintenance.
Â 
Seismic Report. In general, prospective
borrowers seeking loans secured by properties located in California or in seismic zones 3 or 4 obtain a seismic engineering report
of the building and, based thereon and on certain statistical information, an estimate of damage based on the percentage of the
replacement cost of the building in an earthquake scenario. This percentage of the replacement cost is expressed in terms of probable
maximum loss (âPMLâ), probable loss (âPLâ), or scenario expected loss (âSELâ).
Generally, any of the mortgage loans as to which the property was estimated to have PML, PL or SEL in excess of 20% of the estimated
replacement cost, would either be subject to a lower loan-to-value ratio limit at origination, be conditioned on seismic upgrading
(or appropriate reserves or
Â 


272
Â 
Â 
letter of credit for retrofitting), be conditioned on satisfactory earthquake insurance, or be structured
with a degree of recourse to a guarantor.
Â 
Zoning and Building Code Compliance.
In connection with the origination of a multifamily or commercial mortgage loan, Wells Fargo Bank will generally consider whether
the use and occupancy of the related real property collateral is in material compliance with zoning, land-use, building rules,
regulations and orders then applicable to that property. Evidence of this compliance may be in the form of one or more of the following:
legal opinions; surveys; recorded documents; temporary or permanent certificates of occupancy; letters from government officials
or agencies, including applicable land use and zoning regulations; title insurance endorsements; engineering or consulting reports;
and/or representations by the related borrower.
Â 
Where a mortgaged property as currently
operated is a permitted nonconforming use and/or the structure and the improvements may not be rebuilt to the same dimensions or
used in the same manner in the event of a major casualty, Wells Fargo Bank will consider whetherâ
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â any
major casualty that would prevent rebuilding has a sufficiently remote likelihood of occurring;
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â casualty insurance proceeds together with the value of any additional collateral would be available in an amount estimated
by Wells Fargo Bank to be sufficient to pay off the related mortgage loan in full;
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â the real property collateral, if permitted to be repaired or restored in conformity with current law, would in Wells Fargo
Bankâs judgment constitute adequate security for the related mortgage loan;
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â whether a variance or other similar change in applicable zoning restrictions is potentially available, or whether the applicable
governing entity is likely to enforce the related limitations; and/or
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â to require the related borrower to obtain law and ordinance insurance and/or alternative mitigant is in place.
Â 
Escrow Requirements. Generally,
Wells Fargo Bank requires most borrowers to fund various escrows for taxes and insurance, capital expenses and replacement reserves.
Generally, the required escrows for mortgage loans originated by Wells Fargo Bank are as follows:
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â TaxesâTypically, an initial deposit and monthly escrow deposits equal to 1/12th of the annual property taxes (based
on the most recent property assessment and the current millage rate) are required to provide Wells Fargo Bank with sufficient funds
to satisfy all taxes and assessments. Tax escrows may not be required if a property is a single tenant property and the tenant
is required to pay taxes directly. Wells Fargo Bank may waive this escrow requirement under certain circumstances.
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â InsuranceâIf the property is insured under an individual policy (i.e., the property is not covered by a blanket
policy), typically an initial deposit and monthly escrow deposits equal to 1/12th of the annual property insurance premium are
required to provide Wells Fargo Bank with sufficient funds to pay all insurance premiums. Insurance escrows may not be required
if (i)Â the borrower maintains a blanket insurance policy, or (ii)Â the property is a single tenant property (which may
include
Â 


273
Â 

Â 
ground leased tenants) and the tenant is required to maintain property insurance. Wells Fargo Bank may
waive this escrow requirement under certain circumstances.
Â Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â Replacement
ReservesâReplacement reserves are generally calculated in accordance with the expected useful life of the components of
the property during the term of the mortgage loan. Annual replacement reserves are generally underwritten to the suggested replacement
reserve amount from an independent, third-party property condition or engineering report, or to certain minimum requirements by
property type. Replacement reserves may not be required if the related mortgaged property is a single tenant property and the
related tenant is responsible for all repairs and maintenance, including those required with respect to the roof and improvement
structure. Wells Fargo Bank may waive this escrow requirement under certain circumstances.
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â Completion
Repair/Environmental RemediationâTypically, a completion repair or remediation reserve is required where an environmental
or engineering report suggests that such reserve is necessary. Upon funding of the related mortgage loan, Wells Fargo Bank generally
requires that at least 115%-125% of the estimated costs of repairs or replacements be reserved and generally requires that repairs
or replacements be completed within a year after the funding of the related mortgage loan. Wells Fargo Bank may waive this escrow
requirement or adjust the timing to complete repairs under certain circumstances.
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â Tenant
Improvement/Lease CommissionsâIn most cases, various tenants have lease expirations within the mortgage loan term. To mitigate
this risk, special reserves may be required to be funded either at closing of the mortgage loan and/or during the related mortgage
loan term to cover certain anticipated leasing commissions or tenant improvement costs which might be associated with re-leasing
the space occupied by such tenants. Tenant Improvement/Lease Commissions may not be required for single tenant properties with
leases that extend beyond the loan term or where rent at the mortgaged property is considered below market. Wells Fargo Bank may
waive this escrow requirement under certain circumstances.
Â 
Furthermore, Wells Fargo Bank may accept
an alternative to a cash escrow or reserve from a borrower, such as a letter of credit or a guarantee from the borrower or an affiliate
of the borrower or periodic evidence that the items for which the escrow or reserve would have been established are being addressed.
In some cases, Wells Fargo Bank may determine that establishing an escrow or reserve is not warranted in the event of the existence
of one or more of the credit positive characteristics discussed above, or given the amounts that would be involved and Wells Fargo
Bankâs evaluation of the ability of the mortgaged property, the borrower or a holder of direct or indirect ownership interests
in the borrower to bear the subject expense or cost absent creation of an escrow or reserve.
Â 
Co-Originations. From time to time,
Wells Fargo Bank originates mortgage loans together with other financial institutions. The resulting mortgage loans are evidenced
by two or more promissory notes, at least one of which will reflect Wells Fargo Bank as the payee. Wells Fargo Bank has in the
past and may in the future deposit such promissory notes for which it is named as payee with one or more securitization trusts,
while its co-originators have in the past and may in the future deposit such promissory notes for which they are named payee into
other securitization trusts. No Wells Fargo Bank Mortgage Loan to be included in the trust fund has been co-originated as described
in this paragraph.
Â 


274
Â 

Â 
Exceptions. One or more of Wells
Fargo Bankâs Mortgage Loans may vary from the specific Wells Fargo Bankâs underwriting guidelines described above when
additional credit positive characteristics are present as discussed above. In addition, in the case of one or more of Wells Fargo
Bankâs Mortgage Loans, Wells Fargo Bank or another originator may not have applied each of the specific underwriting guidelines
described above as the result of case-by-case permitted flexibility based upon other compensating factors. For any material exceptions
to Wells Fargo Bankâs underwriting guidelines described above in respect of the Wells Fargo Bank Mortgage Loans, see âDescription
of the Mortgage PoolâExceptions to Underwriting Guidelinesâ in this prospectus.
Â 
Review of Mortgage Loans
for Which Wells Fargo Bank is the Sponsor
Â 
Overview. Wells Fargo Bank, in
its capacity as the sponsor of the Wells Fargo Bank Mortgage Loans, has conducted a review of the Wells Fargo Bank Mortgage Loans
it is selling to the depositor designed and effected to provide reasonable assurance that the disclosure related to the Wells Fargo
Bank Mortgage Loans is accurate in all material respects. Wells Fargo Bank determined the nature, extent and timing of the review
and the level of assistance provided by any third parties. The review of the Wells Fargo Bank Mortgage Loans was performed by a
deal team comprised of real estate and securitization professionals who are employees of Wells Fargo Bank (collectively, the âWells
Fargo Bank Deal Teamâ) with the assistance of certain third parties. Wells Fargo Bank has ultimate authority and control
over, and assumes all responsibility for and attributes to itself, the review of the Mortgage Loans that it is selling to the depositor
and the reviewâs findings and conclusions. The review procedures described below were employed with respect to all of the
Wells Fargo Bank Mortgage Loans (rather than relying on sampling procedures), except that certain review procedures were solely
relevant to the large loan disclosures in this prospectus, as further described below.
Â 
Database. To prepare for securitization,
members of the Wells Fargo Bank Deal Team created a database of loan-level and property-level information relating to each Wells
Fargo Bank Mortgage Loan. The database was compiled from, among other sources, the related mortgage loan documents, third-party
reports (appraisals, environmental site assessments, property condition reports, zoning reports and applicable seismic studies),
insurance policies, borrower-supplied information (including, to the extent available, rent rolls, leases, operating statements
and budgets) and information collected by Wells Fargo Bank during the underwriting process. Prior to securitization of each Wells
Fargo Bank Mortgage Loan, the Wells Fargo Bank Deal Team may have updated the information in the database with respect to such
Wells Fargo Bank Mortgage Loan based on current information provided by the related servicer relating to loan payment status and
escrows, updated operating statements, rent rolls and leasing activity, and information otherwise brought to the attention of the
Wells Fargo Bank Deal Team. Such updates were not intended to be, and do not serve as, a re-underwriting of any Mortgage Loan.
Â 
A data tape (the âWells Fargo
Bank Data Tapeâ) containing detailed information regarding each Wells Fargo Bank Mortgage Loan was created from the information
in the database referred to in the prior paragraph. The Wells Fargo Bank Data Tape was used by the Wells Fargo Bank Deal Team to
provide the numerical information regarding the Wells Fargo Bank Mortgage Loans in this prospectus.
Â 
Data Comparisons and Recalculation.
The depositor, on behalf of Wells Fargo Bank, engaged a third-party accounting firm to perform certain data comparison and recalculation
procedures which were designed or provided by Wells Fargo Bank relating to information in this prospectus regarding the Wells Fargo
Bank Mortgage Loans. These procedures included:
Â 


275
Â 
Â 

Â·Â Â Â Â Â comparing
the information in the Wells Fargo Bank Data Tape against various source documents provided by Wells Fargo Bank;
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â comparing
numerical information regarding the Wells Fargo Bank Mortgage Loans and the related Mortgaged Properties disclosed in this prospectus
against the information contained in the Wells Fargo Bank Data Tape; and
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â recalculating
certain percentages, ratios and other formulae relating to the Wells Fargo Bank Mortgage Loans disclosed in this prospectus.
Â 
Legal Review. In anticipation of
the securitization of each Wells Fargo Bank Mortgage Loan, mortgage loan seller counsel promulgated a form of legal summary to
be completed by origination counsel that, among other things, set forth certain material terms and property diligence information,
and elicited information concerning potentially outlying attributes of the mortgage loan as well as any related mitigating considerations.
Mortgage loan sellerâs counsel reviewed the legal summaries for each Wells Fargo Bank Mortgage Loan, together with pertinent
parts of the Mortgage Loan documentation and property diligence materials, in connection with preparing or corroborating the accuracy
of certain loan disclosure in this prospectus. In addition, mortgage loan sellerâs counsel reviewed Wells Fargo Bankâs
representations and warranties set forth on AnnexÂ D-1 to this prospectus and, if applicable, identified exceptions to those
representations and warranties.
Â 
Securitization counsel was also engaged
to assist in the review of the Wells Fargo Bank Mortgage Loans. Such assistance included, among other things, a review of a due
diligence questionnaire completed by the Wells Fargo Bank Deal Team. Securitization counsel also reviewed the property release
provisions, if any, for each Wells Fargo Bank Mortgage Loan with multiple Mortgaged Properties for compliance with the REMIC provisions.
Â 
Mortgage loan sellerâs counsel or
securitization counsel also assisted in the preparation of the mortgage loan summaries set forth in AnnexÂ A-3 to this prospectus,
based on their respective reviews of pertinent sections of the related mortgage loan documents and other loan information.
Â 
Other Review Procedures. Prior
to securitization, Wells Fargo Bank confirmed with the related servicers for the Wells Fargo Bank Mortgage Loans that, to the best
of such servicersâ knowledge and except as previously identified, material events concerning the related Mortgage Loan, the
Mortgaged Property and the borrower and guarantor had not occurred since origination, including, but not limited to, (i)Â loan
modifications or assumptions, or releases of the related borrower or Mortgaged Property; (ii)Â damage to the Mortgaged Property
that materially and adversely affects its value as security for the Mortgage Loan; (iii)Â pending condemnation actions; (iv)Â litigation,
regulatory or other proceedings against the Mortgaged Property, borrower or guarantor, or notice of non-compliance with environmental
laws; (v)Â bankruptcies involving any borrower or guarantor, or any tenant occupying a single tenant property; and (vi)Â any
existing or incipient material defaults.
Â 
The Wells Fargo Bank Deal Team also consulted
with Wells Fargo Bank personnel responsible for the origination of the Wells Fargo Bank Mortgage Loans to confirm that the Wells
Fargo Bank Mortgage Loans were originated in compliance with the origination and underwriting criteria described above under ââWells
Fargo Bankâs Commercial Mortgage Loan Underwriting,â as well as to identify any material deviations from those
origination and underwriting criteria. See âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâExceptions to Underwriting Guidelinesâ
in this prospectus.
Â 


276
Â 
Â 
Findings and Conclusions. Wells
Fargo Bank found and concluded with reasonable assurance that the disclosure regarding the Wells Fargo Bank Mortgage Loans in this
prospectus is accurate in all material respects. Wells Fargo Bank also found and concluded with reasonable assurance that the Wells
Fargo Bank Mortgage Loans were originated in accordance with Wells Fargo Bankâs origination procedures and underwriting criteria,
except as described above under âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâExceptions to Underwriting Guidelinesâ.
Â 
Review Procedures in the Event of a
Mortgage Loan Substitution. Wells Fargo Bank will perform a review of any Wells Fargo Bank Mortgage Loan that it elects to
substitute for a Wells Fargo Bank Mortgage Loan in the pool in connection with a material breach of a representation or warranty
or a material document defect. Wells Fargo Bank, and if appropriate its legal counsel, will review the mortgage loan documents
and servicing history of the substitute mortgage loan to confirm it meets each of the criteria required under the terms of the
related mortgage loan purchase agreement and the related pooling and servicing agreement (the âQualification Criteriaâ).
Wells Fargo Bank may engage a third party accounting firm to compare the Qualification Criteria against the underlying source documentation
to verify the accuracy of the review by Wells Fargo Bank and to confirm any numerical and/or statistical information to be disclosed
in any required filings under the Exchange Act. Legal counsel will also be engaged by Wells Fargo Bank to render any tax opinion
required in connection with the substitution.
Â 
Compliance with Rule 15Ga-1
under the Exchange Act
Â 
The transaction documents for certain
prior transactions in which Wells Fargo Bank securitized commercial mortgage loans or participation interests (âCRE Loansâ)
contain covenants requiring the repurchase or replacement of an underlying CRE Loan for the breach of a related representation
or warranty under various circumstances if the breach is not cured. The following table provides information regarding the demand,
repurchase and replacement activity with respect to the mortgage loans securitized by Wells Fargo Bank (or a predecessor), which
activity occurred during the period from OctoberÂ 1, 2012 to September 30, 2015 (the âRule 15Ga-1 Reporting Periodâ)
or is still outstanding.

(1)In connection with the
  preparation of this table, Wells Fargo Bank undertook the following steps to gather the
  information required by RuleÂ 15Ga-1 (âRule 15Ga-1â) under the
  Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the âExchange Actâ):
  (i)Â identifying all asset-backed securities transactions in which Wells Fargo Bank
  (or a predecessor) acted as a securitizer, (ii)Â performing a diligent search of
  the records of Wells Fargo Bank and the records of affiliates of Wells Fargo Bank that
  acted as securitizers in transactions of commercial mortgage loans for all relevant information,
  (iii)Â reviewing appropriate documentation from all relevant transactions to determine
  the parties responsible for enforcing representations and warranties, and any other parties
  who might have received repurchase requests (such parties, âDemand Entitiesâ),
  and (iv)Â making written request of each Demand Entity to provide any information
  in its possession regarding requests or demands to repurchase any loans for breach of
  a representation or warranty with respect to any relevant transaction. In this effort,
  Wells Fargo Bank made written requests of all trustees and unaffiliated co-sponsors of
  applicable commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions. Wells Fargo Bank followed
  up written requests made of Demand Entities as it deemed appropriate.

(10)U.S. Bank National Association
  (âU.S. Bankâ), as Trustee for Registered Holders of Wachovia Bank
  Commercial Mortgage Trust, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-C28
  v. Dexia Real Estate Capital Markets, Case No.Â 12 CivÂ 9412, filed in the United
  States District Court for the Southern District of NewÂ York (âU.S. Bank vs.
  Dexiaâ). On SeptemberÂ 29, 2011, Dexia Real Estate Capital Markets (âDexiaâ)
  received a letter from CWCapital Asset ManagementÂ LLC as special servicer for the
  issuing trust demanding that Dexia cure alleged defects in the documentation of LoanÂ #58
  Marketplace Retail and Office Center. By letter dated DecemberÂ 29, 2011, Dexia rejected
  the issuing trustâs demand. U.S. Bank, as trustee for the issuing trust, filed
  a complaint against Dexia (on or about DecemberÂ 27, 2012) arguing that Dexia had
  breached the terms of the mortgage loan purchase agreement in light of the determination
  in a Minnesota enforcement action against the guarantors of LoanÂ #58 Marketplace
  Retail and Office Center that the form of the guaranty sold to U.S. Bank pursuant to
  the mortgage loan purchase agreement had not been signed by the guarantors. U.S. Bank,
  in its complaint, seeks a judgment requiring Dexia to repurchase LoanÂ #58 Marketplace
  Retail and Office Center and also requests an award of damages alleged to total approximately
  $16.5Â million. Dexia filed a Notice of Motion to Dismiss and a Memorandum in Support
  of its Motion to Dismiss on JanuaryÂ 25, 2013. Judge ShiraÂ A. Scheindlin entered
  an order denying Dexiaâs motion on JuneÂ 6, 2013. After completion of discovery,
  U.S. Bank and Dexia filed cross-motions for summary judgment and on JulyÂ 9, 2014
  Judge Scheindlin entered an Opinion and Order granting the summary judgment motion of
  U.S. Bank and denying the summary judgment motion of Dexia. On SeptemberÂ 12, 2014,
  Judge Scheindlin entered its judgment directing Dexia to repurchase the loan for $19,627,961.66.
  Dexia has appealed the judgment and the Opinion and Order because Dexia believes they
  should be reversed. Briefing on the appeal has been completed, and the matter is set
  for oral argument on December 3, 2015.

to Bank of America, National Association, as successor by merger to LaSalle Bank National Association, as Trustee for Registered
Holders of Wachovia Bank Commercial Mortgage Trust, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-C24, made demand
on Dexia by letter dated AprilÂ 3, 2013 (the âDemand Letterâ) for repurchase of loanÂ #12 made to Metroplaza
Hotel,Â LLC. In the Demand Letter, U.S. Bank claimed that Dexia breached the representations and warranties made in the mortgage
loan purchase agreement for Dexiaâs failure to record a UCC financing statement against Inn at Woodbridge Inc. (âWoodbridgeâ),
the tenant under a master lease and holder of a leasehold interest in a portion of the mortgaged property that secures loanÂ #12.
U.S. Bank claims that such failure to record a UCC financing statement against Woodbridge resulted in U.S. Bank not having a perfected
security interest and enforceable lien in the personalty owned by Woodbridge and pledged as collateral for loanÂ #12. Dexia
responded to the Demand Letter on JulyÂ 2, 2013 and rejected the repurchase demand. Dexia believes the demand was untimely,
having been made beyond NewÂ Yorkâs six-year statute of limitations for such claims. Dexia has received no further communication
from U.S. Bank.

SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale
Â 
General
Â 
SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale,
a French limited liability company (sociÃ©tÃ© anonyme) authorized as a bank, acting through its New York Branch (âSociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©raleâ), is a sponsor and mortgage loan seller in this transaction. The principal offices of SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale in the United States are located at 245 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10167, and its telephone number
is (212) 278-6461. SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale is an affiliate of SG Americas Securities, LLC, one of the underwriters.
Â 
SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©raleâs
Commercial Mortgage Securitization Program
Â 
SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale
has been engaged in commercial mortgage securitization in the United States since January 2015, although it was also engaged in
mortgage securitization businesses prior to 2009. The vast majority of mortgage loans originated by SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©raleâs
commercial real estate securitization business line are intended to be either sold through securitization transactions in which
SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale acts as a sponsor or sold to third parties in individual loan sale transactions. Other
business lines within SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale may from time to time engage in the business of making commercial
real estate loans that are not originated for the purposes of securitization and that may in fact be held by SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale through maturity. The following is a general description of the types of mortgage loans related to commercial
real estate that SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©raleâs commercial real estate securitization team originates for
securitization purposes:
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â Fixed rate mortgage loans generally having maturities between five and ten years and generally secured by commercial real
estate such as office, retail, hospitality,
Â 


280
Â 

Â 
multifamily, residential, healthcare, self storage and industrial properties. These loans are SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©raleâs commercial real estate securitization teamâs principal loan product and are primarily originated
for the purpose of securitization.
Â Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â Floating
rate loans generally having shorter maturities and secured by stabilized and non-stabilized commercial real estate properties.
These loans are primarily originated for securitization, though in certain cases only a senior interest in the loan is intended
to be securitized.
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â Subordinate
mortgage loans and mezzanine loans. These loans are generally not originated for securitization by SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale
and are sold in individual loan sale transactions.
Â 
In general, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale
does not hold the loans that its commercial real estate securitization team originates until maturity.
Â 
SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale
originates mortgage loans and initiates a securitization transaction by selecting the portfolio of mortgage loans to be securitized
and transferring those mortgage loans to a securitization depositor who in turn transfers those mortgage loans to the issuing trust
fund. In selecting a portfolio to be securitized, consideration is given to geographic concentration, property type concentration
and rating agency models and criteria, such that the overall value and capital structure is maximized for the benefit of SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale.
Â 
SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©raleâs
role may also include engaging third-party service providers such as the master servicer, the special servicer, the trustee and
the certificate administrator, and engaging the rating agencies. In coordination with the underwriters for the related offering,
SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale works with rating agencies, investors, mortgage loan sellers and servicers in structuring
the securitization transaction.
Â 
Neither SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale
nor any of its affiliates act as servicer of the mortgage loans in its securitization transactions it participates in. Instead,
other entities will be contracted to service the mortgage loans in such securitization transactions.
Â 
SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale
sold mortgage loans into securitizations until 2009 and resumed this activity with the WFCM 2015-SG1 transaction. For the period
beginning in January 2015 through October 2015, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale has securitized 40 fixed rate commercial
mortgage loans with an aggregate original principal balance of approximately $470 million.
Â 
SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©raleâs
Underwriting Standards
Â 
Each of the Mortgage Loans originated
by SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale (âSociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Mortgage Loansâ)
was generally originated or co-originated in accordance with the underwriting criteria described below. Each lending situation
is unique, however, and the facts and circumstances surrounding a particular mortgage loan, such as the quality and location of
the real estate collateral, the sponsorship of the borrower and the tenancy of the collateral, will impact the extent to which
the general guidelines below are applied to that specific loan. These underwriting criteria are general, and SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale cannot assure you that every loan will comply in all respects with the guidelines. SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©raleâs commercial real estate securitization business line originates mortgage loans principally for securitization.
Commercial real estate loans originated by other business lines within SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale for purposes
other than securitization are not required to be originated in accordance with the underwriting criteria described below.
Â 
General. SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale originates mortgage loans for securitization from its U.S. headquarters in New York, New York. Bankers within
the origination group focus on
Â 


281
Â 
Â 
sourcing, structuring, underwriting and performing due diligence on their loans. Bankers within
the structured finance group work closely with the loansâ originators to ensure that the loans are suitable for securitization
and satisfy rating agency criteria. All mortgage loans must be approved by at least one or more members of SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©raleâs credit committee, depending on the size of the mortgage loan.
Â 
Loan Analysis. Generally, SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale performs both a credit analysis and collateral analysis with respect to a loan applicant and the real estate
that will secure a mortgage loan. In general, the analysis of a borrower includes a review of money laundering and background checks
and the analysis of its sponsor includes a review of money laundering and background checks, third-party credit reports, bankruptcy
and lien searches, general banking references and commercial mortgage related references. In general, the analysis of the collateral
includes a site visit and a review of the propertyâs historical operating statements (if available), independent market research,
an appraisal with an emphasis on rental and sales comparables, engineering and environmental reports, the propertyâs historic
and current occupancy, financial strengths of tenants, the duration and terms of tenant leases and the use of the property. Each
report is reviewed for acceptability by a real estate finance officer of SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale. The borrowerâs
and property managerâs experience and presence in the subject market are also reviewed. Consideration is also given to anticipated
changes in cash flow that may result from changes in lease terms or market considerations.
Â 
Borrowers are generally required to be
single purpose entities although they are generally not required to be structured to limit the possibility of becoming insolvent
or bankrupt unless the loan has a principal balance of greater than $30 million, in which case additional limitations including
the requirement that the borrower have at least one independent director are required.
Â 
Loan Approval. All mortgage loans
originated by SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale must be approved by at least one real estate finance credit officer
and the head of commercial real estate securitization. Prior to closing loans, a credit memorandum is produced and delivered to
the credit committee. If deemed appropriate a member of the real estate credit department will visit the subject property. The
credit committee may approve a mortgage loan as recommended, request additional due diligence, modify the loan terms or decline
a loan transaction.
Â 
Property Analysis. Prior to origination
of a loan, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale typically performs, or causes to be performed, site inspections at each
property. Depending on the property type, such inspections generally include an evaluation of one or more of the following: functionality,
design, attractiveness, visibility and accessibility of the property as well as proximity to major thoroughfares, transportation
centers, employment sources, retail areas, educational facilities and recreational areas. Such inspections generally assess the
submarket in which the property is located, which may include evaluating competitive or comparable properties.
Â 
Appraisal and Loan-to-Value Ratio.
SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale typically obtains an appraisal that complies, or is certified by the appraiser to
comply, with the real estate appraisal regulations issued jointly by the federal bank regulatory agencies under the Uniform Standards
of Professional Appraisal Practices as amended from time to time. The loan-to-value ratio of the mortgage loan is generally based
on the âas-isâ value set forth in the appraisal. In certain cases, the loan-to-value ratio of the mortgage loan is
based on the âas-completeâ or âas-stabilizedâ value set forth in the appraisal. In certain cases, an updated
appraisal is obtained.
Â 


282
Â 
Â 
Debt Service Coverage Ratio and Loan-to-Value
Ratio. SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©raleâs underwriting standards generally mandate minimum debt service coverage
ratios and maximum loan-to-value ratios. A loan-to-value ratio generally based upon the appraiserâs determination of value
as well as the value derived using a stressed capitalization rate is considered. The debt service coverage ratio is based upon
the underwritten net cash flow and is given particular importance. However, notwithstanding such guidelines, in certain circumstances
the actual debt service coverage ratios, loan-to-value ratios and amortization periods for the mortgage loans originated by SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale may vary from these guidelines.
Â 
Escrow Requirements. Generally,
SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale requires most borrowers to fund various escrows for taxes and insurance, capital expenses
and replacement reserves. In the case of certain hotel loans, FF&E reserves may be held by the franchisor or manager rather
than the lender. Generally, the required escrows for mortgage loans originated by SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale
are as follows (see Annex A-1 to this prospectus for instances in which reserves were not taken):
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â 
TaxesâTypically an initial deposit and monthly escrow deposits equal to 1/12th of the annual property taxes (based
on the most recent property assessment and the current millage rate) are required to provide the lender with sufficient funds to
satisfy all taxes and assessments. SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale may waive this escrow requirement under appropriate
circumstances including, but not limited to, (i)Â where a tenant is required to pay the taxes directly, (ii)Â where there
is institutional sponsorship or a high net worth individual, or (iii)Â where there is a low loan-to-value ratio (i.e.,
less than 60%).
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â InsuranceâIf the property is insured under an individual policy (i.e., the property is not covered by a blanket
policy), typically an initial deposit and monthly escrow deposits equal to 1/12th of the annual property insurance premium are
required to provide the lender with sufficient funds to pay all insurance premiums. SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale
may waive this escrow requirement under appropriate circumstances, including, but not limited to, (i)Â where a property is
covered by a blanket insurance policy maintained by the borrower or sponsor, (ii)Â where there is institutional sponsorship
or a high net worth individual, (iii)Â where an investment grade tenant is responsible for paying all insurance premiums, or
(iv)Â where there is a low loan-to-value ratio (i.e., less than 60%).
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â Replacement ReservesâReplacement reserves are generally calculated in accordance with the expected useful life of
the components of the property during the term of the mortgage loan plus two years. SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale
relies on information provided by an independent engineer to make this determination. SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale
may waive this escrow requirement under appropriate circumstances, including, but not limited to, (i)Â where an investment
grade tenant is responsible for replacements under the terms of its lease, (ii)Â where there is institutional sponsorship or
a high net worth individual, or (iii)Â where there is a low loan-to-value ratio (i.e., less than 60%).
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â Completion
Repair/Environmental RemediationâTypically, a completion repair or remediation reserve is required where an environmental
or engineering report suggests that such reserve is necessary. Upon funding of the related mortgage loan, SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale generally requires that at least 115%-125% of the estimated costs of repairs or replacements be reserved
and generally requires that repairs or replacements be completed within a year after the funding of the related mortgage loan.
SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale may waive this escrow requirement under
Â 


283
Â 

Â 
appropriate circumstances, including, but not limited to, (i)Â where a secured creditor insurance
policy or borrower insurance policy is in place, or (ii)Â where an investment grade party has agreed to take responsibility,
and pay, for any required repair or remediation.
Â Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â Tenant Improvement/Lease CommissionsâIn most cases, various tenants have lease expirations within the mortgage loan
term. To mitigate this risk, special reserves may be required to be funded either at closing of the mortgage loan and/or during
the mortgage loan term to cover certain anticipated leasing commissions or tenant improvement costs which might be associated with
re-leasing the space occupied by such tenants. SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale may waive this escrow requirement under
appropriate circumstances, including, but not limited to, (i)Â where there is institutional sponsorship or a high net worth
individual, (ii)Â where tenant improvement costs are the responsibility of investment grade tenants who do not have termination
rights under their leases, (iii)Â where rents at the mortgaged property are considered to be significantly below market, (iv)Â where
no material leases expire within the mortgage loan term, or (v)Â where there is a low loan-to-value ratio (i.e., less
than 60%).
Â 
Environmental Report. SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale generally obtains a Phase I ESA or an update of a previously obtained ESA for each mortgaged property prepared
by an approved environmental consulting firm. SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale or its designated agent typically reviews
the Phase I ESA to verify the presence or absence of potential adverse environmental conditions. In cases in which the Phase I
ESA identifies any such conditions and no third party is identified as responsible for such condition, or the condition has not
otherwise been satisfactorily mitigated, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale generally requires the borrower to conduct
remediation activities, or to establish an operations and maintenance plan or to place funds in escrow to be used to address any
required remediation. In cases in which the Phase I ESA recommends that a Phase II ESA be obtained, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale
generally requires such Phase II ESA to be obtained.
Â 
Physical Condition Report. SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale generally obtains a current PCR for each mortgaged property prepared by an approved structural engineering
firm. SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale, or an agent, typically reviews the PCR to determine the physical condition
of the property, and to determine the anticipated costs of necessary repair, replacement and major maintenance or capital expenditure
over the term of the mortgage loan. In cases in which the PCR identifies an immediate need for material repairs or replacements
with an anticipated cost that is over a certain minimum threshold or percentage of loan balance, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale
often requires that funds be put in escrow at the time of origination of the mortgage loan to complete such repairs or replacements
or obtains a guarantee from a sponsor of the borrower in lieu of reserves.
Â 
Title Insurance Policy. The borrower
is required to provide, and SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale or its counsel typically will review, a title insurance
policy for each property. The title insurance policies provided typically must meet the following requirements: (a)Â written
by a title insurer licensed to do business in the jurisdiction where the mortgaged property is located, (b)Â in an amount at
least equal to the original principal balance of the mortgage loan, (c)Â protection and benefits run to the mortgagee and its
successors and assigns, (d)Â written on an American Land Title Association (âALTAâ) form or equivalent policy
promulgated in the jurisdiction where the mortgaged property is located and (e)Â if a survey was prepared, the legal description
of the mortgaged property in the title policy conforms to that shown on the survey.
Â 


284
Â 
Â 
Property Insurance. SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale typically requires the borrower to provide one or more of the following insurance policies: (1)Â commercial
general liability insurance for bodily injury or death and property damage; (2)Â an âAll Risk of Physical Lossâ
policy; (3)Â if applicable, boiler and machinery coverage; and (4)Â if the mortgaged property is located in a special flood
hazard area where mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply, flood insurance. In some cases, a sole tenant is responsible
for maintaining insurance and, subject to the satisfaction of rating conditions or net worth criteria, is allowed to self-insure
against the risks.
Â 
Other Factors. Other factors that
are considered by SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale in the origination of a commercial mortgage loan include current
operations, occupancy and tenant base.
Â 
Exceptions. Notwithstanding the
discussion under ââSociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©raleâs Underwriting Standardsâ above,
one or more of the SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Mortgage Loans may vary from, or do not comply with, SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©raleâs underwriting guidelines described above. In addition, in the case of one or more of the SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale Mortgage Loans, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale may not have strictly applied the underwriting
guidelines described above as the result of a case by case permitted exception based upon other compensating factors. None of the
SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Mortgage Loans were originated with any material exceptions to SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©raleâs underwriting policies.
Â 
Review of the Mortgage Loans
for Which SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale is the Sponsor
Â 
Overview. In connection with the
securitization described in this prospectus, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale, as a sponsor of this offering, has conducted
a review of the SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Mortgage Loans it is selling to the depositor designed and effected
to provide reasonable assurance that the disclosure related to such SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Mortgage Loans
is accurate in all material respects. SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale determined the nature, extent and timing of
the review and the level of assistance provided by any third parties. The review of the SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale
Mortgage Loans was conducted as described below with respect to each of those SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Mortgage
Loans. The review of the SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Mortgage Loans was performed by a deal team comprised of
real estate and securitization professionals who are employees and contractors of SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale
or its affiliates (collectively, the âSociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Deal Teamâ) with the assistance
of certain third parties. SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale has ultimate authority and control over, and assumes all
responsibility for and attributes to itself, the review of the SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Mortgage Loans and
the reviewâs findings and conclusions. The review procedures described below were employed with respect to all of the SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale Mortgage Loans (rather than relying on sampling procedures), except that certain review procedures were
only relevant to the large loan disclosures in this prospectus, as further described below.
Â 
Database. To prepare for securitization,
members of SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Deal Team created a database of loan-level and property-level information,
and prepared an asset summary report, regarding each of the SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Mortgage Loans. The database
and the respective asset summary reports were compiled from, among other sources, the related mortgage loan documents, appraisals,
environmental reports, seismic reports, property condition reports, zoning reports, insurance review summaries, borrower-supplied
information (including, but not limited to, rent rolls, leases, operating statements and budgets) and information collected by
SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale during the underwriting process. After origination of each of the SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale Mortgage Loans, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Deal Team may have updated the information
in the database and the related asset summary report with respect to the SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Mortgage
Loans based on updates provided by the related servicer relating to loan payment status and escrows, updated operating statements,
rent rolls and leasing activity, and information otherwise brought to the
Â 


285
Â 
Â 
attention of SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale
Deal Team. Such updates were not intended to be, and do not serve as, a re-underwriting of any SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale
Mortgage Loan.
Â 
A data tape (the âSociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale Data Tapeâ) containing detailed information regarding each of the SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale
Mortgage Loans was created from the information in the database referred to in the prior paragraph. The SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale
Data Tape was used by the SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Deal Team to provide the numerical information regarding
the SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Mortgage Loans in this prospectus.
Â 
Data Comparisons and Recalculation.
The depositor, on behalf of SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale, engaged a third party accounting firm to perform certain
data comparison and recalculation procedures designed or provided by SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale, relating to
information in this prospectus regarding the SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Mortgage Loans. These procedures included:
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â comparing the information in the SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Data Tape against various source documents
provided by SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale;
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â comparing
numerical information regarding the SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Mortgage Loans and the related Mortgaged Properties
disclosed in this prospectus against the information contained in the SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Data Tape;
and
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â recalculating certain percentages, ratios and other formulae relating to the SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale
Mortgage Loans disclosed in this prospectus.
Â 
Legal Review. SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale engaged various law firms to conduct certain legal reviews of the SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale
Mortgage Loans for disclosure in this prospectus. In anticipation of the securitization of the SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale
Mortgage Loans, origination counsel prepared a loan summary that sets forth salient loan terms and summarizes material deviations
from SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©raleâs standard form loan documents. In addition, origination counsel for each
SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Mortgage Loan reviewed SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©raleâs representations
and warranties set forth on Annex D-1 to this prospectus and, if applicable, identified exceptions to those representations and
warranties.
Â 
Loan sellerâs counsel was also engaged
to assist in the review of the SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Mortgage Loans. Such assistance included, among other
things, (i)Â a review of sections of the Mortgage Loan documents that deviate materially from SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©raleâs
standard form documents, as identified by SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale and origination counsel, (ii)Â a review
of the asset summary reports and the loan summaries prepared by SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale relating to the SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale Mortgage Loans, and (iii)Â a review of a due diligence questionnaire completed by the origination counsel.
Â 
SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale
prepared, and both originating counsel and loan sellerâs counsel reviewed, the loan summaries for the SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale Mortgage Loans included in the 15 largest Mortgage Loans or groups of cross-collateralized Mortgage Loans
in the Mortgage Pool, and the abbreviated loan summaries for the SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Mortgage Loans included
in the next 5 largest Mortgage Loans in the Mortgage Pool, which loan summaries and abbreviated loan summaries are incorporated
in âSummaries of the Fifteen Largest Mortgage Loansâ in the attached AnnexÂ A-3 to this prospectus.
Â 
Other Review Procedures. With respect
to any pending litigation that existed at the origination of any of the SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Mortgage Loans,
SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale requested updates from the related borrower, origination counsel and/or borrowerâs
litigation counsel. In connection with the origination of each SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Mortgage Loan, SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale, together with origination counsel, conducted a search with respect to each
Â 


286
Â 
Â 
borrower under the related SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale Mortgage Loan to determine whether it filed for bankruptcy. If SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale
became aware of a significant natural disaster in the vicinity of any Mortgaged Property securing one of the SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale Mortgage Loans, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale obtained information on the status of the Mortgaged
Property from the related borrower to confirm that there was no material damage to the Mortgaged Property.
Â 
Additionally, with respect to each SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale Mortgage Loan, the SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Deal Team also consulted with the applicable
SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale mortgage loan origination team to confirm that each of the SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale
Mortgage Loans was originated in compliance with the origination and underwriting criteria described above under ââSociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©raleâs Underwriting Standardsâ, as well as to identify any material deviations from those origination
and underwriting criteria. See âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâExceptions to Underwriting Guidelinesâ
in this prospectus.
Â 
Review Procedures in the Event of a
Mortgage Loan Substitution. SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale will perform a review of any SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale Mortgage Loan that it elects to substitute for a SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Mortgage Loan
in the pool in connection with a material breach of a representation or warranty or a material document defect. SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale, and if appropriate its legal counsel, will review the mortgage loan documents and servicing history of
the substitute mortgage loan to confirm it meets each of the criteria required under the terms of the related MLPA and the PSA
(the âQualification Criteriaâ). SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale may engage a third party to compare the
Qualification Criteria against the underlying source documentation to verify the accuracy of the review by SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale and to confirm any numerical and/or statistical information to be disclosed in any required filings under
the Exchange Act. Legal counsel will also be engaged by SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale to render any tax opinion
required in connection with the substitution.
Â 
Findings and Conclusions. SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale found and concluded with reasonable assurance that the disclosure regarding the SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale
Mortgage Loans in this prospectus is accurate in all material respects. SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale also found
and concluded with reasonable assurance that the SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Mortgage Loans were originated in

Â 
The Depositor
Â 
Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Securities,Â Inc.,
a North Carolina corporation, is the depositor. The depositor is a special purpose corporation incorporated in the State of North
Carolina in 1988, for the purpose of engaging in the business, among other things, of acquiring and depositing mortgage loans in
trust in exchange for certificates evidencing interest in such trusts and selling or otherwise distributing such certificates.
The depositor is a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Wells Fargo Bank, a sponsor, an originator, a mortgage loan seller, the master
servicer, the certificate administrator, the tax administrator, the custodian and the certificate registrar and an affiliate of
Wells Fargo Securities,Â LLC, one of the underwriters. See âCertain Affiliations, Relationships and Related Transactions
Involving Transaction Partiesâ below.
Â 
The depositor will have minimal ongoing
duties with respect to the certificates and the Mortgage Loans. The depositorâs duties will include, without limitation,
(i)Â appointing a successor trustee in the event of the resignation or removal of the trustee, (ii)Â providing information
in its possession with respect to the certificates to the tax administrator to the extent necessary to perform REMIC tax administration,
(iii)Â indemnifying the trustee, the tax administrator and the issuing entity for any liability, assessment or costs arising
from the depositorâs willful misconduct, bad faith or negligence in providing such information, (iv)Â indemnifying the
trustee and the tax administrator against certain securities law liabilities, and (v)Â signing or contracting with the master
servicer, signing any Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the certification required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and any Distribution
Reports on Form 10-D and Current Reports on Form 8-K required to be filed by the issuing entity. The depositor is also required
under the underwriting agreement to indemnify the underwriters for certain securities law liabilities.
Â 
The depositor purchases commercial mortgage
loans and interests in commercial mortgage loans for the purpose of selling those assets to trusts created in connection with the
securitization of pools of assets and does not engage in any activities unrelated to those securitizations. On the Closing Date,
the depositor will acquire the Mortgage Loans from each mortgage loan seller and will simultaneously transfer them, without recourse,
to the trustee for the benefit of the Certificateholders.
Â 
The depositor remains responsible under
the PSA for providing the master servicer, special servicer, certificate administrator and trustee with certain information and
other assistance requested by those parties and reasonably necessary to performing their duties under the PSA. The depositor also
remains responsible for mailing notices to the Certificateholders upon the appointment of certain successor entities under the
PSA.
Â 
The Issuing Entity
Â 
The issuing entity, Wells Fargo Commercial
Mortgage Trust 2015-P2 (the âTrustâ), will be a New York common law trust, formed on the Closing Date pursuant
to the PSA.
Â 
The only activities that the issuing entity
may perform are those set forth in the PSA, which are generally limited to owning and administering the Mortgage Loans and any
REO Property, disposing of defaulted mortgage loans and REO Property, issuing the certificates, making distributions, providing
reports to Certificateholders and other activities described in this prospectus. Accordingly, the issuing entity may not issue
securities other than the certificates, or invest in securities, other than investing of funds in the Collection Account and other
accounts maintained under the PSA in certain short-term permitted investments. The issuing entity may not lend or borrow money,
except that the master servicer, the special servicer and the trustee may make Advances of delinquent monthly debt service
Â 


288
Â 
Â 
payments
and Servicing Advances to the issuing entity, but only to the extent it does not deem such Advances to be non-recoverable from
the related mortgage loan; such Advances are intended to provide liquidity, rather than credit support. The PSA may be amended
as set forth under âPooling and Servicing AgreementâAmendmentâ. The issuing entity administers the Mortgage
Loans through the trustee, the certificate administrator, the master servicer and the special servicer. A discussion of the duties
of the trustee, the certificate administrator, the master servicer and the special servicer, including any discretionary activities
performed by each of them, is set forth in this prospectus under âTransaction PartiesâThe Trusteeâ, ââThe
Certificate Administratorâ, ââThe Master Servicerâ and ââThe Special Servicerâ
and âPooling and Servicing Agreementâ.
Â 
The only assets of the issuing entity
other than the Mortgage Loans and any REO Properties are the Collection Account and other accounts maintained pursuant to the PSA,
the short-term investments in which funds in the Collection Account and other accounts are invested. The issuing entity has no
present liabilities, but has potential liability relating to ownership of the Mortgage Loans and any REO Properties and certain
other activities described in this prospectus, and indemnity obligations to the trustee, the certificate administrator, the depositor,
the master servicer, the special servicer and the operating advisor. The fiscal year of the issuing entity is the calendar year.
The issuing entity has no executive officers or board of directors and acts through the trustee, the certificate administrator,
the master servicer and the special servicer.
Â 
The depositor will be contributing the
Mortgage Loans to the issuing entity. The depositor will be purchasing the Mortgage Loans from the mortgage loan sellers, as described
under âDescription of the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreementsâ.
Â 
The Trustee
Â 
Wilmington Trust, National Association
(âWTNAâ) (formerly called MÂ &Â T Bank, National Association) will act as trustee on behalf of the
Certificateholders pursuant to the PSA. WTNA is a national banking association with trust powers incorporated in 1995. The trusteeâs

The transaction parties may maintain banking
and other commercial relationships with WTNA and its affiliates. In its capacity as trustee on commercial mortgage securitizations,
WTNA and its affiliates are generally required to make an advance if the related servicer or special servicer fails to make a required
advance. In the past three years, WTNA and its affiliates have not been required to make an advance on a commercial mortgage-backed
securities transaction.
Â 
WTNA is subject to various legal proceedings
that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. WTNA does not believe that the ultimate resolution of any of these
proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its services as trustee.
Â 


289
Â 
Â 
The information set forth under this sub-heading
has been provided by WTNA. None of the depositor, the underwriters or any other person, other than WTNA, makes any representation
or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of such information.
Â

set forth in the PSA. A discussion of the role of the trustee and its continuing duties, including: 1)Â any
actions required by the trustee, including whether notices are required to investors, rating agencies or other third parties, upon
an event of default, potential event of default (and how defined) or other breach of a transaction covenant and any required percentage
of a class or classes of asset-backed securities that is needed to require the trustee to take action, 2)Â limitations on the
trusteeâs liability under the transaction agreements regarding the asset-backed securities transaction, 3)Â any indemnification
provisions that entitle the trustee to be indemnified from the cash flow that otherwise would be used to pay the asset-backed securities,
and 4)Â any contractual provisions or understandings regarding the trusteeâs removal, replacement or resignation, as
well as how the expenses associated with changing from one trustee to another trustee will be paid, is set forth in this
prospectus under âPooling and Servicing Agreementâ. In its capacity as trustee on commercial mortgage
loan securitizations, WTNA and its affiliates are generally required to make an advance if the related servicer or special servicer
fails to make a required advance. See âPooling and Servicing AgreementâAdvancesâ.

relationships and related transactions between the trustee and the other transaction parties, see âCertain Affiliations,
Relationships and Related Transactions Involving Transaction Partiesâ.

Â 
Under the terms of the PSA, Wells Fargo
Bank is responsible for securities administration, which includes pool performance calculations, distribution calculations and
related distributions to Certificateholders and the preparation of monthly distribution reports. As certificate administrator,
Wells Fargo Bank is responsible for the preparation and filing of all REMIC and grantor trust tax returns on behalf of the trust
REMICs and the preparation of monthly reports on Form 10-D, certain current reports on Form 8-K and annual reports on Form 10-K
that are required to be filed with the SEC on behalf of the issuing entity. Wells Fargo Bank has been engaged in the business of

of DecemberÂ 31, 2014, Wells Fargo Bank was acting as securities administrator with respect to more than $171 billion of outstanding
commercial mortgage-backed securities.
Â 
Wells Fargo Bank is acting as custodian
(the âCustodianâ) of the mortgage files pursuant to and subject to the PSA. In that capacity, Wells Fargo Bank
is responsible to hold and safeguard the mortgage notes and other contents of the mortgage files on behalf of the trustee for the
benefit of the Certificateholders. Wells Fargo Bank maintains each mortgage file in a separate file folder marked with a unique
bar code to assure loan-level file integrity and to assist in inventory management. Files are segregated by transaction or investor.
Wells Fargo Bank has been engaged in the mortgage document custody business for more than 25 years. Wells Fargo Bank maintains
its commercial document custody facilities in Minneapolis, Minnesota. As of DecemberÂ 31, 2014, Wells Fargo Bank was acting
as custodian of more than 116,000 commercial mortgage files.
Â 
Wells Fargo Bank serves or may have served
within the past two years as loan file custodian for various mortgage loans owned by a sponsor or an affiliate of a sponsor, and
one or more of those mortgage loans may be included in the Trust. The terms of any custodial agreement under which those services
are provided by Wells Fargo Bank are customary for the mortgage-backed securitization industry and provide for the delivery, receipt,
review and safekeeping of mortgage loan files.
Â 
On JuneÂ 18, 2014, a group of institutional
investors filed a civil complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of NewÂ York, NewÂ York County, against Wells Fargo
Bank, in its capacity as trustee under 276 residential mortgage backed securities (âRMBSâ) trusts, which was
later amended on JulyÂ 18, 2014, to increase the number of trusts to 284 RMBS trusts. On NovemberÂ 24, 2014, the plaintiffs
filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the state court action without prejudice. That same day, a group of institutional investors
filed a civil complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of NewÂ York against Wells Fargo Bank,Â N.A.,
alleging claims against the bank in its capacity as trustee for 274 RMBS trusts (the âComplaintâ). In DecemberÂ 2014,
the plaintiffsâ motion to voluntarily dismiss their original state court action was granted. As with the prior state court
action, the Complaint is one of six similar complaints filed contemporaneously against RMBS trustees (Deutsche Bank National Trust
Company, Citibank N.A., HSBC Bank USA, The Bank of New York Mellon and U.S. Bank National Association) by a group of institutional
investor plaintiffs. The Complaint against Wells Fargo Bank alleges that the trustee caused losses to investors and asserts causes
of action based upon, among other things, the trusteeâs alleged failure to (i)Â enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage
loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, (ii)Â notify investors of alleged events of default
purportedly caused by breaches by mortgage loan servicers, and (iii)Â abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged
events of default. Relief sought includes money damages in an unspecified amount, reimbursement of expenses, and equitable relief.
Other cases alleging similar causes of action have been filed against Wells Fargo Bank and other trustees by RMBS investors in
these and other transactions.
Â 


291
Â 
Â 
There can be no assurances as to the outcome
of the litigation, or the possible impact of the litigation on Wells Fargo Bank or the RMBS trusts. However, Wells Fargo Bank denies
liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the
cause of losses to investors and that it has meritorious defenses, and it intends to contest the plaintiffsâ claims vigorously.
Â

this heading ââThe Certificate Administratorâ has been provided by Wells Fargo Bank.

PGI utilizes the Enterprise! loan servicing
system, which is widely used in the loan servicing industry. PGI has a robust website available for borrowers to view the current
status of their loans. PGI also utilizes a website to provide information to master servicers, including property inspections,
property financials and other reporting.
Â 
The PGI servicing team is comprised of
the following areas:
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â Operations is responsible for new loan boarding, loan audits, insurance and real estate tax monitoring and escrows and UCC
administration.
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â Servicing Asset Management is responsible for processing borrower consents, including lease related items; escrow and reserve
administration and monitoring triggers.
Â

servicer and special servicer communication.
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â Surveillance

surveillance.
Â 
Â·Â Â Â Â Â Cash
Management and Investor Reporting controls cash management, including payment processing, remittances and investor reporting.
Â 
PGI may use sub-servicers or vendors to
perform certain servicing processes. None of the sub-servicers or vendors perform any cashiering or material processes. PGI monitors
any sub-vendors for compliance and quality control.
Â 
Generally, all loan payments received
by PGI are initially deposited into commingled receipts accounts. Funds are then transferred to segregated investor-specific accounts
pursuant to the servicing agreements.
Â 


297
Â 
Â 
PGI has developed policies, procedures
and controls for the performance of primary servicing obligations consistent with applicable servicing agreements and servicing
standards.
Â 
PGI has quality control policies and procedures
to ensure compliance with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 of Regulation AB. PGIâs policies and procedures are
updated as processes change to ensure continuing compliance with regulatory and servicing industry changes. There have been no
material non-compliance or default issues against PGI in the servicing of its CMBS or other loans.
Â 
No securitization transaction involving
commercial mortgage loans in which PGI was acting as primary servicer has experienced an event of default as a result of any action
or inaction of PGI as primary servicer, including as a result of PGIâs failure to comply with the applicable servicing criteria
in connection with any securitization transaction.
Â 
From time to time, PGI and its affiliates
are parties to lawsuits and other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. PGI does not believe that any currently
pending lawsuits or legal proceedings would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its business or
its ability to act as primary servicer with respect to the PCC Mortgage Loans.
Â 
PGI has an interim servicing agreement
with Macquarie Investments US Inc. d/b/a Principal Commercial Capital (and certain of its affiliates) to primary service PCC Mortgage
Loans prior to securitization. PGI also has an interim servicing agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association or one of
its affiliates to primary service the Mortgage Loan secured by the Mortgaged Property identified in AnnexÂ A-1 as University
Center South prior to securitization.
Â 
PGI has acquired the right to be appointed
as the primary servicer of 10 Mortgage Loans, representing approximately 25.8% of the Initial Pool Balance (which includes all
of the PCC Mortgage Loans and the Mortgage Loan secured by the Mortgaged Property identified in AnnexÂ A-1 as University Center
South). Accordingly, Wells Fargo Bank, as master servicer, and PGI, as primary servicer, will enter into a Primary Servicing Agreement
to be dated as of a date in December 1, 2015 (the âPGI Primary Servicing Agreementâ). The primary servicing
of the related PCC Mortgage Loans will be governed by the PGI Primary Servicing Agreement.
Â 
Neither PGI nor any of its affiliates
will retain on the Closing Date any certificates issued by the issuing entity or any other economic interest in this securitization.

to terminate PGI as primary servicer under the PGI Primary Servicing Agreement if certain termination events under the PGI Primary
Servicing Agreement are not remedied. In addition, the depositor will have the right to terminate PGI as primary servicer under

lawsuits and other legal proceedings as part of its duties as a loan servicer (e.g., enforcement of loan obligations) and/or

The Operating Advisor
and Asset Representations Reviewer
Â 
Pentalpha Surveillance LLC (âPentalpha
Surveillanceâ), a Delaware limited liability company, will act as the operating advisor under the PSA. The operating
advisor will have certain review and consultation duties with respect to activities of the special servicer. Pentalpha Surveillance
will also be serving as the asset representations reviewer under the PSA. The asset representations reviewer generally will be
required to review certain delinquent mortgage loans after a specified delinquency threshold has been exceeded and notification
from the certificate administrator that the required percentage of certificateholders have voted to direct a review of such delinquent
mortgage loans.
Â 
The principal offices of Pentalpha Surveillance
are located at 375 N. French Road, SuiteÂ 100, Amherst, New York, 14228 and its telephone number is (716)Â 418-1307. Pentalpha

Pentalpha Surveillance is a leading provider
of independent oversight services on behalf of loan securitization trusts. Pentalpha Surveillance utilizes custom software systems
and a team of industry operations veterans to investigate and resolve securitization matters including, but not limited to, collections
optimization, representation and warranty settlements, derivative contract errors and transaction party disputes. These services
have been applied primarily on transactions involving commercial and residential real estate debt; however, Pentalpha Surveillance
has also performed certain of these services in other structured asset classes. Some of the companyâs oversight assignments
utilize âafter the actionâ compliance reviews while others are more proactive and include delegated authority that
requires Pentalpha Surveillance to provide âloan-level preapprovalsâ before a vendor takes an action. More than $500
billion of residential, commercial and other income-producing loans have been boarded to the software in connection with the services
provided by the Pentalpha group of companies.
Â 
Pentalpha Surveillance and its affiliates
have been engaged by individual securitization trusts, financial institutions, institutional investors as well as agencies of the
U.S. Government. As of SeptemberÂ 30, 2015, Pentalpha Surveillance has acted as operating advisor or trust advisor in approximately
74 commercial mortgage-backed securitizations with an aggregate initial unpaid principal balance of approximately $83Â billion
since October 2010.
Â 
Pentalpha Surveillance also has been engaged
as an independent representation and warranty reviewer on numerous residential mortgage-backed securitizations across multiple
issuer platforms. In that role, Pentalpha Surveillance has been integrally involved in the design and development of specific operational
protocols and testing methodologies in connection with the breach review process related to representations and warranties. In
addition, Pentalpha Surveillance has been a leader in the concept, design and implementation of the asset representations reviewer
role in commercial mortgage-backed securitizations both during its consideration and after its adoption by the Securities and Exchange
Commission in September 2014.
Â 
Pentalpha Surveillance is not an affiliate
of the issuing entity, the depositor, the sponsors, the mortgage loan sellers, the trustee, the certificate administrator, the
master servicer, the special servicer, the directing certificateholder, any âoriginatorsâ (within the meaning of Item
1110 of Regulation AB) or any âsignificant obligorâ (within the meaning of Item 1112 of Regulation AB) with respect
to the Trust.

Â 
Â 
From time to time, Pentalpha Surveillance
may be a party to lawsuits and other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. However, there are currently
no legal proceedings pending, and no legal proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities, against Pentalpha
Surveillance or of which any of its property is the subject, that would have a material adverse effect on Pentalpha Surveillanceâs
business or its ability to serve as operating advisor or asset representations reviewer pursuant to the PSA or that is material
to the holders of the certificates.

in such Whole Loan; (3)Â those funds or assets as from time to time are deposited in the accounts discussed in âPooling
and Servicing AgreementâAccountsâ (such accounts collectively, the âSecuritization Accountsâ)
(but, with respect to any Whole Loan, only to the extent of the issuing entityâs interest in such Whole Loan), if established;
(4)Â the rights of the mortgagee under all insurance policies with respect to its Mortgage Loans; and (5)Â certain rights
of the depositor under each MLPA relating to Mortgage Loan document delivery requirements and the representations and warranties
of each mortgage loan seller regarding the Mortgage Loans it sold to the depositor.

The âCertificate Balanceâ
of any class of Principal Balance Certificates outstanding at any time represents the maximum amount that its holders are entitled
to receive as distributions allocable to principal from the cash flow on the Mortgage Loans and the other assets in the issuing
entity, all as described in this prospectus. On each Distribution Date, the Certificate Balance of each class of Principal Balance
Certificates will be reduced by any distributions of principal actually made on, and by any Realized Losses actually allocated
to, that class of Principal Balance Certificates on that Distribution Date. In the event that
Â 


304
Â 
Â 
Realized Losses previously allocated
to a class of Principal Balance Certificates in reduction of its Certificate Balance are recovered subsequent to such Certificate
Balance being reduced to zero, holders of such class of Principal Balance Certificates may receive distributions in respect of
such recoveries in accordance with the distribution priorities described under ââDistributionsâPriority of
Distributionsâ below.
Â 
The Residual Certificates will not have
a Certificate Balance or entitle their holders to distributions of principal or interest.
Â 
The ClassÂ X Certificates will not
have Certificate Balances, nor will they entitle their holders to distributions of principal, but the ClassÂ X Certificates
will represent the right to receive distributions of interest in an amount equal to the aggregate interest accrued on their respective
notional amounts (each, a âNotional Amountâ). The Notional Amount of the ClassÂ X-A certificates will equal
the aggregate of the Certificate Balances of the ClassÂ A Certificates outstanding from time to time. The initial Notional
Amount of the ClassÂ X-A certificates will be approximately $749,145,000. The Notional Amount of the ClassÂ X-B certificates
will equal the Certificate Balance of the ClassÂ B certificates outstanding from time to time. The initial Notional Amount
of the ClassÂ X-B certificates will be approximately $61,385,000. The Notional Amount of the ClassÂ X-D certificates will
equal the Certificate Balance of the ClassÂ D certificates outstanding from time to time. The initial Notional Amount of the
ClassÂ X-D certificates will be approximately $56,373,000.
Â 
The ClassÂ V certificates will not
have a Certificate Balance nor will they entitle their holders to distributions of principal, but the ClassÂ V certificates
will represent the right to receive Excess Interest received on any ARD Loan.
Â 
âExcess Interestâ with
respect to the ARD Loan is the interest accrued at the Revised Rate in respect of such ARD Loan in excess of the interest accrued
at the Initial Rate, plus any related interest accrued on such amounts, to the extent permitted by applicable law and the
related Mortgage Loan documents.
Â 
The Mortgage Loans (exclusive of Excess
Interest) will be held by the lower-tier REMIC (the âLower-Tier REMICâ). The certificates (other than the ClassÂ V
certificates) will be issued by the upper-tier REMIC (the âUpper-Tier REMICâ) (collectively with the Lower-Tier
REMIC, the âTrust REMICsâ). The ClassÂ V certificates will be issued by the grantor trust (the âGrantor
Trustâ).
Â 
Distributions
Â 
Method, Timing and Amount
Â 
Distributions on the certificates are
required to be made by the certificate administrator, to the extent of available funds as described in this prospectus, on the
4th business day following each Determination Date (each, a âDistribution Dateâ). The âDetermination
Dateâ will be the 11th day of each calendar month (or, if the 11th calendar day of that month is
not a business day, then the next business day) commencing in January 2016.
Â 
All distributions (other than the final
distribution on any certificate) are required to be made to the Certificateholders in whose names the certificates are registered
at the close of business on each Record Date. With respect to any Distribution Date, the âRecord Dateâ will
be the last business day of the month preceding the month in which that Distribution Date occurs. These distributions are required
to be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account specified by the Certificateholder at a bank or other
entity having appropriate facilities to accept such funds, if the Certificateholder has provided the
Â 


305
Â 
Â 
certificate administrator
with written wiring instructions no less than 5 business days prior to the related Record Date (which wiring instructions may be
in the form of a standing order applicable to all subsequent distributions) or otherwise by check mailed to the Certificateholder.
The final distribution on any certificate is required to be made in like manner, but only upon presentation and surrender of the
certificate at the location that will be specified in a notice of the pendency of the final distribution. All distributions made
with respect to a class of certificates will be allocated pro rata among the outstanding certificates of that class based
on their respective Percentage Interests.
Â 
The âPercentage Interestâ
evidenced by any certificate (other than a ClassÂ R or ClassÂ V certificate) will equal its initial denomination as of
the closing date divided by the initial Certificate Balance or Notional Amount, as applicable, of the related class.
Â 
The master servicer is authorized but
not required to direct the investment of funds held in the Collection Account and the Companion Distribution Account in U.S. government
securities and other obligations that satisfy criteria established by the Rating Agencies (âPermitted Investmentsâ).
The master servicer will be entitled to retain any interest or other income earned on such funds and the master servicer will be
required to bear any losses resulting from the investment of such funds, as provided in the PSA. The certificate administrator
is authorized but not required to direct the investment of funds held in the Lower-Tier REMIC Distribution Account, the Upper-Tier
REMIC Distribution Account, the Interest Reserve Account, the Excess Interest Distribution Account and the Gain-on-Sale Reserve
Account in Permitted Investments. The certificate administrator will be entitled to retain any interest or other income earned
on such funds and the certificate administrator will be required to bear any losses resulting from the investment of such funds,
as provided in the PSA.
Â 
Available Funds
Â 
The aggregate amount available for distribution
to holders of the certificates on each Distribution Date (the âAvailable Fundsâ) will, in general, equal the
sum of the following amounts (without duplication):
Â 
(a)Â 
the aggregate amount of all cash received on the Mortgage Loans (in the case of each Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, only to
the extent received by the issuing entity pursuant to the related Non-Serviced PSA) and any REO Property that is on deposit in
the Collection Account (in each case, exclusive of any amount on deposit in or credited to any portion of the Collection Account
that is held for the benefit of the holder of any related Companion Loan), as of the Master Servicer Remittance Date, exclusive
of (without duplication):
Â 

Â·all scheduled payments of principal and/or interest and any balloon payments paid by the borrowers of a Mortgage Loan (such
amounts other than any Excess Interest, the âPeriodic Paymentsâ), that are due on a Due Date after the end of
the related Collection Period, excluding interest relating to periods prior to, but due after, the Cut-off Date;
Â 

Â·all unscheduled payments of principal (including prepayments), unscheduled interest, liquidation proceeds, insurance proceeds
and condemnation proceeds and other unscheduled recoveries received subsequent to the related Determination Date (or, with respect
to voluntary prepayments of principal of each Mortgage Loan with a Due Date occurring after the related Determination Date, subsequent
to the related Due Date) allocable to the Mortgage Loans;
Â 


306
Â 
Â 

Â·all amounts in the Collection Account that are due or reimbursable to any person other than the Certificateholders;
Â 

Â·with respect to each Actual/360 Loan and any Distribution Date occurring in each February and in any January occurring in a
year that is not a leap year (unless such Distribution Date is the final Distribution Date), the related Withheld Amount to the
extent those funds are on deposit in the Collection Account;
Â 

Â·all Excess Interest allocable to the Mortgage Loans (which is separately distributed to the ClassÂ V certificates);
Â 

Â·all Yield Maintenance Charges and Prepayment Premiums;
Â 

Â·all amounts deposited in the Collection Account in error; and
Â 

Â·any late payment charges or accrued interest on a Mortgage Loan allocable to the default interest rate for such Mortgage Loan,
to the extent permitted by law, excluding any interest calculated at the Mortgage Rate for the related Mortgage Loan;
Â 
(b)Â 
if and to the extent not already included in clauseÂ (a), the aggregate amount transferred from the REO Account allocable
to the Mortgage Loans to the Collection Account for such Distribution Date;
Â 
(c)Â 
all Compensating Interest Payments made by the master servicer with respect to the Mortgage Loans with respect to such Distribution
Date and P&I Advances made by the master servicer or the trustee, as applicable, with respect to the Distribution Date (net
of certain amounts that are due or reimbursable to persons other than the Certificateholders); and
Â 
(d)Â 
with respect to each Actual/360 Loan and any Distribution Date occurring in each March (or February, if such Distribution
Date is the final Distribution Date), the related Withheld Amounts as required to be deposited in the Lower-Tier REMIC Distribution
Account pursuant to the PSA.
Â 
The âCollection Periodâ
for each Distribution Date and any Mortgage Loan (including any Companion Loan) will be the period commencing on the day immediately
following the Due Date for such Mortgage Loan (including any Companion Loan) in the month preceding the month in which that Distribution
Date occurs or the date that would have been the Due Date if such Mortgage Loan (including any Companion Loan) had a Due Date in
such preceding month and ending on and including the Due Date for such Mortgage Loan (including any related Companion Loan) occurring
in the month in which that Distribution Date occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the last day of a Collection
Period is not a business day, any Periodic Payments received with respect to Mortgage Loans (including any periodic payments for
any Companion Loan) relating to such Collection Period on the business day immediately following such day will be deemed to have
been received during such Collection Period and not during any other Collection Period.
Â 
âDue Dateâ means, with
respect to each Mortgage Loan (including any Companion Loan), the date on which scheduled payments of principal, interest or both
are required to be made by the related borrower.
Â 


307
Â

Â 
Â 
The âCross-Over Dateâ
means the Distribution Date on which the Certificate Balances of the Subordinate Certificates have all previously been reduced
to zero as a result of the allocation of Realized Losses to those certificates.
Â 
Reimbursement of previously allocated
Realized Losses will not constitute distributions of principal for any purpose and will not result in an additional reduction in
the Certificate Balance of the class of certificates in respect of which a reimbursement is made.
Â 
Pass-Through Rates
Â 
The interest rate (the âPass-Through
Rateâ) applicable to each class of certificates (other than the ClassÂ R and ClassÂ V certificates) for any Distribution
Date will equal the rates set forth below:
Â 
The Pass-Through Rate on the ClassÂ A-1
certificates will be a per annum rate equal to 1.9690%.
The Pass-Through Rate on the ClassÂ A-2A
certificates will be a per annum rate equal to 3.1170%.
The Pass-Through Rate on the ClassÂ A-2B
certificates will equal the WAC Rate that corresponds to the related interest accrual period.
The Pass-Through Rate on the ClassÂ A-3
certificates will be a per annum rate equal to 3.5410%.
The Pass-Through Rate on the ClassÂ A-4
certificates will be a per annum rate equal to 3.8090%.
The Pass-Through Rate on the ClassÂ A-SB
certificates will be a per annum rate equal to 3.6560%.
The Pass-Through Rate on the ClassÂ A-S
certificates will be a per annum rate equal to 4.0130%.

The Pass-Through Rate on the ClassÂ C
certificates will equal the WAC Rate that corresponds to the related interest accrual period.
The Pass-Through Rate on the ClassÂ D
certificates will be a per annum rate equal to 3.2410%.
The Pass-Through Rate on the ClassÂ E
certificates will equal the WAC Rate that corresponds to the related interest accrual period.
The Pass-Through Rate on the ClassÂ F
certificates will equal the WAC Rate that corresponds to the related interest accrual period.
The Pass-Through Rate on the ClassÂ G
certificates will equal the WAC Rate that corresponds to the related interest accrual period.
Â Â 
The Pass-Through Rate for the
ClassÂ X-A certificates for any Distribution Date will be a per
annum rate equal the excess, if any of (a)Â the WAC Rate for the related Distribution Date, over (b)Â the weighted
average of the Pass-Through Rates on the ClassÂ A-1,
Â 


311
Â 
Â 

Class
A-2A, Class A-2B, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-SB and Class A-S certificates for such Distribution Date, weighted on the basis
of their respective Certificate Balances immediately prior to that Distribution Date.Â 
Â 
The
Pass-Through Rate for the Class X-B certificates for any Distribution Date will be a per annum rate equal to the excess,
if any, of (a) the WAC Rate for the related Distribution Date, over (b) the Pass-Through Rate on the Class B certificates for
the related Distribution Date.
Â 
The
Pass-Through Rate for the Class X-D certificates for any Distribution Date will be a per annum rate equal to the excess,
if any, of (a) the WAC Rate for the related Distribution Date, over (b) the Pass-Through Rate on the Class D certificates for
the related Distribution Date.Â 
Â 
The
Class V certificates will not have a Pass-Through Rate or be entitled to distributions in respect of interest other than Excess
Interest, if any, with respect to the ARD Loan.Â 
Â 
The âWAC Rateâ with respect to any Distribution Date is equal to the
weighted average of the applicable Net Mortgage Rates of the Mortgage Loans (including any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) as of the
first day of the related Collection Period, weighted on the basis of their respective Stated Principal Balances as of the first
day of such Collection Period (after giving effect to any payments received during any applicable grace period).

Â Â 
The âNet Mortgage Rateâ
for each Mortgage Loan (including any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) and any REO Loan (other than the portion of the REO Loan related
to any Companion Loan) is equal to the related Mortgage Rate then in effect (without regard to any increase in the interest rate
of any ARD Loan after the related Anticipated Repayment Date), less the related Administrative Cost Rate; provided,
however, that for purposes of calculating Pass-Through
Rates and Withheld Amounts, the Net Mortgage Rate for any Mortgage Loan will be determined without regard to any modification,
waiver or amendment of the terms of the related Mortgage Loan, whether agreed to by the master servicer, the special servicer or
resulting from a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding involving the related borrower. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for
Mortgage Loans that do not accrue interest on a 30/360 Basis, then, solely for purposes of calculating the Pass-Through Rate on
the Regular Certificates, the Net Mortgage Rate of any Mortgage Loan for any one-month period preceding a related Due Date will
be the annualized rate at which interest would have to accrue in respect of the Mortgage Loan on the basis of a 360-day year consisting
of twelve 30-day months in order to produce the aggregate amount of interest actually required to be paid in respect of the Mortgage
Loan during the one-month period at the related Net Mortgage Rate; provided,
however, that with respect to each Actual/360 Loan, the
Net Mortgage Rate for the one-month period (1)Â prior to the Due Dates in January and February in any year which is not a leap
year or in February in any year which is a leap year (in either case, unless the related Distribution Date is the final Distribution
Date) will be determined exclusive of Withheld Amounts, and (2)Â prior to the Due Date in March (or February, if the related
Distribution Date is the final Distribution Date), will be determined inclusive of Withheld Amounts for the immediately preceding
February and January, as applicable. With respect to any REO Loan, the Net Mortgage Rate will be calculated as described above,
as if the predecessor Mortgage Loan had remained outstanding.
Â 
âAdministrative Cost Rateâ
as of any date of determination will be a per annum rate
equal to the sum of the Servicing Fee Rate, the Certificate Administrator/Trustee Fee Rate, the Operating Advisor Fee Rate, the
Asset Representations Reviewer Fee Rate and the CREFCÂ® Intellectual Property Royalty License Fee Rate.

Â 


312
Â 
Â 
âMortgage Rateâ with
respect to any Mortgage Loan (including any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or any related Companion Loan is the per
annum rate at which interest accrues on the Mortgage Loan or the related Companion Loan as stated in the related Mortgage
Note or the promissory note evidencing such Companion Loan without giving effect to any default rate or Revised Rate.
Â 
Interest Distribution
Amount
Â 
The âInterest Distribution Amountâ
with respect to any Distribution Date and each class of Regular Certificates will equal (A)Â the sum of (i)Â the Interest
Accrual Amount with respect to such class for such Distribution Date and (ii)Â the Interest Shortfall, if any, with respect
to such class for such Distribution Date, less (B)Â any Excess Prepayment Interest Shortfall allocated to such class on such
Distribution Date.
Â 
The âInterest Accrual Amountâ
with respect to any Distribution Date and any class of Regular Certificates is equal to interest for the related Interest Accrual
Period accrued at the Pass-Through Rate for such class on the Certificate Balance or Notional Amount, as applicable, for such class
immediately prior to that Distribution Date. Calculations of interest for each Interest Accrual Period will be made on 30/360 Basis.
Â 
An âInterest Shortfallâ
with respect to any Distribution Date for any class of Regular Certificates is the sum of (a)Â the portion of the Interest
Distribution Amount for such class remaining unpaid as of the close of business on the preceding Distribution Date, and (b)Â to
the extent permitted by applicable law, (i)Â other than in the case of certificates with a Notional Amount, one monthâs
interest on that amount remaining unpaid at the Pass-Through Rate applicable to such class for the current Distribution Date and
(ii)Â in the case of the certificates with a Notional Amount, one-monthâs interest on that amount remaining unpaid at
the WAC Rate for such Distribution Date.
Â 
The âInterest Accrual Periodâ
for each Distribution Date will be the calendar month prior to the month in which that Distribution Date occurs.
Â 
Principal Distribution
Amount
Â 
The âPrincipal Distribution Amountâ
for any Distribution Date will be equal to the sum of the following amounts:
Â 
(a)Â 
the Principal Shortfall for that Distribution Date,
Â 
(b)Â 
the Scheduled Principal Distribution Amount for that Distribution Date, and
Â 
(c)Â 
the Unscheduled Principal Distribution Amount for that Distribution Date;
Â 
provided that the Principal Distribution Amount for
any Distribution Date will be reduced, to not less than zero, by the amount of any reimbursements of:
Â 
(A)
Nonrecoverable Advances (including any servicing advance with respect to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan under the related
Non-Serviced PSA reimbursed out of general collections on the Mortgage Loans), with interest on such Nonrecoverable Advances at
the Reimbursement Rate, that are paid or reimbursed from principal collections on the Mortgage Loans in a period during which such
principal collections would have otherwise been included in the Principal Distribution Amount for such Distribution Date, and
Â 


313
Â 
Â Â 
(B)
Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts paid or reimbursed from principal collections on the Mortgage Loans in a period during
which such principal collections would have otherwise been included in the Principal Distribution Amount for such Distribution
Date,
Â 
provided, further,
that in the case of clausesÂ (A) and (B) above, if any of the amounts that were reimbursed from principal collections on
the Mortgage Loans (including REO Loans) are subsequently recovered on the related Mortgage Loan (or REO Loan), such recovery
will increase the Principal Distribution Amount for the Distribution Date related to the period in which such recovery
occurs.
Â 
The âScheduled Principal Distribution
Amountâ for each Distribution Date will equal the aggregate of the principal portions of (a)Â all Periodic Payments
(excluding balloon payments) with respect to the Mortgage Loans due during or, if and to the extent not previously received or
advanced and distributed to Certificateholders on a preceding Distribution Date, prior to the related Collection Period and all
Assumed Scheduled Payments with respect to the Mortgage Loans for the related Collection Period, in each case to the extent paid
by the related borrower as of the related Determination Date (or, with respect to each Mortgage Loan with a Due Date occurring,
or a grace period ending, after the related Determination Date, the related Due Date or, last day of such grace period, as applicable,
to the extent received by the master servicer as of the business day preceding the Master Servicer Remittance Date) or advanced
by the master servicer or the trustee, as applicable, and (b)Â all balloon payments with respect to the Mortgage Loans to the
extent received on or prior to the related Determination Date (or, with respect to each Mortgage Loan with a Due Date occurring,
or a grace period ending, after the related Determination Date, the related Due Date or, last day of such grace period, as applicable,
to the extent received by the master servicer as of the business day preceding the Master Servicer Remittance Date), and to the
extent not included in clauseÂ (a) above. The Scheduled Principal Distribution Amount from time to time will include all late
payments of principal made by a borrower with respect to the Mortgage Loans, including late payments in respect of a delinquent
balloon payment, received by the times described above in this definition, except to the extent those late payments are otherwise
available to reimburse the master servicer or the trustee, as the case may be, for prior Advances, as described above.
Â 
The âUnscheduled Principal Distribution
Amountâ for each Distribution Date will equal the aggregate of the following: (a)Â all prepayments of principal received
on the Mortgage Loans as of the Determination Date; and (b)Â any other collections (exclusive of payments by borrowers) received
on the Mortgage Loans and any REO Properties on or prior to the related Determination Date whether in the form of Liquidation Proceeds,
Insurance and Condemnation Proceeds, net income, rents, and profits from REO Property or otherwise, that were identified and applied
by the master servicer as recoveries of previously unadvanced principal of the related Mortgage Loan; provided that all
such Liquidation Proceeds and Insurance and Condemnation Proceeds will be reduced by any unpaid Special Servicing Fees, Liquidation
Fees, any amount related to the Loss of Value Payments to the extent that such amount was transferred into the Collection Account
during the related Collection Period, accrued interest on Advances and other additional trust fund expenses incurred in connection
with the related Mortgage Loan, thus reducing the Unscheduled Principal Distribution Amount.
Â 
The âAssumed Scheduled Paymentâ
for any Collection Period and with respect to any Mortgage Loan (including any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) that is delinquent in
respect of its balloon payment or any REO Loan (excluding, for purposes of any P&I Advances, the portion allocable to any related
Companion Loan), is an amount equal to the sum of (a)Â the principal portion of the Periodic Payment that would have been due
on such Mortgage Loan
Â 


314
Â 
Â Â 
or REO Loan on the related Due Date
based on the constant payment required by such related Mortgage Note or the original amortization schedule of the Mortgage
Loan, as the case may be (as calculated with interest at the related Mortgage Rate), if applicable, assuming the related
balloon payment has not become due, after giving effect to any reduction in the principal balance occurring in connection
with a modification of such Mortgage Loan in connection with a default or a bankruptcy (or similar proceeding), and
(b)Â interest on the Stated Principal Balance of that Mortgage Loan or REO Loan (excluding, for purposes of any P&I
Advances, the portion allocable to any related Companion Loan) at its Mortgage Rate (net of interest at the applicable rate
at which the Servicing Fee is calculated).
Â 
The âPrincipal Shortfallâ
for any Distribution Date means the amount, if any, by which (1)Â the Principal Distribution Amount for the prior Distribution
Date exceeds (2)Â the aggregate amount actually distributed on the preceding Distribution Date in respect of such Principal
Distribution Amount.
Â 
The âClassÂ A-SB Planned
Principal Balanceâ for any Distribution Date is the balance shown for such Distribution Date in the table set forth in
AnnexÂ E to this prospectus. Such balances were calculated using, among other things, certain weighted average life assumptions.
See âYield and Maturity ConsiderationsâWeighted Average Lifeâ. Based on such assumptions, the Certificate
Balance of the ClassÂ A-SB certificates on each Distribution Date would be expected to be reduced to the balance indicated
for such Distribution Date in the table set forth in AnnexÂ E to this prospectus. We cannot assure you, however, that the mortgage
loans will perform in conformity with our assumptions. Therefore, we cannot assure you that the balance of the ClassÂ A-SB
certificates on any Distribution Date will be equal to the balance that is specified for such Distribution Date in the table.
Â 
Certain Calculations with
Respect to Individual Mortgage Loans
Â 
The âStated Principal Balanceâ
of each Mortgage Loan will be an amount equal to its unpaid principal balance as of the Cut-off Date or, in the case of a replacement
Mortgage Loan, as of the date it is added to the trust, after application of all payments of principal due during or prior to the
month of substitution, whether or not those payments have been received, minus the sum of:
Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
(i)Â Â Â  the principal portion of each Periodic
Payment due on such Mortgage Loan after the Cut-off Date (or in the case of a replacement Mortgage Loan, due after the Due Date
in the related month of substitution), to the extent received from the borrower or advanced by the master servicer;
Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
(ii)Â Â Â  all principal prepayments received
with respect to such Mortgage Loan after the Cut-off Date (or in the case of a replacement Mortgage Loan, after the Due Date in
the related month of substitution);
Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
(iii)Â Â Â  the principal portion of all Insurance
and Condemnation Proceeds (to the extent allocable to principal on such Mortgage Loan) and Liquidation Proceeds received with respect
to such Mortgage Loan after the Cut-off Date (or in the case of a replacement Mortgage Loan, after the Due Date in the related
month of substitution); and
Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
(iv)Â Â Â  any reduction in the outstanding principal
balance of such Mortgage Loan resulting from a valuation by a court in a bankruptcy proceeding that is less than the then outstanding
principal amount of such Mortgage Loan or a modification of such
Â 


315
Â 

Â 
Mortgage Loan pursuant to the terms and provisions of the PSA
that occurred prior to the end of the Collection Period for the most recent Distribution Date.
Â 
The Stated Principal Balance of any REO
Loan that is a successor to a Mortgage Loan, as of any date of determination, will be an amount equal to (x)Â the Stated Principal
Balance of the predecessor Mortgage Loan as of the date of the related REO Property was acquired for U.S. federal tax purposes,
minus (y)Â the sum of:
Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
(i)Â Â Â  the principal portion of any P&I
Advance made with respect to such REO Loan; and
Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
(ii)Â Â Â  the principal portion of all Insurance
and Condemnation Proceeds (to the extent allocable to principal on the related Mortgage Loan), Liquidation Proceeds and all income
rents and profits received with respect to such REO Loan.
Â 
See âCertain Legal Aspects of
Mortgage Loansâ below.
Â 
With respect to each Companion Loan on
any date of determination, the Stated Principal Balance will equal the unpaid principal balance of such Companion Loan as of such
date. On any date of determination, the Stated Principal Balance of each Whole Loan will equal the sum of the Stated Principal
Balances of the related Mortgage Loan and the related Companion Loan(s), as applicable, on such date.
Â 
With respect to any REO Loan that is a
successor to a Companion Loan as of any date of determination, the Stated Principal Balance will equal (x)Â the Stated Principal
Balance of the predecessor Companion Loan as of the date of the related REO Acquisition, minus (y)Â the principal portion
of any amounts allocable to the related Companion Loan in accordance with the related Intercreditor Agreement.
Â 
If any Mortgage Loan or REO Loan is paid
in full or the Mortgage Loan or REO Loan (or any REO Property) is otherwise liquidated, then, as of the first Distribution Date
that follows the end of the Collection Period in which that payment in full or liquidation occurred and notwithstanding that a
loss may have occurred in connection with any liquidation, the Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loan or Whole Loan will
be zero.
Â 
For purposes of calculating allocations
of, or recoveries in respect of, Realized Losses, as well as for purposes of calculating the Servicing Fee and Certificate Administrator/Trustee
Fee payable each month, each REO Property (including any REO Property with respect to a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan held pursuant
to the related Non-Serviced PSA) will be treated as if there exists with respect to such REO Property an outstanding Mortgage Loan
and, if applicable, each related Companion Loan (an âREO Loanâ), and all references to Mortgage Loan or Companion
Loan and pool of Mortgage Loans in this prospectus, when used in that context, will be deemed to also be references to or to also
include, as the case may be, any REO Loans. Each REO Loan will generally be deemed to have the same characteristics as its actual
predecessor Mortgage Loan (including related Companion Loan), including the same fixed Mortgage Rate (and, accordingly, the same
Net Mortgage Rate) and the same unpaid principal balance and Stated Principal Balance. Amounts due on the predecessor Mortgage
Loan (including related Companion Loan) including any portion of it payable or reimbursable to the master servicer, the special
servicer, the operating advisor, the asset representations reviewer, the certificate administrator or the trustee, as applicable,
will continue to be âdueâ in respect of the REO Loan; and amounts received in respect of the related REO Property,
net of payments to be made, or reimbursement to the master servicer or special servicer for payments previously advanced, in connection
with the operation and management of that
Â 


316
Â 
Â Â 
property, generally will be applied by the master servicer as if received on the predecessor
Mortgage Loan or related Companion Loan.
Â 
With respect to each Serviced Whole Loan,
no amounts relating to the related REO Property or REO Loan allocable to any related Companion Loan will be available for amounts
due to the Certificateholders or to reimburse the issuing entity, other than in the limited circumstances related to Servicing
Advances, indemnification, Special Servicing Fees and other reimbursable expenses related to such Serviced Whole Loan incurred
with respect to such Serviced Whole Loan in accordance with the PSA.
Â 
Excess Interest
Â 
On each Distribution Date, the certificate
administrator is required to distribute any Excess Interest received with respect to the ARD Loan on or prior to the related Determination
Date to the holders of the ClassÂ V certificates. Excess Interest will not be available to make distributions to any other
class of certificates or to provide credit support for other classes of certificates or offset any interest shortfalls or to pay
any other amounts to any other party under the PSA.
Â 
Application Priority of
Mortgage Loan Collections or Whole Loan Collections
Â 
Absent express provisions in the related
Mortgage Loan documents (and, with respect to each Serviced Whole Loan, the related Intercreditor Agreement) or to the extent otherwise
agreed to by the related borrower in connection with a workout of a Mortgage Loan, all amounts collected by or on behalf of the
issuing entity in respect of any Mortgage Loan in the form of payments from the related borrower, Liquidation Proceeds, condemnation
proceeds or insurance proceeds (excluding, if applicable, in the case of each Serviced Whole Loan, any amounts payable to the holder
of the related Companion Loan(s) pursuant to the related Intercreditor Agreement) will be deemed to be allocated for purposes of
collecting amounts due under the Mortgage Loan, pursuant to the PSA, in the following order of priority:
Â 
First, as a recovery
of any unreimbursed Advances (including any Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount) with respect to the related Mortgage Loan and
unpaid interest at the Reimbursement Rate on such Advances and, if applicable, unreimbursed and unpaid expenses of the issuing
entity;
Â 
Second, as a recovery
of Nonrecoverable Advances and any interest on those Nonrecoverable Advances at the Reimbursement Rate, to the extent previously
paid or reimbursed from principal collections on the Mortgage Loans (as described in the first proviso in the definition
of Principal Distribution Amount);
Â 
Third, to the extent
not previously allocated pursuant to clauseÂ First, as a recovery of accrued and unpaid interest on such Mortgage Loan
(exclusive of default interest and Excess Interest) to the extent of the excess of (i)Â accrued and unpaid interest on such
Mortgage Loan at the related Mortgage Rate in effect from time to time through the end of the applicable mortgage interest accrual
period, over (ii)Â the cumulative amount of the reductions (if any) in the amount of related P&I Advances for such Mortgage
Loan that have occurred in connection with related Appraisal Reduction Amounts (to the extent collections have not been allocated
as recovery of accrued and unpaid interest pursuant to clauseÂ Fifth below on earlier dates);
Â 
Fourth, to the extent
not previously allocated pursuant to clauseÂ First, as a recovery of principal of such Mortgage Loan then due and owing,
including by reason of
Â 


317
Â 
Â Â 
acceleration of such Mortgage Loan following a default thereunder (or, if the Mortgage Loan has been liquidated,
as a recovery of principal to the extent of its entire remaining unpaid principal balance);
Â 
Fifth, as a recovery
of accrued and unpaid interest on such Mortgage Loan to the extent of the cumulative amount of the reductions (if any) in the amount
of related P&I Advances for such Mortgage Loan that have occurred in connection with related Appraisal Reduction Amounts (to
the extent collections have not been allocated as recovery of accrued and unpaid interest pursuant to this clauseÂ Fifth
on earlier dates);
Â 
Sixth, as a recovery
of amounts to be currently allocated to the payment of, or escrowed for the future payment of, real estate taxes, assessments and

Advisor Consulting Fees);
Â 
Twelfth, as a recovery
of any remaining principal of such Mortgage Loan to the extent of its entire remaining unpaid principal balance; and
Â 
Thirteenth, in the case
of an ARD Loan after the related Anticipated Repayment Date, any accrued but unpaid Excess Interest,
Â 
provided that, to the extent required under the REMIC
provisions of the Code, payments or proceeds received (or receivable by exercise of the lenderâs rights under the related
Mortgage Loan documents) with respect to any partial release of a Mortgaged Property (including in connection with a condemnation)
at a time when the loan-to-value ratio of the related Mortgage Loan or Serviced Whole Loan exceeds 125%, or would exceed 125% following
any partial release (based solely on the value of real property and excluding personal property and going concern value, if any,
unless otherwise permitted under the applicable REMIC rules as evidenced by an opinion of counsel provided to the trustee) may
be required to be collected and allocated to reduce the principal balance of the Mortgage Loan or Serviced Whole Loan) in the manner
required by such REMIC provisions.
Â 
Collections by or on behalf of the issuing
entity in respect of any REO Property (exclusive of the amounts to be allocated to the payment of the costs of operating, managing,
leasing, maintaining and disposing of such REO Property and, if applicable, in the case of each Serviced Whole Loan, exclusive
of any amounts payable to the holder of the related Companion Loan(s), as applicable, pursuant to the related Intercreditor Agreement)
will be deemed to be allocated for purposes of collecting amounts due under the Mortgage Loan, pursuant to the PSA, in the following
order of priority:
Â 


318
Â 
Â Â 
First, as a recovery
of any unreimbursed Advances (including any Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount) with respect to the related Mortgage Loan and
interest at the Reimbursement Rate on all Advances and, if applicable, unreimbursed and unpaid expenses of the issuing entity with
respect to the related Mortgage Loan;
Â 
Second, as a recovery
of Nonrecoverable Advances and any interest on those Nonrecoverable Advances at the Reimbursement Rate, to the extent previously
paid or reimbursed from principal collections on the Mortgage Loans (as described in the first proviso in the definition of Principal
Distribution Amount);
Â 
Third, to the extent
not previously allocated pursuant to clauseÂ First, as a recovery of accrued and unpaid interest on such Mortgage Loan
(exclusive of default interest and Excess Interest) to the extent of the excess of (i)Â accrued and unpaid interest on such
Mortgage Loan at the applicable Mortgage Rate in effect from time to time through the end of the applicable mortgage interest accrual
period, over (ii)Â the cumulative amount of the reductions (if any) in the amount of related P&I Advances for such Mortgage
Loan that have occurred in connection with related Appraisal Reduction Amounts (to the extent collections have not been allocated
as a recovery of accrued and unpaid interest pursuant to clauseÂ Fifth below on earlier dates);
Â 
Fourth, to the extent
not previously allocated pursuant to clauseÂ First, as a recovery of principal of such Mortgage Loan to the extent of
its entire unpaid principal balance;
Â 
Fifth, as a recovery
of accrued and unpaid interest on such Mortgage Loan to the extent of the cumulative amount of the reductions (if any) in the amount
of related P&I Advances for such Mortgage Loan that have occurred in connection with related Appraisal Reduction Amounts (to
the extent collections have not been allocated as recovery of accrued and unpaid interest pursuant to this clauseÂ Fifth

Advisor Consulting Fees); and
Â 
Tenth, in the case of
an ARD Loan after the related Anticipated Repayment Date, any accrued but unpaid Excess Interest.
Â 
Allocation of Yield
Maintenance Charges and Prepayment Premiums
Â 
If any Yield Maintenance Charge or Prepayment
Premium is collected during any particular collection period with respect to any Mortgage Loan, then on the Distribution Date corresponding
to that Collection Period, the certificate administrator will pay that Yield Maintenance Charge or Prepayment Premium in the following
manner: (1)Â to each of the ClassÂ A-1, ClassÂ A-2A, ClassÂ A-2B, ClassÂ A-3, ClassÂ A-4, ClassÂ A-SB,
ClassÂ A-S, ClassÂ B, ClassÂ C and ClassÂ D certificates, the product of (a)Â such Yield Maintenance Charge
or Prepayment Premium, (b)Â the related Base Interest Fraction for such class, and (c)Â a
Â 


319
Â 
Â Â 
fraction, the numerator of which is
equal to the amount of principal distributed to such class for that Distribution Date, and the denominator of which is the
total amount of principal distributed to all Principal Balance Certificates for that Distribution Date, (2)Â to the
ClassÂ X-A certificates, the excess, if any, of (a)Â the product of (i)Â such Yield Maintenance Charge or
Prepayment Premium and (ii)Â a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the amount of principal distributed to the
ClassÂ A-1, ClassÂ A-2A, ClassÂ A-2B, ClassÂ A-3, ClassÂ A-4, ClassÂ A-SB and ClassÂ A-S
certificates for that Distribution Date, and the denominator of which is the total amount of principal distributed to all
Principal Balance Certificates for that Distribution Date, over (b)Â the amount of such Yield Maintenance Charge or
Prepayment Premium distributed to the ClassÂ A-1, ClassÂ A-2A, ClassÂ A-2B, ClassÂ A-3, ClassÂ A-4,
ClassÂ A-SB and ClassÂ A-S certificates as described above, and (3) to the Class X-B certificates, any remaining such
Yield Maintenance Charge or Prepayment Premium not distributed as described above.
Â 
âBase Interest Fractionâ
means, with respect to any principal prepayment of any Mortgage Loan that provides for the payment of a Yield Maintenance Charge
or Prepayment Premium, and with respect to any Class of Principal Balance Certificates, a fraction (A)Â the numerator of which
is the greater of (x)Â zero and (y)Â the difference between (i)Â the pass-through rate on that class, and (ii)Â the
applicable Discount Rate and (B)Â the denominator of which is the difference between (i)Â the mortgage interest rate on
the related Mortgage Loan and (ii)Â the applicable Discount Rate; provided,
however, that:
Â 

Â·under no circumstances will the Base Interest Fraction be greater than one;
Â 

Â·if the Discount Rate referred to above is greater than or equal to the mortgage interest rate on the related Mortgage Loan
and is greater than or equal to the pass-through rate on that class, then the Base Interest Fraction will equal zero; and
Â 

Â·if the Discount Rate referred to above is greater than or equal to the mortgage interest rate on the related Mortgage Loan
and is less than the pass-through rate on that class, then the Base Interest Fraction will be equal to 1.0.
Â 
âDiscount Rateâ means,
with respect to any principal prepayment of any Mortgage Loan that provides for the payment of a Yield Maintenance Charge or Prepayment
Premiumâ
Â 

Â·if a Discount Rate was used in the calculation of the applicable Yield Maintenance Charge or Prepayment Premium pursuant to
the terms of the Mortgage Loan or REO Loan, that Discount Rate, converted (if necessary) to a monthly equivalent yield, or
Â 

Â·if a Discount Rate was not used in the calculation of the applicable Yield Maintenance Charge or Prepayment Premium pursuant
to the terms of the Mortgage Loan, the yield calculated by the linear interpolation of the yields, as reported in Federal Reserve
Statistical Release H.15 (519)âSelected Interest Rates under the heading âU.S. government securities/treasury constant
maturitiesâ for the week ending prior to the date of the relevant prepayment (or deemed prepayment), of U.S. Treasury constant
maturities with a maturity date, one longer and one shorter, most nearly approximating the maturity date of that Mortgage Loan
or REO Loan, such interpolated treasury yield converted to a monthly equivalent yield.
Â 
For purposes of the immediately preceding
bullet, the certificate administrator or the master servicer will select a comparable publication as the source of the applicable
yields of
Â 


320
Â 
Â Â 
U.S. Treasury constant maturities if Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 is no longer published.
Â 
âPrepayment Premiumâ
means, with respect to any Mortgage Loan, any premium, fee or other additional amount (other than a Yield Maintenance Charge) paid
or payable, as the context requires, by a borrower in connection with a principal prepayment on, or other early collection of principal
of, that Mortgage Loan or any successor REO Loan with respect thereto (including any payoff of a Mortgage Loan by a mezzanine lender
on behalf of the subject borrower if and as set forth in the related intercreditor agreement).
Â 
âYield Maintenance Chargeâ
means, with respect to any Mortgage Loan, any premium, fee or other additional amount paid or payable, as the context requires,
by a borrower in connection with a principal prepayment on, or other early collection of principal of, a Mortgage Loan, calculated,
in whole or in part, pursuant to a yield maintenance formula or otherwise pursuant to a formula that reflects the lost interest,
including any specified amount or specified percentage of the amount prepaid which constitutes the minimum amount that such Yield
Maintenance Charge may be.
Â 
No Prepayment Premiums or Yield Maintenance
Charges will be distributed to the holders of the ClassÂ X-D, ClassÂ E, ClassÂ F, ClassÂ G, ClassÂ R or ClassÂ V
certificates.
Â 
For a description of Yield Maintenance
Charges, see âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâCertain Terms of the Mortgage Loansâ and âCertain
Legal Aspects of Mortgage LoansâDefault Interest and Limitations on Prepaymentsâ.

Â 
The Assumed Final Distribution Dates set
forth above were calculated without regard to any delays in the collection of balloon payments and without regard to delinquencies,
defaults or liquidations. Accordingly, in the event of defaults on the Mortgage Loans, the actual final Distribution Date for one
or more classes of the Offered Certificates may be later, and could be substantially later, than the related Assumed Final Distribution
Date(s).
Â 
In addition, the Assumed Final Distribution
Dates set forth above were calculated on the basis of a 0% CPR prepayment rate and the Structuring Assumptions. Since the rate
of
Â 


321
Â 
Â Â 
payment (including prepayments) of the Mortgage Loans may exceed the scheduled rate of payments, and could exceed the scheduled
rate by a substantial amount, the actual final Distribution Date for one or more classes of the Offered Certificates may be earlier,
and could be substantially earlier, than the related Assumed Final Distribution Date(s). The rate of payments (including prepayments)
on the Mortgage Loans will depend on the characteristics of the Mortgage Loans, as well as on the prevailing level of interest
rates and other economic factors, and we cannot assure you as to actual payment experience.
Â 

The âRated Final Distribution
Dateâ for each class of Offered Certificates will be the Distribution Date in December 2048. See âRatingsâ.
Â 
Prepayment Interest
Shortfalls
Â 
If a borrower prepays a Mortgage Loan
(other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Whole Loan in whole or in part, after the due date but on or before the Determination
Date in any calendar month, the amount of interest (net of related Servicing Fees and any Excess Interest) accrued on such prepayment
from such due date to, but not including, the date of prepayment (or any later date through which interest accrues) will, to the
extent actually collected (without regard to any Prepayment Premium or Yield Maintenance Charge actually collected) constitute
a âPrepayment Interest Excessâ. Conversely, if a borrower prepays a Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced
Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Whole Loan in whole or in part after the Determination Date (or, with respect to each Mortgage Loan
(other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, as applicable, with a due date occurring after
the related Determination Date, the related Due Date) in any calendar month and does not pay interest on such prepayment through
the following Due Date, then the shortfall in a full monthâs interest (net of related Servicing Fees and any Excess Interest)
on such prepayment will constitute a âPrepayment Interest Shortfallâ. Prepayment Interest Excesses (to the extent
not offset by Prepayment Interest Shortfalls or required to be paid as Compensating Interest Payments) collected on the Mortgage
Loans (other than any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) and any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, will be retained by the master
servicer as additional servicing compensation.
Â 
The master servicer will be required to
deliver to the certificate administrator for deposit in the Distribution Account (other than the portion of any Compensating Interest
Payment described below that is allocable to a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) on each Master Servicer Remittance Date, without
any right of reimbursement thereafter, a cash payment (a âCompensating Interest Paymentâ) in an aggregate amount,
equal to the lesser of:
Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
(i)Â Â Â  the aggregate amount of Prepayment Interest
Shortfalls incurred in connection with voluntary principal prepayments received in respect of the Mortgage Loans (other than each
Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) and any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan (in each case other than a Specially Serviced Loan
or a Mortgage Loan or any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan on which the special servicer allowed a prepayment on a date
other than the applicable Due Date) for the related Distribution Date, and
Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
(ii)Â Â Â  the aggregate of (A)Â that portion
of the master servicerâs Servicing Fees for the related Distribution Date that is, in the case of each Mortgage Loan (other
than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan), Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan and REO Loan for which such Servicing Fees are being paid
in such Collection Period, calculated at a rate of 0.0025% per annum,
(B)Â all Prepayment Interest Excesses received by the master servicer during such Collection Period with respect to the Mortgage
Loans (other than the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans) (and, so long as a Whole Loan is
Â 


322
Â 
Â 
Â 
serviced under the PSA, any related Serviced
Pari Passu Companion Loan) subject to such prepayment and (C)Â to the extent earned on voluntary principal prepayments, net
investment earnings payable to the master servicer for such Collection Period received by the master servicer during such Collection
Period with respect to the Mortgage Loans (other than the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans) or any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion
Loan, as applicable, subject to such prepayment. In no event will the rights of the Certificateholders to the offset of the aggregate
Prepayment Interest Shortfalls be cumulative.
Â 
If a Prepayment Interest Shortfall occurs
with respect to a Mortgage Loan as a result of the master servicer allowing the related borrower to deviate (a âProhibited
Prepaymentâ) from the terms of the related Mortgage Loan documents regarding principal prepayments (other than (v)Â any
Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, (w)Â subsequent to a default under the related Mortgage Loan documents or if the Mortgage Loan
is a Specially Serviced Loan, (x)Â pursuant to applicable law or a court order or otherwise in such circumstances where the
master servicer is required to accept such principal prepayment in accordance with the Servicing Standard, (y)Â at the request
or with the consent of the special servicer or, so long as no Control Termination Event has occurred or is continuing, and with
respect to the Mortgage Loans other than an Excluded Loan, the Directing Certificateholder or (z)Â in connection with the payment
of any insurance proceeds or condemnation awards), then for purposes of calculating the Compensating Interest Payment for the related
Distribution Date, the master servicer will pay, without regard to clauseÂ (ii) above, the aggregate amount of Prepayment Interest
Shortfalls with respect to such Mortgage Loan otherwise described in clauseÂ (i) above in connection with such Prohibited Prepayments.
Â 
Compensating Interest Payments with respect
to any Serviced Whole Loan will be allocated among the related Mortgage Loan and the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan
in accordance with their respective principal amounts, and the master servicer will be required to pay the portion of such Compensating
Interest Payments allocable to the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan to the related Other Master Servicer.
Â 
The aggregate of any Prepayment Interest
Shortfalls resulting from any principal prepayments made on the Mortgage Loans to be included in the Available Funds for any Distribution
Date that are not covered by the master servicerâs Compensating Interest Payment for the related Distribution Date and the
portion of the compensating interest payments allocable to each Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan to the extent received from the related
Non-Serviced Master Servicer (such amounts, the âExcess Prepayment Interest Shortfallâ) will be allocated on
that Distribution Date among each class of Regular Certificates, pro rata in accordance with their respective Interest Accrual
Amounts for that Distribution Date.
Â 
Subordination; Allocation
of Realized Losses
Â 
The rights of holders of the Subordinate
Certificates to receive distributions of amounts collected or advanced on the Mortgage Loans will be subordinated, to the extent
described in this prospectus, to the rights of holders of the Senior Certificates. In particular, the rights of the holders of
the ClassÂ A-S, ClassÂ B, ClassÂ C, ClassÂ D, ClassÂ E, ClassÂ F and ClassÂ G certificates to receive
distributions of interest and principal, as applicable, will be subordinated to such rights of the holders of the Senior Certificates.
The ClassÂ A-S certificates will likewise be protected by the subordination of the ClassÂ B, ClassÂ C, ClassÂ D,
ClassÂ E, ClassÂ F and ClassÂ G certificates. The ClassÂ B certificates will likewise be protected by the subordination
of the ClassÂ C, ClassÂ D, ClassÂ E, ClassÂ F and ClassÂ G certificates. The ClassÂ C certificates will
likewise be protected by the subordination of the ClassÂ D, ClassÂ E,
Â 


323
Â 
Â Â 
ClassÂ F and ClassÂ G certificates. The ClassÂ D
certificates will likewise be protected by the subordination of the ClassÂ E, ClassÂ F and ClassÂ G certificates.
Â 
This subordination will be effected in
two ways: (i)Â by the preferential right of the holders of a class of certificates to receive on any Distribution Date the
amounts of interest and/or principal distributable to them prior to any distribution being made on such Distribution Date in respect
of any classes of certificates subordinate to that class (as described above under ââDistributionsâPriority
of Distributionsâ) and (ii)Â by the allocation of Realized Losses to classes of certificates that are subordinate
to more senior classes, as described below.

Â 
No other form of credit support will be
available for the benefit of the Offered Certificates.
Â 
Prior to the Cross-Over Date, allocation
of principal on any Distribution Date will be made first, to the ClassÂ A-SB certificates until their Certificate Balance
has been reduced to the ClassÂ A-SB Planned Principal Balance for the related Distribution Date, second, to the ClassÂ A-1
certificates until their Certificate Balance has been reduced to zero, third, to the ClassÂ A-2A certificates, until
their Certificate Balance has been reduced to zero, fourth, to the ClassÂ A-2B certificates, until their Certificate
Balance has been reduced to zero, fifth, to the ClassÂ A-3 certificates, until their Certificate Balance has
been reduced to zero, sixth, to the ClassÂ A-4 certificates until their Certificate Balance has been reduced to zero,
and seventh, to the ClassÂ A-SB certificates until their Certificate Balance has been reduced to zero. On or after the
Cross-Over Date, allocation of principal will be made to the ClassÂ A-1, ClassÂ A-2A, ClassÂ A-2B, ClassÂ A-3,
ClassÂ A-4 and ClassÂ A-SB certificates that are still outstanding, pro
rata, without regard to the ClassÂ A-SB Planned Principal Balance, until their Certificate Balances have been reduced
to zero. See ââDistributionsâPriority of Distributionsâ above.
Â 
Allocation to the ClassÂ A-1, ClassÂ A-2A,
ClassÂ A-2B, ClassÂ A-3, ClassÂ A-4 and ClassÂ A-SB certificates, for so long as they are outstanding, of the entire
Principal Distribution Amount for each Distribution Date will have the effect of reducing the aggregate Certificate Balance of
the ClassÂ A-1, ClassÂ A-2A, ClassÂ A-2B, ClassÂ A-3, ClassÂ A-4 and ClassÂ A-SB certificates at a proportionately
faster rate than the rate at which the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the pool of Mortgage Loans will decline. Therefore,
as principal is distributed to the holders of the ClassÂ A-1, ClassÂ A-2A, ClassÂ A-2B, ClassÂ A-3, ClassÂ A-4
and ClassÂ A-SB certificates, the percentage interest in the issuing entity evidenced by the ClassÂ A-1, ClassÂ A-2A,
ClassÂ A-2B, ClassÂ A-3, ClassÂ A-4 and ClassÂ A-SB certificates will be decreased (with a corresponding increase
in the percentage interest in the issuing entity evidenced by the Subordinate Certificates), thereby increasing, relative to their
respective Certificate Balances, the subordination afforded to the ClassÂ A-1, ClassÂ A-2A, ClassÂ A-2B, ClassÂ A-3,
ClassÂ A-4 and ClassÂ A-SB certificates by the Subordinate Certificates.
Â 
Following retirement of the ClassÂ A-1,
ClassÂ A-2A, ClassÂ A-2B, ClassÂ A-3, ClassÂ A-4 and ClassÂ A-SB certificates, the successive allocation on
each Distribution Date of the remaining Principal Distribution Amount to the ClassÂ A-S certificates, the ClassÂ B certificates,
the ClassÂ C certificates, the ClassÂ D certificates, the ClassÂ E certificates, the ClassÂ F certificates and
ClassÂ G certificates, in that order, for so long as they are outstanding, will provide a similar, but diminishing benefit
to those certificates (other than to ClassÂ G certificates) as to the relative amount of subordination afforded by the outstanding
classes of certificates with later sequential designations.
Â 
On each Distribution Date, immediately
following the distributions to be made to the Certificateholders on that date, the certificate administrator is required to calculate
the
Â 


324
Â 
Â Â 
amount, if any, by which (i)Â the
aggregate Stated Principal Balance (for purposes of this calculation only, the aggregate Stated Principal Balance will not be
reduced by the amount of principal payments received on the Mortgage Loans that were used to reimburse the master servicer,
the special servicer or the trustee from general collections of principal on the Mortgage Loans for Workout-Delayed
Reimbursement Amounts, to the extent those amounts are not otherwise determined to be Nonrecoverable Advances) of the
Mortgage Loans, including any REO Loans (but in each case, excluding any Companion Loan) expected to be outstanding
immediately following that Distribution Date is less than (ii)Â the then aggregate Certificate Balance of the Principal
Balance Certificates after giving effect to distributions of principal on that Distribution Date (any such deficit, a
âRealized Lossâ). The certificate administrator will be required to allocate any Realized Losses among the
respective classes of Principal Balance Certificates in the following order, until the Certificate Balance of each such class
is reduced to zero:
Â 
first, to the ClassÂ G certificates;
Â 
second, to the ClassÂ F certificates;
Â 
third, to the ClassÂ E certificates;
Â 
fourth, to the ClassÂ D certificates;
Â 
fifth, to the ClassÂ C certificates;
Â 
sixth, to the ClassÂ B certificates;
and
Â 
seventh, to the ClassÂ A-S
certificates.
Â 
Following the reduction of the Certificate
Balances of all classes of Subordinate Certificates to zero, the certificate administrator will be required to allocate Realized
Losses among the Senior Certificates (other than the ClassÂ X Certificates), pro rata, based upon their respective Certificate
Balances, until their respective Certificate Balances have been reduced to zero.
Â 
Realized Losses will not be allocated
to the ClassÂ V certificates or the ClassÂ R certificates and will not be directly allocated to the ClassÂ X Certificates.
However, the Notional Amounts of the classes of ClassÂ X Certificates will be reduced if the related classes of Principal Balance
Certificates are reduced by such Realized Losses.
Â 
In general, Realized Losses could result
from the occurrence of: (1)Â losses and other shortfalls on or in respect of the Mortgage Loans, including as a result of defaults
and delinquencies on the related Mortgage Loans, Nonrecoverable Advances made in respect of the Mortgage Loans, the payment to
the special servicer of any compensation as described in âPooling and Servicing AgreementâServicing and Other Compensation
and Payment of Expensesâ, and the payment of interest on Advances and certain servicing expenses; and (2)Â certain
unanticipated, non-Mortgage Loan specific expenses of the issuing entity, including certain reimbursements to the certificate administrator
or trustee as described under âTransaction PartiesâThe Trusteeâ or ââThe Certificate
Administratorâ, and certain federal, state and local taxes, and certain tax-related expenses, payable out of the issuing
entity, as described under âMaterial Federal Income Tax Considerationsâ.
Â 
A class of Regular Certificates will be
considered outstanding until its Certificate Balance or Notional Amount, as the case may be, is reduced to zero. However, notwithstanding
a reduction of its Certificate Balance to zero, reimbursements of any previously allocated Realized Losses are required thereafter
to be made to a class of Principal Balance
Â 


325
Â 
Â Â 
Certificates in accordance with the payment priorities set forth in ââDistributionsâPriority
of Distributionsâ above.
Â 
Reports to Certificateholders;
Certain Available Information
Â 
Certificate Administrator
Reports
Â 
On each Distribution Date, the
certificate administrator will be required to prepare and make available to each Certificateholder of record a Distribution
Date Statement providing the information required under Regulation AB and in the form of AnnexÂ B relating to
distributions made on that date for the relevant class and the recent status of the Mortgage Loans.
Â 
In addition, the certificate administrator
will include (to the extent it receives such information) (i)Â the identity of any Mortgage Loans permitting additional debt,
identifying (A)Â the amount of any additional debt incurred during the related Collection Period, (B)Â the total DSCR calculated
on the basis of the mortgage loan and such additional debt and (C)Â the aggregate loan-to-value ratio calculated on the basis

beginning and ending account balances for each of the Securitization Accounts (for the applicable period) in each Form 10-D filed
on behalf of the issuing entity.
Â 
Within a reasonable period of time after
the end of each calendar year, the certificate administrator is required to furnish to each person or entity who at any time during
the calendar year was a holder of a certificate, a statement with (i)Â the amount of the distribution on each Distribution
Date in reduction of the Certificate Balance of the certificates and (ii)Â the amount of the distribution on each Distribution
Date of the applicable Interest Accrual Amount, in each case, as to the applicable class, aggregated for the related calendar year
or applicable partial year during which that person was a Certificateholder, together with any other information that the certificate
administrator deems necessary or desirable, or that a Certificateholder or Certificate Owner reasonably requests, to enable Certificateholders
to prepare their tax returns for that calendar year. This obligation of the certificate administrator will be deemed to have been
satisfied to the extent that substantially comparable information will be provided by the certificate administrator pursuant to
any requirements of the Code as from time to time are in force.
Â 
In addition, the certificate administrator
will make available on its website (www.ctslink.com), to the extent received from the applicable person, on each Distribution Date
to each Privileged Person the following reports (other than clauseÂ (1) below, the âCREFCÂ® Reportsâ)

Â 
The master servicer or the special servicer,
as applicable, may omit any information from these reports that the master servicer or the special servicer regards as confidential.
Subject to any potential liability for willful misconduct, bad faith or negligence as described under âPooling and Servicing
AgreementâLimitation on Liability; Indemnificationâ, none of the master servicer, the special servicer, the trustee
or the certificate administrator will be responsible for the accuracy or completeness of any information supplied to it by a borrower,
a mortgage loan seller or another party to the PSA or a party under any Non-Serviced PSA that is included in any reports, statements,
materials or information prepared or provided by it. Some information will be made available to Certificateholders by electronic
transmission as may be agreed upon between the depositor and the certificate administrator.
Â 
Before each Distribution Date, the master
servicer will deliver to the certificate administrator by electronic means:
Â 

Â·a CREFCÂ® property file;
Â 

Â·a CREFCÂ® financial file;
Â 

Â·a CREFCÂ® loan setup file (to the extent delivery is required under the PSA); and

Â 
In addition, the master servicer (with
respect to a Mortgage Loan that is not a Specially Serviced Loan or a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or special servicer (with respect
to Specially Serviced Loans and REO Properties), as applicable, is also required to prepare the following for each Mortgaged Property
securing a Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) and REO Property:

borrower is required by the Mortgage Loan documents to deliver and does deliver, or otherwise agrees to provide and does
Â 


327
Â 
Â 
 
Â Â provide, that information, for the Mortgaged Property or REO Property as of the end of that calendar quarter,
provided, however,
that any analysis or report with respect to the first calendar quarter of each year will not be required to the extent provided
in the then current applicable CREFCÂ® guidelines (it being understood that as of the date of this prospectus, the
applicable CREFCÂ® guidelines provide that such analysis or report with respect to the first calendar quarter (in
each year) is not required for a Mortgaged Property unless such Mortgaged Property is analyzed on a trailing 12 month basis, or
if the related Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) is on the CREFCÂ® Servicer Watch List).

Â Â Â 

Â·Within 45 days after receipt by the special servicer (with respect to Specially Serviced Loans and REO Properties) or the master
servicer (with respect to a Mortgage Loan that is not a Specially Serviced Loan or a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) of any annual
operating statements or rent rolls (if and to the extent any such information is in the form of normalized year-end financial statements
that has been based on a minimum number of months of operating results as recommended by CREFCÂ® in the instructions
to the CREFCÂ® guidelines) commencing within 45 days of receipt of such annual operating statement for the calendar
year ending DecemberÂ 31, 2016, a CREFCÂ® net operating income adjustment worksheet, but only to the extent the

the full year net operating income and debt service coverage numbers used by the master servicer to prepare the CREFCÂ®
comparative financial status report.
Â 
Certificate Owners and any holders of
Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loans who are also Privileged Persons may also obtain access to any of the certificate administrator
reports upon request and pursuant to the provisions of the PSA. Otherwise, until the time Definitive Certificates are issued to

or any Controlling Class Certificateholder (each such party, as applicable, an âExcluded Controlling Class Holderâ),
any Excluded Information via the certificate administratorâs website unless a loan-by-loan segregation is later performed

Class Loans, and (ii)Â if such party is not the Directing Certificateholder or any Controlling Class Certificateholder, any
information other than the
Â 


328
Â 
Â 
Distribution Date
Statement; provided, further, however,
that, with respect to a Borrower Party that is the special servicer, such Borrower Party will be prohibited from viewing or
otherwise retrieving any information solely related to any related Excluded Special Servicer Loan, which may include any
asset status reports, Final Asset Status Reports (or summaries thereof), and such other information as may be specified in
the PSA pertaining to such Excluded Special Servicer Loan; provided, further, however,

website). Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, neither the master servicer nor the certificate administrator
will have any obligation to restrict access by the special servicer or any Excluded Special Servicer to any information
related to any Excluded Special Servicer Loan.
Â 
In determining whether any person is an
additional servicer or an affiliate of the operating advisor, the certificate administrator may rely on a certification by the
master servicer, the special servicer, a mortgage loan seller or the operating advisor, as the case may be.
Â 
âBorrower Partyâ means
a borrower, a mortgagor, a manager of a Mortgaged Property, the holder of a mezzanine loan that has accelerated the related mezzanine
loan (unless (i)Â acceleration was automatic under such mezzanine loan, (ii)Â the event directly giving rise to the automatic

(iii)Â such mezzanine lender is stayed from exercising and has not commenced the exercise of remedies associated with foreclosure
of the equity collateral under such mezzanine loan) or commenced foreclosure or enforcement proceedings against the equity collateral
pledged to secure the related mezzanine loan, or any Borrower Party Affiliate.
Â 
âBorrower Party Affiliateâ
means, with respect to a borrower, a mortgagor, a manager of a Mortgaged Property or a mezzanine lender that has accelerated the
related mezzanine loan (unless (i)Â acceleration was automatic under such mezzanine loan, (ii)Â the event directly giving
rise to the automatic acceleration under such mezzanine loan was not initiated by such mezzanine lender or an affiliate of such
mezzanine lender, and (iii)Â such mezzanine lender is stayed from exercising and has not commenced the exercise of remedies
associated with foreclosure of the equity collateral under such mezzanine loan) or commenced foreclosure or enforcement proceedings

owning, directly or indirectly, 25% or more of the beneficial interests in such borrower, mortgagor, manager or mezzanine lender,
as applicable. For the purposes of this definition, âcontrolâ when used with respect to any specified person means
the power to direct the management and policies of such person, directly or indirectly, whether through the ownership of voting
securities, by contract or otherwise and the terms âcontrollingâ and âcontrolledâ have meanings correlative
to the foregoing.
Â 
âExcluded Controlling Class Loanâ
means a Mortgage Loan or Whole Loan with respect to which the Directing Certificateholder or any Controlling Class Certificateholder
is a Borrower Party.
Â 


329

which may include any asset status reports, Final Asset Status Reports (or summaries thereof), inspection reports related to Specially
Serviced Loans conducted by the special servicer or any Excluded Special Servicer and such other information as may be specified
in the PSA specifically pertaining to such Excluded Controlling Class Loan and/or the related Mortgaged Properties, other than
such information with respect to such Excluded Controlling Class Loan(s) that is aggregated with information of other Mortgage
Loans at a pool level.
Â 
âExcluded Loanâ means

Class is a Borrower Party.
Â 
âInvestor Certificationâ
means a certificate (which may be in electronic form), substantially in the form attached to the PSA or in the form of an electronic
certification contained on the certificate administratorâs website (which may be a click-through confirmation), representing
(i)Â that such person executing the certificate is a Certificateholder, the Directing Certificateholder (to the extent such
person is not a Certificateholder), a beneficial owner of a certificate, a Companion Holder or a prospective purchaser of a certificate
(or any investment advisor, manager or other representative of the foregoing), (ii)Â that either (a)Â such person is not
a Borrower Party, in which case such person will have access to all the reports and information made available to Certificateholders
via the certificate administratorâs website under the PSA, or (b)Â such person is a Borrower Party, in which case (1)Â if
such person is the Directing Certificateholder or a Controlling Class Certificateholder, such person will have access to all the
reports and information made available to Certificateholders via the certificate administratorâs website under the PSA other
than any Excluded Information as set forth in the PSA or (2)Â if such person is not the Directing Certificateholder or a Controlling
Class Certificateholder, such person will only receive access to the Distribution Date Statements prepared by the certificate administrator,
(iii)Â that such person has received a copy of the final prospectus and (iv)Â such person agrees to keep any Privileged
Information confidential and will not violate any securities laws; provided,
however, that any Excluded Controlling Class Holder (i)Â will
be permitted to obtain, in accordance with terms of PSA, any Excluded Information relating to any Excluded Controlling Class Loan
with respect to which such Excluded Controlling Class Holder is not a Borrower Party (if such Excluded Information is not otherwise
available via the certificate administratorâs website) and (ii)Â will be considered a Privileged Person for all other
purposes, except with respect to its ability to obtain information with respect to any related Excluded Controlling Class Loan.
Â 
A âCertificateholderâ
is the person in whose name a certificate is registered in the certificate register or any beneficial owner thereof; provided,
however, that solely for the purposes of giving any consent,
approval, waiver or taking any action pursuant to the PSA, any certificate registered in the name of or beneficially owned by the
master servicer, the special servicer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Excluded Special Servicer), the trustee, the
certificate administrator, the depositor, any mortgage loan seller, a Borrower Party, or any affiliate of any of such persons will
be deemed not to be outstanding (provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, any Controlling Class certificates owned by
an Excluded Controlling Class Holder will not be deemed to be outstanding as to such Excluded Controlling Class Holder solely with
respect to any related Excluded Controlling Class Loan; and provided, further,
that any Controlling Class certificates owned by the special servicer or an affiliate thereof will not be deemed to be outstanding
as to the special servicer or such affiliate solely with respect to any related Excluded Special Servicer Loan), and the Voting
Rights to which it is entitled will not be taken into account in determining whether the
Â 


330
Â 
Â Â 
requisite percentage of Voting Rights
necessary to effect any such consent, approval, waiver or take any such action has been obtained; provided, however,
that the foregoing restrictions will not apply in the case of the master servicer, the special servicer (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Excluded Special Servicer), the trustee, the certificate administrator, the depositor, any mortgage
loan seller or any affiliate of any of such persons unless such consent, approval or waiver sought from such party would in
any way increase its compensation or limit its obligations in the named capacities under the PSA or waive a Servicer
Termination Event or trigger an Asset Review with respect to such Mortgage Loan; provided, further,
that so long as there is no Servicer Termination Event with respect to the master servicer or the special servicer, as
applicable, the master servicer and the special servicer or such affiliate of either will be entitled to exercise such Voting
Rights with respect to any issue which could reasonably be believed to adversely affect such partyâs compensation or
increase its obligations or liabilities under the PSA; and provided, further,
that such restrictions will not apply to (i)Â the exercise of the special servicerâs, the master servicerâs
or any mortgage loan sellerâs rights, if any, or any of their affiliates as a member of the Controlling Class or
(ii)Â any affiliate of the depositor, the master servicer, the special servicer, the trustee or the certificate
administrator that has provided an Investor Certification in which it has certified as to the existence of certain policies
and procedures restricting the flow of information between it and the depositor, the master servicer, the special servicer,
the trustee or the certificate administrator, as applicable.
Â 
âNRSRO Certificationâ
means a certification (a)Â executed by an NRSRO or (b)Â provided electronically and executed by such NRSRO by means of
a âclick-throughâ confirmation on the 17g-5 Information Providerâs website in favor of the 17g-5 Information
Provider that states that such NRSRO is a Rating Agency as such term is defined in the PSA or that such NRSRO has provided the
depositor with the appropriate certifications pursuant to paragraphÂ (e) of Rule 17g-5 under the Exchange Act (âRule
17g-5â), that such NRSRO has access to the depositorâs 17g-5 Information Providerâs website, and that such
NRSRO will keep such information confidential except to the extent such information has been made available to the general public.
Â 
Under the PSA, the master servicer or
the special servicer, as applicable, is required to provide or make available to the holders of any Companion Loan (or their designee
including any master servicer or special servicer) certain other reports, copies and information relating to the related Serviced
Whole Loan to the extent required under the related Intercreditor Agreement.
Â 
Certain information concerning the Mortgage
Loans and the certificates, including the Distribution Date Statements, CREFCÂ® reports and supplemental notices
with respect to such Distribution Date Statements and CREFCÂ® reports, may be provided by the certificate administrator
at the direction of the depositor to certain market data providers, such as Bloomberg, L.P., Trepp, LLC, Intex Solutions, Inc.,
BlackRock Financial Management Inc., Interactive Data Corporation, CMBS.com, Markit and Thomson Reuters Corporation, pursuant to
the terms of the PSA.
Â 
Upon the reasonable request of any Certificateholder
that has delivered an Investor Certification to the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, the master servicer
(with respect to non-Specially Serviced Loans) and the special servicer (with respect to Specially Serviced Loans) may provide
(or forward electronically) at the expense of such Certificateholder copies of any appraisals, operating statements, rent rolls
and financial statements obtained by the master servicer or the special servicer, as the case may be; provided that in connection
with such request, the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, may require a written confirmation executed by the
requesting person substantially in such form as may be reasonably acceptable to the master servicer or the
Â 


331
Â 
Â 
special servicer, as
applicable, generally to the effect that such person will keep such information confidential and will use such information only
for the purpose of analyzing asset performance and evaluating any continuing rights the Certificateholder may have under the PSA.
Certificateholders will not, however, be given access to or be provided copies of, any Mortgage Files or Diligence Files.

Â 

Â·solely to Certificateholders and Certificate Owners that are Privileged Persons, the âInvestor Registryâ.
Â 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Directing Certificateholder or any Controlling Class Certificateholder, as applicable, is an Excluded Controlling
Class Holder, such Excluded Controlling Class Holder is required to promptly notify each of the master servicer, the special servicer,
the operating advisor, the trustee and the certificate administrator pursuant to the PSA and provide an Investor Certification
pursuant to the PSA and will not be entitled to access any Excluded Information (unless a
loan-by-loan segregation is later performed by the certificate administrator in which case such access will only be prohibited
with respect to the related Excluded Controlling Class Loan(s)) made available on the certificate administratorâs website
for so long as it is an Excluded Controlling Class Holder. The PSA will require each Excluded Controlling Class Holder in such
new Investor Certification to certify that it acknowledges and agrees that it is prohibited from accessing and reviewing (and
it agrees not to access and review) any Excluded Information. In addition, if the Directing Certificateholder or any Controlling
Class Certificateholder is not an Excluded Controlling Class Holder, such person will certify and agree that they will not share
any Excluded Information with any Excluded Controlling Class Holder.
Â 
Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing set forth in the PSA will prohibit the Directing Certificateholder or any Controlling Class Certificateholder
from receiving, requesting or reviewing any Excluded Information relating to any Excluded Controlling Class Loan with respect
to which the Directing Certificateholder or such Controlling Class Certificateholder is not a Borrower Party and, if such Excluded
Information is not available via the certificate administratorâs website, such Directing Certificateholder or Controlling
Class Certificateholder that is not a Borrower Party with respect to the related Excluded Controlling Class Loan will be permitted
to obtain such information in accordance with terms of the PSA.
Â 
Any
reports on Form 10-D filed by the certificate administrator will contain (i)Â the information required by Rule 15Ga-1(a) concerning
all Mortgage Loans held by the issuing entity that were the subject of a demand to repurchase or replace due to a breach or alleged
breach of one or more representations and warranties made by the related mortgage loan seller, (ii)Â a reference to the most
recent Form ABS-15G filed by the depositor and the mortgage loan sellers, if applicable, and the SECâs assigned âCentral
Index Keyâ for each such filer and (iii)Â certain account balances to the extent available to the certificate administrator.
Â 
The
certificate administrator will not make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of any report, document
or other information made available on the certificate administratorâs website and will assume no responsibility for any
such report, document or other information, other than with respect to such reports, documents or other information prepared by
the certificate administrator. In addition, the certificate administrator may disclaim responsibility for any information distributed
by it for which it is not the original source.
Â 
In connection
with providing access to the certificate administratorâs website (other than with respect to access provided to the general
public in accordance with the PSA), the
Â 


334
Â 
Â Â 
certificate administrator may require registration and the acceptance of a disclaimer,
including an agreement to keep certain nonpublic information made available on the website confidential, as required under the
PSA. The certificate administrator will not be liable for the dissemination of information in accordance with the PSA.
Â 
The
certificate administrator will make the âInvestor Q&A Forumâ available to Privileged Persons via the
certificate administratorâs website under a tab or heading designated âInvestor Q&A Forumâ, where
(i)Â Certificateholders and beneficial owners that are Privileged Persons may submit inquiries to (a)Â the
certificate administrator relating to the Distribution Date Statements, (b)Â the master servicer or the special servicer
relating to servicing reports, the Mortgage Loans (excluding each Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or the related Mortgaged
Properties or (c)Â the operating advisor relating to annual or other reports prepared by the operating advisor or actions
by the special servicer referenced in such reports, and (ii)Â Privileged Persons may view previously submitted inquiries
and related answers. The certificate administrator will forward such inquiries to the appropriate person and, in the case of
an inquiry relating to a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, to the applicable party under the related Non-Serviced PSA. The
certificate administrator, the master servicer, the special servicer or the operating advisor, as applicable, will be
required to answer each inquiry, unless such party determines (i)Â the question is beyond the scope of the topics
detailed above, (ii)Â that answering the inquiry would not be in the best interests of the issuing entity and/or the
Certificateholders, (iii)Â that answering the inquiry would be in violation of applicable law, the PSA
(including requirements in respect of non-disclosure of Privileged Information) or the Mortgage Loan documents,
(iv)Â that answering the inquiry would materially increase the duties of, or result in significant additional cost or
expense to, the certificate administrator, the master servicer, the special servicer or the operating advisor, as applicable,
(v)Â that answering the inquiry would require the disclosure of Privileged Information (subject to the Privileged
Information Exception) or (vi)Â that answering the inquiry is otherwise, for any reason, not advisable. In addition, no
party will post or otherwise disclose any direct communications with the Directing Certificateholder as part of its responses
to any inquiries. In the case of an inquiry relating to a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, the certificate administrator is
required to make reasonable efforts to obtain an answer from the applicable party under the related Non-Serviced PSA; provided
that the certificate administrator will not be responsible for the content of such answer, or any delay or failure to obtain
such answer. The certificate administrator will be required to post the inquiries and related answers, if any, on the
Investor Q&A Forum, subject to and in accordance with the PSA. The Investor Q&A Forum may not reflect questions,
answers and other communications that are not submitted through the certificate administratorâs website. Answers posted
on the Investor Q&A Forum will be attributable only to the respondent, and will not be deemed to be answers from any of
the depositor, the underwriters or any of their respective affiliates. None of the underwriters, depositor, any of their
respective affiliates or any other person will certify as to the accuracy of any of the information posted in the Investor
Q&A Forum and no such person will have any responsibility or liability for the content of any such
information.
Â 
The
certificate administrator will make the âInvestor Registryâ available to any Certificateholder and beneficial owner
that is a Privileged Person via the certificate administratorâs website. Certificateholders and beneficial owners may register
on a voluntary basis for the âInvestor Registryâ and obtain contact information for any other Certificateholder or
beneficial owner that has also registered, provided that they comply with certain requirements as provided for in the PSA.
Â 
The
certificate administratorâs internet website will initially be located at âwww.ctslink.comâ. Access will be
provided by the certificate administrator to such persons
Â 


335
Â 
Â Â 

upon receipt by the certificate administrator from such person of an Investor Certification or NRSRO Certification in
the form(s) attached to the PSA, which form(s) will also be located on and submitted electronically via the
certificate administratorâs internet website. The parties to the PSA will not be required to provide that
certification. In connection with providing access to the certificate administratorâs internet website, the certificate
administrator may require registration and the acceptance of a disclaimer. The certificate administrator will not be liable
for the dissemination of information in accordance with the terms of the PSA. The certificate administrator will make
no representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of such documents and will assume no responsibility for
them. In addition, the certificate administrator may disclaim responsibility for any information distributed by the
certificate administrator for which it is not the original source. Assistance in using the certificate administratorâs
internet website can be obtained by calling the certificate administratorâs customer service desk at
866-846-4526.
Â 
The
certificate administrator is responsible for the preparation of tax returns on behalf of the issuing entity and the preparation
of Distribution Reports on Form 10-D (based on information included in each monthly Distribution Date Statement and other information
provided by other transaction parties) and Annual Reports on Form 10-K and certain other reports on Form 8-K that are required
to be filed with the SEC on behalf of the issuing entity.
Â 
â17g-5
Information Providerâ means the certificate administrator.
Â 
The
PSA will require the master servicer, subject to certain restrictions (including execution and delivery of a confidentiality agreement)
set forth in the PSA, to provide certain of the reports or, in the case of the master servicer and the Controlling Class Certificateholder,
access to the reports available as set forth above, as well as certain other information received by the master servicer, to any
Privileged Person so identified by a Certificate Owner or an underwriter, that requests reports or information. However, the master
servicer will be permitted to require payment of a sum sufficient to cover the reasonable costs and expenses of providing copies
of these reports or information (which such amounts in any event are not reimbursable as additional trust fund expenses), except
that, other than for extraordinary or duplicate requests, prior to the occurrence of a Consultation Termination Event, the Directing
Certificateholder will be entitled to reports and information free of charge. Except as otherwise set forth in this paragraph,
until the time definitive certificates are issued, notices and statements required to be mailed to holders of certificates will
be available to Certificate Owners of certificates only to the extent they are forwarded by or otherwise available through DTC
and its Participants. Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Participants, and by Participants to Certificate
Owners, will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from
time to time. Except as otherwise set forth in this paragraph, the master servicer, the special servicer, the trustee, the certificate
administrator and the depositor are required to recognize as Certificateholders only those persons in whose names the certificates
are registered on the books and records of the certificate registrar. The initial registered holder of the certificates will be
Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC.
Â 
Voting
Rights
Â 
At all
times during the term of the PSA, the voting rights for the certificates (the âVoting Rightsâ) will be allocated
among the respective classes of Certificateholders as follows:
Â 
(1)Â Â Â Â Â 2%
in the case of the ClassÂ X Certificates, allocated pro rata, based upon their respective Notional Amounts as of the
date of determination, and
Â 


336
Â 

Â 
(2)Â Â Â Â Â in
the case of any Principal Balance Certificates, a percentage equal to the product of 98% and a fraction, the numerator of
which is equal to the aggregate Certificate Balance (and solely in connection with certain votes relating to the replacement
of the special servicer, operating advisor or asset representations reviewer as described in this prospectus, taking into
account any notional reduction in the Certificate Balance for Appraisal Reduction Amounts allocated to the certificates) of
the class, in each case, determined as of the prior Distribution Date, and the denominator of which is equal to the aggregate
Certificate Balance (and solely in connection with certain votes relating to the replacement of the special servicer and the
operating advisor as described in this prospectus, taking into account any notional reduction in the Certificate Balance for
Appraisal Reduction Amounts allocated to the certificates) of the Principal Balance Certificates, each determined as of the
prior Distribution Date;
Â 
The
Voting Rights of any class of certificates are required to be allocated among Certificateholders of such class in proportion to
their respective Percentage Interests.
Â 
Neither
the ClassÂ V certificates nor the ClassÂ R certificates will be entitled to any Voting Rights.
Â 
Delivery,
Form, Transfer and Denomination
Â 
The
Offered Certificates (other than the ClassÂ X Certificates) will be issued, maintained and transferred in the book-entry form
only in minimum denominations of $10,000 initial Certificate Balance, and in multiples of $1 in excess of $10,000. The ClassÂ X
Certificates will be issued, maintained and transferred only in minimum denominations of authorized initial Notional Amounts of
not less than $1,000,000 and in integral multiples of $1 in excess of $1,000,000.
Â 
Book-Entry
Registration
Â 
The
Offered Certificates will initially be represented by one or more global certificates for each such class registered in the name
of a nominee of The Depository Trust Company (âDTCâ). The depositor has been informed by DTC that DTCâs
nominee will be Cede & Co. No holder of an Offered Certificate will be entitled to receive a certificate issued in fully registered,
certificated form (each, a âDefinitive Certificateâ) representing its interest in such class, except under
the limited circumstances described under ââDefinitive Certificatesâ below. Unless and until Definitive
Certificates are issued, all references to actions by holders of the Offered Certificates will refer to actions taken by DTC upon
instructions received from holders of Offered Certificates through its participating organizations (together with Clearstream
Banking, sociÃ©tÃ© anonyme (âClearstreamâ) and Euroclear Bank, as operator of the Euroclear System
(âEuroclearâ) participating organizations, the âParticipantsâ), and all references in this
prospectus to payments, notices, reports, statements and other information to holders of Offered Certificates will refer to payments,
notices, reports and statements to DTC or Cede & Co., as the registered holder of the Offered Certificates, for distribution
to holders of Offered Certificates through its Participants in accordance with DTC procedures; provided, however,
that to the extent that the party to the PSA responsible for distributing any report, statement or other information has been
provided in writing with the name of the Certificate Owner of such an Offered Certificate (or the prospective transferee of such
Certificate Owner), such report, statement or other information will be provided to such Certificate Owner (or prospective transferee).
Â 
Until
Definitive Certificates are issued in respect of the Offered Certificates, interests in the Offered Certificates will be transferred
on the book-entry records of DTC and its
Â 


337
Â 
Â Â 
Participants. The certificate administrator will initially serve as certificate registrar
for purposes of recording and otherwise providing for the registration of the Offered Certificates.
Â 
Holders
of Offered Certificates may hold their certificates through DTC (in the United States) or Clearstream or Euroclear (in
Europe) if they are Participants of such system, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in such systems.
Clearstream and Euroclear will hold omnibus positions on behalf of the Clearstream Participants and the Euroclear
Participants, respectively, through customersâ securities accounts in Clearstreamâs and Euroclearâs names
on the books of their respective depositaries (collectively, the âDepositariesâ), which in turn will hold
such positions in customersâ securities accounts in the Depositariesâ names on the books of DTC. DTC is a limited
purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a âbanking organizationâ within the meaning of
the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a âclearing corporationâ within the meaning of
the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a âclearing agencyâ registered pursuant to SectionÂ 17A of the
Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its Participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of
securities transactions between Participants through electronic computerized book-entries, thereby eliminating the need for
physical movement of certificates. Participants (âDTC Participantsâ) include securities brokers and
dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations. Indirect access to the DTC system also is available to others such
as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant,
either directly or indirectly (âIndirect Participantsâ).
Â 
Transfers
between DTC Participants will occur in accordance with DTC rules. Transfers between Clearstream Participants and Euroclear Participants
will occur in accordance with the applicable rules and operating procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear.
Â 
Cross-market
transfers between persons holding directly or indirectly through DTC, on the one hand, and directly through Clearstream Participants
or Euroclear Participants, on the other, will be effected in DTC in accordance with DTC rules on behalf of the relevant European
international clearing system by its Depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions
to the relevant European international clearing system by the counterparty in such system in accordance with its rules and procedures
and within its established deadlines (European time). The relevant European international clearing system will, if the transaction
meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its Depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf
by delivering or receiving securities in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day
funds settlement applicable to DTC. Clearstream Participants and Euroclear Participants may not deliver instructions directly
to the Depositaries.
Â 
Because
of time-zone differences, credits of securities in Clearstream or Euroclear as a result of a transaction with a DTC Participant
will be made during the subsequent securities settlement processing, dated the business day following the DTC settlement date,
and such credits or any transactions in such securities settled during such processing will be reported to the relevant Clearstream
Participant or Euroclear Participant on such business day. Cash received in Clearstream or Euroclear as a result of sales of securities
by or through a Clearstream Participant or a Euroclear Participant to a DTC Participant will be received with value on the DTC
settlement date but will be available in the relevant Clearstream or Euroclear cash account only as of the business day following
settlement in DTC.
Â 
The
holders of Offered Certificates that are not Participants or Indirect Participants but desire to purchase, sell or otherwise transfer
ownership of, or other interests in, such
Â 


338
Â 
Â Â 
Offered
Certificates may do so only through Participants and Indirect Participants. In addition, holders of Offered Certificates in
global form (âCertificate Ownersâ) will receive all distributions of principal and interest through the
Participants who in turn will receive them from DTC. Under a book-entry format, holders of such Offered Certificates may
experience some delay in their receipt of payments, since such payments will be forwarded by the certificate administrator to
Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC. DTC will forward such payments to its Participants, which thereafter will forward them to
Indirect Participants or the applicable Certificate Owners. Certificate Owners will not be recognized by the trustee, the
certificate administrator, the certificate registrar, the operating advisor, the special servicer or the master servicer as
holders of record of certificates and Certificate Owners will be permitted to receive information furnished to
Certificateholders and to exercise the rights of Certificateholders only indirectly through DTC and its Participants and
Indirect Participants, except that Certificate Owners will be entitled to receive or have access to notices and information
and to exercise certain rights as holders of beneficial interests in the certificates through the certificate administrator
and the trustee to the extent described in ââReports to Certificateholders; Certain Available
Informationâ, ââCertificateholder Communicationâ and ââList of
Certificateholdersâ and âPooling and Servicing AgreementâThe Operating Advisorâ, ââThe
Asset Representations Reviewerâ, ââReplacement of Special Servicer Without Causeâ,
ââLimitation on Rights of Certificateholders to Institute a Proceedingâ, ââTermination;
Retirement of Certificatesâ and ââResignation and Removal of the Trustee and the Certificate
Administratorâ.
Â 
Under
the rules, regulations and procedures creating and affecting DTC and its operations (the âDTC Rulesâ), DTC
is required to make book-entry transfers of Offered Certificates in global form among Participants on whose behalf it acts with
respect to such Offered Certificates and to receive and transmit distributions of principal of, and interest on, such Offered
Certificates. Participants and Indirect Participants with which the Certificate Owners have accounts with respect to the Offered
Certificates similarly are required to make book-entry transfers and receive and transmit such payments on behalf of their respective
Certificate Owners. Accordingly, although the Certificate Owners will not possess the Offered Certificates, the DTC Rules provide
a mechanism by which Certificate Owners will receive payments on Offered Certificates and will be able to transfer their interest.
Â 
Because
DTC can only act on behalf of Participants, who in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants and certain banks, the ability
of a holder of Offered Certificates in global form to pledge such Offered Certificates to persons or entities that do not participate
in the DTC system, or to otherwise act with respect to such Offered Certificates, may be limited due to the lack of a physical
certificate for such Offered Certificates.
Â 
DTC
has advised the depositor that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of an Offered Certificate under the PSA
only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose accounts with DTC such certificate is credited. DTC may take conflicting
actions with respect to other undivided interests to the extent that such actions are taken on behalf of Participants whose holdings
include such undivided interests.
Â 
Clearstream
is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and is a global securities settlement clearing house. Clearstream holds securities
for its participating organizations (âClearstream Participantsâ) and facilitates the clearance and settlement
of securities transactions between Clearstream Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of Clearstream Participants,
thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates. Transactions may be settled in Clearstream in numerous currencies,
including United States dollars. Clearstream provides to its Clearstream Participants, among other things, services for safekeeping,
administration, clearance and settlement of internationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing. Clearstream
interfaces with domestic

Â 
Â Â 
markets in several countries. Clearstream is regulated as a bank by the Luxembourg Monetary Institute.
Clearstream Participants are recognized financial institutions around the world, including underwriters, securities brokers and
dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations and may include the underwriters. Indirect
access to Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain
a custodial relationship with a Clearstream Participant, either directly or indirectly.

Â 
Euroclear
was created in 1968 to hold securities for participants of the Euroclear system (âEuroclear Participantsâ)
and to clear and settle transactions between Euroclear Participants through simultaneous electronic book-entry delivery against
payment, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates and any risk from lack of simultaneous transfers of
securities and cash. Transactions may now be settled in any of numerous currencies, including United States dollars. The Euroclear
system includes various other services, including securities lending and borrowing and interfaces with domestic markets in several
countries generally similar to the arrangements for cross-market transfers with DTC described above. Euroclear is operated by
Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. (the âEuroclear Operatorâ). All operations are conducted by the Euroclear Operator,
and all Euroclear securities clearance accounts and Euroclear cash accounts are accounts with the Euroclear Operator. Euroclear
Participants include banks (including central banks), securities brokers and dealers and other professional financial intermediaries
and may include the underwriters. Indirect access to the Euroclear system is also available to other firms that clear through
or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear Participant, either directly or indirectly.
Â 
Securities
clearance accounts and cash accounts with the Euroclear Operator are governed by the Terms and Conditions Governing Use of Euroclear
and the related operating procedures of the Euroclear System and applicable Belgian law (collectively, the âTerms and
Conditionsâ). The Terms and Conditions govern transfers of securities and cash within the Euroclear system, withdrawal
of securities and cash from the Euroclear system, and receipts of payments with respect to securities in the Euroclear system.
All securities in the Euroclear system are held on a fungible basis without attribution of specific certificates to specific securities
clearance accounts. The Euroclear Operator acts under the Terms and Conditions only on behalf of Euroclear Participants and has
no record of or relationship with persons holding through Euroclear Participants.
Â 
Although
DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have implemented the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in book-entry
securities among Participants of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform or to continue to comply
with such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time. None of the depositor, the trustee, the certificate
administrator, the master servicer, the special servicer or the underwriters will have any responsibility for the performance
by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective direct or indirect Participants of their respective obligations under the
rules and procedures governing their operations.

pursuant to binding escrow instructions executed by an authorized representative of the title company) to issue such title insurance
policy;

the Diligence File will be required to include a statement to that effect. No information that is proprietary to the related originator

File. It is generally not required to include any of the same items identified above again if such items have
Â 


346
Â 
Â Â 
already
been included under another clause of the definition of Diligence File, and the Diligence File will be required to include a
statement to that effect. The mortgage loan seller may, without any obligation to do so, include such other documents or
information as part of the Diligence File that such mortgage loan seller believes should be included to enable the asset
representations reviewer to perform the Asset Review on such Mortgage Loan; provided that such documents or
information are clearly labeled and identified.
Â 
Each
MLPA will contain certain representations and warranties of the applicable mortgage loan seller with respect to each Mortgage
Loan sold by that mortgage loan seller. Those representations and warranties are set forth in Annex D-1, and will be made as of
the Closing Date, or as of another date specifically provided in the representation and warranty, subject to certain exceptions
to such representations and warranties as set forth in Annex D-2.
Â 
If any
of the documents required to be included in the Mortgage File for any Mortgage Loan is missing from the Mortgage File or defective
or if there is a breach of a representation or warranty relating to any Mortgage Loan, and, in either case, such omission, defect
or breach materially and adversely affects the value of the related Mortgage Loan, the value of the related Mortgaged Property
or the interests of any Certificateholders in the Mortgage Loan or Mortgaged Property or causes the Mortgage Loan to be other
than a âqualified mortgageâ within the meaning of Code SectionÂ 860G(a)(3), but without regard to the rule of
Treasury Regulations SectionÂ 1.860G-2(f)(2) that causes a defective obligation to be treated as a âqualified mortgageâ
(a âMaterial Defectâ), the applicable mortgage loan seller will be required to, no later than 90 days following:
Â 
(x)	such
mortgage loan sellerâs discovery of the Material Defect or receipt of notice of the Material Defect from any party to the
PSA (a âBreach Noticeâ), except in the case of the following clauseÂ (y); or
Â 
(y)	in
the case of such Material Defect that would cause the Mortgage Loan not to be a âqualified mortgageâ within the meaning
of Code SectionÂ 860G(a)(3), but without regard to the rule of Treasury regulations SectionÂ 1.860G-2(f)(2) that causes
a defective obligation to be treated as a qualified mortgage, the earlier of (A) discovery by the related Mortgage Loan Seller
or any party to the PSA of such Material Defect, or (B) receipt of a Breach Notice by the mortgage loan seller,
Â Â 
(A)	cure
such Material Defect in all material respects, at its own expense,
Â 
(B)	repurchase
the affected Mortgage Loan or REO Loan at the Purchase Price, or
Â 
(C)	substitute
a Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan (other than with respect to the Whole Loans, as applicable, for which no substitution will
be permitted) for such affected Mortgage Loan, and pay a shortfall amount in connection with such substitution;
Â 
provided that no such
substitution may occur on or after the second anniversary of the Closing Date; provided, however, that the applicable mortgage
loan seller will generally have an additional 90-day period to cure such Material Defect (or, failing such cure, to repurchase
the affected Mortgage Loan or REO Loan or, if applicable, substitute a Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan (other than with respect
to the related Whole Loans, for which no substitution will be permitted), if it is diligently proceeding toward that cure, and
has delivered to the master servicer, the special servicer, the certificate administrator (who will promptly deliver a copy of
such officerâs certificate to the 17g-5 Information Provider), the trustee, the operating advisor and, prior to the occurrence
of a Consultation Termination Event, the Directing Certificateholder, an officerâs certificate that describes the reasons
that
Â 


347
Â 
Â Â 
a cure was not effected
within the initial 90-day period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there will be no such 90-day extension if such Material
Defect would cause the related Mortgage Loan not to be a âqualified mortgageâ within the meaning of Code Section
860G(a)(3), but without regard to the rule of Treasury regulations Section 1.860G-2(f)(2) that causes a defective Mortgage
Loan to be treated as a qualified mortgage.
Â 
No delay
in either the discovery of a Material Defect or in providing notice of such Material Defect will relieve the applicable mortgage
loan seller of its obligation to repurchase the related Mortgage Loan unless (i) the mortgage loan seller did not otherwise discover
or have knowledge of such Material Defect and (ii) such delay is the result of the failure by a party to the PSA to promptly provide
a notice of such Material Defect as required by the terms of the MLPA or the PSA after such party has actual knowledge of such
defect or breach (knowledge will not be deemed to exist by reason of the custodianâs exception report) and such delay precludes
the mortgage loan seller from curing such Material Defect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Mortgage Loan is not secured by
a Mortgaged Property that is, in whole or in part, a hotel, restaurant (operated by a borrower), healthcare facility, nursing
home, assisted living facility, self storage facility, theater or fitness center (operated by a borrower), then the failure to
deliver copies of the UCC financing statements with respect to such Mortgage Loan will not be a Material Defect.
Â 
If there
is a Material Defect with respect to one or more Mortgaged Properties with respect to a Mortgage Loan, the applicable mortgage
loan seller will not be obligated to repurchase the Mortgage Loan if (i) the affected Mortgaged Property may be released pursuant
to the terms of any partial release provisions in the related Mortgage Loan documents (and such Mortgaged Property is, in fact,
released), (ii) the remaining Mortgaged Property(ies) satisfy the requirements, if any, set forth in the Mortgage Loan documents
and the applicable mortgage loan seller provides an opinion of counsel to the effect that such release would not (A)Â endanger
the status of any Trust REMIC as a REMIC or (B)Â result in the imposition of a tax upon any Trust REMIC or the issuing entity
and (iii) each applicable Rating Agency has provided a Rating Agency Confirmation.
Â 
Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in lieu of a mortgage loan seller repurchasing, substituting or curing such Material Defect, to the extent that
the mortgage loan seller and the special servicer (with the consent of the Directing Certificateholder in respect of any Mortgage
Loan that is not an Excluded Loan and for so long as no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing) are able to
agree upon a cash payment payable by the mortgage loan seller to the issuing entity that would be deemed sufficient to compensate
the issuing entity for such Material Defect (a âLoss of Value Paymentâ), the mortgage loan seller may elect,
in its sole discretion, to pay such Loss of Value Payment. Upon its making such payment, the mortgage loan seller will be deemed
to have cured such Material Defect in all respects. A Loss of Value Payment may not be made with respect to any such Material
Defect that would cause the applicable Mortgage Loan not to be a âqualified mortgageâ within the meaning of Code Section
860G(a)(3), but without regard to the rule of Treasury regulations Section 1.860G-2(f)(2) that causes a defective Mortgage Loan
to be treated as a qualified mortgage.
Â 
In addition,
the MLPA provides that, with respect to any Non-Serviced Whole Loan, if a material document defect exists under the related Non-Serviced
PSA, and the related seller repurchases the related Non-Serviced Companion Loan from the related Non-Serviced Securitization Trust,
such seller is required to repurchase the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan; provided, however, that no such repurchase
obligation will apply to any material document defect related solely to the promissory notes for any Pari Passu Companion Loan
contained in the related Non-Serviced Securitization Trust.
Â 


348
Â 
Â Â 
With
respect to any Mortgage Loan, the âPurchase Priceâ equals to the sum of (1) the outstanding principal balance
of such Mortgage Loan (or related REO Loan (excluding, for such purpose, the related Companion Loan, if applicable)), as of the
date of purchase, (2) all accrued and unpaid interest on the Mortgage Loan (or any related REO Loan (excluding, for such purpose,
the related Companion Loan, if applicable)) at the related Mortgage Rate in effect from time to time (excluding any portion of
such interest that represents default interest or Excess Interest on the ARD Loan), to, but not including, the due date immediately
preceding or coinciding with the Determination Date for the Collection Period of purchase, (3) all related unreimbursed Servicing
Advances plus accrued and unpaid interest on all related Advances at the Reimbursement Rate, Special Servicing Fees (whether paid
or unpaid) and any other additional trust fund expenses (except for Liquidation Fees) in respect of such Mortgage Loan or related
REO Loan (excluding, for such purposes, any Companion Loan, if any), (4) solely in the case of a repurchase or substitution by
a mortgage loan seller, all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred or to be incurred by the master servicer, the
special servicer, the depositor, the certificate administrator, asset representations reviewer or the trustee in respect of the
omission, breach or defect giving rise to the repurchase or substitution obligation, including any expenses arising out of the
enforcement of the repurchase or substitution obligation, including, without limitation, legal fees and expenses and any additional
trust fund expenses relating to such Mortgage Loan or related REO Loan; provided, however, that such out-of-pocket
expenses will not include expenses incurred by investors in instituting an Asset Review Vote Election, in taking part in an Asset
Review Vote or in utilizing the dispute resolution provisions described below under ââDispute Resolution Provisionsâ,
and (5) Liquidation Fees, if any, payable with respect to the affected Mortgage Loan or related REO Loan (which will not include
any Liquidation Fees if such affected Mortgage Loan is repurchased prior to the expiration of the additional 90-day period immediately
following the initial 90-day period).
Â 
A âQualified
Substitute Mortgage Loanâ is a substitute mortgage loan (other than with respect to the Whole Loans, for which
no substitution will be permitted) replacing a Mortgage Loan with respect to which a material breach or document defect exists
that must, on the date of substitution:
Â 
(a)	have
an outstanding principal balance, after application of all scheduled payments of principal and interest due during or prior to
the month of substitution, whether or not received, not in excess of the Stated Principal Balance of the removed Mortgage Loan
as of the due date in the calendar month during which the substitution occurs;
Â 
(b)	have
a fixed Mortgage Rate not less than the Mortgage Rate of the removed Mortgage Loan (determined without regard to any prior modification,
waiver or amendment of the terms of the removed Mortgage Loan);
Â 
(c)	have
the same due date and a grace period no longer than that of the removed Mortgage Loan;
Â 
(d)	accrue
interest on the same basis as the removed Mortgage Loan (for example, on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day
months);
Â 
(e)	have
a remaining term to stated maturity not greater than, and not more than two years less than, the remaining term to stated maturity
of the removed Mortgage Loan;
Â 


349
Â 
Â Â 
(f)	have
a then-current loan-to-value ratio equal to or less than the lesser of (i)Â the loan-to-value ratio for the removed
Mortgage Loan as of the Closing Date and (ii)Â 75%, in each case using a âvalueâ for the Mortgaged Property
as determined using an appraisal conducted by a member of the Appraisal Institute (âMAIâ) prepared in
accordance with the requirements of the FIRREA;
Â 
(g)	comply
as of the date of substitution in all material respects with all of the representations and warranties set forth in the related
MLPA;
Â 
(h)	have
an environmental report that indicates no material adverse environmental conditions with respect to the related Mortgaged Property
and that will be delivered as a part of the related Mortgage File;
Â 
(i)	have
a then-current DSCR at least equal to the greater of (i)Â the original DSCR of the removed Mortgage Loan as of the Closing
Date and (ii)Â 1.25x;
Â 
(j)	constitute
a âqualified replacement mortgageâ within the meaning of Code SectionÂ 860G(a)(4) as evidenced by an opinion of
counsel (provided at the related mortgage loan sellerâs expense);
Â 
(k)	not
have a maturity date or an amortization period that extends to a date that is after the date five years prior to the Rated Final
Distribution Date;
Â 
(l)	have
comparable prepayment restrictions to those of the removed Mortgage Loan;
Â 
(m)	not
be substituted for a removed Mortgage Loan unless the trustee and the certificate administrator have received a Rating Agency
Confirmation from each of the Rating Agencies (the cost, if any, of obtaining such Rating Agency Confirmation to be paid by the
related mortgage loan seller);
Â 
(n)	have
been approved, so long as no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing and the affected Mortgage Loan is not an
Excluded Loan, by the Directing Certificateholder;
Â 
(o)	prohibit
Defeasance within two years of the Closing Date;
Â 
(p)	not
be substituted for a removed Mortgage Loan if it would result in the termination of the REMIC status of any Trust REMIC or the
imposition of tax on any Trust REMIC other than a tax on income expressly permitted or contemplated to be imposed by the terms
of the PSA, as determined by an opinion of counsel at the cost of the related mortgage loan seller;
Â 
(q)	have
an engineering report that indicates no material adverse property condition or deferred maintenance with respect to the related
Mortgaged Property that will be delivered as a part of the related servicing file; and
Â 
(r)	be
current in the payment of all scheduled payments of principal and interest then due.
Â 
In the
event that more than one Mortgage Loan is substituted for a removed Mortgage Loan or Mortgage Loans, then (x) the amounts described
in clause (a) are required to be determined on the basis of aggregate principal balances and (y) each such proposed Qualified
Substitute Mortgage Loan must individually satisfy each of the requirements specified in clauses (b) through (r) of the preceding
sentence, except (z) the rates described


350
Â 
Â 
in
clause (b) above and the remaining term to stated maturity referred to in clause (e) above are required to be determined on a
weighted average basis, provided that no individual Mortgage Rate (net of the Servicing Fee Rate, the Certificate Administrator/Trustee
Fee Rate, the Operating Advisor Fee Rate and the Asset Representations Reviewer Fee Rate) may be lower than the highest fixed
Pass-Through Rate (not based on or subject to a cap equal to or based on the WAC Rate) of any class of Principal Balance Certificates
having a principal balance then-outstanding. When a Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan is substituted for a removed Mortgage Loan,
the applicable mortgage loan seller will be required to certify that the Mortgage Loan meets all of the requirements of the above
definition and send the certification to the trustee the certificate administrator and, prior to the occurrence of a Consultation
Termination Event, the Directing Certificateholder.
Â 
The
foregoing repurchase or substitution obligation or the obligation to pay the Loss of Value Payment will constitute the sole remedy
available to the Certificateholders and the trustee under the PSA for any uncured breach of any mortgage loan sellerâs representations
and warranties regarding the Mortgage Loans or any uncured document defect; provided, however, that if any breach pertains
to a representation or warranty that the related Mortgage Loan documents or any particular Mortgage Loan document requires the
related borrower to bear the costs and expenses associated with any particular action or matter under such Mortgage Loan document(s),
then the applicable mortgage loan seller may cure such breach within the applicable cure period (as the same may be extended)
by reimbursing the issuing entity (by wire transfer of immediately available funds) for (i) the reasonable amount of any such
costs and expenses incurred by parties to the PSA or the issuing entity that are incurred as a result of such breach and have
not been reimbursed by the related borrower and (ii) the amount of any fees of the asset representations reviewer attributable
to the Asset Review of such Mortgage Loan; provided, further, that in the event any such costs and expenses exceed
$10,000, the applicable mortgage loan seller will have the option to either repurchase or substitute for the related Mortgage
Loan as provided above or pay such costs and expenses. The applicable mortgage loan seller will remit the amount of these costs
and expenses and upon its making such remittance, the applicable mortgage loan seller will be deemed to have cured the breach
in all respects. The applicable mortgage loan seller will be the sole warranting party in respect of the Mortgage Loans sold by
that mortgage loan seller to the depositor, and none of its affiliates (other than the respective guarantor) and no other person
will be obligated to repurchase or replace any affected Mortgage Loan or make a Loss of Value Payment in connection with a breach
of any representation and warranty or in connection with a document defect if the applicable mortgage loan seller defaults on
its obligation to do so.
Â 
Dispute
Resolution Provisions
Â 
The
mortgage loan seller will be subject to the dispute resolution provisions described under âPooling and Servicing AgreementâDispute
Resolution Provisionsâ to the extent those provisions are triggered with respect to any mortgage loan sold to the depositor
by the mortgage loan seller and will be obligated under the related MLPA to comply with all applicable provisions and to take
part in any mediation or arbitration proceedings that may result.
Â 
Asset
Review Obligations
Â 
The
mortgage loan seller will be obligated to perform its obligations described under âPooling and Servicing AgreementâThe
Asset Representations ReviewerâAsset Reviewâ
Â 


351
Â 
Â 
relating
to any Asset Reviews performed by the asset representations reviewer, and the mortgage loan seller will have the rights described
under that heading.
Â 
Pooling
and Servicing Agreement
Â 
General
Â 
The
servicing and administration of the Mortgage Loans (other than any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan), any related Serviced Pari Passu
Companion Loans and any related REO Properties (including any interest of the holder of any Companion Loan in the REO Property
acquired with respect to any Serviced Whole Loan) will be governed by the PSA and any related Intercreditor Agreement.
Â 
Each
Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, the related Non-Serviced Companion Loan and any related REO Properties (including the issuing entityâs
interest in REO Property acquired with respect to a Non-Serviced Whole Loan) will be serviced by the related Non-Serviced Master
Servicer and the related Non-Serviced Special Servicer under the related Non-Serviced PSA in accordance with such Non-Serviced
PSA and the related Intercreditor Agreement. Unless otherwise specifically stated and except where the context otherwise indicates
(such as with respect to P&I Advances), discussions in this section or in any other section of this prospectus regarding the
servicing and administration of the Mortgage Loans should be deemed to include the servicing and administration of the related
Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loans but not to include any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, any Non-Serviced Companion Loan and any
related REO Property.
Â 
The
following summaries describe certain provisions of the PSA relating to the servicing and administration of the Mortgage Loans
(excluding each Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan), the related Companion Loans and any related REO Properties. In the case of each Serviced
Whole Loan, certain provisions of the related Intercreditor Agreement are described under âDescription of the Mortgage
PoolâThe Whole LoansâThe Serviced Pari Passu Whole Loansâ.
Â 
Certain
provisions of each Non-Serviced PSA relating to the servicing and administration of the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, the
related Non-Serviced Companion Loan, the related REO Properties and the related Intercreditor Agreement are summarized under âDescription
of the Mortgage PoolâThe Whole Loansâ and ââServicing of the Non-Serviced Mortgage
Loansâ below.
Â 
Assignment
of the Mortgage Loans
Â 
The
depositor will purchase the Mortgage Loans to be included in the issuing entity on or before the Closing Date from each of the
mortgage loan sellers pursuant to separate MLPAs. See âTransaction PartiesâThe Sponsors and Mortgage Loan Sellersâ
and âDescription of the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreementsâ.
Â 
On
the Closing Date, the depositor will sell, transfer or otherwise convey, assign or cause the assignment of the Mortgage Loans,
without recourse, together with the depositorâs rights and remedies against the mortgage loan sellers under the MLPAs, to
the trustee for the benefit of the holders of the certificates. On or prior to the Closing Date, the depositor will require each
mortgage loan seller to deliver to the certificate administrator, in its capacity as custodian, the Mortgage Notes and certain
other documents and instruments with respect to each Mortgage Loan (other than any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Whole
Loan. The custodian will hold such documents in the name of the issuing
Â 


352
Â 
Â 
entity
for the benefit of the holders of the certificates. The custodian is obligated to review certain documents for each Mortgage Loan
within 60 days of the Closing Date and report any missing documents or certain types of document defects to the parties to the
PSA and the Directing Certificateholder (so long as no Consultation Termination Event has occurred and other than in respect of
an Excluded Loan) and the related mortgage loan seller.
Â 
In
addition, pursuant to the related MLPA, each mortgage loan seller will be required to deliver the Diligence Files for each of
its Mortgage Loans to the depositor by uploading such Diligence Files to the designated website within 60 days following the Closing
Date, and the depositor will deliver to the certificate administrator an electronic copy of such Diligence Files to be posted
to the secure data room.
Â 
Pursuant
to the PSA, the depositor will assign to the trustee for the benefit of Certificateholders the representations and warranties
made by the mortgage loan sellers to the depositor in the MLPAs and any rights and remedies that the depositor has against the
mortgage loan sellers under the MLPAs with respect to any Material Defect. See ââEnforcement of Mortgage Loan Sellerâs
Obligations Under the MLPAâ below and âDescription of the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreementsâ.
Â 
Servicing
Standard
Â 
The
master servicer and the special servicer will each be required to diligently service and administer the Mortgage Loans (excluding
each Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan), any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loans and the related REO Properties (other than any
REO Property related to a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan), for which it is responsible in accordance with applicable law, the terms
of the PSA, the Mortgage Loan documents, and the related Intercreditor Agreements and, to the extent consistent with the foregoing,
in accordance with the higher of the following standards of care: (1)Â the same manner in which, and with the same care, skill,
prudence and diligence with which the master servicer or the special servicer, as the case may be, services and administers similar
mortgage loans for other third-party portfolios, and (2)Â the same care, skill, prudence and diligence with which the master
servicer or special servicer, as the case may be, services and administers similar mortgage loans owned by the master servicer
or the special servicer, as the case may be, with a view to: (A)Â the timely recovery of all payments of principal and interest
under the Mortgage Loans or Serviced Whole Loans or (B)Â in the case of a Specially Serviced Loan or an REO Property, the
maximization of recovery of principal and interest on a net present value basis on the Mortgage Loans and any related Serviced
Pari Passu Companion Loans, and the best interests of the issuing entity and the certificateholders (as a collective whole as
if such Certificateholders constituted a single lender) (and, in the case of any Whole Loan, the best interests of the issuing
entity, the Certificateholders and the holder of the related Companion Loan (as a collective whole as if such Certificateholders
and the holder or holders of the related Companion Loan constituted a single lender), taking into account the pari passu
nature of the related Companion Loan), as determined by the master servicer or the special servicer, as the case may be, in its
reasonable judgment, in either case giving due consideration to the customary and usual standards of practice of prudent, institutional
commercial, multifamily and manufactured housing community mortgage loan servicers, but without regard to any conflict of interest
arising from:
Â 
(A)Â Â Â Â Â any
relationship that the master servicer or the special servicer, as the case may be, or any of their respective affiliates, may
have with any of the underlying borrowers, the sponsors, the mortgage loan sellers, the originators, any party to the PSA or any
affiliate of the foregoing;
Â 


353
Â 
Â 
(B)Â Â Â Â Â the
ownership of any certificate (or any interest in any Companion Loan, mezzanine loan or subordinate debt relating to a Mortgage
Loan) by the master servicer or special servicer, as the case may be, or any of their respective affiliates;
Â 
(C)Â Â Â Â Â the
obligation, if any, of the master servicer to make advances;
Â 
(D)Â Â Â Â Â the
right of the master servicer or the special servicer, as the case may be, or any of its affiliates to receive compensation or
reimbursement of costs under the PSA generally or with respect to any particular transaction;
Â 
(E)Â Â Â Â Â the
ownership, servicing or management for others of (i)Â a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan and a Non-Serviced Companion Loan or (ii)Â any
other mortgage loans, subordinate debt, mezzanine loans or properties not covered by the PSA or held by the issuing entity by
the master servicer or special servicer, as the case may be, or any of its affiliates;
Â 
(F)Â Â Â Â Â any
debt that the master servicer or the special servicer, as the case may be, or any of its affiliates, has extended to any underlying
borrower or an affiliate of any borrower (including, without limitation, any mezzanine financing);
Â 
(G)Â Â Â Â Â any
option to purchase any Mortgage Loan or the related Companion Loan the master servicer or special servicer, as the case may be,
or any of its affiliates, may have; and
Â 
(H)Â Â Â Â Â any
obligation of the master servicer or the special servicer, or any of their respective affiliates, to repurchase or substitute
for a Mortgage Loan as a mortgage loan seller (if the master servicer or the special servicer or any of their respective affiliates
is a mortgage loan seller) (the foregoing, collectively referred to as the âServicing Standardâ).
Â 
All
net present value calculations and determinations made under the PSA with respect to any Mortgage Loan, Mortgaged Property or
REO Property (including for purposes of the definition of âServicing Standardâ set forth above) will be made in accordance
with the Mortgage Loan documents or, in the event the Mortgage Loan documents are silent, by using a discount rate (i)Â for
principal and interest payments on the Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan or sale by the special servicer of
a Defaulted Loan, the highest of (1)Â the rate determined by the master servicer or special servicer, as applicable, that
approximates the market rate that would be obtainable by the related borrower on similar non-defaulted debt of such borrower as
of such date of determination, (2)Â the Mortgage Rate and (3)Â the yield on 10-year U.S. treasuries as of such date of
determination and (ii)Â for all other cash flows, including property cash flow, the âdiscount rateâ set forth
in the most recent appraisal (or updated appraisal) of the related Mortgaged Property.
Â 
In
the case of each Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, the master servicer and special servicer will be required to act in accordance with
the Servicing Standard with respect to any action required to be taken regarding such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan pursuant to their
respective obligations under the PSA.
Â 
Subservicing
Â 
The
master servicer and the special servicer may delegate and/or assign some or all of their respective servicing obligations and
duties with respect to some or all of the Mortgage Loans (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) and the Serviced Pari Passu
Companion Loans to one or more third-party sub-servicers, provided that the master servicer and the
Â 


354
Â 
Â 
special
servicer, as applicable, will remain obligated under the PSA. A sub-servicer may be an affiliate of the depositor, the master
servicer or the special servicer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the special servicer may not enter into any sub-servicing agreement
which provides for the performance by third parties of any or all of its obligations under the PSA without, with respect to any
Mortgage Loan other than an Excluded Loan and prior to the occurrence and continuance of a Control Termination Event, the consent
of the Directing Certificateholder, except to the extent necessary for the special servicer to comply with applicable regulatory
requirements.
Â 
Each
sub-servicing agreement between the master servicer or special servicer and a sub-servicer (a âSub-Servicing Agreementâ)
will generally be required to provide that (i)Â if for any reason the master servicer or special servicer, as applicable,
is no longer acting in that capacity (including, without limitation, by reason of a Servicer Termination Event), the trustee or
any successor master servicer or special servicer, as applicable, may, except with respect to certain initial Sub-Servicing Agreements,
assume or terminate such partyâs rights and obligations under such Sub-Servicing Agreement and (ii)Â the sub-servicer
will be in default under such Sub-Servicing Agreement and such Sub-Servicing Agreement will be terminated (following the expiration
of any applicable grace period) if the sub-servicer fails (A) to deliver by the due date any Exchange Act reporting items required
to be delivered to the master servicer, the certificate administrator or the depositor pursuant to the PSA or such Sub-Servicing
Agreement or to the master servicer under any other pooling and servicing agreement that the depositor is a party to, or (B) to
perform in any material respect any of its covenants or obligations contained in such Sub-Servicing Agreement regarding creating,
obtaining or delivering any Exchange Act reporting items required in order for any party to the PSA to perform its obligations
under the PSA or under the Exchange Act reporting requirements of any other pooling and servicing agreement that the depositor
is a party to. The master servicer or special servicer, as applicable, will be required to monitor the performance of sub-servicers
retained by it and will have the right to remove a sub-servicer retained by it at any time it considers removal to be in the best
interests of Certificateholders. However, no sub-servicer will be permitted under any Sub-Servicing Agreement to make material
servicing decisions, such as loan modifications or determinations as to the manner or timing of enforcing remedies under the Mortgage
Loan documents, without the consent of the master servicer or special servicer, as applicable.
Â 
Generally,
the master servicer will be solely liable for all fees owed by it to any sub-servicer retained by the master servicer, without
regard to whether the master servicerâs compensation pursuant to the PSA is sufficient to pay those fees. Each sub-servicer
will be required to be reimbursed by the master servicer for certain expenditures which such sub-servicer makes, only to the same
extent the master servicer is reimbursed under the PSA.
Â 
Advances
Â 
P&I
Advances
Â 
On
the business day immediately preceding each Distribution Date (the âMaster Servicer Remittance Dateâ), except
as otherwise described below, the master servicer will be obligated to make advances (each, a âP&I Advanceâ)
out of its own funds or, subject to the replacement of those funds as provided in the PSA, certain funds held in the Collection
Account that are not required to be part of the Available Funds for that Distribution Date, in an amount equal to (but subject
to reduction as described below) the aggregate of:
Â 
(1)Â Â Â Â Â all
Periodic Payments (other than balloon payments) (net of any applicable Servicing Fees) that were due on the Mortgage Loans (including
any Non-Serviced Mortgage
Â 


355
Â 
Â 
Loan)
and any REO Loan (other than any portion of an REO Loan related to a Companion Loan) during the related Collection Period and
not received as of the business day preceding the Master Servicer Remittance Date; and
Â 
(2)Â Â Â Â Â in
the case of each Mortgage Loan delinquent in respect of its balloon payment as of the Master Servicer Remittance Date (including
any REO Loan (other than any portion of an REO Loan related to a Companion Loan) as to which the balloon payment would have been
past due), an amount equal to its Assumed Scheduled Payment.
Â 
The
master servicerâs obligations to make P&I Advances in respect of any Mortgage Loan (including any Non-Serviced Mortgage
Loan) or REO Loan (other than any portion of a REO Loan related to a Companion Loan) will continue, except if a determination
as to non-recoverability is made, through and up to liquidation of the Mortgage Loan or disposition of the REO Property, as the
case may be. To the extent that the master servicer fails to make a P&I Advance that it is required to make under the PSA,
the trustee will be required to make the required P&I Advance in accordance with the terms of the PSA.
Â 
If
an Appraisal Reduction Amount has been determined with respect to any Mortgage Loan (or, in the case of a Non-Serviced Whole Loan,
an appraisal reduction has been made in accordance with the related Non-Serviced PSA and the master servicer has notice of such
appraisal reduction amount) and such Mortgage Loan experiences subsequent delinquencies, then the interest portion of any P&I
Advance in respect of that Mortgage Loan for the related Distribution Date will be reduced (there will be no reduction in the
principal portion, if any, of such P&I Advance) to equal the product of (x)Â the amount of the interest portion of the
P&I Advance for that Mortgage Loan for the related Distribution Date without regard to this sentence, and (y)Â a fraction,
expressed as a percentage, the numerator of which is equal to the Stated Principal Balance of that Mortgage Loan immediately prior
to the related Distribution Date, net of the related Appraisal Reduction Amount (or, in the case of any Whole Loan, the portion
of such Appraisal Reduction Amount allocated to the related Mortgage Loan), if any, and the denominator of which is equal to the
Stated Principal Balance of that Mortgage Loan immediately prior to the related Distribution Date.
Â 
Neither
the master servicer nor the trustee will be required to make a P&I Advance for a balloon payment, default interest, late payment
charges, Yield Maintenance Charges, Prepayment Premiums or Excess Interest or with respect to any Companion Loan.
Â 
Servicing
Advances
Â 
In
addition to P&I Advances, except as otherwise described under ââRecovery of Advancesâ below and except
in certain limited circumstances described below, the master servicer will also be obligated (subject to the limitations described
in this prospectus), to make advances (âServicing Advancesâ and, collectively with P&I Advances, âAdvancesâ)
in connection with the servicing and administration of any Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) and related
Companion Loan, as applicable, in respect of which a default, delinquency or other unanticipated event has occurred or is reasonably
foreseeable, or, in connection with the servicing and administration of any Mortgaged Property securing a Mortgage Loan (other
than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or REO Property (other than REO Property related to a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan), in order
to pay delinquent real estate taxes, assessments and hazard insurance premiums and to cover other similar costs and expenses necessary
to preserve the priority of or enforce the related Mortgage Loan documents or to protect, lease, manage and maintain the related
Mortgaged Property. To the extent that the master servicer fails to make a Servicing Advance that it is required to make under
the PSA and the trustee has received notice or otherwise has actual
Â 


356
Â 
Â 
knowledge
of this failure, the trustee will be required to make the required Servicing Advance in accordance with the terms of the PSA.
Â 
However,
none of the master servicer, the special servicer or the trustee will make any Servicing Advance in connection with the exercise
of any cure rights or purchase rights granted to the holder of a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan under the related Intercreditor
Agreement or the PSA.
Â 
The
special servicer will have no obligation to make any Servicing Advances. However, in an urgent or emergency situation requiring
the making of a Servicing Advance, the special servicer may make such Servicing Advance, and the master servicer will be required
to reimburse the special servicer for such Advance (with interest on that Advance) within a specified number of days as set forth
in the PSA, unless such Advance is determined to be nonrecoverable by the master servicer in its reasonable judgment (in which
case it will be reimbursed out of the collection account). Once the special servicer is reimbursed, the master servicer will be
deemed to have made the special servicerâs Servicing Advance as of the date made by the special servicer, and will be entitled
to reimbursement with interest on that Advance in accordance with the terms of the PSA.
Â 
No
Servicing Advances will be made with respect to any Serviced Whole Loan if the related Mortgage Loan is no longer held by the
issuing entity or if such Serviced Whole Loan is no longer serviced under the PSA and no Servicing Advances will be made for any
Non-Serviced Whole Loans under the PSA. Any requirement of the master servicer or the trustee to make an Advance in the PSA is
intended solely to provide liquidity for the benefit of the Certificateholders and not as credit support or otherwise to impose
on any such person the risk of loss with respect to one or more Mortgage Loans or the related Companion Loan.
Â 
The
master servicer will also be obligated to make Servicing Advances with respect to Serviced Whole Loans. With respect to a Non-Serviced
Whole Loan, the applicable servicer under the related Non-Serviced PSA will be obligated to make property protection advances
with respect to such Non-Serviced Whole Loans. See ââServicing of the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loansâ below
and âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâThe Whole LoansâThe Non-Serviced Pari Passu Whole Loansâ.
Â 
Nonrecoverable
Advances
Â 
Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of the master servicer, the special servicer or the trustee will be obligated to make any Advance that it
determines in its reasonable judgment would, if made, not be recoverable (including recovery of interest on the Advance) out of
Related Proceeds (a âNonrecoverable Advanceâ). In addition, the special servicer may, at its option (with respect
to any specially-serviced Mortgage Loan, in consultation with (with respect to any Mortgage Loan other than an Excluded Loan),
prior to the occurrence of a Consultation Termination Event, the Directing Certificateholder) make a determination in accordance
with the Servicing Standard that any P&I Advance or Servicing Advance, if made, would be a Nonrecoverable Advance, and if
it makes such a determination, must deliver to the master servicer (and, with respect to a Serviced Pari Passu Mortgage Loan,
to any master servicer or special servicer under the pooling and servicing agreement governing any securitization trust into which
the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan is deposited, and, with respect to each Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, the related
Non-Serviced Master Servicer and Non-Serviced Special Servicer), the certificate administrator, the trustee, the operating advisor
and the 17g-5 Information Provider notice of such determination, which determination may be conclusively relied upon by, but will
not be binding upon, the master servicer and the trustee. The special servicer will have no such
Â 


357
Â 
Â 
obligation
to make an affirmative determination that any P&I Advance or Servicing Advance is, or would be, recoverable, and in the absence
of a determination by the special servicer that such an Advance is non-recoverable, each such decision will remain with the master
servicer or the trustee, as applicable. If the special servicer makes a determination that only a portion, and not all, of any
previously made or proposed P&I Advance or Servicing Advance is non-recoverable, the master servicer and the trustee will
have the right to make its own subsequent determination that any remaining portion of any such previously made or proposed P&I
Advance or Servicing Advance is non-recoverable.
Â 
In
making such non-recoverability determination, each person will be entitled to consider (among other things): (a) (i)Â the
obligations of the borrower under the terms of the related Mortgage Loan or Companion Loan, as applicable, as it may have been
modified, and (ii) the related Mortgaged Properties in their âas-isâ or then-current conditions and occupancies, as
modified by such partyâs assumptions regarding the possibility and effects of future adverse change with respect to such
Mortgaged Properties, (b) estimated future expenses, (c) estimated timing of recoveries, and (d)Â the existence of any Nonrecoverable
Advances which, at the time of such consideration, the recovery of which are being deferred or delayed by the master servicer
or the trustee because there is insufficient principal available for such recovery, in light of the fact that Related Proceeds
are a source of recovery not only for the Advance under consideration but also a potential source of recovery for such delayed
or deferred Advance. In addition, any such person may update or change its recoverability determinations (but not reverse any
other personâs determination that an Advance is non-recoverable) at any time and may obtain at the expense of the issuing
entity any reasonably required analysis, appraisals or market value estimates or other information for such purposes. Absent bad
faith, any non-recoverability determination described in this paragraph will be conclusive and binding on the Certificateholders,
and may be conclusively relied upon by, but is not binding upon, the master servicer and the trustee. The master servicer and
the trustee will be entitled to rely conclusively on any non-recoverability determination of the special servicer. Nonrecoverable
Advances will represent a portion of the losses to be borne by the Certificateholders.
Â 
With
respect to a Non-Serviced Whole Loan, if any servicer under the related Non-Serviced PSA determines that a principal and interest
advance with respect to the related Non-Serviced Companion Loan, if made, would be non-recoverable, such determination will not
be binding on the master servicer and the trustee as it relates to any proposed P&I Advance with respect to such Non-Serviced
Mortgage Loan. Similarly, with respect to a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, if the master servicer or the special servicer determines
that any P&I Advance with respect to such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, if made, would be non-recoverable, such determination
will not be binding on the related Non-Serviced Master Servicer and Non-Serviced Trustee as such determination relates to any
proposed P&I Advance with respect to the related Non-Serviced Companion Loan (unless the related Non-Serviced PSA provides
otherwise).
Â 
Recovery
of Advances
Â 
The
master servicer, the special servicer or the trustee, as applicable, will be entitled to recover (a) any Servicing Advance made
out of its own funds from any amounts collected in respect of a Mortgage Loan (or, consistent with the related Intercreditor Agreement,
a Serviced Whole Loan) as to which such Servicing Advance was made, and (b) any P&I Advance made out of its own funds from
any amounts collected in respect of the Mortgage Loan as to which such P&I Advance was made, whether in the form of late payments,
insurance and condemnation proceeds, liquidation proceeds or otherwise from the related Mortgage Loan or Mortgaged Property (âRelated
Proceedsâ). Each of the master servicer,
Â 


358
Â 
Â 
the
special servicer and the trustee will be entitled to recover any Advance by it that it subsequently determines to be a Nonrecoverable
Advance out of general collections on or relating to the Mortgage Loans on deposit in the Collection Account (first from
principal collections and then from any other collections). Amounts payable in respect of each Serviced Pari Passu Companion
Loan pursuant to the related Intercreditor Agreement will not be available for distributions on the certificates or for the reimbursement
of Nonrecoverable Advances of principal or interest with respect to the related Mortgage Loan, but will be available, in accordance
with the PSA and related Intercreditor Agreement, for the reimbursement of any Servicing Advances with respect to the related
Serviced Whole Loan. If a Servicing Advance by the master servicer or the special servicer (or trustee, as applicable) on a Serviced
Whole Loan becomes a Nonrecoverable Advance and the master servicer, the special servicer or the trustee, as applicable, is unable
to recover such amounts from related proceeds or the related Companion Loan, as applicable, the master servicer, the special servicer
or the trustee (as applicable) will be permitted to recover such Nonrecoverable Advance (including interest thereon) out of general
collections on or relating to the Mortgage Loans on deposit in the Collection Account.
Â 
If
the funds in the Collection Account relating to the Mortgage Loans allocable to principal on the Mortgage Loans are insufficient
to fully reimburse the party entitled to reimbursement, then such party as an accommodation may elect, on a monthly basis, at
its sole option and discretion to defer reimbursement of the portion that exceeds such amount allocable to principal (in which
case interest will continue to accrue on the unreimbursed portion of the advance) for a time as required to reimburse the excess
portion from principal for a consecutive period up to 12 months (provided that, with respect to any Mortgage Loan other
than an Excluded Loan, any such deferral exceeding 6 months will require, prior to the occurrence and continuance of any Control
Termination Event, the consent of the Directing Certificateholder) and any election to so defer will be deemed to be in accordance
with the Servicing Standard; provided that no such deferral may occur at any time to the extent that amounts otherwise
distributable as principal are available for such reimbursement.
Â 
In
connection with a potential election by the master servicer or the trustee to refrain from the reimbursement of all or a portion
of a particular Nonrecoverable Advance during the one month collection period ending on the related Determination Date for any
Distribution Date, the master servicer or the trustee will be authorized to wait for principal collections on the Mortgage Loans
to be received until the end of such collection period before making its determination of whether to refrain from the reimbursement
of all or a portion of a particular Nonrecoverable Advance; provided, however, that if, at any time the master servicer
or the trustee, as applicable, elects, in its sole discretion, not to refrain from obtaining such reimbursement or otherwise determines
that the reimbursement of a Nonrecoverable Advance during a one month collection period will exceed the full amount of the principal
portion of general collections on or relating to the Mortgage Loans deposited in the Collection Account for such Distribution
Date, then the master servicer or the trustee, as applicable, will be required to use its reasonable efforts to give the 17g-5
Information Provider 15 daysâ notice of such determination for posting on the 17g-5 Information Providerâs website,
unless extraordinary circumstances make such notice impractical, which means (1)Â that party determines in its sole discretion
that waiting 15 days after such a notice could jeopardize its ability to recover such Nonrecoverable Advance, (2)Â changed
circumstances or new or different information becomes known to that party that could affect or cause a determination or whether
any Advance is a Nonrecoverable Advance or whether to deter reimbursement of a Nonrecoverable Advance or the determination in
clauseÂ (1) above, or (3)Â in the case of the master servicer, it has not timely received from the trustee information
required by the master servicer to consider in determining whether to defer reimbursement of a Nonrecoverable Advance. If any
of the circumstances described in
Â 


359
Â 
Â 
clauseÂ (1),
clauseÂ (2) or clauseÂ (3) above apply, the master servicer or trustee, as applicable, must give the 17g-5 Information
Provider notice (in accordance with the procedures regarding Rule 17g-5 set forth in the PSA) of the anticipated reimbursement
as soon as reasonably practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, failure to give such notice will in no way affect the master
servicerâs or the trusteeâs election whether to refrain from obtaining such reimbursement or right to obtain reimbursement.
Â 
Each
of the master servicer, the special servicer and the trustee will be entitled to recover any Advance that is outstanding at the
time that a Mortgage Loan is modified but is not repaid in full by the borrower in connection with such modification but becomes
an obligation of the borrower to pay such amounts in the future (such Advance, together with interest on that Advance, a âWorkout-Delayed
Reimbursement Amountâ) out of principal collections on the Mortgage Loans in the Collection Account.
Â 
Any
amount that constitutes all or a portion of any Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount may in the future be determined to constitute
a Nonrecoverable Advance and thereafter will be recoverable as any other Nonrecoverable Advance.
Â 
In
connection with its recovery of any Advance, each of the master servicer, the special servicer and the trustee will be entitled
to be paid, out of any amounts relating to the Mortgage Loans then on deposit in the Collection Account, interest at the Prime
Rate (the âReimbursement Rateâ) accrued on the amount of the Advance from the date made to, but not including,
the date of reimbursement. Neither the master servicer nor the trustee will be entitled to interest on P&I Advances if the
related Periodic Payment is received on or before the related Due Date and any applicable grace period has expired or if the related
Periodic Payment is received after the Determination Date but on or prior to the Master Servicer Remittance Date. The âPrime
Rateâ will be the prime rate, for any day, set forth in The Wall Street Journal, New York City edition.
Â 
See
ââServicing of the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loansâ for reimbursements of servicing advances made in respect
of a Non-Serviced Whole Loan under the related Non-Serviced PSA.
Â 
Accounts
Â 
The
master servicer is required to establish and maintain, or cause to be established and maintained, one or more accounts and subaccounts
(collectively, the âCollection Accountâ) in its own name on behalf of the trustee and for the benefit of the
Certificateholders. The master servicer is required to deposit in the Collection Account on a daily basis (and in no event later
than the 2nd business day following receipt in available and properly identified funds) all payments and collections due after
the Cut-off Date and other amounts received or advanced with respect to the Mortgage Loans (including, without limitation, all
proceeds (the âInsurance and Condemnation Proceedsâ) received under any hazard, title or other insurance policy
that provides coverage with respect to a Mortgaged Property or the related Mortgage Loan or in connection with the full or partial
condemnation of a Mortgaged Property (other than proceeds applied to the restoration of the Mortgaged Property or released to
the related borrower in accordance with the Servicing Standard (or, if applicable, a special servicer) and/or the terms and conditions
of the related Mortgage) and all other amounts received and retained in connection with the liquidation of any Mortgage Loan that
is defaulted and any related defaulted Companion Loans or property acquired by foreclosure or otherwise (the âLiquidation
Proceedsâ)) together with the net operating income (less reasonable reserves for future expenses) derived from the operation
of any REO Properties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the collections on the Whole Loans will be
Â 


360
Â 
Â 
limited
to the portion of such amounts that are payable to the holder of the related Mortgage Loan pursuant to the related Intercreditor
Agreement.
Â 
The
master servicer will also be required to establish and maintain a segregated custodial account (the âCompanion Distribution
Accountâ) with respect to the Serviced Companion Loans, which may be a sub-account of the Collection Account, and deposit
amounts collected in respect of any Serviced Companion Loan in the Companion Distribution Account. The issuing entity will only
be entitled to amounts on deposit in the Companion Distribution Account to the extent these funds are not otherwise payable to
the holder of a Serviced Companion Loan or payable or reimbursable to any party to the PSA. Any amounts in the Companion Distribution
Account to which the issuing entity is entitled will be transferred on a monthly basis to the Collection Account.
Â 
With
respect to each Distribution Date, the master servicer will be required to disburse from the Collection Account and remit to the
certificate administrator for deposit into the Lower-Tier REMIC Distribution Account in respect of the related Mortgage Loans,
to the extent of funds on deposit in the Collection Account, on the related Master Servicer Remittance Date, the Available Funds
for such Distribution Date and any Yield Maintenance Charges or Prepayment Premiums received as of the related Determination Date.
The certificate administrator is required to establish and maintain various accounts, including a âLower-Tier REMIC Distribution
Accountâ and a âUpper-Tier REMIC Distribution Accountâ, both of which may be sub-accounts of a single account,
(collectively, the âDistribution Accountsâ), in its own name on behalf of the trustee and for the benefit of
the Certificateholders.
Â 
On
each Distribution Date, the certificate administrator is required to apply amounts on deposit in the Upper-Tier REMIC Distribution
Account (which will include all funds that were remitted by the master servicer from the Collection Account, plus, among other
things, any P&I Advances less amounts, if any, distributable to the ClassÂ R and ClassÂ V certificates) as set forth
in the PSA generally to make distributions of interest and principal from Available Funds to the holders of the Regular Certificates,
as described under âDescription of the CertificatesâDistributionsâ.
Â 
The
certificate administrator is also required to establish and maintain an account (the âInterest Reserve Accountâ)
which may be a sub-account of the Distribution Account, in its own name on behalf of the trustee for the benefit of the Certificateholders.
On the Master Servicer Remittance Date occurring each February and on any Master Servicer Remittance Date occurring in any January
which occurs in a year that is not a leap year (in each case, unless the related Distribution Date is the final Distribution Date),
the certificate administrator will be required to deposit amounts remitted by the master servicer or P&I Advances made on
the related Mortgage Loans into the Interest Reserve Account during the related interest period, in respect of the Mortgage Loans
that accrue interest on an Actual/360 Basis (collectively, the âActual/360 Loansâ), in an amount equal to one
dayâs interest at the Net Mortgage Rate for each such Actual/360 Loan on its Stated Principal Balance and as of the Distribution
Date in the month preceding the month in which the Master Servicer Remittance Date occurs, to the extent a Periodic Payment or
P&I Advance or other deposit is made in respect of the Mortgage Loans (all amounts so deposited in any consecutive January
(if applicable) and February, âWithheld Amountsâ). On the Master Servicer Remittance Date occurring each March
(or February, if the related Distribution Date is the final Distribution Date), the certificate administrator will be required
to withdraw from the Interest Reserve Account an amount equal to the Withheld Amounts from the preceding January (if applicable)
and February, if any, and deposit that amount into the Lower-Tier REMIC Distribution Account.
Â 


361
Â 
Â 
The
certificate administrator is also required to establish and maintain an account (the âExcess Interest Distribution Accountâ),
which may be a sub-account of the Distribution Account, in the name of the trustee for the benefit of the holders of the ClassÂ V
certificates. Prior to the applicable Distribution Date, the master servicer is required to remit to the certificate administrator
for deposit into the Excess Interest Distribution Account an amount equal to the Excess Interest received by the master servicer
on or prior to the related Determination Date.
Â 
The
certificate administrator may be required to establish and maintain an account (the âGain-on-Sale Reserve Accountâ),
which may be a sub-account of the Distribution Account, in its own name on behalf of the trustee for the benefit of the Certificateholders.
To the extent that any gains are realized on sales of Mortgaged Properties (or, with respect to any Whole Loan, the portion of
such amounts that are payable on the related Mortgage Loan pursuant to the related Intercreditor Agreement), such gains will be
applied on the applicable Distribution Date as part of Available Funds to all amounts due and payable on the Regular Certificates
(including to reimburse for Realized Losses previously allocated to such certificates), and, to the extent not so applied, such
gains will be held and applied to offset future Realized Losses, if any (as determined by the special servicer). Any remaining
amounts will be distributed on the Class R Certificates.
Â 
Other
accounts to be established pursuant to the PSA are one or more segregated custodial accounts (the âREO Accountâ)
for collections from REO Properties. Each REO Account will be maintained by the special servicer in its own name on behalf of
the trustee and for the benefit of the Certificateholders.
Â 
The
Collection Account, the Distribution Accounts, the Interest Reserve Account, the Companion Distribution Account, the Excess Interest
Distribution Account, the Gain-on-Sale Reserve Account and the REO Account are collectively referred to as the âSecuritization
Accountsâ (but with respect to any Whole Loan, only to the extent of the issuing entityâs interest in the Whole
Loan). Each of the foregoing accounts will be held at a depository institution or trust company meeting the requirements of the
PSA.
Â 
Amounts
on deposit in the foregoing accounts may be invested in certain United States government securities and other investments meeting
the requirements of the PSA (âPermitted Investmentsâ). Interest or other income earned on funds in the accounts
maintained by the master servicer, the certificate administrator or the special servicer will be payable to each of them as additional
compensation, and each of them will be required to bear any losses resulting from its investment of such funds.
Â 
Withdrawals
from the Collection Account
Â 
The
master servicer may, from time to time, make withdrawals from the Collection Account (or the applicable subaccount of the Collection
Account, exclusive of the Companion Distribution Account that may be a subaccount of the Collection Account) for any of the following
purposes, in each case only to the extent permitted under the PSA and with respect to any Serviced Whole Loan, subject to the
terms of the related Intercreditor Agreement, without duplication (the order set forth below not constituting an order of priority
for such withdrawals):
Â 
(i)Â Â Â to
remit on each Master Servicer Remittance Date (A) to the certificate administrator for deposit into the Lower-Tier REMIC Distribution
Account certain portions of the Available Funds and any Prepayment Premiums or Yield Maintenance Charges attributable to the Mortgage
Loans on the related Distribution Date or (B) to the certificate administrator for deposit into the Excess Interest Distribution
Account

amount equal to the Excess Interest received in the applicable one-month period ending on the related Determination Date, if any;
Â 
(ii)Â Â Â to
pay or reimburse the master servicer, the special servicer and the trustee, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of the PSA for
Advances made by any of them and interest on Advances (the master servicerâs, special servicerâs or the trusteeâs
respective right, as applicable, to reimbursement for items described in this clauseÂ (ii) being limited as described above
under ââAdvancesâ) (provided that with respect to each Serviced Whole Loan, such reimbursements
are subject to the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreement);
Â 
(iii)Â Â Â to
pay to the master servicer and the special servicer, as compensation, the aggregate unpaid servicing compensation;
Â 
(iv)Â Â Â to

Balances of the Control Eligible Certificates have not been reduced to zero as a result of the allocation of Realized Losses to
such certificates, only to the extent actually received from the related borrower) or the Operating Advisor Fee;
Â 
(v)Â Â Â to
pay to the asset representations reviewer the Asset Representations Reviewer Fee and any unpaid Asset Representations Reviewer
Asset Review Fee (to the extent such fee is to be paid by the issuing entity);
Â 
(vi)Â Â Â to

Reimbursement Amounts;
Â 
(vii)Â Â Â to
reimburse the master servicer, the special servicer or the trustee, as applicable, for any unreimbursed expenses reasonably incurred
with respect to each related Mortgage Loan that has been repurchased or substituted by such person pursuant to the PSA or otherwise;
Â 
(viii)Â Â Â to
reimburse the master servicer or the special servicer for any unreimbursed expenses reasonably incurred by such person in connection
with the enforcement of the related mortgage loan sellerâs obligations under the applicable section of the related MLPA;
Â 
(ix)Â Â Â to
pay for any unpaid costs and expenses incurred by the issuing entity;
Â 
(x)Â Â Â to
pay the master servicer and the special servicer, as applicable, as additional servicing compensation, (A) interest and investment
income earned in respect of amounts relating to the issuing entity held in the Collection Account and the Companion Distribution
Account (but only to the extent of the net investment earnings during the applicable one month period ending on the related Distribution
Date) and (B) certain penalty charges and default interest;
Â 
(xi)Â Â Â to
recoup any amounts deposited in the Collection Account in error;
Â 
(xii)Â Â Â to
the extent not reimbursed or paid pursuant to any of the above clauses, to reimburse or pay the master servicer, the special servicer,
the operating advisor, the asset representations reviewer, the depositor or any of their respective directors, officers, members,
managers, employees and agents, unpaid additional expenses of the issuing entity and certain other unreimbursed expenses incurred
by such person
Â 


363
Â 
Â 
pursuant
to and to the extent reimbursable under the PSA and to satisfy any indemnification obligations of the issuing entity under the
PSA;
Â 
(xiii)	to
pay for the cost of the opinions of counsel or the cost of obtaining any extension to the time in which the issuing entity is
permitted to hold REO Property;
Â 
(xiv)	to
pay any applicable federal, state or local taxes imposed on any Trust REMIC, or any of their assets or transaction, together with
all incidental costs and expenses, to the extent that none of the master servicer, the special servicer, the certificate administrator
or the trustee is liable under the PSA;
Â 
(xv)	to
pay the CREFCÂ® Intellectual Property Royalty License Fee;
Â 
(xvi)	to
reimburse the certificate administrator out of general collections on the Mortgage Loans and REO Properties for legal expenses
incurred by and reimbursable to it by the issuing entity of any administrative or judicial proceedings related to an examination
or audit by any governmental taxing authority;
Â 
(xvii)	to
pay the related mortgage loan seller or any other person, with respect to each Mortgage Loan, if any, previously purchased or
replaced by such person pursuant to the PSA, all amounts received thereon subsequent to the date of purchase or replacement relating
to periods after the date of purchase or replacement;
Â 
(xviii)	to
remit to the certificate administrator for deposit in the Interest Reserve Account the amounts required to be deposited in the
Interest Reserve Account pursuant to the PSA;
Â 
(xix)	to
remit to the companion paying agent for deposit into the Companion Distribution Account the amounts required to be deposited pursuant
to the PSA; and
Â 
(xx)	to
clear and terminate the Collection Account pursuant to a plan for termination and liquidation of the issuing entity.
Â 
No
amounts payable or reimbursable to parties to the PSA out of general collections that do not specifically relate to a Serviced
Whole Loan may be reimbursable from amounts that would otherwise be payable to the related Companion Loan.
Â 
Certain
costs and expenses (such as a pro rata share of any related Servicing Advances) allocable to a Mortgage Loan that is part
of a Serviced Whole Loan may be paid or reimbursed out of payments and other collections on the other Mortgage Loans, subject
to the issuing entityâs right to reimbursement from future payments and other collections on the related Companion Loan
or from general collections with respect to the securitization of the related Companion Loan. If the master servicer makes, with
respect to any Serviced Whole Loan, any reimbursement or payment out of the Collection Account to cover the related Serviced Pari
Passu Companion Loanâs share of any cost, expense, indemnity, Servicing Advance or interest on such Servicing Advance, or
fee with respect to such Serviced Whole Loan, then the master servicer (with respect to a Mortgage Loan that is not a Specially
Serviced Loan or a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or special servicer (with respect to Specially Serviced Loans and REO Properties)
must use efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to collect such amount out of collections on such Serviced Pari Passu
Companion Loan or, if and to the extent permitted under the related Intercreditor Agreement, from the holder of the related Serviced
Pari Passu Companion Loan.
Â 


364
Â 
Â 
The
master servicer will also be entitled to make withdrawals, from time to time, from the Collection Account of amounts necessary
for the payments or reimbursements required to be paid to the parties to the applicable Non-Serviced PSA, pursuant to the applicable
Intercreditor Agreement and the applicable Non-Serviced PSA. See ââServicing of the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loansâ.
Â 
If
a P&I Advance is made with respect to any Mortgage Loan (other than any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) that is part of a Whole
Loan, then that P&I Advance, together with interest on such P&I Advance, may only be reimbursed out of future payments
and collections on that Mortgage Loan or, as and to the extent described under ââAdvancesâ above, on
other Mortgage Loans, but not out of payments or other collections on the related Serviced Companion Loan. Likewise, the Certificate
Administrator/Trustee Fee and the Operating Advisor Fee that accrue with respect to any Mortgage Loan (other than any Non-Serviced
Mortgage Loan and other than the Empire Mall Mortgage Loan) that is part of a Whole Loan and any other amounts payable to the
operating advisor may only be paid out of payments and other collections on such Mortgage Loan and/or the Mortgage Pool generally,
but not out of payments or other collections on the related Serviced Companion Loan.
Â 
Servicing
and Other Compensation and Payment of Expenses
Â 
General
Â 
The
parties to the PSA other than the depositor will be entitled to payment of certain fees as compensation for services performed
under the PSA. Below is a summary of the fees payable to the parties to the PSA from amounts that the issuing entity is entitled
to receive. In addition, CREFCÂ® will be entitled to a license fee for use of its names and trademarks, including
the CREFCÂ® Investor Reporting Package. Certain additional fees and costs payable by the related borrowers are allocable
to the parties to the PSA other than the depositor, but such amounts are not payable from amounts that the issuing entity is entitled
to receive.
Â 
The
amounts available for distribution on the certificates on any Distribution Date will generally be net of the following amounts:

Â 


(1)With
  respect to any Mortgage Loan and any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan (or any
  Specially Serviced Loan) in respect of which an REO Property was acquired, all references
  to Mortgage Loan, Companion Loan, Specially Serviced Loan in this table will be deemed
  to also be references to or to also include any REO Loans.
Â 

With respect
  to each Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, the related master servicer, special servicer, certificate
  administrator, trustee, operating advisor and/or asset representations reviewer under
  the related Non-Serviced PSA will be entitled to receive similar fees and reimbursements
  with respect to that Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan in amounts, from sources and at frequencies
  that are similar, but not necessarily identical, to those described above and, in certain
  cases (for example, with respect to unreimbursed special servicing fees and servicing
  advances with respect to each Non-Serviced Whole Loan), such amounts may be reimbursable
  from general collections on the other Mortgage Loans to the extent not recoverable from
  the related Non-Serviced Whole Loan.
Â 

In connection
  with the servicing and administration of each Serviced Whole Loan pursuant to the terms
  of the PSA and the related Intercreditor Agreement, the master servicer and special servicer
  will be entitled to servicing compensation, without duplication, with respect to the
  related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan as well as the related Mortgage Loan to the
  extent consistent with the PSA and not prohibited by the related Intercreditor Agreement.
Â

Â 
Master
Servicing Compensation
Â 
The
fee of the master servicer including the fee of any primary or other sub-servicer (the âServicing Feeâ) will
be payable monthly from amounts allocable in respect of interest received in respect of each Mortgage Loan, Serviced Pari Passu
Companion Loan (to the extent not prohibited under the related Intercreditor Agreement) and REO Loan (other than the portion of
any REO Loan related to any Non-Serviced Companion Loan) (including Specially Serviced Loans and any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan
constituting a âspecially serviced loanâ under any related Non-Serviced PSA), and will accrue at a rate (the âServicing
Fee Rateâ) on the Stated Principal Balance of such Mortgage Loan, Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan or REO Loan, equal
to a per annum rate ranging from 0.0050% to 0.0550%. The Servicing Fee payable to the master servicer with respect to each
Serviced
Â 


371
Â 
Â 
Pari
Passu Companion Loan will be payable, subject to the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreement, from amounts payable in respect
of the related Companion Loan.
Â 
In
addition to the Servicing Fee, the master servicer will be entitled to retain, as additional servicing compensation (other than
with respect to a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan), the following amounts to the extent collected from the related borrower:
Â 

Â·100%
  of Excess Modification Fees related to any modifications, waivers, extensions or amendments
  of any Mortgage Loans (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) that are not Specially
  Serviced Loans and any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan to the extent not prohibited
  by the related Intercreditor Agreement; provided that with respect to such transactions,
  the consent of the special servicer is not required for the related transaction and,
  in the event that the special servicerâs consent is required, then the master servicer
  will be entitled to 50% of such fees;
Â 

Â·100%
  of all assumption application fees and other similar items received on any Mortgage Loans
  that are not Specially Serviced Loans (including any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion
  Loan to the extent not prohibited by the related Intercreditor Agreement) (whether or
  not the consent of the special servicer is required) and 100% of all defeasance fees;
Â 

Â·100%
  of assumption, waiver, consent and earnout fees and other similar items (other than assumption
  application fees and defeasance fees) pursuant to the PSA on any Mortgage Loans that
  are not Specially Serviced Loans (including any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion
  Loan to the extent not prohibited by the related Intercreditor Agreement), provided
  that with respect to such transactions, the consent of the special servicer is not
  required to take such actions;
Â 

Â·50%
  of all assumption, waiver, consent and earnout fees and other similar items (other than
  assumption application fees and defeasance fees), in each case, with respect to all Mortgage
  Loans that are not Specially Serviced Loans (including any related Serviced Pari Passu
  Companion Loan to the extent not prohibited by the related Intercreditor Agreement) for
  which the special servicerâs consent or approval is required and only to the extent
  that all amounts then due and payable with respect to the related Mortgage Loan or related
  Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan have been paid;
Â 

Â·100%
  of charges collected for checks returned for insufficient funds;
Â 

Â·100%

  not Specially Serviced Loans;
Â 

Â·the
  excess, if any, of Prepayment Interest Excesses over Prepayment Interest Shortfalls arising
  from any principal prepayments on the Mortgage Loans and any Serviced Pari Passu Companion
  Loan; and
Â 

Â·late
payment charges and default interest paid by the borrowers (that were accrued while the related Mortgage Loans (other than a Non-Serviced
Mortgage Loan) or any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan (to the extent not prohibited by the related Intercreditor Agreement)
were not Specially Serviced Loans), but only to the extent such late payment charges and default interest are not needed to pay
interest on Advances or certain additional trust fund expenses
Â 


372
Â 
Â 


(excluding
  Special Servicing Fees, Liquidation Fees and Workout Fees) incurred with respect to the
  related Mortgage Loan or, if provided under the related Intercreditor Agreement, any
  related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan since the Closing Date.

Â 
Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, the master servicer and the special servicer will each be entitled to charge and retain reasonable review
fees in connection with any borrower request to the extent such fees are not prohibited under the related Mortgage Loan documents
and are actually paid by or on behalf of the related borrower. In addition, the master servicer also is authorized but not required
to invest or direct the investment of funds held in the Collection Account and the Companion Distribution Account in Permitted
Investments, and the master servicer will be entitled to retain any interest or other income earned on those funds and will bear
any losses resulting from the investment of these funds, except as set forth in the PSA. The master servicer also is entitled
to retain any interest earned on any servicing escrow account to the extent the interest is not required to be paid to the related
borrowers.
Â 
See
ââModifications, Waivers and Amendmentsâ.
Â 
âExcess
Modification Feesâ means, with respect to any Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Whole
Loan, the sum of (A)Â the excess, if any, of (i)Â any and all Modification Fees with respect to a modification, waiver,
extension or amendment of any of the terms of such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Whole Loan, over (ii)Â all unpaid or unreimbursed
additional expenses (including, without limitation, reimbursement of Advances and interest on Advances to the extent not otherwise
paid or reimbursed by the borrower but excluding Special Servicing Fees, Workout Fees and Liquidation Fees) outstanding or previously
incurred on behalf of the issuing entity with respect to the related Mortgage Loan or Serviced Whole Loan, and reimbursed from
such Modification Fees and (B)Â expenses previously paid or reimbursed from Modification Fees as described in the preceding
clauseÂ (A), which expenses have been recovered from the related borrower or otherwise.
Â 
âModification
Feesâ means, with respect to any Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Pari Passu Companion
Loans, any and all fees with respect to a modification, extension, waiver or amendment that modifies, extends, amends or waives
any term of such Mortgage Loan documents and/or related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan documents (as evidenced by a signed
writing) agreed to by the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable (other than all assumption fees, assumption application
fees, consent fees, defeasance fees, Special Servicing Fees, Liquidation Fees or Workout Fees).
Â 
With
respect to each of the master servicer and special servicer, the Excess Modification Fees collected and earned by such person
from the related borrower (taken in the aggregate with any other Excess Modification Fees collected and earned by such person
from the related borrower within the prior 12 months of the collection of the current Excess Modification Fees) will be subject
to a cap of 1.0% of the outstanding principal balance of the related Mortgage Loan or Serviced Whole Loan on the closing date
of the related modification, extension, waiver or amendment (after giving effect to such modification, extension, waiver or amendment)
with respect to any Mortgage Loan or Serviced Whole Loan.
Â 
The
Servicing Fee is calculated on the Stated Principal Balance of each Mortgage Loan (including each Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan)
and each related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan in the same manner as interest is calculated on such Mortgage Loans and
Â 


373
Â 
Â 
Serviced
Pari Passu Companion Loans. The Servicing Fee for each Mortgage Loan is included in the Administrative Cost Rate listed for that
Mortgage Loan on AnnexÂ A-1. Any Servicing Fee Rate calculated on an Actual/360 Basis will be recomputed on the basis of twelve
30-day months, assuming a 360-day year (â30/360 Basisâ) for purposes of calculating the Net Mortgage Rate.
Â 
Pursuant
to the terms of the PSA, Wells Fargo Bank will be entitled to retain a portion of the Servicing Fee with respect to each Mortgage
Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) and, to the extent provided for in the related Intercreditor Agreement, each Serviced
Pari Passu Companion Loan, notwithstanding any termination or resignation of Wells Fargo Bank as master servicer; provided
that Wells Fargo Bank may not retain any portion of the Servicing Fee to the extent that portion of the Servicing Fee is required
to appoint a successor master servicer. In addition, Wells Fargo Bank will have the right to assign and transfer its rights to
receive that retained portion of its Servicing Fee to another party.
Â 
The
master servicer will be required to pay its overhead and any general and administrative expenses incurred by it in connection
with its servicing activities under the PSA. The master servicer will not be entitled to reimbursement for any expenses incurred
by it except as expressly provided in the PSA. The master servicer will be responsible for all fees payable to any sub-servicers.
See âDescription of the CertificatesâDistributionsâMethod, Timing and Amountâ.
Â 
With
respect to a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, the related Non-Serviced Master Servicer (or primary servicer) will be entitled to a
primary servicing fee accruing at a rate equal to 0.0025% per annum with respect to such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, which
is included as part of the Servicing Fee Rate for purposes of the information presented in this prospectus.
Â 
Special
Servicing Compensation
Â 
The
principal compensation to be paid to the special servicer in respect of its special servicing activities will be the Special Servicing
Fee, the Workout Fee and the Liquidation Fee.
Â 
The
âSpecial Servicing Feeâ will accrue with respect to each Specially Serviced Loan and each REO Loan (other than
a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) on a loan-by-loan basis at a rate equal to the greater of a per annum rate of 0.25% and the
per annum rate that would result in a special servicing fee of $3,500 for the related month (the âSpecial Servicing
Fee Rateâ) calculated on the basis of the Stated Principal Balance of the related Mortgage Loan (including any REO Loan)
and Companion Loan, as applicable, and in the same manner as interest is calculated on the Specially Serviced Loans, and will
be payable monthly, first from Liquidation Proceeds, Insurance and Condemnation Proceeds, and collections in respect of
the related REO Property or Specially Serviced Loan and then from general collections on all the Mortgage Loans (other
than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) and any REO Properties. Each Non-Serviced Whole Loan will be subject to a similar special servicing
fee pursuant to the related Non-Serviced PSA. For further detail, see âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâThe Whole
LoansâThe Non-Serviced Pari Passu Whole Loansâ.
Â 
The
âWorkout Feeâ will generally be payable with respect to each Corrected Loan and will be calculated by application
of a âWorkout Fee Rateâ of 1.00% to each collection (other than penalty charges and Excess Interest) of interest
and principal (other than any amount for which a Liquidation Fee would be paid) (including scheduled payments, prepayments, balloon
payments, and payments at maturity or anticipated repayment date) received on the Corrected Loan for so long as it remains a Corrected
Loan; provided, however, that after
Â 


374
Â 
Â 
receipt
by the special servicer of Workout Fees with respect to such Corrected Loan in an amount equal to $25,000, any Workout Fees in
excess of such amount will be reduced by the Excess Modification Fee Amount; provided, further, however,
that in the event the Workout Fee collected over the course of such workout calculated at the Workout Fee Rate is less than $25,000,
then the special servicer will be entitled to an amount from the final payment on the related Corrected Loan (including any related
Serviced Companion Loan) that would result in the total Workout Fees payable to the special servicer in respect of that Corrected
Loan (including any related Serviced Companion Loan) equal to $25,000. The âExcess Modification Fee Amountâ
with respect to either the master servicer or the special servicer, any Corrected Loan and any particular modification, waiver,
extension or amendment with respect to such Corrected Loan that gives rise to the payment of a Workout Fee, is an amount equal
to the aggregate of any Excess Modification Fees paid by or on behalf of the related borrower with respect to the related Mortgage
Loan (including the related Serviced Companion Loan, if applicable, unless prohibited under the related Intercreditor Agreement)
and received and retained by the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, as compensation within the prior 12 months
of such modification, waiver, extension or amendment, but only to the extent those fees have not previously been deducted from
a Workout Fee or Liquidation Fee. The Non-Serviced Whole Loans will be subject to a similar workout fee pursuant to the related
Non-Serviced PSA. For further details, see âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâThe Whole LoansâThe Non-Serviced
Pari Passu Whole Loansâ and âPooling and Servicing AgreementâServicing of the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loansâ.
Â 
The
Workout Fee with respect to any Corrected Loan will cease to be payable if the Corrected Loan again becomes a Specially Serviced
Loan but will become payable again if and when the Mortgage Loan (including a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) again becomes
a Corrected Loan. The Workout Fee with respect to any Specially Serviced Loan that becomes a Corrected Loan will be reduced by
any Excess Modification Fees paid by or on behalf of the related borrower with respect to a related Mortgage Loan or REO Loan
and received by the special servicer as compensation within the prior 12 months, but only to the extent those fees have not previously
been deducted from a Workout Fee or Liquidation Fee.
Â 
If
the special servicer is terminated (other than for cause) or resigns, it will retain the right to receive any and all Workout
Fees payable with respect to a Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan that became a Corrected Loan during the period
that it acted as special servicer and remained a Corrected Loan at the time of that termination or resignation, except that such
Workout Fees will cease to be payable if the Corrected Loan again becomes a Specially Serviced Loan. The successor special servicer
will not be entitled to any portion of those Workout Fees. If the special servicer resigns or is terminated (other than for cause),
it will receive any Workout Fees payable on Specially Serviced Loans for which the resigning or terminated special servicer had
determined to grant a forbearance or cured the event of default through a modification, restructuring or workout negotiated by
the special servicer and evidenced by a signed writing, but which had not as of the time the special servicer resigned or was
terminated become a Corrected Loan solely because the borrower had not made 3 consecutive timely Periodic Payments and which subsequently
becomes a Corrected Loan as a result of the borrower making such 3Â consecutive timely Periodic Payments.
Â 
A
âLiquidation Feeâ will be payable to the special servicer with respect to each Specially Serviced Loan or REO
Property (except with respect to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) as to which the special servicer receives (a)Â a full, partial
or discounted payoff from the related borrower or (b)Â any Liquidation Proceeds or Insurance and Condemnation Proceeds
Â 


375
Â 
Â 
(including
with respect to the related Companion Loan, if applicable) or REO Property. The Liquidation Fee for each Specially Serviced Loan
(and each related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) and REO Property will be payable from, and will be calculated by application
of a âLiquidation Fee Rateâ of 1.00% to the related payment or proceeds (or, if such rate would result in an aggregate
liquidation fee less than $25,000, then the Liquidation Fee Rate will be equal to the lesser of (i)Â 3.0% and (ii)Â such
lower rate as would result in an aggregate liquidation fee equal to $25,000); provided that the Liquidation Fee with respect
to any Specially Serviced Loan will be reduced by the amount of any Excess Modification Fees paid by or on behalf of the related
borrower with respect to the related Mortgage Loan (including a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) or REO Property and received
by the special servicer as compensation within the prior 12 months, but only to the extent those fees have not previously been
deducted from a Workout Fee or Liquidation Fee.
Â 
Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary described above, no Liquidation Fee will be payable based upon, or out of, Liquidation Proceeds received
in connection with:
Â 
(i)Â Â Â (A)
the repurchase of, or substitution for, any Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan by a mortgage loan seller for
a breach of representation or warranty or for defective or deficient Mortgage Loan documentation within the time period (or extension
of such time period) provided for such repurchase or substitution if such repurchase or substitution occurs prior to the termination
of such extended period, or (B) the payment of a Loss of Value Payment in connection with any such breach or document defect if
the applicable mortgage loan seller makes such Loss of Value Payment within the 90-day initial cure period or, if applicable,
within the subsequent 90-day extended cure period,
Â 
(ii)Â Â Â the
purchase of any Specially Serviced Loan or an REO Property that is subject to mezzanine indebtedness by the holder of the related
mezzanine loan within 90 days of such holderâs purchase option first becoming exercisable during the period prior to such
Mortgage Loan becoming a Corrected Loan,
Â 
(iii)Â Â Â the
purchase of all of the Mortgage Loans and REO Properties in connection with any termination of the issuing entity,
Â 
(iv)Â Â Â with
respect to a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, (A) a repurchase of such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan by the related mortgage
loan seller for a breach of representation or warranty or for defective or deficient Mortgage Loan documentation under the pooling
and servicing agreement for the securitization trust that owns such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan within the time period
(or extension of such time period) provided for such repurchase if such repurchase occurs prior to the termination of such extended
period provided in such pooling and servicing agreement or (B) a purchase of such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan by an applicable
party to a pooling and servicing agreement pursuant to a clean-up call or similar liquidation of another securitization entity,
Â 
(v)Â Â Â the
purchase of any Specially Serviced Loan by the special servicer or its affiliate (except if such affiliate purchaser is the Directing
Certificateholder or its affiliate; provided, however, that if no Control Termination Event has occurred and is
continuing, and such affiliated Directing Certificateholder or its affiliate purchases any Specially Serviced Loan within 90 days
after the special servicer delivers to such Directing Certificateholder for approval the initial asset status report with respect
to such Specially Serviced Loan, the special servicer will not be entitled to a liquidation
Â 


376
Â 
Â 
fee in connection with such purchase
by the Directing Certificateholder or its affiliates) or
Â 
(vi)Â Â Â if
a Mortgage Loan or the Serviced Whole Loan becomes a Specially Serviced Loan only because of an event described in clauseÂ (1)
of the definition of âSpecially Serviced Loanâ under the heading âPooling and Servicing AgreementâGeneralâ
and the related Liquidation Proceeds are received within 90 days following the related maturity date as a result of the related
Mortgage Loan or the Serviced Whole Loan being refinanced or otherwise repaid in full.
Â 
Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event that a liquidation fee is not payable due to the application of any of clausesÂ (i) through (vi)
above, the special servicer may still collect and retain a liquidation fee and similar fees from the related borrower to the extent
provided for in, or not prohibited by, the related Mortgage Loan documents. Each Non-Serviced Whole Loan will be subject to a
similar liquidation fee pursuant to the related Non-Serviced PSA. For further detail, see âDescription of the Mortgage
PoolâThe Whole LoansâThe Non-Serviced Pari Passu Whole Loansâ.
Â 
The
special servicer will also be entitled to additional servicing compensation in the form of:
Â 
(i)Â Â Â 100%
of Excess Modification Fees related to modifications, waivers, extensions or amendments of any Specially Serviced Loans,
Â 
(ii)Â Â 100%
of assumption application fees and assumption fees and other related fees as further described in the PSA, received with respect
to the Specially Serviced Loans,
Â 
(iii)	100%
of waiver, consent and earnout fees on any Specially Serviced Loan or certain other similar fees paid by the related borrower,
and
Â 
(iv)	50%
of all Excess Modification Fees and assumption fees, consent fees and earnout fees received with respect to all Mortgage Loans
(including the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loans, to the extent not prohibited by the related Intercreditor Agreements, if applicable)
(excluding any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) that are not Specially Serviced Loans and for which the special servicerâs consent
or approval is required.
Â 
The
special servicer will also be entitled to late payment charges and default interest paid by the borrowers and accrued while the
related Mortgage Loans (including the related Companion Loan, if applicable, and to the extent not prohibited by the related Intercreditor
Agreement) were Specially Serviced Loans and that are not needed to pay interest on Advances or certain additional trust fund
expenses with respect to the related Mortgage Loan (including the related Companion Loan, if applicable, to the extent not prohibited
by the related Intercreditor Agreement) since the Closing Date. The special servicer also is authorized but not required to invest
or direct the investment of funds held in the REO Account in Permitted Investments, and the special servicer will be entitled
to retain any interest or other income earned on those funds and will bear any losses resulting from the investment of these funds,
except as set forth in the PSA.
Â 
Each
Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan is serviced under the related Non-Serviced PSA (including on those occasions under such Non-Serviced
PSA when the servicing of such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan has been transferred from the related Non-Serviced Master Servicer to
the related Non-Serviced Special Servicer). Accordingly, in its capacity as the
Â 


377
Â 
Â 
special
servicer under the PSA, the special servicer will not be entitled to receive any special servicing compensation for any Non-Serviced
Mortgage Loan. Only the related Non-Serviced Special Servicer will be entitled to special servicing compensation on any such Non-Serviced
Mortgage Loan and only the related Non-Serviced Special Servicer will be entitled to special servicing compensation on any related
Non-Serviced Whole Loans.
Â 
Disclosable
Special Servicer Fees
Â 
The
PSA will provide that the special servicer and its affiliates will be prohibited from receiving or retaining any Disclosable Special
Servicer Fees in connection with the disposition, workout or foreclosure of any Mortgage Loan and Serviced Pari Passu Companion
Loan, the management or disposition of any REO Property, or the performance of any other special servicing duties under the PSA.
The PSA will also provide that, with respect to each Distribution Date, the special servicer must deliver or cause to be delivered
to the master servicer within one business day following the Determination Date, and the master servicer must deliver, to the
extent it has received, to the certificate administrator, without charge and on the Master Servicer Remittance Date, an electronic
report which discloses and contains an itemized listing of any Disclosable Special Servicer Fees received by the special servicer
or any of its affiliates with respect to such Distribution Date, provided that no such report will be due in any month
during which no Disclosable Special Servicer Fees were received.
Â 
âDisclosable
Special Servicer Feesâ means, with respect to any Mortgage Loan and related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan (including
any related REO Property), any compensation and other remuneration (including, without limitation, in the form of commissions,
brokerage fees, rebates, or as a result of any other fee-sharing arrangement) received or retained by the special servicer or
any of its affiliates that is paid by any person (including, without limitation, the issuing entity, any mortgagor, any manager,
any guarantor or indemnitor in respect of such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan and any purchaser of any Mortgage
Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan or REO Property) in connection with the disposition, workout or foreclosure of any
Mortgage Loan, the management or disposition of any REO Property, and the performance by the special servicer or any such affiliate
of any other special servicing duties under the PSA, other than (1)Â any Permitted Special Servicer/Affiliate Fees and (2)Â any
compensation to which the special servicer is entitled pursuant to the PSA.
Â 
âPermitted
Special Servicer/Affiliate Feesâ means any commercially reasonable treasury management fees, banking fees, title agency
fees, insurance commissions or fees and appraisal fees received or retained by the special servicer or any of its affiliates in
connection with any services performed by such party with respect to any Mortgage Loan and Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan
(including any related REO Property) in accordance with the PSA.
Â 
The
special servicer will be required to pay its overhead and any general and administrative expenses incurred by it in connection
with its servicing activities under the PSA. The special servicer will not be entitled to reimbursement for any expenses incurred
by it except as expressly provided in the PSA. See âDescription of the CertificatesâDistributionsâMethod,
Timing and Amountâ.
Â 
Certificate
Administrator and Trustee Compensation
Â 
As
compensation for the performance of its routine duties, the trustee and the certificate administrator will be paid a fee (collectively,
the âCertificate Administrator/Trustee Feeâ); provided that the Certificate Administrator/Trustee Fee
includes the trustee fee, and the
Â 


378
Â 
Â 
certificate
administrator will pay the trustee fee to the trustee in an amount equal to $210 per month. The Certificate Administrator/Trustee
Fee will be payable monthly from amounts received in respect of the Mortgage Loans and will be equal to the product of a rate
equal to 0.0060% per annum (the âCertificate Administrator/Trustee Fee Rateâ) and the Stated Principal
Balance of the Mortgage Loans and any REO Loans and will be calculated in the same manner
as interest is calculated on such Mortgage Loans or REO Loans.
Â 
Operating
Advisor Compensation
Â 
The
fee of the operating advisor (the âOperating Advisor Feeâ) will be payable monthly from amounts received in
respect of each Mortgage Loan (excluding each Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan and the Empire Mall Whole Loan and excluding each Companion
Loan) and REO Loan, and will be equal to the product of a rate equal to 0.0020% per annum (the âOperating Advisor
Fee Rateâ) and the Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans and any REO Loans
and will be calculated in the same manner as interest is calculated on such Mortgage Loans.
Â 
An
âOperating Advisor Consulting Feeâ will be payable to the operating advisor with respect to each Major Decision
on which the operating advisor has consultation obligations and performed its duties with respect to that Major Decision. The
Operating Advisor Consulting Fee will be a fee for each such Major Decision equal to $10,000 (or such lesser amount as the related
borrower agrees to pay) with respect to any Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan); provided that the
operating advisor may in its sole discretion reduce the Operating Advisor Consulting Fee with respect to any Major Decision; provided,
further, however, that to the extent such fee is incurred after the outstanding Certificate Balances of the Control
Eligible Certificates have been reduced to zero as a result of the allocation of Realized Losses to such certificates, such fee
shall be payable in full to the operating advisor as a trust fund expense.
Â 
Each
of the Operating Advisor Fee and the Operating Advisor Consulting Fee will be payable from funds on deposit in the Collection
Account out of amounts otherwise available to make distributions on the certificates as described above in ââWithdrawals
from the Collection Accountâ, but with respect to the Operating Advisor Consulting Fee, only as and to the extent that
such fee is actually received from the related borrower (other than as described above). If the operating advisor has consultation
rights with respect to a Major Decision, the PSA will require the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, to use
commercially reasonable efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to collect the applicable Operating Advisor Consulting
Fee from the related borrower in connection with such Major Decision, but only to the extent not prohibited by the related Mortgage
Loan documents, and in no event will it take any enforcement action with respect to the collection of such Operating Advisor Consulting
Fee other than requests for collection. The master servicer or special servicer, as applicable, will each be permitted to waive
or reduce the amount of any such Operating Advisor Consulting Fee payable by the related borrower if it determines that such full
or partial waiver is in accordance with the Servicing Standard; provided that the master servicer or the special servicer,
as applicable, will be required to consult, on a non-binding basis, with the operating advisor prior to any such waiver or reduction.
Â 
In
addition to the Operating Advisor Fee and the Operating Advisor Consulting Fee, the operating advisor will be entitled to reimbursement
of Operating Advisor Expenses in accordance with the terms of the PSA. âOperating Advisor Expensesâ for each
Distribution Date will equal any unreimbursed indemnification amounts or additional trust fund expenses payable to the operating
advisor pursuant to the PSA (other than the Operating Advisor Fee and the Operating Advisor Consulting Fee).
Â 


379
Â 
Â 
Asset
Representations Reviewer Compensation
Â 
The
asset representations reviewer will be paid a fee of $5,000 (the âAsset Representations Reviewer Upfront Feeâ)
on the Closing Date. As compensation for the performance of its routine duties, the asset representations reviewer will be paid
a fee (the âAsset Representations Reviewer Feeâ). The Asset Representations Reviewer Fee will be payable monthly
from amounts received in respect of each Mortgage Loan (including each Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, but not any Companion Loan)
and REO Loan, will be equal to the product of a rate equal to 0.00083% per annum (the âAsset Representations Reviewer
Fee Rateâ) and the Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans and any REO Loans and will be calculated in the same
manner as interest is calculated on such Mortgage Loans. In connection with each Asset Review with respect to each Delinquent
Loan, the asset representations reviewer will be required to be paid a fee of (i)Â $15,000 plus $1,000 per additional Mortgaged
Property with respect to a Delinquent Loan with a Cut-off Date Balance less than $15,000,000, (ii)Â $20,000 plus $1,000 per
additional Mortgaged Property with respect to a Delinquent Loan with a Cut-off Date Balance greater than or equal to $15,000,000,
but less than $30,000,000 or (iii)Â $25,000 plus $1,000 per additional Mortgaged Property with respect to a Delinquent Loan
with a Cut-off Date Balance greater than or equal to $30,000,000 (the âAsset Representations Reviewer Asset Review Feeâ).
Â 
The
Asset Representations Reviewer Fee will be payable from funds on deposit in the Collection Account out of amounts otherwise available
to make distributions on the certificates as described above in ââWithdrawals from the Collection Accountâ.
The Asset Representations Reviewer Asset Review Fee with respect to each Delinquent Loan will be required to be paid by the related
mortgage loan seller; provided, however, that if the related mortgage loan seller is insolvent or fails to pay such
amount within 90Â days of written request by the asset representations reviewer, such fee will be paid by the trust following
delivery by the asset representations reviewer of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the master servicer or the special servicer,
as applicable, of such insolvency or failure to pay such amount; provided, further, that notwithstanding any payment of
such fee by the issuing entity to the asset representations reviewer, such fee will remain an obligation of the related mortgage
loan seller and the special servicer will be required to pursue remedies against such mortgage loan seller to recover any such
amounts to the extent paid by the issuing entity. The Asset Representations Reviewer Asset Review Fee with respect to a Delinquent
Loan is required to be included in the Purchase Price for any Mortgage Loan that was the subject of a completed Asset Review and
that is repurchased by the related mortgage loan seller, and such portion of the Purchase Price received will be used to reimburse
the trust for any such fees paid to the asset representations reviewer pursuant to the terms of the PSA.
Â 
CREFCÂ®
Intellectual Property Royalty License Fee
Â 
CREFCÂ®
Intellectual Property Royalty License Fee will be paid to CREFCÂ® on a monthly basis.
Â 
âCREFCÂ®
Intellectual Property Royalty License Feeâ with respect to each Mortgage Loan and REO Loan (other than the portion
of an REO Loan related to any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) and for any Distribution Date is the amount accrued during the
related Interest Accrual Period at the CREFCÂ® Intellectual Property Royalty License Fee Rate on the Stated Principal
Balance of such Mortgage Loan and REO Loan as of the close of business on the Distribution Date in such Interest Accrual Period;
provided that such amounts will be computed for the same period and on the same interest accrual basis respecting which
any related interest payment due or deemed due on the related Mortgage Loan and REO Loan is computed and will be prorated for
partial periods. The CREFCÂ® Intellectual Property Royalty
Â 


380
Â 
Â 
License
Fee is a fee payable to CREFCÂ® for a license to use the CREFCÂ® Investor Reporting Package in connection
with the servicing and administration, including delivery of periodic reports to the Certificateholders, of the issuing entity
pursuant to the PSA. No CREFCÂ® Intellectual Property Royalty License Fee will be paid on any Companion Loan.
Â 
âCREFCÂ®
Intellectual Property Royalty License Fee Rateâ with respect to each Mortgage Loan is a rate equal to 0.0005%
per annum.
Â 
Appraisal
Reduction Amounts
Â 
After
an Appraisal Reduction Event has occurred with respect to a Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or a Serviced
Whole Loan, an Appraisal Reduction Amount is required to be calculated. An âAppraisal Reduction Eventâ will
occur on the earliest of:
Â 
(1)Â Â Â Â Â 120
days after an uncured delinquency (without regard to the application of any grace period), other than any uncured delinquency
in respect of a balloon payment, occurs in respect of the Mortgage Loan or a related Companion Loan, as applicable;
Â 
(2)Â Â Â Â Â the
date on which a reduction in the amount of Periodic Payments on the Mortgage Loan or Companion Loan, as applicable, or a change
in any other material economic term of the Mortgage Loan or Companion Loan, as applicable (other than an extension of its maturity),
becomes effective as a result of a modification of the related Mortgage Loan or Companion Loan, as applicable, by the special
servicer;
Â 
(3)Â Â Â Â Â 30
days after the date on which a receiver has been appointed for the Mortgaged Property;
Â 
(4)Â Â Â Â Â 30
days after the date on which a borrower or the tenant at a single tenant property declares bankruptcy (and the bankruptcy petition
is not otherwise dismissed within such time);
Â 
(5)Â Â Â Â Â 60
days after the date on which an involuntary petition of bankruptcy is filed with respect to the borrower if not dismissed within
such time;
Â 
(6)Â Â Â Â Â 90
days after an uncured delinquency occurs in respect of a balloon payment with respect to such Mortgage Loan or Companion Loan,
except where a refinancing is anticipated within 120 days after the maturity date of the Mortgage Loan and related Companion Loan
in which case 120 days after such uncured delinquency; and
Â 
(7)Â Â Â Â Â immediately
after a Mortgage Loan or related Companion Loan becomes an REO Loan;
Â 
provided,
however, that the 30-day period referenced in clausesÂ (3) and (4) above will not apply if the related Mortgage Loan
is a Specially Serviced Loan.
Â 
No
Appraisal Reduction Event may occur at any time when the Certificate Balances of all classes of Subordinate Certificates have
been reduced to zero.
Â 
The
âAppraisal Reduction Amountâ for any Distribution Date and for any Mortgage Loan (other than any Non-Serviced
Mortgage Loan) or any Serviced Whole Loan as to which any Appraisal Reduction Event has occurred, will be an amount, calculated
by the special servicer (and, prior to the occurrence of a Consultation Termination Event, in consultation with the Directing
Certificateholder (except with respect to an Excluded Loan) and, after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Control
Termination Event, in consultation with
Â 


381
Â 
Â 
the
Directing Certificateholder (except with respect to an Excluded Loan) and the operating advisor and, after the occurrence and
during the continuance of a Consultation Termination Event, in consultation with the operating advisor), as of the first Determination
Date that is at least 10 business days following the date the special servicer receives an appraisal or conducts a valuation described
below equal to the excess of
Â 
(a)Â Â Â Â Â the
Stated Principal Balance of that Mortgage Loan or the Stated Principal Balance of the applicable Serviced Whole Loan, as the case
may be, over
Â 
(b)Â Â Â Â Â the
excess of
Â 
1.	Â Â the
sum of
Â 

a)90%
  of the appraised value of the related Mortgaged Property as determined (A) by one or
  more MAI appraisals obtained by the special servicer with respect to that Mortgage Loan
  (together with any other Mortgage Loan cross-collateralized with such Mortgage Loan)
  or Serviced Whole Loan with an outstanding principal balance equal to or in excess of
  $2,000,000 (the costs of which will be paid by the master servicer as an Advance), or
  (B) by an internal valuation performed by the special servicer with respect to any Mortgage
  Loan (together with any other Mortgage Loan cross-collateralized with such Mortgage Loan)
  or Serviced Whole Loan with an outstanding principal balance less than $2,000,000, minus
  with respect to any MAI appraisals such downward adjustments as the special servicer
  may make (without implying any obligation to do so) based upon its review of the appraisals
  and any other information it deems relevant, and
Â 

b)all
  escrows, letters of credit and reserves in respect of that Mortgage Loan or Serviced
  Whole Loan as of the date of calculation; over
Â 
2.Â Â Â the
sum as of the Due Date occurring in the month of the date of determination of
Â 

a)to
  the extent not previously advanced by the master servicer or the trustee, all unpaid
  interest due on that Mortgage Loan or Serviced Whole Loan at a per annum rate
  equal to the Mortgage Rate,
Â 

b)all
  P&I Advances on the related Mortgage Loan and all Servicing Advances on the related
  Mortgage Loan or Serviced Whole Loan not reimbursed from the proceeds of such Mortgage
  Loan or Serviced Whole Loan and interest on those Advances at the Reimbursement Rate
  in respect of that Mortgage Loan or Serviced Whole Loan, and
Â 

c)all
  currently due and unpaid real estate taxes and assessments, insurance premiums and ground
  rents, unpaid Special Servicing Fees and all other amounts due and unpaid (including
  any capitalized interest whether or not then due and payable) with respect to such Mortgage
  Loan or Serviced Whole Loan (which taxes, premiums, ground rents and other amounts have
  not been the subject of an Advance by the master servicer, the special servicer or the
  trustee, as applicable).
Â 
Each
Serviced Whole Loan will be treated as a single Mortgage Loan for purposes of calculating an Appraisal Reduction Amount with respect
to the Mortgage Loan and Companion Loan, as applicable, that comprise such Serviced Whole Loan. Any Appraisal Reduction Amount
in respect of any Serviced Pari Passu Mortgage Loan will be allocated, pro rata, between the related Serviced Pari Passu
Mortgage Loan and the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan based upon their respective Stated Principal Balances. For a
Â 


382
Â 
Â 
summary
of the provisions in each Non-Serviced PSA relating to appraisal reductions, see ââServicing of the Non-Serviced
Mortgage Loansâ below.
Â 
The
special servicer will be required to order an appraisal or conduct a valuation promptly upon the occurrence of an Appraisal Reduction
Event (other than with respect to a Non-Serviced Whole Loan). On the first Determination Date occurring on or after the tenth
business day following the receipt of the MAI appraisal or the completion of the valuation, the special servicer will be required
to calculate and report to the master servicer, the trustee, the certificate administrator, the operating advisor and, prior to
the occurrence of any Consultation Termination Event, the Directing Certificateholder, the Appraisal Reduction Amount, taking
into account the results of such appraisal or valuation and receipt of information requested by the special servicer from the
master servicer reasonably necessary to calculate the Appraisal Reduction Amount. Such report will also be forwarded by the master
servicer (or the special servicer if the related Mortgage Loan is a Specially Serviced Loan), to the extent the related Serviced
Pari Passu Companion Loan has been included in a securitization transaction, to the master servicer of such securitization into
which the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan has been sold, or to the holder of any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion
Loan by the master servicer (or the special servicer if the related Mortgage Loan is a Specially Serviced Loan).
Â 
In
the event that the special servicer has not received any required MAI appraisal within 60 days after the Appraisal Reduction Event
(or, in the case of an appraisal in connection with an Appraisal Reduction Event described in clausesÂ (1) and (6) of the
definition of Appraisal Reduction Event above, within 120 days (in the case of clauseÂ (1)) or 90 or 120 days (in the case
of clauseÂ (6)), respectively, after the initial delinquency for the related Appraisal Reduction Event), the Appraisal Reduction
Amount will be deemed to be an amount equal to 25% of the current Stated Principal Balance of the related Mortgage Loan (or Serviced
Whole Loan) until an MAI appraisal is received by the special servicer and the Appraisal Reduction Amount is calculated as of
the first Determination Date that is at least 10 business days after the special servicerâs receipt of such MAI appraisal.
The master servicer will provide (via electronic delivery) the special servicer with any information in its possession that is
reasonably required to determine, redetermine, calculate or recalculate any Appraisal Reduction Amount pursuant to its definition
using reasonable efforts to deliver such information within four business days of the special servicerâs reasonable request
(which request is required to be made promptly, but in no event later than 10Â business days, after the special servicerâs
receipt of the applicable appraisal or preparation of the applicable internal valuation); provided, however, that
the special servicerâs failure to timely make such a request will not relieve the master servicer of its obligation to use
reasonable efforts to provide such information to the special servicer within 4Â business days following the special servicerâs
reasonable request. The master servicer will not calculate Appraisal Reduction Amounts.
Â 
With
respect to each Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) and each Serviced Whole Loan as to which an Appraisal
Reduction Event has occurred (unless the Mortgage Loan or Serviced Whole Loan has remained current for 3Â consecutive Periodic
Payments, and with respect to which no other Appraisal Reduction Event has occurred with respect to that Mortgage Loan during
the preceding 3Â months (for such purposes taking into account any amendment or modification of such Mortgage Loan, any related
Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan or Serviced Whole Loan)), the special servicer is required (i)Â within 30 days of each
anniversary of the related Appraisal Reduction Event and (ii)Â upon its determination that the value of the related Mortgaged
Property has materially changed, to notify the master servicer of the occurrence of such anniversary or determination and to order
an appraisal (which may be an update of a prior appraisal), the cost of which will be
Â 


383
Â 
Â 
paid
by the master servicer as a Servicing Advance (or to the extent it would be a Nonrecoverable Advance, an expense of the issuing
entity paid out of the Collection Account), or to conduct an internal valuation, as applicable. Based upon the appraisal or valuation
and receipt of information reasonably requested by the special servicer from the master servicer necessary to calculate the Appraisal
Reduction Amount, the special servicer is required to determine or redetermine, as applicable, and report to the master servicer,
the trustee, the certificate administrator, the operating advisor and, with respect to any Mortgage Loan other than an Excluded
Loan and prior to the occurrence of a Consultation Termination Event, the Directing Certificateholder, the calculated or recalculated
amount of the Appraisal Reduction Amount with respect to the Mortgage Loan or Serviced Whole Loan, as applicable. Such report
will also be forwarded to the holder of any related Companion Loan by the master servicer (or the special servicer if the related
Mortgage Loan is a Specially Serviced Loan). With respect to any Mortgage Loan other than an Excluded Loan, prior to the occurrence
of a Consultation Termination Event, the special servicer will consult with the Directing Certificateholder, with respect to any
appraisal, valuation or downward adjustment in connection with an Appraisal Reduction Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
special servicer will not be required to obtain an appraisal or valuation with respect to a Mortgage Loan or Serviced Whole Loan
that is the subject of an Appraisal Reduction Event to the extent the special servicer has obtained an appraisal or valuation
with respect to the related Mortgaged Property within the 12-month period prior to the occurrence of the Appraisal Reduction Event.
Instead, the special servicer may use the prior appraisal or valuation in calculating any Appraisal Reduction Amount with respect
to the Mortgage Loan or Serviced Whole Loan, provided that the special servicer is not aware of any material change to
the Mortgaged Property that has occurred that would affect the validity of the appraisal or valuation.
Â 
Each
Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan is subject to provisions in the related Non-Serviced PSA relating to appraisal reductions that are
similar, but not necessarily identical, to the provisions described above. The existence of an appraisal reduction under a Non-Serviced
PSA in respect of the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan will proportionately reduce the master servicerâs or the trusteeâs,
as the case may be, obligation to make P&I Advances on the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan and will generally have the
effect of reducing the amount otherwise available for distributions to the Certificateholders. Pursuant to such Non-Serviced PSA,
the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan will be treated, together with each related Non-Serviced Companion Loan, as a single mortgage
loan for purposes of calculating an appraisal reduction amount with respect to the loans that comprise a Non-Serviced Whole Loan.
Any appraisal reduction calculated with respect to a Non-Serviced Whole Loan will generally be allocated to the related Non-Serviced
Mortgage Loan and the related Non-Serviced Companion Loan, on a pro rata basis based upon their respective Stated Principal
Balances.
Â 
If
any Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or any Serviced Whole Loan previously subject to an Appraisal Reduction
Amount becomes a Corrected Loan, and no other Appraisal Reduction Event has occurred and is continuing with respect to such Mortgage
Loan or Serviced Whole Loan, the Appraisal Reduction Amount and the related Appraisal Reduction Event will cease to exist.
Â 
As
a result of calculating one or more Appraisal Reduction Amounts (and, in the case of any Whole Loan, to the extent allocated in
the related Mortgage Loan), the amount of any required P&I Advance will be reduced, which will have the effect of reducing
the amount of interest available to the most subordinate class of certificates then-outstanding (i.e., first, to ClassÂ G
certificates, second, to the ClassÂ F certificates, third, to the ClassÂ E certificates, fourth, to the ClassÂ D certificates,
fifth, to the ClassÂ C certificates, sixth, to the ClassÂ B
Â 


384
Â 
Â 
certificates,
seventh, to the ClassÂ A-S certificates, and finally, pro rata based on their respective interest entitlements, to
the Senior Certificates). See ââAdvancesâ.
Â 
For
purposes of determining the Controlling Class, Appraisal Reduction Amounts allocated to a related Mortgage Loan will be allocated
to each class of Principal Balance Certificates in reverse sequential order to notionally reduce their Certificate Balances until
the Certificate Balances of each such class is notionally reduced to zero (i.e., first, to ClassÂ G certificates, second,
to the ClassÂ F certificates, third, to the ClassÂ E certificates, fourth, to the ClassÂ D certificates, fifth, to
the ClassÂ C certificates, sixth, to the ClassÂ B certificates, seventh, to the ClassÂ A-S certificates, and finally,
pro rata based on their respective interest entitlements, to the Senior Certificates). With respect to any Appraisal Reduction
Amount calculated for purposes of determining the Controlling Class, the appraised value of the related Mortgaged Property will
be determined on an âas-isâ basis.
Â 
Any
class of Control Eligible Certificates, the Certificate Balance of which (taking into account the application of any Appraisal
Reduction Amounts to notionally reduce the Certificate Balance of such class) has been reduced to less than 25% of its initial
Certificate Balance, is referred to as an âAppraised-Out Classâ. Any Appraised-Out Class will no longer be
the Controlling Class; provided, however, that if at any time, the Certificate Balances of the certificates other
than the Control Eligible Certificates have been reduced to zero as a result of principal payments on the Mortgage Loans, then
the Controlling Class will be the most subordinate class of Control Eligible Certificates that has an aggregate Certificate Balance
greater than zero without regard to any Appraisal Reduction Amounts. The holders of the majority (by Certificate Balance) of an
Appraised-Out Class will have the right, at their sole expense, to require the special servicer to order a second appraisal of
any Mortgage Loan (or Serviced Whole Loan) for which an Appraisal Reduction Event has occurred (such holders, the âRequesting
Holdersâ). The special servicer will use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that such appraisal is delivered within
30 days from receipt of the Requesting Holdersâ written request and will ensure that such appraisal is prepared on an âas-isâ
basis by an MAI appraiser. Upon receipt of such supplemental appraisal, the special servicer will be required to determine, in
accordance with the Servicing Standard, whether, based on its assessment of such supplemental appraisal, any recalculation of
the applicable Appraisal Reduction Amount is warranted and, if so warranted, will recalculate such Appraisal Reduction Amount
based upon such supplemental appraisal and receipt of information requested by the special servicer from the master servicer as
described above. If required by any such recalculation, the applicable Appraised-Out Class will be reinstated as the Controlling
Class and each other Appraised-Out Class will, if applicable, have its related Certificate Balance notionally restored to the
extent required by such recalculation of the Appraisal Reduction Amount.
Â 
Any
Appraised-Out Class for which the Requesting Holders are challenging the special servicerâs Appraisal Reduction Amount determination
may not exercise any direction, control, consent and/or similar rights of the Controlling Class until such time, if any, as such
class is reinstated as the Controlling Class; the rights of the Controlling Class will be exercised by the most senior class of
Control Eligible Certificates, if any, during such period.
Â 
With
respect to each Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, the related Non-Serviced Directing Certificateholder will be subject to provisions
similar to those described above. See âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâThe Whole LoansâThe Non-Serviced
Pari Passu Whole Loansâ and âPooling and Servicing AgreementâServicing of the Non-Serviced
Mortgage Loansâ.
Â 


385
Â 
Â 
Maintenance
of Insurance
Â 
To
the extent permitted by the related Mortgage Loan and required by the Servicing Standard, the master servicer (with respect to
the Mortgage Loans and any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, but excluding any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) will be required
to use efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to cause each borrower to maintain, and the special servicer (with respect
to REO Properties other than the Mortgaged Property securing a Non-Serviced Whole Loan and subject to the conditions set forth
in the following sentence) will maintain, for the related Mortgaged Property all insurance coverage required by the terms of the
related Mortgage Loan documents; provided, however, that the master servicer (with respect to Mortgage Loans and
any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loans) will not be required to cause the borrower to maintain and the special servicer
(with respect to REO Properties) will not be required to maintain terrorism insurance to the extent that the failure of the related
borrower to do so is an Acceptable Insurance Default (as defined below) or if the trustee does not have an insurable interest.
Insurance coverage is required to be in the amounts (which, in the case of casualty insurance, is generally equal to the lesser
of the outstanding principal balance of the related Mortgage Loan and the replacement cost of the related Mortgaged Property),
and from an insurer meeting the requirements, set forth in the related Mortgage Loan documents. If the borrower does not maintain
such coverage, the master servicer (with respect to such Mortgage Loans and any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) or
the special servicer (with respect to REO Properties other than a Mortgaged Property securing a Non-Serviced Whole Loan), as the
case may be, will be required to maintain such coverage to the extent such coverage is available at commercially reasonable rates
and the trustee has an insurable interest, as determined by the master servicer (with respect to the Mortgage Loans and any related
Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) or special servicer (with respect to REO Properties other than a Mortgaged Property securing
a Non-Serviced Whole Loan), as applicable, in accordance with the Servicing Standard; provided that if any Mortgage Loan
documents permit the holder thereof to dictate to the borrower the insurance coverage to be maintained on such Mortgaged Property,
the master servicer or, with respect to REO Property, the special servicer will impose or maintain such insurance requirements
as are consistent with the Servicing Standard taking into account the insurance in place at the origination of the Mortgage Loan;
provided, further, that with respect to the immediately preceding proviso the master servicer will be obligated
to use efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to cause the borrower to maintain (or to itself maintain) insurance against
property damage resulting from terrorist or similar acts unless the borrowerâs failure is an Acceptable Insurance Default
as determined by the special servicer with (with respect to any Mortgage Loan other than an Excluded Loan and unless a Control
Termination Event has occurred and is continuing) the consent of the Directing Certificateholder. See âDescription of

to the Mortgage LoansâTerrorism Insurance May Not Be Available for All Mortgaged Propertiesâ.
Â 
Notwithstanding
any contrary provision above, the master servicer will not be required to maintain, and will not be in default for failing to
obtain, any earthquake or environmental insurance on any Mortgaged Property unless (other than with respect to a Mortgaged Property
securing a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) such insurance was required at the time of origination of the related Mortgage Loan, the
trustee has an insurable interest and such insurance is currently available at commercially reasonable rates. In addition, the
master servicer and special servicer will be entitled to rely on insurance consultants (at the applicable servicerâs expense)
in determining whether any insurance is available at commercially reasonable rates. After the master servicer determines that
a Mortgaged Property other than the Mortgaged Property securing a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan is
Â 


386
Â 
Â 
located
in an area identified as a federally designated special flood hazard area (and flood insurance has been made available), the master
servicer will be required to use efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard (1)Â to cause the borrower to maintain (to
the extent required by the related Mortgage Loan documents), and (2)Â if the borrower does not so maintain, to itself maintain
to the extent the trustee, as mortgagee, has an insurable interest in the Mortgaged Property and such insurance is available at
commercially reasonable rates (as determined by the master servicer in accordance with the Servicing Standard but only to the
extent that the related Mortgage Loan permits the lender to require the coverage) a flood insurance policy in an amount representing
coverage not less than the lesser of (x)Â the outstanding principal balance of the related Mortgage Loan (and any related
Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) and (y)Â the maximum amount of insurance which is available under the National Flood Insurance
Act of 1968, as amended, plus such additional excess flood coverage with respect to the Mortgaged Property, if any, in an amount
consistent with the Servicing Standard.
Â 
Notwithstanding
the foregoing, with respect to the Mortgage Loans (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) and any related Serviced Pari Passu
Companion Loan that either (x)Â require the borrower to maintain âall-riskâ property insurance (and do not expressly
permit an exclusion for terrorism) or (y)Â contain provisions generally requiring the applicable borrower to maintain insurance
in types and against such risks as the holder of such Mortgage Loan and any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan reasonably
requires from time to time in order to protect its interests, the master servicer will be required to, consistent with the Servicing
Standard, (A) monitor in accordance with the Servicing Standard whether the insurance policies for the related Mortgaged Property
contain exclusions in addition to those customarily found in insurance policies for mortgaged properties similar to the Mortgaged
Properties on or prior to September 11, 2001 (âAdditional Exclusionsâ) (provided that the master servicer
will be entitled to conclusively rely upon certificates of insurance in determining whether such policies contain Additional Exclusions),
(B) request the borrower to either purchase insurance against the risks specified in the Additional Exclusions or provide an explanation
as to its reasons for failing to purchase such insurance, and (C) notify the special servicer if it has knowledge that any insurance
policy contains Additional Exclusions or if it has knowledge that any borrower fails to purchase the insurance requested to be
purchased by the master servicer pursuant to clauseÂ (B) above. If the special servicer determines in accordance with the
Servicing Standard that such failure is not an Acceptable Insurance Default, the special servicer will be required to notify the
master servicer and the master servicer will be required to use efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to cause such insurance
to be maintained. If the special servicer determines that such failure is an Acceptable Insurance Default, it will be required
to promptly deliver such conclusions in writing to the 17g-5 Information Provider for posting to the 17g-5 Information Providerâs
website for those Mortgage Loans that (i)Â have one of the 10 highest outstanding principal balances of the Mortgage Loans
then included in the issuing entity or (ii)Â comprise more than 5% of the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loans
then included in the issuing entity.
Â 
âAcceptable
Insurance Defaultâ means, with respect to any Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Whole
Loan, a default under the related Mortgage Loan documents arising by reason of (i)Â any failure on the part of the related
borrower to maintain with respect to the related Mortgaged Property specific insurance coverage with respect to, or an all-risk
casualty insurance policy that does not specifically exclude, terrorist or similar acts, and/or (ii)Â any failure on the part
of the related borrower to maintain with respect to the related Mortgaged Property insurance coverage with respect to damages
or casualties caused by terrorist or similar acts upon terms not materially less favorable than those in place as of the Closing
Date, in each case, as to which default the
Â 


387
Â 
Â 
master
servicer and the special servicer may forbear taking any enforcement action; provided that, subject to the consent or consultation
rights of the Directing Certificateholder or the holder of any Companion Loan as described under ââThe Directing
CertificateholderâMajor Decisionsâ, the special servicer has determined in its reasonable judgment based on inquiry
consistent with the Servicing Standard that either (a) such insurance is not available at commercially reasonable rates and that
such hazards are not at the time commonly insured against for properties similar to the related Mortgaged Property and located
in or around the region in which such related Mortgaged Property is located, or (b) such insurance is not available at any rate.
Â 
During
the period that the special servicer is evaluating the availability of such insurance, or waiting for a response from the Directing
Certificateholder, neither the master servicer nor the special servicer will be liable for any loss related to its failure to
require the borrower to maintain (or its failure to maintain) such insurance and neither will be in default of its obligations
as a result of such failure.
Â 
The
special servicer will be required to maintain (or cause to be maintained) fire and hazard insurance on each REO Property (other
than any REO Property with respect to a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan), to the extent obtainable at commercially reasonable rates
and the trustee has an insurable interest, in an amount that is at least equal to the lesser of (1)Â the full replacement
cost of the improvements on the REO Property, and (2)Â the outstanding principal balance owing on the related Mortgage Loan
and any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan or REO Loan, as applicable, and in any event, the amount necessary to avoid
the operation of any co-insurance provisions. In addition, if the REO Property is located in an area identified as a federally
designated special flood hazard area, the special servicer will be required to cause to be maintained, to the extent available
at commercially reasonable rates (as determined by the special servicer (prior to the occurrence and continuance of a Control
Termination Event and other than in respect of any Excluded Loan, with the consent of the Directing Certificateholder) in accordance
with the Servicing Standard), a flood insurance policy meeting the requirements of the current guidelines of the Federal Insurance
Administration in an amount representing coverage not less than the maximum amount of insurance that is available under the National
Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended.
Â 
The
PSA provides that the master servicer may satisfy its obligation to cause each borrower to maintain a hazard insurance policy
and the master servicer or special servicer may satisfy its obligation to maintain hazard insurance by maintaining a blanket or
master single interest or force-placed policy insuring against hazard losses on the Mortgage Loans and related Serviced Pari Passu
Companion Loan and REO Properties (other than the Mortgaged Property securing a Non-Serviced Whole Loan), as applicable. Any losses
incurred with respect to Mortgage Loans (and any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) or REO Properties due to uninsured
risks (including earthquakes, mudflows and floods) or insufficient hazard insurance proceeds may adversely affect payments to
Certificateholders. Any cost incurred by the master servicer or special servicer in maintaining a hazard insurance policy, if
the borrower defaults on its obligation to do so, will be advanced by the master servicer as a Servicing Advance and will be charged
to the related borrower. Generally, no borrower is required by the Mortgage Loan documents to maintain earthquake insurance on
any Mortgaged Property and the special servicer will not be required to maintain earthquake insurance on any REO Properties. Any
cost of maintaining that kind of required insurance or other earthquake insurance obtained by the special servicer will be paid
out of the REO Account or advanced by the master servicer as a Servicing Advance.
Â 


388
Â 
Â 
The
costs of the insurance may be recovered by the master servicer or the trustee, as the case may be, from reimbursements received
from the borrower or, if the borrower does not pay those amounts, as a Servicing Advance as set forth in the PSA. All costs and
expenses incurred by the special servicer in maintaining the insurance described above on REO Properties will be paid out of the
related REO Account or, if the amount in such account is insufficient, such costs and expenses will be advanced by the master
servicer to the special servicer as a Servicing Advance to the extent that such Servicing Advance is not determined to be a Nonrecoverable
Advance.
Â 
No
pool insurance policy, special hazard insurance policy, bankruptcy bond, repurchase bond or certificate guarantee insurance will
be maintained with respect to the Mortgage Loans, nor will any Mortgage Loan be subject to FHA insurance.
Â 
Modifications,
Waivers and Amendments
Â 
Except
as otherwise set forth in this paragraph, the special servicer (with respect to Specially Serviced Loans) or the master servicer
(with respect to Mortgage Loans that are not Specially Serviced Loans or Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans) may not waive, modify or
amend (or consent to waive, modify or amend) any provision of a Mortgage Loan and/or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan that is
not in default or as to which default is not reasonably foreseeable except for (1)Â the waiver of any due-on-sale clause or
due-on-encumbrance clause to the extent permitted in the PSA, and (2)Â any waiver, modification or amendment more than 3Â months
after the Closing Date that would not be a âsignificant modificationâ of the Mortgage Loan within the meaning of Treasury
regulations SectionÂ 1.860G-2(b) or otherwise cause any Trust REMIC to fail to qualify as a REMIC or any Trust REMIC to be
subject to tax under the REMIC provisions. The master servicer will not be permitted under the PSA to agree to any modifications,
waivers and amendments that constitute Major Decisions without the consent of the special servicer (which consent will be deemed
given (unless earlier objected to by the special servicer) 15 business days after the special servicerâs receipt of the
master servicerâs written recommendation and analysis with respect to such Major Decision and all information reasonably
requested by the special servicer, and reasonably available to the master servicer, in order to grant or withhold such consent)
except certain non-material consents and waivers described in the PSA and as permitted under the Mortgage Loan documents.
Â 
If,
and only if, the special servicer determines that a modification, waiver or amendment (including the forgiveness or deferral of
interest or principal or the substitution or release of collateral or the pledge of additional collateral) of the terms of a Specially
Serviced Loan with respect to which a payment default or other material default has occurred or a payment default or other material
default is, in the special servicerâs judgment, reasonably foreseeable, is reasonably likely to produce a greater recovery
on a net present value basis (the relevant discounting to be performed at the related Mortgage Rate) to the issuing entity and,
if applicable, the holders of any applicable Companion Loan, than liquidation of such Specially Serviced Loan, then the special
servicer may, but is not required to, agree to a modification, waiver or amendment of the Specially Serviced Loan, subject to
(x)Â the restrictions and limitations described below, (y)Â with respect to any Major Decision, prior to the occurrence
and continuance of a Control Termination Event, the approval of the Directing Certificateholder (or after the occurrence and continuance
of a Control Termination Event, but prior to a Consultation Termination Event upon consultation with the Directing Certificateholder)
as provided in the PSA and described in this prospectus and (z)Â with respect to a Serviced Whole Loan, the rights of the
holder of the related Companion Loan, as applicable, to advise or consult with the special servicer with respect to, or consent
to, such modification, waiver or amendment, in each case, pursuant to the terms of the related
Â 


389
Â 
Â 
intercreditor
agreement and, with respect to a Mortgage Loan that has mezzanine debt, the rights of the mezzanine lender to consent to such
modification, waiver or amendment, in each case, pursuant to the terms of the related intercreditor agreement.
Â 
In
connection with (i)Â the release of a Mortgaged Property (other than a Mortgaged Property securing a Non-Serviced Whole Loan)
or any portion of such a Mortgaged Property from the lien of the related Mortgage or (ii)Â the taking of a Mortgaged Property
(other than a Mortgaged Property securing a Non-Serviced Whole Loan) or any portion of such a Mortgaged Property by exercise of
the power of eminent domain or condemnation, if the related Mortgage Loan documents require the master servicer or the special
servicer, as applicable, to calculate (or to approve the calculation of the related borrower of) the loan-to-value ratio of the
remaining Mortgaged Property or Mortgaged Properties or the fair market value of the real property constituting the remaining
Mortgaged Property or Mortgaged Properties, for purposes of REMIC qualification of the related Mortgage Loan, then such calculation
will, unless then permitted by the REMIC provisions, exclude the value of personal property and going concern value, if any, as
determined by an appropriate third party.
Â 
The
special servicer is required to use its reasonable efforts to the extent reasonably possible to fully amortize a modified Mortgage
Loan prior to the Rated Final Distribution Date. The special servicer may not agree to a modification, waiver or amendment of
any term of any Specially Serviced Loan if that modification, waiver or amendment would:
Â 
(1)Â Â Â Â Â extend
the maturity date of the Specially Serviced Loan to a date occurring later than the earlier of (A) 5 years prior to the Rated
Final Distribution Date and (B) if the Specially Serviced Loan is secured solely or primarily by a leasehold estate and not the
related fee interest, the date occurring 20Â years or, to the extent consistent with the Servicing Standard giving due consideration
to the remaining term of the ground lease and, with respect to any Mortgage Loan other than an Excluded Loan, prior to the occurrence
and continuance of a Control Termination Event, with the consent of the Directing Certificateholder, 10 years, prior to the end
of the current term of the ground lease, plus any options to extend exercisable unilaterally by the borrower; or
Â 
(2)Â Â Â Â Â provide
for the deferral of interest unless interest accrues on the Mortgage Loan or the Serviced Whole Loans, generally, at the related
Mortgage Rate.
Â 
If
the special servicer gives notice of any modification, waiver or amendment of any term of any Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced
Whole Loan) or related Companion Loan, the special servicer will be required to notify the master servicer, the holder of any
related Companion Loan, the related mortgage loan seller (so long as such mortgage loan seller is not a master servicer or sub-servicer
of such Mortgage Loan or the Directing Certificateholder), the operating advisor (after the occurrence and during the continuance
of a Control Termination Event), the certificate administrator, the trustee, the Directing Certificateholder (with respect to
any Mortgage Loan other than an Excluded Loan, and unless a Consultation Termination Event has occurred), and the 17g-5 Information
Provider, who will thereafter post any such notice to the 17g-5 Information Providerâs website. If the master servicer gives
notice of any modification, waiver or amendment of any term of any such Mortgage Loan or related Companion Loan, the master servicer
will be required to notify the certificate administrator, the trustee, the special servicer (and, unless a Consultation Termination
Event has occurred, the special servicer will be required to forward any such notice with respect to any Mortgage Loan other than
an Excluded Loan to the Directing Certificateholder), the related mortgage loan seller (so long as such mortgage loan seller is
not a master servicer or sub-servicer of such Mortgage Loan or the Directing Certificateholder), the holder of any related Companion
Loan and the 17g-5 Information
Â 


390
Â 
Â 
Provider,
who will be required to thereafter post any such notice to the 17g-5 Information Providerâs website. The party providing
notice will be required to deliver to the custodian for deposit in the related Mortgage File, an original counterpart of the agreement
related to the modification, waiver or amendment, promptly following the execution of that agreement, and if required, a copy
to the master servicer and to the holder of any related Companion Loan, all as set forth in the PSA. Copies of each agreement
whereby the modification, waiver or amendment of any term of any Mortgage Loan is effected are required to be available for review
during normal business hours at the offices of the custodian. See âDescription of the CertificatesâReports to Certificateholders;
Certain Available Informationâ.
Â 
The
modification, waiver or amendment of a Serviced Whole Loan or a Mortgage Loan that has a related mezzanine loan will be subject
to certain limitations set forth in the related intercreditor agreement. See âRisk FactorsâRisks Relating to the
Mortgage LoansâOther Financings or Ability to Incur Other Indebtedness Entails Riskâ.
Â 
Enforcement
of âDue-on-Saleâ and âDue-on-Encumbranceâ Provisions
Â 
The
master servicer (with respect to a Mortgage Loan that is not a Specially Serviced Loan or a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or special
servicer (with respect to Specially Serviced Loans and REO Properties) will determine, in a manner consistent with the Servicing
Standard, whether (a) to exercise any right it may have with respect to a Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan)
and any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan containing a âdue-on-saleâ clauseÂ (1) to accelerate the payments
on that Mortgage Loan and any related Companion Loan, as applicable, or (2)Â to withhold its consent to any sale or transfer,
consistent with the Servicing Standard or (b)Â to waive its right to exercise such rights; provided, however,
that (i)Â with respect to such waiver of rights, if such waiver is by the master servicer, the master servicer has
obtained the consent of the special servicer (provided that such consent will be deemed given 15 business days (or 5 business
days after the time period provided for in any related Intercreditor Agreement) after the special servicerâs receipt of
the master servicerâs written recommendation and analysis with respect to such waiver and all information reasonably requested
by the special servicer, and reasonably available to the master servicer, in order to grant or withhold such consent) and prior
to the occurrence and continuance of any Control Termination Event and other than with respect to an Excluded Loan, the special
servicer has obtained the prior written consent (or deemed consent) of the Directing Certificateholder (or after the occurrence
and continuance of a Control Termination Event, but prior to a Consultation Termination Event and other than with respect to an
Excluded Loan, the special servicer has consulted with the Directing Certificateholder), which consent will be deemed given 10
business days after the Directing Certificateholderâs receipt of the special servicerâs written recommendation and
analysis with respect to such waiver and all information reasonably requested by the Directing Certificateholder, and reasonably
available to the special servicer, with respect to such proposed waiver or proposed granting of consent and (ii)Â with respect
to any Mortgage Loan (either alone or, if applicable, with other related Mortgage Loans) that exceeds specified size thresholds
(either actual or relative), or that fails to satisfy certain other applicable conditions imposed by the Rating Agencies, a Rating
Agency Confirmation is received by the master servicer or the special servicer, as the case may be, from each Rating Agency and
a confirmation of any applicable rating agency that such action will not result in the downgrade, withdrawal or qualification
of its then-current ratings of any class of securities backed, wholly or partially, by any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan
(if any).
Â 


391
Â 
Â 
With
respect to a Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) and any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan with a
âdue-on-encumbranceâ clause, the master servicer (with respect to a Mortgage Loan that is not a Specially Serviced
Loan or a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or special servicer (with respect to Specially Serviced Loans and REO Properties) will determine,
in a manner consistent with the Servicing Standard, whether (a) to exercise any right it may have with respect to a Mortgage Loan
containing a âdue-on-encumbranceâ clauseÂ (1) to accelerate the payments thereon, or (2) to withhold its consent
to the creation of any additional lien or other encumbrance, consistent with the Servicing Standard or (b) to waive its right
to exercise such rights, provided, however, that the master servicer, prior to itself taking such an action, has
obtained the consent (or deemed consent) of the special servicer (provided that such consent will be deemed given 15 business
days (or 5 business days after the time period provided for in any related Intercreditor Agreement) after the special servicerâs
receipt of the master servicerâs written recommendation and analysis with respect to such waiver and all information reasonably
requested by the special servicer, and reasonably available to the master servicer, in order to grant or withhold such consent),
(i) prior to the occurrence and continuance of any Control Termination Event and other than with respect to an Excluded Loan,
the special servicer has obtained the prior written consent (or deemed consent) of the Directing Certificateholder (or after the
occurrence and continuance of a Control Termination Event, but prior to a Consultation Termination Event and other than with respect
to an Excluded Loan, the special servicer has consulted with the Directing Certificateholder), which consent will be deemed given
10 business days after the Directing Certificateholderâs receipt of the special servicerâs written recommendation
and analysis with respect to such waiver and all information reasonably requested by the Directing Certificateholder, and reasonably
available to the special servicer, with respect to such proposed waiver or proposed granting of consent and (ii)Â with respect
to any Mortgage Loan (either alone or, if applicable, with other related Mortgage Loans) that exceeds specified size thresholds
(either actual or relative), or that fails to satisfy certain other applicable conditions imposed by the Rating Agencies, the
master servicer or the special servicer has received a Rating Agency Confirmation from each Rating Agency and a confirmation of
any applicable rating agency that such action will not result in the downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of its then-current
ratings of any class of securities backed, wholly or partially, by any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan (if any).
Â 
Any
modification, extension, waiver or amendment of the payment terms of a Non-Serviced Whole Loan will be required to be structured
so as to be consistent with the servicing standard under the related Non-Serviced PSA and the allocation and payment priorities
in the related loan documents and the related Intercreditor Agreement, such that neither the issuing entity as holder of such
Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan nor any holder of the related Non-Serviced Companion Loan gains a priority over the other holder that
is not reflected in the related loan documents and the related Intercreditor Agreement.
Â 
Inspections;
Collection of Operating Information
Â 
The
master servicer will be required to perform (at its own expense) or cause to be performed (at its own expense) physical inspections
of each Mortgaged Property relating to a Mortgage Loan (other than the Mortgaged Property securing a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan,
which is subject to inspection pursuant to the related Non-Serviced PSA, and other than a Specially Serviced Loan) with a Stated
Principal Balance of (A) $2,000,000 or more at least once every 12 months and (B) less than $2,000,000 at least once every 24
months, in each case commencing in the calendar year 2016 unless a physical inspection has been performed by the special servicer
within the previous 12 months; provided, further, however, that if any scheduled payment becomes more than
60 days delinquent on the
Â 


392
Â 
Â 
related
Mortgage Loan, the special servicer is required to inspect or cause to be inspected the related Mortgaged Property as soon as
practicable after the Mortgage Loan becomes a Specially Serviced Loan and annually thereafter for so long as the Mortgage Loan
remains a Specially Serviced Loan (the cost of which inspection, to the extent not paid by the related borrower, will be reimbursed
first from default interest and late charges constituting additional compensation of the special servicer on the related
Mortgage Loan (but with respect to a Serviced Whole Loan, only amounts available for such purpose under the related Intercreditor
Agreement) and then from the Collection Account as an expense of the issuing entity, and in the case of a Serviced Whole
Loan, as an expense of the holders of the related Serviced Pari Passu Mortgage Loan and Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, pro
rata and pari passu, to the extent provided in the related Intercreditor Agreement. The special servicer or the master
servicer, as applicable, will be required to prepare or cause to be prepared a written report of the inspection describing, among
other things, the condition of and any damage to the Mortgaged Property to the extent evident from the inspection and specifying
the existence of any vacancies at the Mortgaged Property of which the preparer of such report has knowledge and the master servicer
or special servicer, as applicable, deems material, of any sale, transfer or abandonment of the Mortgaged Property of which the
preparer of such report has knowledge or that is evident from the inspection, of any adverse change in the condition of the Mortgaged
Property of which the preparer of such report has knowledge or that is evident from the inspection, and that the master servicer
or special servicer, as applicable, deems material, or of any material waste committed on the Mortgaged Property to the extent
evident from the inspection.
Â 
Copies
of the inspection reports referred to above that are delivered to the certificate administrator will be posted to the certificate
administratorâs website for review by Privileged Persons pursuant to the PSA. See âDescription of the CertificatesâReports
to Certificateholders; Certain Available Informationâ.
Â 
Collection
of Operating Information
Â 
With
respect to each Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) that requires the borrower to deliver operating statements,
the special servicer or the master servicer, as applicable, is also required to use reasonable efforts to collect and review the
annual operating statements beginning with calendar year end 2016 of the related Mortgaged Property. Most of the Mortgage Loan
documents obligate the related borrower to deliver annual property operating statements. However, we cannot assure you that any
operating statements required to be delivered will in fact be delivered, nor is the special servicer or the master servicer likely
to have any practical means of compelling the delivery in the case of an otherwise performing Mortgage Loan.
Â 
Special
Servicing Transfer Event
Â 
The
Mortgage Loans (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan), any related Companion Loans and any related REO Properties will be serviced
by the special servicer under the PSA in the event that the servicing responsibilities of the master servicer are transferred
to the special servicer as described below. Such Mortgage Loans and related Companion Loans (including those loans that have become
REO Properties) serviced by the special servicer are referred to in this prospectus collectively as the âSpecially Serviced
Loansâ. The master servicer will be required to transfer its servicing responsibilities to the special servicer with
respect to any Mortgage Loan (including any related Companion Loan) for which the master servicer is responsible for servicing:
Â 
(1)Â Â Â Â Â as
to which a payment default has occurred at its original maturity date, or, if the original maturity date has been extended, at
its extended maturity date; and in the case of
Â 


393
Â 
Â 
a
balloon payment, if the balloon payment is delinquent and the related borrower has not provided the special servicer, as of the
related maturity date, with a written and fully executed (subject only to customary final closing conditions) written commitment
for refinancing from an acceptable lender reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the special servicer (and the special
servicer will promptly forward such commitment to the master servicer), which provides that such refinancing will occur within
120 days of such related maturity date, provided that such Mortgage Loan and any related Companion Loan, as applicable,
will become a Specially Serviced Loan immediately (i)Â if, in the judgment of the special servicer in accordance with the
Servicing Standard, the related borrower fails to diligently pursue such refinancing, or fails to satisfy any condition of such
refinancing or the related borrower fails to pay any Assumed Scheduled Payment on the related due date (subject to any applicable
grace period) at any time before the refinancing, (ii)Â if such refinancing does not occur within 120 days of the related
maturity date (or within such shorter period as the refinancing is scheduled to occur pursuant to the related refinancing commitment),
or (iii)Â the related refinancing commitment is terminated before the refinancing is scheduled to occur;
Â 
(2)Â Â Â Â Â as
to which any Periodic Payment (other than a balloon payment) is more than 60 days delinquent (unless, prior to such Periodic Payment
becoming more than 60 days delinquent, in the case of a Mortgage Loan with an associated mezzanine loan, the holder of the related
Companion Loan or the holder of the related mezzanine debt, as applicable, cures such delinquency);
Â 
(3)Â Â Â Â Â as
to which (i)Â the borrower has entered into or consented to bankruptcy, appointment of a receiver or conservator or a similar
insolvency proceeding, or (ii)Â the borrower has become the subject of a decree or order for that proceeding provided
that, with respect to clauseÂ (ii), that if the appointment, decree or order was involuntary and is stayed or discharged,
or the case dismissed within 60 days, that Mortgage Loan and any related Companion Loan will not be considered a Specially Serviced
Loan during that period, or (iii)Â the borrower has admitted in writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they become
due;
Â 
(4)Â Â Â Â Â as
to which the master servicer or special servicer has received notice of the foreclosure or proposed foreclosure of any lien other
than the Mortgage on the Mortgaged Property;
Â 
(5)Â Â Â Â Â as
to which, in the judgment of the master servicer or special servicer (and, in the case of the special servicer, with respect to
any Mortgage Loan other than an Excluded Loan and unless a Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, with the
consent of the Directing Certificateholder), as applicable, a payment default is imminent or reasonably foreseeable and is not
likely to be cured by the borrower within 60 days;
Â 
(6)Â Â Â Â Â as
to which a default of which the master servicer or special servicer has notice (other than a failure by the related borrower to
pay principal or interest) and which the master servicer or special servicer (and, in the case of the special servicer, with respect
to any Mortgage Loan other than an Excluded Loan and unless a Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, with the
consent of the Directing Certificateholder) determines, in its good faith reasonable judgment, may materially and adversely affect
the interests of the Certificateholders (and, with respect to any Whole Loan, the interest of the Certificateholders and the holders
of the related Companion Loan, as a collective whole (taking into account the pari passu nature of any Companion Loan,
as applicable), has occurred and remains unremedied for the applicable grace period specified in the Mortgage Loan or related
Companion Loan documents, other than in certain circumstances the failure
Â 


394
Â 
Â 
to
maintain terrorism insurance (or if no grace period is specified for events of default that are capable of cure, for 60 days);
or
Â 
(7)Â Â Â Â Â as
to which the master servicer or special servicer (and, in the case of the special servicer, with respect to any Mortgage Loan
other than an Excluded Loan and unless a Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, with the consent of the Directing
Certificateholder) determines that (i)Â a default (other than as described in clauseÂ (5) above) under the Mortgage Loan
or related Companion Loan is imminent or reasonably foreseeable, (ii)Â such default will materially impair the value of the
corresponding Mortgaged Property as security for the Mortgage Loan or related Companion Loan or otherwise materially adversely
affect the interests of Certificateholders (and, with respect to a Whole Loan, the interest of the Certificateholders and the
holders of the related Companion Loan as a collective whole (taking into account the pari passu nature of any Companion
Loans)), and (iii)Â the default will continue unremedied for the applicable cure period under the terms of the Mortgage Loan
or related Companion Loan, or, if no cure period is specified and the default is capable of being cured, for 60 days (provided
that such 60-day grace period does not apply to a default that gives rise to immediate acceleration without application of
a grace period under the terms of the Mortgage Loan or related Companion Loan); provided that any determination that a
special servicing transfer event has occurred under this clauseÂ (7) with respect to any Mortgage Loan or related Companion
Loan solely by reason of the failure (or imminent failure) of the related borrower to maintain or cause to be maintained insurance
coverage against damages or losses arising from acts of terrorism may only be made by the special servicer (and unless a Control
Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, with the consent of the Directing Certificateholder) as described under ââMaintenance
of Insuranceâ above.
Â 
However,
the master servicer will be required to continue to (x)Â receive payments on the Mortgage Loans (and any related Serviced
Pari Passu Companion Loan) (including amounts collected by the special servicer), (y)Â make certain calculations with respect
to the Mortgage Loans and any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan and (z)Â make remittances and prepare certain reports
to the Certificateholders with respect to the Mortgage Loans and any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan. Additionally,
the master servicer will continue to receive the Servicing Fee in respect of the Mortgage Loans (and any related Serviced Pari
Passu Companion Loan) at the Servicing Fee Rate.
Â 
If
the related Mortgaged Property is acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan (and any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan)
(upon acquisition, an âREO Propertyâ) whether through foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or otherwise,
the special servicer will continue to be responsible for its operation and management. If any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan
becomes specially serviced, then the related Mortgage Loan will also become a Specially Serviced Loan. If any Mortgage Loan becomes
a Specially Serviced Loan, then the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan will also become a Specially Serviced Loan. The
master servicer will have no responsibility for the performance by the special servicer of its duties under the PSA. Any Mortgage
Loan (excluding any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) that is or becomes a cross-collateralized Mortgage Loan and is cross-collateralized
with a Specially Serviced Loan will become a Specially Serviced Loan.
Â 
If
any Specially Serviced Loan, in accordance with its original terms or as modified in accordance with the PSA, becomes performing
for at least 3Â consecutive Periodic Payments (provided that no additional event of default is foreseeable in the reasonable
judgment of the special servicer and no other event or circumstance exists that causes such Mortgage Loan or related Companion
Loan to otherwise constitute a Specially Serviced Loan), the special servicer will be required to transfer servicing of such Specially
Serviced Loan (a âCorrected Loanâ) to the master servicer.
Â 


395
Â 
Â 
Asset
Status Report
Â 
The
special servicer will be required to prepare a report (an âAsset Status Reportâ) for each Mortgage Loan (other
than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) and, if applicable, any Serviced Whole Loan that becomes a Specially Serviced Loan not later
than 60 days after the servicing of such Mortgage Loan is transferred to the special servicer. Each Asset Status Report will be
required to be delivered in electronic form to:
Â 

othe
  Directing Certificateholder (but only with respect to any Mortgage Loan other than an
  Excluded Loan and prior to the occurrence of a Consultation Termination Event);
Â 

owith
  respect to any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, the holder of the related
  Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan or, to the extent the related Serviced Pari Passu
  Companion Loan has been included in a securitization transaction, the master servicer
  of such securitization into which the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan has
  been sold;
Â 

othe
  operating advisor (but, other than with respect to an Excluded Loan, only after the occurrence
  and during the continuance of a Control Termination Event);
Â 

othe
  master servicer; and
Â 

othe
  17g-5 Information Provider, which will be required to post such report to the 17g-5 Information
  Providerâs website.
Â 
A
summary of each Final Asset Status Report will be provided to the certificate administrator and the certificate administrator
will be required to post the summary of the Final Asset Status Report to the certificate administratorâs website.
Â 
An
Asset Status Report prepared for each Specially Serviced Loan will be required to include, among other things, the following information:
Â 

oa
  summary of the status of such Specially Serviced Loan and any negotiations with the related
  borrower;
Â 

oa
  discussion of the legal and environmental considerations reasonably known to the special
  servicer, consistent with the Servicing Standard, that are applicable to the exercise
  of remedies and to the enforcement of any related guaranties or other collateral for
  the related Specially Serviced Loan and whether outside legal counsel has been retained;
Â 

othe
  most current rent roll and income or operating statement available for the related Mortgaged
  Property;
Â 

o(A)
  the special servicerâs recommendations on how such Specially Serviced Loan might
  be returned to performing status (including the modification of a monetary term, and
  any workout, restructure or debt forgiveness) and returned to the master servicer for
  regular servicing or foreclosed or otherwise realized upon (including any proposed sale
  of a Defaulted Loan or REO Property), (B) a description of any such proposed or taken
  actions, and (C) the alternative courses of action that were or are being considered
  by the special servicer in connection with the proposed or taken actions;
Â 


396
Â 
Â Â 

othe
  status of any foreclosure actions or other proceedings undertaken with respect to the
  Specially Serviced Loan, any proposed workouts and the status of any negotiations with
  respect to such workouts, and an assessment of the likelihood of additional defaults
  under the related Mortgage Loan or Serviced Whole Loan;
Â 

oa
  description of any amendment, modification or waiver of a material term of any ground
  lease (or any space lease or air rights lease, if applicable) or franchise agreement;
Â 

othe
  decision that the special servicer made, or intends or proposes to make, including a
  narrative analysis setting forth the special servicerâs rationale for its proposed
  decision, including its rejection of the alternatives;
Â 

oan
  analysis of whether or not taking such proposed action is reasonably likely to produce
  a greater recovery on a present value basis than not taking such action, setting forth
  (x)Â the basis on which the special servicer made such determination and (y)Â the
  net present value calculation and all related assumptions;
Â 

othe
  appraised value of the related Mortgaged Property (and a copy of the last obtained appraisal
  of such Mortgaged Property) together with a description of any adjustments to the valuation
  of such Mortgaged Property made by the special servicer together with an explanation
  of those adjustments; and
Â 

osuch
  other information as the special servicer deems relevant in light of the Servicing Standard.
Â 
With
respect to any Mortgage Loan other than an Excluded Loan, if no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the
Directing Certificateholder will have the right to disapprove the Asset Status Report prepared by the special servicer with respect
to a Specially Serviced Loan within 10 business days after receipt of the Asset Status Report. If the Directing Certificateholder
does not disapprove an Asset Status Report within 10 business days or if the special servicer makes a determination, in accordance
with the Servicing Standard, that the disapproval by the Directing Certificateholder (communicated to the special servicer within
10 business days) is not in the best interest of all the Certificateholders, the special servicer will be required to implement
the recommended action as outlined in the Asset Status Report. If the Directing Certificateholder disapproves the Asset Status
Report within the 10 business day period and the special servicer has not made the affirmative determination described above,
the special servicer will be required to revise the Asset Status Report as soon as practicable thereafter, but in no event later
than 30 days after the disapproval. The special servicer will be required to continue to revise the Asset Status Report until
the Directing Certificateholder fails to disapprove the revised Asset Status Report or until the special servicer makes a determination,
in accordance with the Servicing Standard, that the disapproval is not in the best interests of the Certificateholders; provided
that, if the Directing Certificateholder has not approved the Asset Status Report for a period of 60 business days following
the first submission of an Asset Status Report, the special servicer may act upon the most recently submitted form of Asset Status
Report, if consistent with the Servicing Standard.
Â 
If
a Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the special servicer will be required to promptly deliver each Asset
Status Report prepared in connection with a Specially Serviced Loan to the operating advisor (and, with respect to any Mortgage
Loan other than an Excluded Loan and for so long as no Consultation Termination Event has occurred, the Directing Certificateholder).
The operating advisor will be required to provide comments to the special servicer in respect of the Asset Status Report, if any,
within 10
Â 


397
Â 
Â 
business
days following the later of receipt of (i)Â such Asset Status Report or (ii)Â such related additional information reasonably
requested by the operating advisor, and propose possible alternative courses of action to the extent it determines such alternatives
to be in the best interest of the Certificateholders (including any Certificateholders that are holders of the Control Eligible
Certificates), as a collective whole. The special servicer will be obligated to consider such alternative courses of action and
any other feedback provided by the operating advisor (and, with respect to any Mortgage Loan other than an Excluded Loan, so long
as no Consultation Termination Event has occurred, the Directing Certificateholder) in connection with the special servicerâs
preparation of any Asset Status Report. The special servicer will revise the Asset Status Report as it deems necessary to take
into account any input and/or comments from the operating advisor (and, with respect to any Mortgage Loan other than an Excluded
Loan, so long as no Consultation Termination Event has occurred, the Directing Certificateholder), to the extent the special servicer
determines that the operating advisorâs and/or Directing Certificateholderâs input and/or recommendations are consistent
with the Servicing Standard and in the best interest of the Certificateholders as a collective whole (or, with respect to a Serviced
Whole Loan, the best interest of the Certificateholders and the holders of the related Companion Loan, as a collective whole (taking
into account the pari passu nature of such Companion Loan)).
Â 
The
special servicer will not be required to take or to refrain from taking any action because of an objection or comment by the operating
advisor or a recommendation of the operating advisor.
Â 
After
the occurrence and during the continuance of a Control Termination Event but prior to the occurrence of a Consultation Termination
Event, each of the Directing Certificateholder (other than with respect to an Excluded Loan) and the operating advisor will be
entitled to consult with the special servicer and propose alternative courses of action and provide other feedback in respect
of any Asset Status Report. After the occurrence of a Consultation Termination Event, the Directing Certificateholder will have
no right to consult with the special servicer with respect to Asset Status Reports and the special servicer will only be obligated
to consult with the operating advisor with respect to any Asset Status Report as described above. The special servicer may choose
to revise the Asset Status Report as it deems reasonably necessary in accordance with the Servicing Standard to take into account
any input and/or recommendations of the operating advisor or the Directing Certificateholder during the applicable periods described
above, but is under no obligation to follow any particular recommendation of the operating advisor or the Directing Certificateholder.
Â 
With
respect to each Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, the related Non-Serviced Directing Certificateholder will have approval and consultation
rights with respect to any asset status report prepared by the related Non-Serviced Special Servicer with respect to the related
Non-Serviced Whole Loan that are substantially similar, but not identical, to the approval and consultation rights of the Directing
Certificateholder with respect to the Mortgage Loans and the Serviced Whole Loans. See ââServicing of the Non-Serviced
Mortgage Loansâ.
Â 
Realization
Upon Mortgage Loans
Â 
If
a payment default or material non-monetary default on a Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) has occurred,
then, pursuant to the PSA, the special servicer, on behalf of the trustee, may, in accordance with the terms and provisions of
the PSA, at any time institute foreclosure proceedings, exercise any power of sale contained in the related Mortgage, obtain a
deed in lieu of foreclosure, or otherwise acquire title to the related Mortgaged Property, by operation of law or otherwise. The
special servicer is not permitted, however, to cause the trustee to acquire title to any Mortgaged Property, have a
Â 


398
Â 
Â 
receiver
of rents appointed with respect to any Mortgaged Property or take any other action with respect to any Mortgaged Property that
would cause the trustee, for the benefit of the Certificateholders, or any other specified person to be considered to hold title
to, to be a âmortgagee-in-possessionâ of, or to be an âownerâ or an âoperatorâ of such Mortgaged
Property within the meaning of certain federal environmental laws, unless the special servicer has determined in accordance with
the Servicing Standard, based on an updated environmental assessment report prepared by a person who regularly conducts environmental
audits and performed within six months prior to any such acquisition of title or other action (which report will be an expense
of the issuing entity subject to the terms of the PSA) that:
Â 
(a)	such
Mortgaged Property is in compliance with applicable environmental laws or, if not, after consultation with an environmental consultant,
that it would be in the best economic interest of the Certificateholders (and with respect to any Serviced Whole Loan, the related
Companion Holders), as a collective whole as if such Certificateholders and, if applicable, Companion Holders constituted a single
lender, to take such actions as are necessary to bring such Mortgaged Property in compliance with such laws, and
Â 
(b)	there
are no circumstances present at such Mortgaged Property relating to the use, management or disposal of any hazardous materials
for which investigation, testing, monitoring, containment, clean-up or remediation could be required under any currently effective
federal, state or local law or regulation, or that, if any such hazardous materials are present for which such action could be
required, after consultation with an environmental consultant, it would be in the best economic interest of the Certificateholders
(and with respect to any Serviced Whole Loan, the related Companion Holders), as a collective whole as if such Certificateholders
and, if applicable, Companion Holders constituted a single lender, to take such actions with respect to the affected Mortgaged
Property.
Â 
Such
requirement precludes enforcement of the security for the related Mortgage Loan until a satisfactory environmental site assessment
is obtained (or until any required remedial action is taken), but will decrease the likelihood that the issuing entity will become
liable for a material adverse environmental condition at the Mortgaged Property. However, we cannot assure you that the requirements
of the PSA will effectively insulate the issuing entity from potential liability for a materially adverse environmental condition
at any Mortgaged Property.
Â 
If
title to any Mortgaged Property is acquired by the issuing entity (directly or through a single member limited liability company
established for that purpose), the special servicer will be required to sell the Mortgaged Property prior to the close of the
third calendar year beginning after the year of acquisition, unless (1)Â the IRS grants (or does not deny) a qualifying extension
of time to sell the Mortgaged Property or (2)Â the special servicer, the certificate administrator and the trustee receive
an opinion of independent counsel to the effect that the holding of the Mortgaged Property by the Lower-Tier REMIC longer than
the above-referenced 3Â year period will not result in the imposition of a tax on any Trust REMIC or cause any Trust REMIC
to fail to qualify as a REMIC under the Code at any time that any certificate is outstanding. Subject to the foregoing and any
other tax-related limitations, pursuant to the PSA, the special servicer will generally be required to attempt to sell any Mortgaged
Property so acquired in accordance with the Servicing Standard. The special servicer will also be required to ensure that any
Mortgaged Property acquired by the issuing entity is administered so that it constitutes âforeclosure propertyâ within
the meaning of Code SectionÂ 860G(a)(8) at all times, and that the sale of the Mortgaged Property does not result in the receipt
by the issuing entity of any income from nonpermitted assets as described in Code SectionÂ 860F(a)(2)(B). If any Lower-Tier
REMIC acquires title to any
Â 


399
Â 
Â 
Mortgaged
Property, the special servicer, on behalf of such Lower-Tier REMIC, will retain, at the expense of the issuing entity, an independent
contractor to manage and operate the property. The independent contractor generally will be permitted to perform construction
(including renovation) on a foreclosed property only if the construction was more than 10% completed at the time default on the
related Mortgage Loan became imminent. The retention of an independent contractor, however, will not relieve the special servicer
of its obligation to manage the Mortgaged Property as required under the PSA.
Â 
In
general, the special servicer will be obligated to cause any Mortgaged Property acquired as an REO Property to be operated and
managed in a manner that would, in its good faith and reasonable judgment and to the extent commercially feasible, maximize the
issuing entityâs net after-tax proceeds from such property. Generally, no Trust REMIC will be taxable on income received
with respect to a Mortgaged Property acquired by the issuing entity to the extent that it constitutes ârents from real propertyâ,
within the meaning of Code SectionÂ 856(c)(3)(A) and Treasury regulations under the Code. Rents from real property include
fixed rents and rents based on the gross receipts or sales of a tenant but do not include the portion of any rental based on the
net income or profit of any tenant or sub-tenant. No determination has been made whether rent on any of the Mortgaged Properties
meets this requirement. Rents from real property include charges for services customarily furnished or rendered in connection
with the rental of real property, whether or not the charges are separately stated. Services furnished to the tenants of a particular
building will be considered as customary if, in the geographic market in which the building is located, tenants in buildings which
are of similar class are customarily provided with the service. No determination has been made whether the services furnished
to the tenants of the Mortgaged Properties are âcustomaryâ within the meaning of applicable regulations. It is therefore
possible that a portion of the rental income with respect to a Mortgaged Property owned by the issuing entity would not constitute
rents from real property. In addition, it is possible that none of the income with respect to a Mortgaged Property would qualify
if a separate charge is not stated for non-customary services provided to tenants or if such services are not performed by an
independent contractor. Rents from real property also do not include income from the operation of a trade or business on the Mortgaged
Property, such as a hotel property, or rental income attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real
property if the rent attributable to personal property exceeds 15% of the total net rent for the taxable year. Any of the foregoing
types of income may instead constitute ânet income from foreclosure propertyâ, which would be taxable to a REMIC at
the highest marginal federal corporate rate (currently 35%) and may also be subject to state or local taxes. The PSA provides
that the special servicer will be permitted to cause the Lower-Tier REMIC to earn ânet income from foreclosure propertyâ
that is subject to tax if it determines that the net after-tax benefit to Certificateholders is greater than another method of
operating or net leasing the Mortgaged Property. Because these sources of income, if they exist, are already in place with respect
to the Mortgaged Properties, it is generally viewed as beneficial to Certificateholders to permit the issuing entity to continue
to earn them if it acquires a Mortgaged Property, even at the cost of this tax. These taxes would be chargeable against the related
income for purposes of determining the proceeds available for distribution to holders of certificates. See âMaterial
Federal Income Tax ConsiderationsâTaxes That May Be Imposed on a REMICâProhibited Transactionsâ.
Â 
Under
the PSA, the special servicer is required to establish and maintain one or more REO Accounts, to be held on behalf of the trustee
for the benefit of the Certificateholders and with respect to a Serviced Whole Loan, the related Companion Holder, for the retention
of revenues and insurance proceeds derived from each REO Property. The special servicer is required to use the funds in the REO
Account to pay for the proper operation, management,
Â 

400
Â 
Â 
maintenance and disposition of any REO Property,
but only to the extent that amounts on deposit in the REO Account relate to such REO Property. To the extent that amounts in the
REO Account in respect of any REO Property are insufficient to make such payments, the master servicer is required to make a Servicing
Advance, unless it determines such Servicing Advance would be nonrecoverable. On or prior to each Determination Date, the special
servicer is required to deposit all amounts received in respect of each REO Property during the most recently ended Collection
Period, net of any amounts withdrawn to make any permitted disbursements, into the Collection Account; provided that the
special servicer may retain in the REO Account permitted reserves.
Â 
Sale of Defaulted
Loans and REO Properties
Â 
If the special servicer determines in accordance
with the Servicing Standard that no satisfactory arrangements (including by way of discounted payoff) can be made for collection
of delinquent payments thereon and such sale would be in the best economic interests of the Certificateholders or, in the case
of a Serviced Whole Loan, Certificateholders and any holder of the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan (as a collective
whole as if such Certificateholders and Companion Holder constituted a single lender) to attempt to sell a Defaulted Loan (other
than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) and any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan as described below, the special servicer
will be required to use reasonable efforts to solicit offers for each Defaulted Loan on behalf of the Certificateholders and the
holder of any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan in such manner as will be reasonably likely to maximize the value of the
Defaulted Loan on a net present value basis. In the case of each Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, under certain limited circumstances
permitted under the related Intercreditor Agreement, to the extent that such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan is not sold together with
the related Non-Serviced Companion Loan by the special servicer for the related Non-Serviced Whole Loans, the special servicer
will be entitled to sell (with respect to any Mortgage Loan other than an Excluded Loan, with the consent of the Directing Certificateholder
if no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing) such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan if it determines in accordance
with the Servicing Standard that such action would be in the best interests of the Certificateholders. In the absence of a cash
offer at least equal to its outstanding principal balance plus all accrued and unpaid interest and outstanding costs and expenses
and certain other amounts under the PSA (a âPar Purchase Priceâ), the special servicer may purchase the Defaulted
Loan for the Par Purchase Price or may accept the first cash offer received from any person that constitutes a fair price for the
Defaulted Loan. If multiple offers are received during the period designated by the special servicer for receipt of offers, the
special servicer is generally required to select the highest offer. The special servicer is required to give the trustee, the certificate
administrator, the master servicer, the operating advisor and (other than in respect of any Excluded Loan) the Directing Certificateholder
10Â business daysâ prior written notice of its intention to sell any such Defaulted Loan. Neither the trustee nor any
of its affiliates may make an offer for or purchase any Defaulted Loan. âDefaulted Loanâ means a Mortgage Loan
(other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Whole Loan (i)Â that is delinquent at least 60 days in respect of its
Periodic Payments or delinquent in respect of its balloon payment, if any; provided that in respect of a balloon payment,
such period will be 120Â days if the related borrower has provided the special servicer with a written and fully executed commitment
for refinancing of the related Mortgage Loan from an acceptable lender reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the special
servicer; and, in either case, such delinquency is to be determined without giving effect to any grace period permitted by the
related Mortgage or Mortgage Note and without regard to any acceleration of payments under the related Mortgage and Mortgage Note
or (ii)Â as to which the special servicer has, by written notice to the related borrower, accelerated the maturity of the indebtedness
evidenced by the related Mortgage Note.
Â 


401
Â 
Â 
The special servicer will be required to
determine whether any cash offer constitutes a fair price for any Defaulted Loan if the highest offeror is a person other than
an Interested Person. In determining whether any offer from a person other than an Interested Person constitutes a fair price for
any Defaulted Loan, the special servicer will be required to take into account (in addition to the results of any appraisal, updated
appraisal or narrative appraisal that it may have obtained pursuant to the PSA within the prior 9 months), among other factors,
the period and amount of the occupancy level and physical condition of the related Mortgaged Property and the state of the local
economy.
Â 
If the offeror is an Interested Person (provided
that the trustee may not be a offeror), then the trustee will be required to determine whether the cash offer constitutes a fair
price unless (i)Â the offer is equal to or greater than the applicable Par Purchase Price and (ii)Â the offer is the highest
offer received. Absent an offer at least equal to the Par Purchase Price, no offer from an Interested Person will constitute a
fair price unless (A) it is the highest offer received and (B) at least two other offers are received from independent third parties.
In determining whether any offer received from an Interested Person represents a fair price for any such Defaulted Loan, the trustee
will be supplied with and will be required to rely on the most recent appraisal or updated appraisal conducted in accordance with
the PSA within the preceding 9-month period or, in the absence of any such appraisal, on a new appraisal. Except as provided in
the following paragraph, the cost of any appraisal will be covered by, and will be reimbursable as, a Servicing Advance by the
master servicer.
Â 
Notwithstanding anything contained in the
preceding paragraph to the contrary, if the trustee is required to determine whether a cash offer by an Interested Person constitutes
a fair price, the trustee may (at its option and at the expense of the Interested Person) designate an independent third party
expert in real estate or commercial mortgage loan matters with at least 5 yearsâ experience in valuing loans similar to the
subject Mortgage Loan or Serviced Whole Loan, as the case may be, that has been selected with reasonable care by the trustee to
determine if such cash offer constitutes a fair price for such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Whole Loan. If the trustee designates
such a third party to make such determination, the trustee will be entitled to rely conclusively upon such third partyâs
determination. The reasonable fees of, and the costs of all appraisals, inspection reports and broker opinions of value incurred
by any such third party pursuant to this paragraph will be covered by, and will be reimbursable by, the Interested Person; provided
that the trustee will not engage a third party expert whose fees exceed a commercially reasonable amount as determined by the trustee.
Â 
The special servicer is required to use
reasonable efforts to solicit offers for each REO Property on behalf of the Certificateholders and the related Companion Holder(s)
(if applicable) and to sell each REO Property in the same manner as with respect to a Defaulted Loan.
Â 
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing paragraphs,
the special servicer will not be required to accept the highest cash offer for a Defaulted Loan or REO Property if the special
servicer determines (with respect to any Mortgage Loan other than an Excluded Loan, in consultation with the Directing Certificateholder
(unless a Consultation Termination Event exists) and, in the case of a Serviced Whole Loan or an REO Property related to a Serviced
Whole Loan, the related Companion Holder(s)), in accordance with the Servicing Standard (and subject to the requirements of any
related Intercreditor Agreement), that rejection of such offer would be in the best interests of the Certificateholders and, in
the case of a sale of a Serviced Whole Loan or an REO Property related to a Serviced Whole Loan, the related Companion Holder(s)
(as a collective whole as if such Certificateholders and, if applicable, the related Companion Holder(s) constituted a single lender).
In addition, the special servicer may accept a lower offer (from any person other than itself or an affiliate) if it
Â 

402
Â 
Â 
determines,
in its reasonable and good faith judgment, that acceptance of such offer would be in the best interests of the Certificateholders
and, in the case of a Serviced Whole Loan or an REO Property related to a Serviced Whole Loan, the related Companion Holder(s)
(as a collective whole as if such Certificateholders and, if applicable, the related Companion Holder(s) constituted a single lender).
The special servicer will be required to use reasonable efforts to sell all Defaulted Loans prior to the Rated Final Distribution
Date.
Â 
An âInterested Personâ
is the depositor, the master servicer, the special servicer, the operating advisor, the asset representations reviewer, the certificate
administrator, the trustee, the Directing Certificateholder, any sponsor, any Borrower Party, any independent contractor engaged
by the special servicer or any known affiliate of any of the preceding entities, and, with respect to a Whole Loan if it is a Defaulted
Loan, the depositor, the master servicer, the special servicer (or any independent contractor engaged by such special servicer),
or the trustee for the securitization of a Companion Loan, and each related Companion Holder or its representative, any holder
of a related mezzanine loan, or any known affiliate of any such party described above.
Â 
With respect to each Serviced Whole Loan,
pursuant to the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreement(s), if such Serviced Whole Loan becomes a Defaulted Loan, and if the
special servicer determines to sell the related Mortgage Loan in accordance with the discussion in this ââSale of
Defaulted Loans and REO Propertiesâ section, then the special servicer will be required to sell the related Companion
Loan together with such Mortgage Loan as one whole loan and will be required to require that all offers be submitted to the special
servicer in writing. The special servicer will not be permitted to sell the related Mortgage Loan together with the related Companion
Loan if such Serviced Whole Loan becomes a Defaulted Loan without the consent of the holder of the related Companion Loan, unless
the special servicer complies with certain notice and delivery requirements set forth in the PSA. See âDescription of
the Mortgage PoolâThe Whole LoansâThe Serviced Pari Passu Whole Loansâ.
Â 
In addition, with respect to each Non-Serviced
Mortgage Loan, if such Mortgage Loan has become a defaulted loan under the related Non-Serviced PSA, the related Non-Serviced Special
Servicer will generally have the right to sell such Mortgage Loan together with the related Companion Loan as notes evidencing
one whole loan. The issuing entity, as the holder of such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, will have the right to consent to such sale,
provided that the Non-Serviced Special Servicer may sell the related Non-Serviced Whole Loan without such consent if the
required notices and information regarding such sale are provided to the issuing entity in accordance with the related Intercreditor
Agreement. The Directing Certificateholder will be entitled to exercise such consent right so long as no Control Termination Event
has occurred and is continuing, and if a Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the special servicer will exercise
such consent rights. See âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâThe Whole LoansâThe Non-Serviced Pari Passu Whole
Loansâ.
Â 
To the extent that Liquidation Proceeds
collected with respect to any Mortgage Loan are less than the sum of (1)Â the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage
Loan, (2)Â interest accrued on the Mortgage Loan and (3)Â the aggregate amount of outstanding reimbursable expenses (including
any (i)Â unpaid servicing compensation, (ii)Â unreimbursed Servicing Advances, (iii)Â accrued and unpaid interest on
all Advances and (iv)Â additional expenses of the issuing entity) incurred with respect to the Mortgage Loan, the issuing entity
will realize a loss in the amount of the shortfall. The trustee, the master servicer and/or the special servicer will be entitled
to reimbursement out of the Liquidation Proceeds recovered on any Mortgage Loan, prior to the distribution of those Liquidation
Proceeds to Certificateholders, of any and all amounts that represent unpaid servicing compensation in respect of the
Â 

403
Â 
Â 
related Mortgage
Loan, certain unreimbursed expenses incurred with respect to the Mortgage Loan and any unreimbursed Advances (including interest
on Advances) made with respect to the Mortgage Loan. In addition, amounts otherwise distributable on the certificates will be further
reduced by interest payable to the master servicer, the special servicer or trustee on these Advances.
Â 
The Directing Certificateholder
Â 
General
Â 
Subject to the rights of the holder of the
related Companion Loans under the related Intercreditor Agreements as described under ââRights of Holders of Companion
Loansâ below, for so long as no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the Directing Certificateholder
will be entitled to advise (1)Â the special servicer, with respect to all Specially Serviced Loans other than any Excluded
Loan or (2)Â the special servicer, with respect to non-Specially Serviced Loans other than any Excluded Loan, as to all matters
for which the master servicer must obtain the consent or deemed consent of the special servicer (e.g., the Major Decisions)
and (3)Â the special servicer with respect to all Mortgage Loans other than any Excluded Loan for which an extension of maturity
is being considered by the special servicer or by the master servicer subject to the consent or deemed consent of the special servicer,
and will have the right to replace the special servicer with or without cause and have certain other rights under the PSA, each
as described below. With respect to any Mortgage Loan other than an Excluded Loan, upon the occurrence and continuance of a Control
Termination Event, the Directing Certificateholder will have certain consultation rights only, and upon the occurrence of a Consultation
Termination Event, the Directing Certificateholders will not have any consent or consultation rights, as further described below.
Â 
The âDirecting Certificateholderâ
will be the Controlling Class Certificateholder (or its representative) selected by more than 50% of the Controlling Class Certificateholders,
by Certificate Balance, as determined by the certificate registrar from time to time; provided, however, that
Â 
(1)Â Â Â Â Â absent that selection, or
Â 
(2)Â Â Â Â Â until a Directing Certificateholder
is so selected, or
Â 
(3)Â Â Â Â Â upon receipt of a notice from a majority
of the Controlling Class Certificateholders, by Certificate Balance, that a Directing Certificateholder is no longer designated,
the Controlling Class Certificateholder that owns the largest aggregate Certificate Balance of the Controlling Class (or its representative)
will be the Directing Certificateholder;
Â 
provided, however, that (i)Â in the case of
this clauseÂ (3), in the event no one holder owns the largest aggregate Certificate Balance of the Controlling Class, then
there will be no Directing Certificateholder until appointed in accordance with the terms of the PSA, and (ii)Â the certificate
administrator and the other parties to the PSA will be entitled to assume that the identity of the Directing Certificateholder
has not changed until such parties receive written notice of a replacement of the Directing Certificateholder from a party holding
the requisite interest in the Controlling Class (as confirmed by the Certificate Registrar), or the resignation of the then-current
Directing Certificateholder.
Â 
The initial Directing Certificateholder
is expected to be Raith Capital Partners, LLC or an affiliate.
Â 


404
Â 
Â 
A âControlling Class Certificateholderâ
is each holder (or Certificate Owner, if applicable) of a certificate of the Controlling Class as determined by the certificate
registrar from time to time, upon request by any party to the PSA.
Â 
The âControlling Classâ
will be, as of any time of determination, the most subordinate class of Control Eligible Certificates then-outstanding that has
an aggregate Certificate Balance (as notionally reduced by any Appraisal Reduction Amounts allocable to such class) at least equal
to 25% of the initial Certificate Balance of that class; provided, however, that if at any time the Certificate Balances
of the certificates other than the Control Eligible Certificates have been reduced to zero as a result of principal payments on
the Mortgage Loans, then the Controlling Class will be the most subordinate class of Control Eligible Certificates that has a Certificate
Balance greater than zero without regard to any Appraisal Reduction Amounts. The Controlling Class as of the Closing Date will
be the ClassÂ G certificates.
Â 
The âControl Eligible Certificatesâ
will be any of the ClassÂ E, ClassÂ F or ClassÂ G certificates.
Â 
The master servicer, the special servicer,
the operating advisor, the certificate administrator, the trustee or any certificateholder may request that the certificate registrar
determine which class of certificates is the then-current Controlling Class and the certificate registrar must thereafter provide
such information to the requesting party. The depositor, the trustee, the master servicer, the special servicer, the operating
advisor and, for so long as no Consultation Termination Event has occurred, the Directing Certificateholder, may request that the
certificate administrator provide, and the certificate administrator must so provide, a list of the holders (or Certificate Owners,
if applicable) of the Controlling Class. The trustee, the certificate administrator, the master servicer, the special servicer
and the operating advisor may each rely on any such list so provided.
Â 
In the event that no Directing Certificateholder
has been appointed or identified to the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, and the master servicer or special
servicer, as applicable, has attempted to obtain such information from the certificate administrator and no such entity has been
identified to the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, then until such time as the new Directing Certificateholder
is identified to the master servicer and the special servicer, the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, will
have no duty to consult with, provide notice to, or seek the approval or consent of any such Directing Certificateholder as the
case may be.
Â 
The ClassÂ E certificateholders that
are the Controlling Class Certificateholders may waive its rights as the Controlling Class Certificateholders as described in ââControl
Termination Event and Consultation Termination Eventâ below.
Â 
Major Decisions
Â 
Except as otherwise described under ââControl
Termination Event and Consultation Termination Eventâ and ââServicing Overrideâ below and subject
to the rights of the holder of the related Companion Loan under the related Intercreditor Agreement as described under ââRights
of Holders of Companion Loansâ below, (a) with respect to a Mortgage Loan (other than a Specially Serviced Loan or a
Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan), the master servicer will not be permitted to take any of the following actions unless it has obtained
the consent of the special servicer, which consent will be deemed given (unless earlier objected to by the special servicer) 15
business days after the special servicerâs receipt of the master servicerâs written recommendation and analysis with
respect to such Major Decision and all information reasonably requested by the special servicer, and reasonably available to the
Â 

405
Â 
Â 
master servicer, in order to grant or withhold such consent, and (b) with respect to any Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced
Mortgage Loan or an Excluded Loan) or Serviced Whole Loan, prior to the occurrence and continuance of a Control Termination Event,
the special servicer will not be permitted to take any of the following actions and the special servicer will not be permitted
to consent to the master servicerâs taking any of the following actions, as to which the Directing Certificateholder has
objected in writing within 10 business days (or 30 days with respect to clauseÂ (xi) below) after receipt of the special servicerâs
written recommendation and analysis and all information reasonably requested by the Directing Certificateholder, and reasonably
available to the special servicer, in order to grant or withhold such consent (provided that if such written objection has
not been received by the special servicer within such ten-business-day (or 30-day) period, the Directing Certificateholder will
be deemed to have approved such action).
Â 
Each of the following, a âMajor
Decisionâ:
Â 
(i)Â Â Â Â Â any proposed or actual

of additional debt by a borrower or mezzanine debt by a direct or indirect parent of a borrower, to the extent the mortgageeâs

Â 


407
Â 
Â 
Asset Status Report
Â 
With respect to any Mortgage Loan other
than an Excluded Loan, so long as no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the Directing Certificateholder
will have the right to disapprove the Asset Status Report prepared by the special servicer with respect to a Specially Serviced
Loan. If a Consultation Termination Event has occurred, the Directing Certificateholder will have no right to consult with the
special servicer with respect to the Asset Status Reports. See ââAsset Status Reportâ above.
Â 
Replacement of Special Servicer
Â 
With respect to any Mortgage Loan other
than an Excluded Loan, so long as no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the Directing Certificateholder
will have the right to replace the special servicer with or without cause as described under ââReplacement of Special
Servicer Without Causeâ and ââTermination of Master Servicer and Special Servicer for CauseâServicer
Termination Eventsâ below.
Â 
Control Termination Event
and Consultation Termination Event
Â 
With respect to any Mortgage Loan (other
than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan or an Excluded Loan) or Serviced Whole Loan, if a Control Termination Event has occurred and
is continuing, but for so long as no Consultation Termination Event has occurred, the special servicer will not be required to
obtain the consent of the Directing Certificateholder with respect to any of the Major Decisions or Asset Status Reports, but will
be required to consult with the Directing Certificateholder in connection with any Major Decision or Asset Status Report (or any
other matter for which the consent of the Directing Certificateholder would have been required or for which the Directing Certificateholder
would have the right to direct the special servicer if no Control Termination Event had occurred and was continuing) and to consider
alternative actions recommended by the Directing Certificateholder in respect of such Major Decision or Asset Status Report (or
such other matter). Such consultation will not be binding on the special servicer. In the event the special servicer receives no
response from the Directing Certificateholder within 10 business days following its written request for input on any required consultation,
the special servicer will not be obligated to consult with the Directing Certificateholder on the specific matter; provided,
however, that the failure of the Directing Certificateholder to respond will not relieve the special servicer from consulting
with the Directing Certificateholder on any future matters with respect to the related Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced
Mortgage Loan or an Excluded Loan) or Serviced Whole Loan. With respect to any Excluded Special Servicer Loan (that is not also
an Excluded Loan), if any, the Directing Certificateholder (prior to the occurrence and continuance of a Control Termination Event)
will be required to select an Excluded Special Servicer with respect to such Excluded Special Servicer Loan. After the occurrence
and during the continuance of a Control Termination Event or if at any time the applicable Excluded Special Servicer Loan is also
an Excluded Loan, the resigning special servicer will be required to select the related Excluded Special Servicer.
Â 
In addition, if a Control Termination Event
has occurred and is continuing, the special servicer will also be required to consult with the operating advisor in connection
with any Major Decision (and such other matters that are subject to consultation rights of the operating advisor pursuant to the
PSA) and to consider alternative actions recommended by the operating advisor in respect of such Major Decision; provided
that such consultation is on a non-binding basis. In the event the special servicer receives no response from the operating advisor
within 10 business days following the later of (i)Â its written request for input on any required consultation and (ii)Â delivery
of all such additional information reasonably requested by the operating advisor related to the subject matter of such
Â 

408
Â 
Â 
consultation,
the special servicer will not be obligated to consult with the operating advisor on the specific matter; provided, however,
that the failure of the operating advisor to respond will not relieve the special servicer from consulting with the operating advisor
on any future matters with respect to the related Mortgage Loan or Serviced Whole Loan or any other Mortgage Loan. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this prospectus, with respect to any Excluded Loan (regardless of whether a Control Termination
Event has occurred and is continuing), the special servicer or the related Excluded Special Servicer, as applicable, will be required
to consult with the operating advisor, on a non-binding basis, in connection with the related transactions involving proposed Major
Decisions and consider alternative actions recommended by the operating advisor, in respect thereof, in accordance with the procedures
set forth in the PSA for consulting with the operating advisor.
Â 
If a Consultation Termination Event has
occurred, no class of certificates will act as the Controlling Class, and the Directing Certificateholder will have no consultation
or consent rights under the PSA and will have no right to receive any notices, reports or information (other than notices, reports
or information required to be delivered to all Certificateholders) or any other rights as Directing Certificateholder under the
PSA. The special servicer will nonetheless be required to consult with only the operating advisor in connection with Major Decisions,
asset status reports and other material special servicing actions to the extent set forth in the PSA, and no Controlling Class
Certificateholder will be recognized or have any right to approve or be consulted with respect to asset status reports or material
special servicer actions.
Â 
A âControl Termination Eventâ
will occur when (i)Â the ClassÂ E certificates have a Certificate Balance (taking into account the application of any Appraisal
Reduction Amounts to notionally reduce the Certificate Balance of such class) of less than 25% of the initial Certificate Balance
of that class or (ii)Â a holder of the ClassÂ E certificates is the majority Controlling Class Certificateholder and has
irrevocably waived its right, in writing, to exercise any of the rights of the Controlling Class Certificateholder and such rights
have not been reinstated to a successor controlling class certificateholder as described below; provided, however,
that a Control Termination Event will not be deemed continuing in the event that the Certificate Balances of the certificates other
than the Control Eligible Certificates have been reduced to zero as a result of principal payments on the Mortgage Loans.
Â 
A âConsultation Termination Eventâ
will occur when (i)Â there is no class of Control Eligible Certificates that has a then-outstanding Certificate Balance at
least equal to 25% of the initial Certificate Balance of that class, in each case, without regard to the application of any Appraisal
Reduction Amounts; or (ii)Â a holder of the ClassÂ E certificates is the majority Controlling Class Certificateholder and
has irrevocably waived its right, in writing, to exercise any of the rights of the Controlling Class Certificateholder and such
rights have not been reinstated to a successor controlling class certificateholder pursuant to the terms of the PSA; provided
that no Consultation Termination Event resulting solely from the operation of clauseÂ (ii) will be deemed to have existed or
be in continuance with respect to a successor holder of the ClassÂ E certificates that has not irrevocably waived its right
to exercise any of the rights of the Controlling Class Certificateholder; provided, however, that a Consultation
Termination Event will not be deemed continuing in the event that the Certificate Balances of the certificates other than the Control
Eligible Certificates have been reduced to zero as a result of principal payments on the Mortgage Loans.
Â 
With respect to any Excluded Loan, the Directing
Certificateholder or any Controlling Class Certificateholder will not have any consent or consultation rights with respect to the
Â 

409
Â 
Â 
servicing of such Excluded Loan and a Control Termination Event and Consultation Termination Event will be deemed to have occurred
with respect to an Excluded Loan.
Â 
At any time that the Controlling Class Certificateholder
is the holder of a majority of the ClassÂ E certificates and the ClassÂ E certificates are the Controlling Class, it may
waive its right (a) to appoint the Directing Certificateholder and (b) to exercise any of the Directing Certificateholderâs
rights set forth in the PSA by irrevocable written notice delivered to the depositor, certificate administrator, master servicer,
special servicer and operating advisor. During such time, the special servicer will be required to consult with only the operating
advisor in connection with asset status reports and material special servicing actions to the extent set forth in the PSA, and
no Controlling Class Certificateholder will be recognized or have any right to replace the special servicer or approve or be consulted
with respect to asset status reports or material special servicer actions. Any such waiver will remain effective until such time
as the Controlling Class Certificateholder sells or transfers all or a portion of its interest in the certificates to an unaffiliated
third party if such unaffiliated third party then holds the majority of the Controlling Class after giving effect to such transfer.
Following any such sale or transfer of ClassÂ E certificates, the successor ClassÂ E certificateholder that is the Controlling
Class Certificateholder will be reinstated as, and will again have the rights of, the Controlling Class Certificateholder without
regard to any prior waiver by the predecessor certificateholder that was the Controlling Class Certificateholder. The successor
ClassÂ E certificateholder that is the Controlling Class Certificateholder will also have the right to irrevocably waive its
right to appoint the Directing Certificateholder and to exercise any of the rights of the Controlling Class Certificateholder.
In the event of any transfer of the ClassÂ E certificates by a Controlling Class Certificateholder that had irrevocably waived
its rights as described in this paragraph, the successor Controlling Class Certificateholder that purchased such ClassÂ E certificates,
even if it does not waive its rights as described in the preceding sentence, will not have any consent rights with respect to any
Mortgage Loan that became a Specially Serviced Loan prior to such successor Controlling Class Certificateholderâs purchase
of such ClassÂ E certificates and had not become a Corrected Loan prior to such purchase until such Mortgage Loan becomes a
Corrected Loan.
Â 
For a description of certain restrictions
on any modification, waiver or amendment to the Mortgage Loan documents, see ââModifications, Waivers and Amendmentsâ
above.
Â 
Servicing Override
Â 
In the event that the master servicer or
the special servicer, as applicable, determines that immediate action with respect to any Major Decision (or any other matter requiring
consent of the Directing Certificateholder with respect to any Mortgage Loan other than an Excluded Loan, prior to the occurrence
and continuance of a Control Termination Event in the PSA (or any matter requiring consultation with the Directing Certificateholder
or the operating advisor)) is necessary to protect the interests of the Certificateholders (and, with respect to a Serviced Whole
Loan, the interest of the Certificateholders and the holders of any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan), as a collective
whole (taking into account the pari passu nature of any Companion Loans), the master servicer or the special servicer, as
the case may be, may take any such action without waiting for the Directing Certificateholderâs response (or without waiting
to consult with the Directing Certificateholder or the operating advisor, as the case may be); provided that the special
servicer or master servicer, as applicable, provides the Directing Certificateholder (or the operating advisor, if applicable)
with prompt written notice following such action including a reasonably detailed explanation of the basis for such action.
Â 
In addition, neither the master servicer
nor the special servicer (i)Â will be required to take or refrain from taking any action pursuant to instructions or objections
from the
Â 

410
Â 
Â 
Directing Certificateholder or (ii)Â may follow any advice or consultation provided by the Directing Certificateholder
or the holder of a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative) that would (1)Â cause it to violate any applicable
law, the related Mortgage Loan documents, any related Intercreditor Agreement, the PSA, including the Servicing Standard, or the
REMIC provisions, (2)Â expose the master servicer, the special servicer, the certificate administrator, the operating advisor,
the asset representations reviewer, the issuing entity or the trustee to liability, (3)Â materially expand the scope of responsibilities
of the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, under the PSA or (4)Â cause the master servicer or the special
servicer, as applicable, to act, or fail to act, in a manner which in the reasonable judgment of the master servicer or the special
servicer, as applicable, is not in the best interests of the Certificateholders.
Â 
Rights of Holders of Companion
Loans
Â 
With respect to any Non-Serviced Whole Loans,
the Directing Certificateholder will not be entitled to exercise the rights described above, but such rights, or rights substantially
similar to those rights, will be exercisable by the related Non-Serviced Directing Certificateholder. The issuing entity, as the
holder of a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, has consultation rights with respect to certain major decisions relating to the related
Non-Serviced Whole Loan and, other than in respect of an Excluded Loan, so long as no Control Termination Event has occurred and
is continuing, the Directing Certificateholder will be entitled to exercise such consultation rights of the issuing entity pursuant
to the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, other than in respect of an Excluded Loan, so long as no Control
Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the Directing Certificateholder may have certain consent rights in connection
with a sale of a Non-Serviced Whole Loan that has become a defaulted loan under the related Non-Serviced PSA. See also âDescription
of the Mortgage PoolâThe Whole LoansâThe Non-Serviced Pari Passu Whole Loansâ and âServicing of
the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loansâ.
Â 
Similarly, with respect to the Empire Mall
Whole Loan, the Directing Certificateholder will not be entitled to exercise the rights described above, but such rights, or rights
substantially similar to those rights, will be exercisable by the Empire Mall Directing Holder. The issuing entity, as the holder
of the Empire Mall Mortgage Loan has, consultation rights with respect to certain major decisions relating to the Empire Mall Whole
Loan, and, other than in respect of an Excluded Loan, so long as no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the
Directing Certificateholder will be entitled to exercise such consultation rights of the issuing entity pursuant to the terms of
the related Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, other than in respect of an Excluded Loan, so long as no Control Termination
Event has occurred and is continuing, the Directing Certificateholder may have certain consent rights in connection with a sale
of the Empire Mall Whole Loan to the extent that it has become a defaulted loan under the related Non-Serviced PSA. See also âDescription
of the Mortgage PoolâThe Whole LoansâThe Non-Serviced Pari Passu Whole Loans âThe Empire Mall Whole Loanâ
and ââServicing of the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loansâ.
Â 
With respect to a Serviced Pari Passu Mortgage
Loan (other than the Empire Mall Controlling Pari Passu Companion Loan, which has the rights described above) that has a related
Pari Passu Companion Loan, the holder of the related Pari Passu Companion Loan has consultation rights with respect to certain
major decisions and consent rights in connection with the sale of the related Serviced Whole Loan if it has become a Defaulted
Loan. See âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâThe Whole LoansâThe Serviced Pari Passu Whole Loansâ
and âSale of Defaulted Loans and REO Propertiesâ.
Â

Â 
Â 
Limitation on Liability
of Directing Certificateholder
Â 
The Directing Certificateholder will not
be liable to the issuing entity or the Certificateholders for any action taken, or for refraining from the taking of any action,
or for errors in judgment. However, the Directing Certificateholder will not be protected against any liability to the Controlling
Class Certificateholders that would otherwise be imposed by reason of willful misconduct, bad faith or negligence in the performance
of duties or by reason of reckless disregard of obligations or duties owed to the Controlling Class Certificateholders.
Â 
Each Certificateholder will acknowledge
and agree, by its acceptance of its certificates, that the Directing Certificateholder:
Â 
(a)Â may have special
relationships and interests that conflict with those of holders of one or more classes of certificates;
Â 
(b)Â may act solely in the
interests of the holders of the Controlling Class;
Â 
(c)Â does not have any
liability or duties to the holders of any class of certificates other than the Controlling Class;
Â 
(d)Â may take actions that
favor the interests of the holders of one or more Classes including the Controlling Class over the interests of the holders of
one or more other classes of certificates; and
Â 
(e)Â will have no liability
whatsoever (other than to a Controlling Class Certificateholder) for having so acted as set forth in (a) â (d) above, and
no Certificateholder may take any action whatsoever against the Directing Certificateholder or any director, officer, employee,
agent or principal of the Directing Certificateholder for having so acted.
Â 
The taking of, or refraining from taking,
any action by the master servicer or the special servicer in accordance with the direction of or approval of the Directing Certificateholder,
which does not violate the terms of any Mortgage Loan, any law or the accepted servicing practices or the provisions of the PSA
or the related Intercreditor Agreement, will not result in any liability on the part of the master servicer or the special servicer.
Â 
Each Certificateholder will acknowledge
and agree, by its acceptance of its certificates, that the holders of a Non-Serviced Companion Loan or their respective designees
(e.g., the related Non-Serviced Directing Certificateholder) will have limitations on liability with respect to actions
taken in connection with the related Mortgage Loan similar to the limitations of the Directing Certificateholder described above
pursuant to the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreement and the Non-Serviced PSA. See âDescription of the Mortgage
PoolâThe Whole LoansâThe Non-Serviced Pari Passu Whole Loansâ.
Â 
The Operating Advisor
Â 
General
Â 
The operating advisor will act solely as
a contracting party to the extent, and in accordance with the standard of care, set forth in the PSA, and will have no fiduciary
duty to any party. The operating advisorâs duties will be limited to its specific duties under the PSA, and the operating
advisor will have no duty or liability to any particular class of certificates or any Certificateholder. The operating advisor
is not the special servicer or a sub-servicer and will not be charged with changing the outcome on any particular Specially Serviced
Â 

412
Â 
Â 
Loan. By purchasing a certificate, potential investors acknowledge and agree that there could be multiple strategies to resolve
any Specially Serviced Loan and that the goal of the operating advisorâs participation is to provide additional input relating
to the special servicerâs compliance with the Servicing Standard in making its determinations as to which strategy to execute.
Â 
Potential investors should note that the
operating advisor is not an âadvisorâ for any purpose other than as specifically set forth in the PSA and is not an
advisor to any person, including without limitation any Certificateholder. For the avoidance of doubt, the operating advisor is
not an âinvestment adviserâ within the meaning of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. See âRisk
FactorsâOther Risks Relating to the CertificatesâYour Lack of Control Over the Issuing Entity and the Mortgage Loans
Can Impact Your Investmentâ.
Â 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the operating
advisor will generally have no obligations or consultation rights as operating advisor under the PSA for this transaction with
respect to any Non-Serviced Whole Loan, the Empire Mall Mortgage Loan or any related REO Properties. It is expected that each operating
advisor under the Empire Mall Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the COMM
2015-LC23 Pooling and Servicing Agreement will have certain obligations and consultation rights with respect to the Empire Mall
Whole Loan and each Non-Serviced Whole Loan thereunder, which are substantially similar to those of the operating advisor under
the PSA for this transaction.
Â 
Duties of Operating Advisor
While No Control Termination Event Has Occurred and Is Continuing
Â 
With respect to each Mortgage Loan (other
than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Whole Loan, unless a Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the
operating advisorâs obligations will be limited to the following, and generally will not involve an assessment of specific
actions of the special servicer:
Â 
(a)Â promptly reviewing information
available to Privileged Persons on the certificate administratorâs website that is relevant to the operating advisorâs
obligations under the PSA;
Â 
(b)Â promptly reviewing each
Final Asset Status Report; and
Â 
(c)Â reviewing any Appraisal
Reduction Amount and net present value calculations used in the special servicerâs determination of what course of action
to take in connection with the workout or liquidation of a Specially Serviced Loan (after they have been finalized); however the
operating advisor may not opine on, or otherwise call into question, such Appraisal Reduction Amount calculations and/or net present
value calculations (except that if the operating advisor discovers a mathematical error contained in such calculations, then the
operating advisor will be required to notify the special servicer and the Directing Certificateholder of such error).
Â 
The operating advisorâs review of
information (other than a Final Asset Status Report and information accompanying such report) or interaction with the special servicer
related to any specific Specially Serviced Loan is only to provide background information to support the operating advisorâs
duties following a servicing transfer, if needed, or to allow more meaningful interaction with the special servicer.
Â 
A âFinal Asset Status Reportâ,
with respect to any Specially Serviced Loan, means each related Asset Status Report, together with such other data or supporting
information
Â 

413
Â 
Â 
provided by the special servicer to the Directing Certificateholder which does not include any communication (other
than the related Asset Status Report) between the special servicer and Directing Certificateholder with respect to such Specially
Serviced Loan; provided that, with respect to any Mortgage Loan other than an Excluded Loan, so long as no Control Termination
Event has occurred and is continuing, no Asset Status Report will be considered to be a Final Asset Status Report unless the Directing
Certificateholder has either finally approved of and consented to the actions proposed to be taken in connection therewith, or
has exhausted all of its rights of approval or consent or has been deemed to have approved or consented to such action or the Asset
Status Report is otherwise implemented by the special servicer in accordance with the terms of the PSA.
Â 
Duties of Operating Advisor
While a Control Termination Event Has Occurred and Is Continuing
Â 
With respect to each Mortgage Loan (other
than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Whole Loan, while a Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the
operating advisorâs obligations will consist of the following:
Â 
(a)Â the operating advisor
will be required to consult (on a non-binding basis) with the special servicer in respect of the Asset Status Reports in accordance
with the Operating Advisor Standard, as described under ââAsset Status Reportâ;
Â 
(b)Â the operating advisor
will be required to consult (on a non-binding basis) with the special servicer in accordance with the Operating Advisor Standard
with respect to Major Decisions as described under ââThe Directing CertificateholderâMajor Decisionsâ;
Â 
(c)Â the operating advisor
will be required to prepare an annual report (if any Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) or Serviced Whole
Loan was a Specially Serviced Loan during the prior calendar year) in the form attached to this prospectus as AnnexÂ C to be
provided to the trustee, the master servicer, the Rating Agencies, the certificate administrator (and made available through the
certificate administratorâs website) and the 17g-5 Information Provider (and made available through the 17g-5 Information
Providerâs website) in accordance with the Operating Advisor Standard, as described below under ââAnnual Reportâ;
and
Â 
(d)Â the operating advisor
will be required to promptly recalculate and verify the accuracy of the mathematical calculations and the corresponding application
of the non-discretionary portion of the applicable formulas required to be utilized in connection with: (1)Â any Appraisal
Reduction Amount or (2)Â net present value calculations used in the special servicerâs determination of what course of
action to take in connection with the workout or liquidation of a Specially Serviced Loan prior to utilization by the special servicer.
Â 
In connection with the performance of the
duties described in clauseÂ (d) above:
Â 
(i)Â Â Â Â Â after the calculation
but prior to the utilization by the special servicer, the special servicer will be required to deliver the foregoing calculations
together with information and support materials (including such additional information reasonably requested by the operating advisor
to confirm the mathematical accuracy of such calculations, but not including any Privileged Information) to the operating advisor;
Â 
(ii)Â Â Â Â Â if the operating advisor
does not agree with the mathematical calculations or the application of the applicable non-discretionary portions of the formula
required to be utilized for such calculation, the operating advisor and special servicer will be
Â 

414
Â 
Â 
required to consult with each
other in order to resolve any inaccuracy in the mathematical calculations or the application of the non-discretionary portions
of the related formula in arriving at those mathematical calculations or any disagreement; and
Â 
(iii)Â Â Â Â if the operating advisor
and special servicer are not able to resolve such matters, the operating advisor will be required to promptly notify the certificate
administrator and the certificate administrator will be required to examine the calculations and supporting materials provided
by the special servicer and the operating advisor and determine which calculation is to apply.
Â 
The âOperating Advisor Standardâ
means the requirement that the operating advisor must act solely on behalf of the issuing entity and in the best interest of, and
for the benefit of, the Certificateholders and, with respect to any Serviced Whole Loan for the benefit of the holders of the related
Companion Loan (as a collective whole as if such Certificateholders and Companion Holders constituted a single lender), and not
to holders of any particular class of certificates (as determined by the operating advisor in the exercise of its good faith and
reasonable judgment), but without regard to any conflict of interest arising from any relationship that the operating advisor or
any of its affiliates may have with any of the underlying borrowers, any sponsor, any mortgage loan seller, the depositor, the
master servicer, the special servicer, the asset representations reviewer, the Directing Certificateholder, or any of their affiliates.
Â 
Annual Report. After the occurrence
and during the continuance of a Control Termination Event, based on the operating advisorâs review of any Assessment of Compliance
report, Attestation Report, Asset Status Report and other information (other than any communications between the Directing Certificateholder
and the special servicer that would be Privileged Information) delivered to the operating advisor by the special servicer, including
each Asset Status Report delivered during the prior calendar year, the operating advisor will (if any Mortgage Loans were Specially
Serviced Loans in the prior calendar year) prepare an annual report in the form attached to this prospectus as AnnexÂ C to
be provided to the 17g-5 Information Provider (and made available through the 17g-5 Information Providerâs website) and the
certificate administrator for the benefit of the Certificateholders (and made available through the certificate administratorâs
website) within 120 days of the end of the prior calendar year for which a Control Termination Event was continuing as of DecemberÂ 31
and setting forth its assessment of the special servicerâs performance of its duties under the PSA during the prior calendar
year on a âplatform-level basisâ with respect to the resolution and/or liquidation of Specially Serviced Loans that
the special servicer is responsible for servicing under the PSA; provided, however, that in the event the special
servicer is replaced, the operating advisorâs annual report will only relate to the entity that was acting as special servicer
as of DecemberÂ 31 in the prior calendar year and is continuing in such capacity through the date of such annual report. Only
as used in connection with the operating advisorâs annual report, the term âplatform-level basisâ refers to the
special servicerâs performance of its duties as they relate to the resolution and liquidation of Specially Serviced Loans,
taking into account the special servicerâs specific duties under the PSA as well as the extent to which those duties were
performed in accordance with the Servicing Standard, with reasonable consideration by the operating advisor of any Assessment of
Compliance report, Attestation Report, Asset Status Report and other information delivered to the operating advisor by the special
servicer (other than any communications between the Directing Certificateholder and the special servicer that would be Privileged
Information) pursuant to the PSA.
Â 
The special servicer must be given an opportunity
to review any annual report produced by the operating advisor at least 5 business days prior to its delivery to the certificate
Â 

415
Â 
Â 
administrator and the 17g-5 Information Provider; provided that the operating advisor will have no obligation to adopt any
comments to such annual report that are provided by the special servicer.
Â 
In each annual report, the operating advisor
will identify any material deviations (i)Â from the Servicing Standard and (ii)Â from the special servicerâs obligations
under the PSA with respect to the resolution or liquidation of Specially Serviced Loans or REO Properties that the special servicer
is responsible for servicing under the PSA (other than with respect to any REO Property related to a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan)
based on the limited review required in the PSA. Each annual report will be required to comply with the confidentiality requirements,
subject to certain exceptions, each as described in this prospectus and as provided in the PSA regarding Privileged Information.
Â 
The ability to perform the duties of the
operating advisor and the quality and the depth of any annual report will be dependent upon the timely receipt of information prepared
or made available by others and the accuracy and the completeness of such information. In addition, in no event will the operating
advisor have the power to compel any transaction party to take, or refrain from taking, any action. It is possible that the lack
of access to Privileged Information may limit or prohibit the operating advisor from performing its duties under the PSA, in which
case any annual report will describe any resulting limitations, and the operating advisor will not be subject to any liability
arising from such limitations or prohibitions. The operating advisor will be entitled to conclusively rely on the accuracy and
completeness of any information it is provided without liability for any such reliance thereunder.
Â 
Recommendation of the Replacement
of the Special Servicer
Â 
After the occurrence of a Consultation Termination
Event, if the operating advisor determines that the special servicer is not performing its duties as required under the PSA or
is otherwise not acting in accordance with the Servicing Standard, the operating advisor may recommend the replacement of the special
servicer in the manner described in ââReplacement of Special Servicer Without Causeâ.
Â 
Eligibility of Operating
Advisor
Â 
The operating advisor will be required to
be an Eligible Operating Advisor at all times during the term of the PSA. âEligible Operating Advisorâ means
an institution:
Â 
(i)Â Â Â Â Â that is a special servicer
or operating advisor on a commercial mortgage-backed securities transaction rated by the Rating Agencies (including, in the case
of the operating advisor, this transaction) but has not been a special servicer or operating advisor on a transaction for which
any Rating Agency has qualified, downgraded or withdrawn its rating or ratings of one or more classes of certificates for such
transaction citing servicing or other relevant concerns with the special servicer or operating advisor, as applicable, as the sole
or a material factor in such rating action;
Â 
(ii)Â Â Â Â Â that can and will make
the representations and warranties of the operating advisor set forth in the PSA;
Â 
(iii)Â Â Â Â that is not (and is
not affiliated with) the depositor, the trustee, the certificate administrator, the master servicer, the special servicer, a mortgage
loan seller, the Directing Certificateholder, or a depositor, a trustee, a certificate administrator, a
Â 

416
Â 
Â 
master servicer or a special
servicer with respect to the securitization of a Companion Loan, or any of their respective affiliates;
Â 
(iv)Â Â Â Â that has not been paid
by any special servicer or successor special servicer any fees, compensation or other remuneration (x)Â in respect of its obligations
under the PSA or (y)Â for the appointment or recommendation for replacement of a successor special servicer to become the special
servicer; and
Â 
(v)Â Â Â Â Â that (x) has been regularly
engaged in the business of analyzing and advising clients in commercial mortgage-backed securities matters and has at least five
years of experience in collateral analysis and loss projections, and (y) has at least five years of experience in commercial real
estate asset management and experience in the workout and management of distressed commercial real estate assets.
Â 
Other Obligations of Operating
Advisor
Â 
At all times, subject to the Privileged
Information Exception, the operating advisor and its affiliates will be obligated to keep confidential any information appropriately
labeled âPrivileged Informationâ received from the special servicer or Directing Certificateholder in connection with
the Directing Certificateholderâs exercise of any rights under the PSA (including, without limitation, in connection with
any Asset Status Report) or otherwise in connection with the transaction, except under the circumstances described below. As used
in this prospectus, âPrivileged Informationâ means (i)Â any correspondence between the Directing Certificateholder
and the special servicer related to any Specially Serviced Loan (other than with respect to an Excluded Loan) or the exercise of
the Directing Certificateholderâs consent or consultation rights under the PSA, (ii)Â any strategically sensitive information
that the special servicer has reasonably determined could compromise the issuing entityâs position in any ongoing or future
negotiations with the related borrower or other interested party and (iii)Â information subject to attorney-client privilege.
Â 
The operating advisor is required to keep
all such labeled Privileged Information confidential and may not disclose such labeled Privileged Information to any person (including
Certificateholders other than the Directing Certificateholder), other than (1)Â to the extent expressly required by the PSA,
to the other parties to the PSA with a notice indicating that such information is Privileged Information or (2)Â pursuant to
a Privileged Information Exception. Each party to the PSA that receives Privileged Information from the operating advisor with
a notice stating that such information is Privileged Information may not disclose such Privileged Information to any person without
the prior written consent of the special servicer and, unless a Control Termination Event has occurred, the Directing Certificateholder
(with respect to any Mortgage Loan other than a Non-Serviced Whole Loan and other than any Excluded Loan) other than pursuant to
a Privileged Information Exception.
Â 
âPrivileged Information Exceptionâ
means, with respect to any Privileged Information, at any time (a) such Privileged Information becomes generally available to the
public other than as a result of a disclosure directly or indirectly by the party restricted from disclosing such Privileged Information
(the âRestricted Partyâ), (b) it is reasonable and necessary for the Restricted Party to disclose such Privileged
Information in working with legal counsel, auditors, taxing authorities or other governmental agencies, (c) such Privileged Information
was already known to such Restricted Party and not otherwise subject to a confidentiality obligation and/or (d) the Restricted
Party is required by law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree to disclose such information.
Â 


417
Â 
Â 
Neither the operating advisor nor any of
its affiliates may make any investment in any class of certificates; provided, however, that such prohibition will
not apply to (i)Â riskless principal transactions effected by a broker dealer affiliate of the operating advisor or (ii)Â investments
by an affiliate of the operating advisor if the operating advisor and such affiliate maintain policies and procedures that (A)
segregate personnel involved in the activities of the operating advisor under the PSA from personnel involved in such affiliateâs
investment activities and (B) prevent such affiliate and its personnel from gaining access to information regarding the issuing
entity and the operating advisor and its personnel from gaining access to such affiliateâs information regarding its investment
activities.
Â 
Delegation of Operating
Advisorâs Duties
Â 
The operating advisor may delegate its duties
to agents or subcontractors in accordance with the PSA; however, the operating advisor will remain obligated and primarily liable
for any actions required to be performed by it under the PSA without diminution of such obligation or liability or related obligation
or liability by virtue of such delegation or arrangements or by virtue of indemnification from any person acting as its agents
or subcontractor to the same extent and under the same terms and conditions as if the operating advisor alone were performing its
obligations under the PSA.
Â 
Termination of the Operating
Advisor With Cause
Â 
The following constitute operating advisor
termination events under the PSA (each, an âOperating Advisor Termination Eventâ), whether any such event is
voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order,
rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body:
Â 
(a)Â any failure by the operating
advisor to observe or perform in any material respect any of its covenants or agreements or the material breach of any of its representations
or warranties under the PSA, which failure continues unremedied for a period of 30 days after the date on which written notice
of such failure, requiring the same to be remedied, is given to the operating advisor by any party to the PSA or to the operating
advisor, the certificate administrator and the trustee by the holders of certificates having greater than 25% of the aggregate
Voting Rights; provided that with respect to any such failure which is not curable within such 30 day period, the operating
advisor will have an additional cure period of 30 days to effect such cure so long as it has commenced to cure such failure within
the initial 30 day period and has provided the trustee and the certificate administrator with an officerâs certificate certifying
that it has diligently pursued, and is continuing to pursue, such cure;
Â 
(b)Â any failure by the operating
advisor to perform in accordance with the Operating Advisor Standard which failure continues unremedied for a period of 30 days
after the date on which written notice of such failure, requiring the same to be remedied, is given to the operating advisor by
any party to the PSA;
Â 
(c)Â any failure by the operating
advisor to be an Eligible Operating Advisor, which failure continues unremedied for a period of 30 days after the date on which
written notice of such failure, requiring the same to be remedied, is given to the operating advisor by any party to the PSA;
Â 
(d)Â a decree or order of a
court or agency or supervisory authority having jurisdiction in the premises in an involuntary case under any present or future
federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law for the appointment of a conservator or receiver or liquidator in any insolvency,
readjustment of debt, marshaling of assets and liabilities or
Â 

418
Â 
Â 
similar proceedings, or for the winding up or liquidation of its
affairs, was entered against the operating advisor, and such decree or order remained in force undischarged or unstayed for a period
of 60 days;
Â 
(e)Â the operating advisor
consents to the appointment of a conservator or receiver or liquidator or liquidation committee in any insolvency, readjustment
of debt, marshaling of assets and liabilities, voluntary liquidation, or similar proceedings of or relating to the operating advisor
or of or relating to all or substantially all of its property; or
Â 
(f)Â the operating advisor
admits in writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, files a petition to take advantage of any applicable
insolvency or reorganization statute, makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or voluntarily suspends payment of
its obligations.
Â 
Upon receipt by the certificate administrator
of notice of the occurrence of any Operating Advisor Termination Event, the certificate administrator will be required to promptly
provide written notice to all Certificateholders electronically by posting such notice on its internet website and by mail, unless
the certificate administrator has received notice that such Operating Advisor Termination Event has been remedied.
Â 
Rights Upon Operating Advisor
Termination Event
Â 
After the occurrence of an Operating Advisor
Termination Event, the trustee may, and upon the written direction of Certificateholders representing at least 25% of the Voting
Rights (taking into account the application of any Appraisal Reduction Amounts to notionally reduce the Certificate Balance of
the classes of certificates), the trustee will, promptly terminate the operating advisor for cause and appoint a replacement operating
advisor that is an Eligible Operating Advisor; provided that no such termination will be effective until a successor operating
advisor has been appointed and has assumed all of the obligations of the operating advisor under the PSA. The trustee may rely
on a certification by the replacement operating advisor that it is an Eligible Operating Advisor. If the trustee is unable to find
a replacement operating advisor that is an Eligible Operating Advisor within 30 days of the termination of the operating advisor,
the depositor will be permitted to find a replacement.
Â 
Upon any termination of the operating advisor
and appointment of a successor operating advisor, the trustee will, as soon as possible, be required to give written notice of
the termination and appointment to the special servicer, the master servicer, the certificate administrator, the depositor, the
Directing Certificateholder (for any Mortgage Loan other than an Excluded Loan and only for so long as no Consultation Termination
Event has occurred), any Companion Loan holder, the Certificateholders and the 17g-5 Information Provider (and made available through
the 17g-5 Information Providerâs website).
Â 
Waiver of Operating Advisor
Termination Event
Â 
The holders of certificates representing
at least 25% of the Voting Rights affected by any Operating Advisor Termination Event may waive such Operating Advisor Termination
Event within 20 days of the receipt of notice from the trustee of the occurrence of such Operating Advisor Termination Event. Upon
any such waiver of an Operating Advisor Termination Event, such Operating Advisor Termination Event will cease to exist and will
be deemed to have been remedied. Upon any such waiver of an Operating Advisor Termination Event by Certificateholders, the trustee
and the certificate administrator will be entitled to recover all costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with enforcement
action taken with respect to such Operating Advisor Termination Event prior to such waiver from the issuing entity.
Â 


419
Â 
Â 
Termination of the Operating
Advisor Without Cause
Â 
After the occurrence of a Consultation Termination
Event, the operating advisor may be removed upon (i)Â the written direction of Certificateholders evidencing not less than
25% of the Voting Rights (taking into account the application of Appraisal Reduction Amounts to notionally reduce the Certificate
Balances of classes to which such Appraisal Reduction Amounts are allocable) requesting a vote to replace the operating advisor
with a replacement operating advisor that is an Eligible Operating Advisor selected by such Certificateholders, (ii)Â payment
by such requesting holders to the certificate administrator of all reasonable fees and expenses to be incurred by the certificate
administrator in connection with administering such vote and (iii)Â receipt by the trustee of the Rating Agency Confirmation
with respect to such removal.
Â 
The certificate administrator will be required
to promptly provide written notice to all Certificateholders of such request by posting such notice on its internet website, and
by mail, and conduct the solicitation of votes of all certificates in such regard.
Â 
Upon the vote or written direction of holders
of at least 75% of the Voting Rights (taking into account the application of Appraisal Reduction Amounts to notionally reduce the
Certificate Balances of classes to which such Appraisal Reduction Amounts are allocable), the trustee will immediately replace
the operating advisor with the replacement operating advisor.
Â 
In addition, in the event there are no classes
of certificates outstanding other than the Control Eligible Certificates, the Class V certificates and the ClassÂ R certificates,
then all of the rights and obligations of the operating advisor under the PSA will terminate without payment of any penalty or
termination fee (other than any rights or obligations that accrued prior to the date of such termination (including accrued and
unpaid compensation) and other than indemnification rights arising out of events occurring prior to such termination). If the operating
advisor is terminated pursuant to the foregoing sentence, then no replacement operating advisor will be appointed.
Â 
Resignation of the Operating
Advisor
Â 
The operating advisor may resign upon 30
daysâ prior written notice to the depositor, the master servicer, the special servicer, the trustee, the certificate administrator,
the asset representations reviewer and the Directing Certificateholder, if applicable, if the operating advisor has secured a replacement
operating advisor that is an Eligible Operating Advisor and such replacement operating advisor has accepted its appointment as
the replacement operating advisor and receipt by the trustee of a Rating Agency Confirmation from each Rating Agency. If no successor
operating advisor has been so appointed and accepted the appointment within 30 days after the notice of resignation, the resigning
operating advisor may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor operating advisor that is
an Eligible Operating Advisor. The resigning operating advisor must pay all costs and expenses associated with the transfer of
its duties.
Â 
Operating Advisor Compensation
Â 
Certain fees will be payable to the operating
advisor, and the operating advisor will be entitled to be reimbursed for certain expenses, as described under âTransaction
PartiesâThe Operating Advisor and Asset Representations Reviewerâ.
Â 
In the event the operating advisor resigns
or is terminated for any reason it will remain entitled to any accrued and unpaid fees and reimbursement of Operating Advisor Expenses
Â 

420
Â 
Â 
and any rights to indemnification provided under the PSA with respect to the period for which it acted as operating advisor.
Â 
The operating advisor will be entitled to
reimbursement of certain expenses incurred by the operating advisor in the event that the operating advisor is terminated without
cause. See ââTermination of the Operating Advisor Without Causeâ above.
Â 
The Asset Representations
Reviewer
Â 
Asset Review
Â 
Asset Review Trigger
Â 
On or prior to each Distribution Date, based
on the CREFCÂ® delinquent loan status report and/or the CREFCÂ® loan periodic update file delivered by the master servicer
for such Distribution Date, the certificate administrator will be required to determine if an Asset Review Trigger has occurred.
If an Asset Review Trigger is determined to have occurred, the certificate administrator will be required to promptly provide notice
to all Certificateholders by posting a notice of its determination on its internet website and by mailing such notice to the Certificateholdersâ
addresses appearing in the certificate register. On each Distribution Date after providing such notice to the Certificateholders,
the certificate administrator, based on information provided to it by the master servicer or the special servicer, will be required
to determine whether (1)Â any additional Mortgage Loan has become a Delinquent Loan, (2)Â any Mortgage Loan has ceased
to be a Delinquent Loan and (3)Â an Asset Review Trigger has ceased to exist, and, if there is an occurrence of any of the
events or circumstances identified in clausesÂ (1), (2) and/or (3), deliver such information in a written notice (which may
be via email) within 2 business days to the master servicer, the special servicer, the operating advisor and the asset representations
reviewer. An âAsset Review Triggerâ will occur when either (1)Â Mortgage Loans with an aggregate outstanding
principal balance of 25.0% or more of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of all of the Mortgage Loans (including any REO
Loans (or a portion of any REO Loan in the case of a Whole Loan)) held by the issuing entity as of the end of the applicable Collection
Period are Delinquent Loans or (2)Â at least 15 Mortgage Loans are Delinquent Loans as of the end of the applicable Collection
Period and the outstanding principal balance of such Delinquent Loans in the aggregate constitutes at least 20.0% of the aggregate
outstanding principal balance of all of the Mortgage Loans (including any REO Loans (or a portion of any REO Loan in the case of
a Whole Loan)) held by the issuing entity as of the end of the applicable Collection Period. The PSA will require that the certificate
administrator include in the Distribution Report on Form 10-D relating to the distribution period in which the Asset Review Trigger
occurred a description of the events that caused the Asset Review Trigger to occur.
Â 
We believe this Asset Review Trigger is
appropriate considering the unique characteristics of pools of Mortgage Loans underlying CMBS. See âRisk FactorsâRisks
Relating to the Mortgage LoansâStatic Pool Data Would Not Be Indicative of the Performance of this Poolâ. In general,
upon a Delinquent Loan becoming a Specially Serviced Loan, as part of the special servicerâs initial investigation into the
circumstances that caused the Mortgage Loan to become delinquent and be transferred to the special servicer, the special servicer
will typically conduct a review of the Delinquent Loan for possible breaches of representations and warranties. Given that the
special servicer will commonly have already conducted such a review and discussed any findings with the Directing Certificateholder
(prior to the occurrence and continuance of a Control Termination Event) prior to the occurrence of an Asset Review Trigger, to
avoid additional fees, costs and expenses to the issuing entity, we set the Delinquent Loan percentage based on an
Â 

421
Â 
Â 
outstanding
principal balance in clauseÂ (1) of the definition of Asset Review Trigger to exceed a delinquency rate that would result in
estimated losses that exceed the subordination provided by the Control Eligible Certificates. For purpose of this calculation,
we assumed an average loss severity of 40%, however, we cannot assure you that any actual loss severity will equal that assumed
percentage. On the other hand, a significant number of Delinquent Loans by loan count, but representing a smaller percentage of
the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loans than the percentage set forth in clauseÂ (1) of the definition
of Asset Review Trigger, could also indicate an issue with the quality of the Mortgage Pool. As a result, we believe it would be
appropriate to have an alternative test as set forth in clauseÂ (2) of the definition of Asset Review Trigger, namely to have
the Asset Review Trigger be met if Mortgage Loans representing 15 of the Mortgage Loans (by loan count) are Delinquent Loans so
long as those Mortgage Loans represent at least 20% of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loans. With
respect to the 80 prior pools of commercial mortgage loans for which Wells Fargo Bank (or its predecessors) was sponsor in a public
offering of CMBS with a securitization closing date on or after JanuaryÂ 1, 2006, the highest percentage of mortgage loans,
based on the aggregate outstanding principal balance of delinquent mortgage loans in an individual CMBS transaction, that were
delinquent at least 60Â days at the end of any reporting period between JanuaryÂ 1, 2010 and SeptemberÂ 30, 2015 was
34.3%; however, the average of the highest delinquency percentages based on the aggregate outstanding principal balance of delinquent
mortgage loans in the reviewed transactions was 6.4%; and the highest percentage of delinquent mortgage loans, based upon the number
of mortgage loans in the reviewed transactions was 17.7% and the average of the highest delinquency percentages based on the number
of mortgage loans in the reviewed transactions was 4.4%.
Â 
âDelinquent Loanâ means
a Mortgage Loan that is delinquent at least 60 days in respect of its Periodic Payments or balloon payment, if any, in either case
such delinquency to be determined without giving effect to any grace period.
Â 
Asset Review Vote
Â 
If Certificateholders evidencing not less
than 5.0% of the Voting Rights deliver to the certificate administrator, within 90 days after the filing of the Form 10-D reporting
the occurrence of an Asset Review Trigger, a written direction requesting a vote to commence an Asset Review (an âAsset
Review Vote Electionâ), the certificate administrator will be required to promptly provide written notice of such direction
to all Certificateholders, and to conduct a solicitation of votes of Certificateholders to authorize an Asset Review. Upon the
affirmative vote to authorize an Asset Review by Certificateholders evidencing at least a majority of an Asset Review Quorum within
150 days of the receipt of the Asset Review Vote Election (an âAffirmative Asset Review Voteâ), the certificate
administrator will be required to promptly provide written notice of such Affirmative Asset Review Vote to all parties to the PSA,
the underwriters, the mortgage loan sellers, the Directing Certificateholder and the Certificateholders. In the event an Affirmative
Asset Review Vote has not occurred within such 150-day period following the receipt of the Asset Review Vote Election, no Certificateholder
may request a vote or cast a vote for an Asset Review and the asset representations reviewer will not be required to review any
Delinquent Loan unless and until (A) an additional Mortgage Loan has become a Delinquent Loan after the expiration of such 150-day
period, (B)Â a new Asset Review Trigger has occurred as a result or an Asset Review Trigger is otherwise in effect, (C) the
certificate administrator has timely received an Asset Review Vote Election after the occurrence of the events described in clausesÂ (A)
and (B) above and (D) an Affirmative Asset Review Vote has occurred within 150 days after the Asset Review Vote Election described
in clauseÂ (C) above. After the occurrence of any Asset Review Vote Election or an Affirmative Asset Review Vote, no
Â 

422
Â 
Â 
Certificateholder
may make any additional Asset Review Vote Election except as described in the immediately preceding sentence. Any reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the certificate administrator in connection with administering such vote will be paid as an expense of the
issuing entity from the Collection Account.
Â 
An âAsset Review Quorumâ
means, in connection with any solicitation of votes to authorize an Asset Review as described above, the holders of certificates
evidencing at least 5.0% of the aggregate Voting Rights.
Â 
Review Materials
Â 
Upon receipt of notice from the certificate
administrator of an Affirmative Asset Review Vote (the âAsset Review Noticeâ), the custodian (with respect to
clausesÂ (i) â (v) for non-Specially Serviced Loans), the master servicer (with respect to clauseÂ (vi) for non-Specially
Serviced Loans) and the special servicer (with respect to Specially Serviced Loans) will be required to promptly, but in no event
later than within 10 business days, provide the following materials to the extent in their possession to the asset representations
reviewer (collectively, with the Diligence Files posted to the secure data room by the certificate administrator, copies of all
Asset Status Reports and Final Asset Status Reports related to each Delinquent Loan, a copy of the prospectus, a copy of each related
MLPA and a copy of the PSA, the âReview Materialsâ):
Â 
(i)Â Â Â Â Â an assignment of the Mortgage
in favor of the trustee, with evidence of recording thereon, for each Delinquent Loan that is subject to an Asset Review;
Â 
(ii)Â Â Â Â an assignment of any
related assignment of leases (if such item is a document separate from the Mortgage) in favor of the trustee, with evidence of
recording thereon, related to each Delinquent Loan that is subject to an Asset Review;
Â 
(iii)Â Â Â Â the assignment of all
unrecorded documents relating to each Delinquent Loan that is subject to an Asset Review, if not already covered pursuant to items
(i) or (ii) above;
Â 
(iv)Â Â Â Â all filed copies (bearing
evidence of filing) or evidence of filing of any UCC financing statements related to each Delinquent Loan that is subject to an
Asset Review;
Â 
(v)Â Â Â Â Â an assignment in favor
of the trustee of any financing statement executed and filed in the relevant jurisdiction related to each Delinquent Loan that
is subject to an Asset Review; and
Â 
(vi)Â Â Â Â any other related information
that is required of the master servicer (with respect to non-Specially Serviced Loans) and the special servicer (with respect to
Specially Serviced Loans) to be delivered to the asset representations reviewer as described below.
Â 
In addition, in the event that the asset
representations reviewer determines that the Review Materials provided to it with respect to any Mortgage Loan are missing any
documents or information required to complete any Test in connection with an Asset Review of such Mortgage Loan, the asset representations
reviewer will promptly, but in no event later than 10Â business days after receipt of the Review Materials, notify the master
servicer (with respect to non-Specially Serviced Loans) or the special servicer (with respect to Specially Serviced Loans), as
applicable, of such missing documents and information, and request the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable,
promptly, but in no event
Â 

423
Â 
Â 
later than 10Â business days after receipt of notification from the asset representations reviewer,
deliver to the asset representations reviewer such missing documents and information in its possession. In the event any missing
documents or information are not provided by the master servicer or special servicer, as applicable, within such 10 business day
period, the asset representations reviewer will request such documents or information from the related mortgage loan seller. The
mortgage loan seller will be required under the related MLPA to deliver such additional documents and information only to the extent
such information is in the possession of such party.
Â 
The asset representations reviewer may,
but is under no obligation to, consider and rely upon information furnished to it by a person that is not a party to the PSA or
the related mortgage loan seller, and will do so only if such information can be independently verified (without unreasonable effort
or expense to the asset representations reviewer) and is determined by the asset representations reviewer in its good faith and
sole discretion to be relevant to the Asset Review (any such information, âUnsolicited Informationâ), as described
below.
Â 
Asset Review
Â 
Upon its receipt of the Asset Review Notice
and access to the Review Materials with respect to a Delinquent Loan, the asset representations reviewer, as an independent contractor,
will be required to commence a review of the compliance of each Delinquent Loan with the representations and warranties related
to that Delinquent Loan (such review, the âAsset Reviewâ). An Asset Review of each Delinquent Loan will consist
of the application of a set of pre-determined review procedures (the âTestsâ) for each representation and warranty
made by the applicable mortgage loan seller with respect to such Delinquent Loan. Once an Asset Review of a Mortgage Loan is completed,
no further Asset Review will be required of or performed on that Mortgage Loan notwithstanding that such Mortgage Loan may continue
to be a Delinquent Loan or become a Delinquent Loan again at the time when a new Asset Review Trigger occurs and a new Affirmative
Asset Review Vote is obtained subsequent to the occurrence of such Asset Review Trigger.
Â 
âAsset Review Standardâ
means the performance by the asset representations reviewer of its duties under the PSA in good faith subject to the express terms
of the PSA. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in the PSA, all determinations or assumptions made by the asset representations
reviewer in connection with an Asset Review are required to be made in the asset representations reviewerâs good faith discretion
and judgment based on the facts and circumstances known to it at the time of such determination or assumption.
Â 
No Certificateholder will have the right
to change the scope of the asset representations reviewerâs review, and the asset representations reviewer will not be required
to review any information other than (i)Â the Review Materials and (ii) if applicable, Unsolicited Information.
Â 
The asset representations reviewer may,
absent manifest error and subject to the Asset Review Standard, (i)Â assume, without independent investigation or verification,
that the Review Materials are accurate and complete in all material respects and (ii)Â conclusively rely on such Review Materials.
Â 
The assets representations reviewer must
prepare a preliminary report with respect to each delinquent loan within 45 business days after the date on which access to the
secure data room is provided. In the event that the asset representations reviewer determines that the Review Materials are insufficient
to complete a Test and such missing information and documentation is not delivered to the asset representations reviewer by the
master
Â 

424
Â 
Â 
servicer (with respect to non-Specially Serviced Loans), the special servicer (with respect to Specially Serviced Loans)
or from the related mortgage loan seller within 15 business days following the request by the asset representations reviewer to
the master servicer or special servicer, as applicable, as described above, the asset representations reviewer will list such missing
information and documents in a preliminary report setting forth the preliminary results of the application of the Tests and the
reasons why such missing information and documents are necessary to complete a Test and (if the asset representations reviewer
has so concluded) that the absence of such information and documents will be deemed to be a failure of such Test. The asset representations
reviewer will provide such preliminary report to the master servicer (with respect to non-Specially Serviced Loans) or the special
servicer (with respect to Specially Serviced Loans), who will promptly, but in no event later than within 10 business days, provide
such results to the related mortgage loan seller. If the preliminary report indicates that any of the representations and warranties
fails or is deemed to fail any Test, the mortgage loan seller will have 90 days (the âCure/Contest Periodâ)
to remedy or otherwise refute the failure. Any information and documents provided or explanations given to support a conclusion
that the representation and warranty has not failed a Test will be sent to the master servicer (with respect to non-Specially Serviced
Loans) or the special servicer (with respect to Specially Serviced Loans), and the master servicer and the special servicer, as
applicable, will be required to promptly, but in no event later than 10 business days after receipt from the related mortgage loan
seller, deliver to the asset representations reviewer any information and documents received from the mortgage loan seller or explanations
given to support the mortgage loan sellerâs claim that the representation and warranty has not failed a Test or the mortgage
loan sellerâs claim that any missing information and documents in the Review Materials are not required to complete a Test.
Â 
The asset representations reviewer will
be required, within 60 days after the date on which access to the secure data room is provided to the asset representations reviewer
by the certificate administrator or within 10 days after the expiration of the Cure/Contest Period (whichever is later), to complete
an Asset Review with respect to each Delinquent Loan and deliver (i) a report setting forth the asset representations reviewerâs
findings and conclusions as to whether or not it has determined there is any evidence of a failure of any Test based on the Asset
Review and a statement that the asset representations reviewerâs findings and conclusions set forth in such report were not
influenced by any third party (an âAsset Review Reportâ) to each party to the PSA, the related mortgage loan
seller for each Delinquent Loan and the Directing Certificateholder, and (ii) a summary of the asset representations reviewerâs
conclusions included in such Asset Review Report (an âAsset Review Report Summaryâ) to the trustee and certificate
administrator. The period of time by which the Asset Review Report must be completed and delivered may be extended by up to an
additional 30Â days, upon written notice to the parties to the PSA and the related mortgage loan seller, if the asset representations
reviewer determines pursuant to the Asset Review Standard that such additional time is required due to the characteristics of the
Mortgage Loans and/or the Mortgaged Property or Mortgaged Properties. In no event will the asset representations reviewer be required
to determine whether any Test failure constitutes a Material Defect, or whether the issuing entity should enforce any rights it
may have against the related mortgage loan seller, which, in each such case, will be the responsibility of the master servicer
or special servicer, as applicable. See ââEnforcement of Mortgage Loan Sellerâs Obligations Under the MLPAâ
below. In addition, in the event that the asset representations reviewer does not receive any information or documentation that
it requested from the master servicer (with respect to non-Specially Serviced Loans), the special servicer (with respect to Specially
Serviced Loans) or the related mortgage loan seller in sufficient time to allow the asset representations reviewer to complete
its Asset Review and deliver an Asset Review Report, the asset representations reviewer will be
Â 

425
Â 
Â 
required to prepare the Asset Review
Report solely based on the information received by the asset representations reviewer with respect to the related Delinquent Loan,
and the asset representations reviewer will have no responsibility to independently obtain any such information from any party
to the PSA or otherwise. The PSA will require that the certificate administrator (i)Â include the Asset Review Report Summary
in the Distribution Report on Form 10âD relating to the distribution period in which the Asset Review Report Summary was
received, and (ii)Â post such Asset Review Report Summary to the certificate administratorâs website not later than two
business days after receipt of such Asset Review Report Summary from the asset representations reviewer.
Â 
Eligibility of Asset Representations
Reviewer
Â 
The asset representations reviewer will
be required to represent and warrant in the PSA that it is an Eligible Asset Representations Reviewer. The asset representations
reviewer is required to be at all times an Eligible Asset Representations Reviewer. If the asset representations reviewer ceases
to be an Eligible Asset Representations Reviewer, the asset representations reviewer is required to immediately notify the master
servicer, the special servicer, the trustee, the operating advisor, the certificate administrator and the Directing Certificateholder
of such disqualification and immediately resign under the PSA as described under the ââResignation of Asset Representations
Reviewerâ below.
Â 
An âEligible Asset Representations
Reviewerâ is an institution that (i)Â is the special servicer, operating advisor or asset representations reviewer
on a transaction rated by any of DBRS, Inc., Fitch, KBRA, Moodyâs, Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC or Standard & Poorâs
Ratings Services and that has not been a special servicer, operating advisor or asset representations reviewer on a transaction
for which DBRS, Inc., Fitch, KBRA, Moodyâs, Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC or Standard & Poorâs Ratings Services
has qualified, downgraded or withdrawn its rating or ratings of one or more classes of certificates for such transaction citing
servicing or other relevant concerns with such special servicer, operating advisor or asset representations reviewer, as applicable,
as the sole or material factor in such rating action, (ii)Â can and will make the representations and warranties of the asset
representations reviewer set forth in the PSA, (iii)Â is not (and is not affiliated with) any sponsor, any mortgage loan seller,
any originator, the master servicer, the special servicer, the depositor, the certificate administrator, the trustee, the Directing
Certificateholder or any of their respective affiliates, (iv)Â has not performed (and is not affiliated with any party hired
to perform) any due diligence, loan underwriting, brokerage, borrower advisory or similar services with respect to any Mortgage
Loan or any related Companion Loan prior to the Closing Date for or on behalf of any sponsor, any mortgage loan seller, any underwriter,
any party to the PSA or the Directing Certificateholder or any of their respective affiliates, or have been paid any fees, compensation
or other remuneration by any of them in connection with any such services and (v)Â that does not directly or indirectly, through
one or more affiliates or otherwise, own any interest in any certificates, any Mortgage Loans, any Companion Loan or any securities
backed by a Companion Loan or otherwise have any financial interest in the securitization transaction to which the PSA relates,
other than in fees from its role as asset representations reviewer (or as operating advisor, if applicable) and except as otherwise
set forth in the PSA.
Â 
Other Obligations of Asset
Representations Reviewer
Â 
The asset representations reviewer and its
affiliates are required to keep confidential any information appropriately labeled as âPrivileged Informationâ received
from any party to the PSA or any sponsor under the PSA (including, without limitation, in connection with the review of the Mortgage
Loans) and not disclose such Privileged Information to any person
Â 

426
Â 
Â 
(including Certificateholders), other than (1)Â to the extent
expressly required by the PSA in an Asset Review Report or otherwise, to the other parties to the PSA with a notice indicating
that such information is Privileged Information or (2)Â pursuant to a Privileged Information Exception. Each party to the PSA
that receives such Privileged Information from the asset representations reviewer with a notice stating that such information is
Privileged Information may not disclose such Privileged Information to any person without the prior written consent of the special
servicer other than pursuant to a Privileged Information Exception.
Â 
Neither the asset representations reviewer
nor any of its affiliates may make any investment in any class of certificates; provided, however, that such prohibition
will not apply to (i)Â riskless principal transactions effected by a broker dealer affiliate of the asset representations reviewer
or (ii)Â investments by an affiliate of the asset representations reviewer if the asset representations reviewer and such affiliate
maintain policies and procedures that (A)Â segregate personnel involved in the activities of the asset representations reviewer
under the PSA from personnel involved in such affiliateâs investment activities and (B)Â prevent such affiliate and its
personnel from gaining access to information regarding the issuing entity and the asset representations reviewer and its personnel
from gaining access to such affiliateâs information regarding its investment activities.
Â 
Delegation of Asset Representations
Reviewerâs Duties
Â 
The asset representations reviewer may delegate
its duties to agents or subcontractors in accordance with the PSA, however, the asset representations reviewer will remain obligated
and primarily liable for any Asset Review required in accordance with the provisions of the PSA without diminution of such obligation
or liability by virtue of such delegation or arrangements or by virtue of indemnification from any person acting as its agents
or subcontractor to the same extent and under the same terms and conditions as if the asset representations reviewer alone were
performing its obligations under the PSA.

Â 
Asset Representations Reviewer
Termination Events
Â 
The following constitute asset representations
reviewer termination events under the PSA (each, an âAsset Representations Reviewer Termination Eventâ) whether
any such event is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any
court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body:
Â 
(i)Â Â Â Â Â any failure by the asset

same to be remedied, is given to the asset representations reviewer by any party to the PSA;
Â

by any party to the PSA;
Â 
(iv)Â Â Â Â a decree or order of

federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law for the appointment of a conservator or receiver or liquidator in any insolvency,
readjustment of debt, marshaling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings, or for the winding-up or liquidation of its
affairs, has been entered against the asset representations reviewer, and such decree or order has remained in force undischarged
or unstayed for a period of 60 days;
Â 
(v)Â Â Â Â Â the asset representations
reviewer consents to the appointment of a conservator or receiver or liquidator or liquidation committee in any insolvency, readjustment

reviewer or of or relating to all or substantially all of its property; or
Â 
(vi)Â Â Â Â the asset representations
reviewer admits in writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, files a petition to take advantage of any
applicable insolvency or reorganization statute, makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or voluntarily suspends
payment of its obligations.
Â 
Upon receipt by the certificate administrator
of written notice of the occurrence of any Asset Representations Reviewer Termination Event, the certificate administrator will
be required to promptly provide written notice to all Certificateholders electronically by posting such notice on its internet
website and by mail, unless the certificate administrator has received notice that such Asset Representations Reviewer Termination
Event has been remedied.
Â 
Rights Upon Asset Representations
Reviewer Termination Event
Â 
If an Asset Representations Reviewer Termination
Event occurs, and in each and every such case, so long as such Asset Representations Reviewer Termination Event has not been remedied,
then either the trustee (i)Â may or (ii)Â upon the written direction of Certificateholders evidencing at least 25% of the
Voting Rights (without regard to the application of any Appraisal Reduction Amounts) will be required to, terminate all of the
rights and obligations of the asset representations reviewer under the PSA, other than rights and obligations accrued prior to
such termination and other than indemnification rights (arising out of events occurring prior to such termination), by written
notice to the asset representations reviewer. The asset representations reviewer is required to bear all reasonable costs and expenses
of each other party to the PSA in connection with its termination for cause.
Â 
Termination of the Asset
Representations Reviewer Without Cause
Â 
Upon (i)Â the written direction of Certificateholders
evidencing not less than 25% of the Voting Rights (without regard to the application of any Appraisal Reduction Amounts) requesting
a vote to terminate and replace the asset representations reviewer with a proposed successor asset representations reviewer that
is an Eligible Asset Representations Reviewer, and (ii)Â payment by such holders to the certificate administrator of the reasonable
fees and expenses to be incurred by the certificate administrator in connection
Â 

428
Â 
Â 
with administering such vote, the certificate administrator
will promptly provide notice to all Certificateholders and the asset representations reviewer of such request by posting such notice
on its internet website, and by mailing to all Certificateholders and the asset representations reviewer. Upon the written direction
of Certificateholders evidencing at least 75% of a Certificateholder Quorum (without regard to the application of any Appraisal
Reduction Amounts), the trustee will terminate all of the rights and obligations of the asset representations reviewer under the
PSA (other than any rights or obligations that accrued prior to the date of such termination and other than indemnification rights
(arising out of events occurring prior to such termination)) by written notice to the asset representations reviewer, and the proposed
successor asset representations reviewer will be appointed.
Â 
In the event that holders of the certificates
entitled to at least 75% of the Voting Rights elect to remove the asset representations reviewer without cause and appoint a successor,
the successor asset representations reviewer will be responsible for all expenses necessary to effect the transfer of responsibilities
from its predecessor.
Â 
Resignation of Asset Representations
Reviewer
Â 
The asset representations reviewer may at
any time resign by giving written notice to the other parties to the PSA. In addition, the asset representations reviewer will
at all times be, and will be required to resign if it fails to be, an Eligible Asset Representations Reviewer by giving written
notice to the other parties. Upon such notice of resignation, the depositor will be required to promptly appoint a successor asset
representations reviewer that is an Eligible Asset Representations Reviewer. No resignation of the asset representations reviewer
will be effective until a successor asset representations reviewer that is an Eligible Asset Representations Reviewer has been
appointed and accepted the appointment. If no successor asset representations reviewer has been so appointed and accepted the appointment
within 30 days after the notice of resignation, the resigning asset representations reviewer may petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor asset representations reviewer that is an Eligible Asset Representations Reviewer.
The resigning asset representations reviewer must pay all costs and expenses associated with the transfer of its duties.
Â 
Asset Representations Reviewer
Compensation
Â 
Certain fees will be payable to the asset
representations reviewer, and the asset representations reviewer will be entitled to be reimbursed for certain expenses, as described
under ââServicing and Other Compensation and Payment of Expensesâ.
Â 
Replacement of Special
Servicer Without Cause
Â 
Except as limited by certain conditions
described in this prospectus and subject to the rights of the holder of the related Companion Loan under the related Intercreditor
Agreement, the special servicer may generally be replaced, prior to the occurrence and continuance of a Control Termination Event,
at any time and without cause, by the Directing Certificateholder so long as, among other things, the Directing Certificateholder
appoints a replacement special servicer that meets the requirements of the PSA, including that the trustee and the certificate
administrator receive a Rating Agency Confirmation from each Rating Agency and that such replacement special servicer may not be
the asset representations reviewer or any of its affiliates. The reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of any such termination
incurred by the Directing Certificateholder without cause (including the costs of obtaining a Rating Agency Confirmation) will
be paid by the holders of the Controlling Class.
Â 


429
Â 
Â 
After the occurrence and during the continuance
of a Control Termination Event, upon (i)Â the written direction of holders of Principal Balance Certificates evidencing not
less than 25% of the Voting Rights (taking into account the application of any Appraisal Reduction Amounts to notionally reduce
the Certificate Balances) of the Principal Balance Certificates requesting a vote to replace the special servicer with a new special
servicer, (ii)Â payment by such holders to the certificate administrator of the reasonable fees and expenses (including any
legal fees and any Rating Agency fees and expenses) to be incurred by the certificate administrator in connection with administering
such vote (which fees and expenses will not be additional trust fund expenses), and (iii)Â delivery by such holders to the
certificate administrator and the trustee of Rating Agency Confirmation from each Rating Agency (such Rating Agency Confirmation
will be obtained at the expense of those holders of certificates requesting such vote), the certificate administrator will be required
to post notice of the same on the certificate administratorâs website and concurrently by mail and conduct the solicitation
of votes of all certificates in such regard, which such vote must occur within 180 days of the posting of such notice. Upon the
written direction of holders of Principal Balance Certificates evidencing at least 75% of a Certificateholder Quorum, the trustee
will be required to terminate all of the rights and obligations of the special servicer under the PSA and appoint the successor
special servicer (which must be a Qualified Replacement Special Servicer) designated by such Certificateholders, subject to indemnification,
right to outstanding fees, reimbursement of Advances and other rights set forth in the PSA, which survive such termination. The
certificate administrator will include on each Distribution Date Statement a statement that each Certificateholder may access such
notices via the certificate administratorâs website and that each Certificateholder may register to receive electronic mail
notifications when such notices are posted thereon.
Â 
A âCertificateholder Quorumâ
means, in connection with any solicitation of votes in connection with the replacement of the special servicer or asset representations
reviewer described above, the holders of certificates evidencing at least 75% of the aggregate Voting Rights (taking into account
the application of Realized Losses and, other than with respect to the termination of the asset representations reviewer, the application
of any Appraisal Reduction Amounts to notionally reduce the Certificate Balance of the certificates) of all Principal Balance Certificates
on an aggregate basis.
Â 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the special
servicer is a Borrower Party with respect to any Mortgage Loan or Serviced Whole Loan (any such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Whole
Loan, an âExcluded Special Servicer Loanâ), the special servicer will be required to resign as special servicer
of that Excluded Special Servicer Loan. Prior to the occurrence and continuance of a Control Termination Event, if the applicable
Excluded Special Servicer Loan is not also an Excluded Loan, the Directing Certificateholder or the Controlling Class Certificateholder
on its behalf will be required to select a successor special servicer that is not a Borrower Party in accordance with the terms
of the PSA (the âExcluded Special Servicerâ) for the related Excluded Special Servicer Loan. After the occurrence
and during the continuance of a Control Termination Event or if at any time the applicable Excluded Special Servicer Loan is also
an Excluded Loan, the resigning special servicer will be required to select the related Excluded Special Servicer. The special
servicer will not have any liability with respect to the actions or inactions of the applicable Excluded Special Servicer or with
respect to the identity of the applicable Excluded Special Servicer so long as the selected Excluded Special Servicer is a Qualified
Replacement Special Servicer. It will be a condition to any such appointment that (i)Â the Rating Agencies confirm that the
appointment would not result in a qualification, downgrade or withdrawal of any of their then-current ratings of the certificates
and the equivalent from each NRSRO hired to provide ratings with respect to any class of securities backed, wholly or partially,
by any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, (ii)Â the applicable Excluded Special Servicer is a Qualified
Â 

430
Â 
Â 
Replacement Special
Servicer and (iii)Â the applicable Excluded Special Servicer delivers to the depositor and the certificate administrator and
any applicable depositor and certificate administrator of any other securitization, if applicable, that contains a Serviced Pari
Passu Companion Loan, the information, if any, required pursuant to Item 6.02 of the Form 8-K regarding itself in its role as Excluded
Special Servicer.
Â 
If at any time the special servicer is no
longer a Borrower Party with respect to an Excluded Special Servicer Loan, (1)Â the related Excluded Special Servicer will
be required to resign, (2)Â the related Mortgage Loan or Serviced Whole Loan will no longer be an Excluded Special Servicer
Loan, (3)Â the special servicer will become the special servicer again for such related Mortgage Loan or Serviced Whole Loan
and (4)Â the special servicer will be entitled to all special servicing compensation with respect to such Mortgage Loan or
Serviced Whole Loan earned during such time on and after such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Whole Loan is no longer an Excluded Special
Servicer Loan.
Â 
The applicable Excluded Special Servicer
will be required to perform all of the obligations of the special servicer for the related Excluded Special Servicer Loan and will
be entitled to all special servicing compensation with respect to such Excluded Special Servicer Loan earned during such time as
the related Mortgage Loan or Serviced Whole Loan is an Excluded Special Servicer Loan.
Â 
A âQualified Replacement Special
Servicerâ is a replacement special servicer that (i)Â satisfies all of the eligibility requirements applicable to
special servicers in the PSA, (ii)Â is not the operating advisor, the asset representations reviewer or an affiliate of the
operating advisor or the asset representations reviewer, (iii)Â is not obligated to pay the operating advisor (x)Â any
fees or otherwise compensate the operating advisor in respect of its obligations under the PSA, or (y)Â for the appointment
of the successor special servicer or the recommendation by the operating advisor for the replacement special servicer to become
the special servicer, (iv)Â is not entitled to receive any compensation from the operating advisor other than compensation
that is not material and is unrelated to the operating advisorâs recommendation that such party be appointed as the replacement
special servicer, (v)Â is not entitled to receive any fee from the operating advisor for its appointment as successor special
servicer, in each case, unless expressly approved by 100% of the Certificateholders, (vi)Â is not a special servicer that has
been cited by Moodyâs or KBRA as having servicing concerns as the sole or material factor in any qualification, downgrade
or withdrawal of the ratings (or placement on âwatch statusâ in contemplation of a ratings downgrade or withdrawal)
of securities in a transaction serviced by the applicable servicer prior to the time of determination and (vii)Â currently
has a special servicer rating of at least âCSS3â from Fitch.
Â 
In addition, after the occurrence of a Consultation
Termination Event, if the operating advisor determines that the special servicer is not performing its duties as required under
the PSA or is otherwise not acting in accordance with the Servicing Standard, the operating advisor will have the right to recommend
the replacement of the special servicer. In such event, the operating advisor will be required to deliver to the trustee and the
certificate administrator, with a copy to the special servicer, a written recommendation detailing the reasons supporting its position
(along with relevant information justifying its recommendation) and recommending a suggested replacement special servicer (which
must be a Qualified Replacement Special Servicer). The certificate administrator will be required to notify each Certificateholder
of the recommendation and post it on the certificate administratorâs internet website, and to conduct the solicitation of
votes with respect to such recommendation.
Â 


431
Â 
Â 
The operating advisorâs recommendation
to replace the special servicer must be confirmed by an affirmative vote of holders of Principal Balance Certificates evidencing
at least a majority of the aggregate Voting Rights (taking into account the application of any Appraisal Reduction Amounts to notionally
reduce the respective Certificate Balances) of all Principal Balance Certificates on an aggregate basis. In the event the holders
of such Principal Balance Certificates elect to remove and replace the special servicer, the certificate administrator will be
required to receive a Rating Agency Confirmation from each of the Rating Agencies at that time. In the event the certificate administrator
receives a Rating Agency Confirmation from each of the Rating Agencies (and the successor special servicer agrees to be bound by
the terms of the PSA), the trustee will then be required to terminate all of the rights and obligations of the special servicer
under the PSA and to appoint the successor special servicer approved by the Certificateholders, provided that such successor
special servicer is a Qualified Replacement Special Servicer, subject to the terminated special servicerâs rights to indemnification,
payment of outstanding fees, reimbursement of Advances and other rights set forth in the PSA that survive termination. The reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses of outside counsel) associated with obtaining such
Rating Agency Confirmations and administering the vote of the applicable holders of the Principal Balance Certificates and the
operating advisorâs identification of a Qualified Replacement Special Servicer will be an additional trust fund expense.
Â 
In any case, the trustee will notify the
outgoing special servicer promptly of the effective date of its termination. Any replacement special servicer recommended by the
operating advisor must be a Qualified Replacement Special Servicer.
Â 
No appointment of a special servicer will
be effective until the depositor or the depositor for the securitization of a Companion Loan has filed any required Exchange Act
filings related to the removal and replacement of the special servicer.
Â 
With respect to any Non-Serviced Whole Loans,
the related Non-Serviced Special Servicer may be removed, and a successor special servicer appointed at any time by the related
Non-Serviced Directing Certificateholder (and not by the Directing Certificateholder for this transaction) to the extent set forth
in the related Non-Serviced PSA and the related Intercreditor Agreement for such Non-Serviced Whole Loan. See âDescription
of the Mortgage PoolâThe Whole LoansâThe Non-Serviced Pari Passu Whole Loansâ and ââServicing
of the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loansâ below.
Â 
Termination of Master
Servicer and Special Servicer for Cause
Â 
Servicer Termination Events
Â 
A âServicer Termination Eventâ
under the PSA with respect to the master servicer or the special servicer, as the case may be, will include, without limitation:
Â 
(a)Â (i)Â any failure by
the master servicer to make a required deposit to the Collection Account or remit to the companion paying agent for deposit into
the Companion Distribution Account on the day and by the time such deposit or remittance was first required to be made, which failure
is not remedied within one business day, or (ii)Â any failure by the master servicer to deposit into, or remit to the certificate
administrator for deposit into, the Distribution Account any amount required to be so deposited or remitted, which failure is not
remedied by 11:00 a.m. New York City time on the relevant Distribution Date;
Â 


432
Â 
Â 
(b)Â any failure by the special
servicer to deposit into the REO Account within one business day after the day such deposit is required to be made, or to remit
to the master servicer for deposit in the Collection Account, or any other account required under the PSA, any such deposit or
remittance required to be made by the special servicer pursuant to, and at the time specified by, the PSA;
Â 
(c)Â any failure by the master
servicer or the special servicer, as the case may be, duly to observe or perform in any material respect any of its other covenants
or obligations under the PSA, which failure continues unremedied for 30 days (or (i)Â with respect to any year that a report
on Form 10-K is required to be filed, 5 business days in the case of the master servicerâs or special servicerâs obligations
under the PSA in respect of Exchange Act reporting items (after any applicable grace periods), (ii)Â 15 days in the case of
the master servicerâs failure to make a Servicing Advance or (iii)Â 15 days in the case of a failure to pay the premium
for any property insurance policy required to be maintained under the PSA) after written notice of the failure has been given to
the master servicer or the special servicer, as the case may be, by any other party to the PSA, or to the master servicer or the
special servicer, as the case may be, with a copy to each other party to the related PSA, by Certificateholders evidencing not
less than 25% of all Voting Rights or, with respect to a Serviced Whole Loan if affected by that failure, by the holder of the
related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan; provided, however, that if that failure is capable of being cured and
the master servicer or the special servicer, as the case may be, is diligently pursuing that cure, such period will be extended
an additional 30 days; provided, further, however, that such extended period will not apply to the obligations
regarding Exchange Act reporting;
Â 
(d)Â any breach on the part
of the master servicer or the special servicer, as the case may be, of any representation or warranty in the PSA that materially
and adversely affects the interests of any class of Certificateholders or holders of any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan and
that continues unremedied for a period of 30 days after the date on which notice of that breach, requiring the same to be remedied,
will have been given to the master servicer or the special servicer, as the case may be, by the depositor, the certificate administrator
or the trustee, or to the master servicer, the special servicer, the depositor, the certificate administrator and the trustee by
the Certificateholders evidencing not less than 25% of Voting Rights or, with respect to a Serviced Whole Loan affected by such
breach, by the holder of the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan; provided, however, that if that breach is
capable of being cured and the master servicer or the special servicer, as the case may be, is diligently pursuing that cure, that
30-day period will be extended an additional 30 days;
Â 
(e)Â certain events of insolvency,
readjustment of debt, marshaling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings in respect of or relating to the master servicer
or the special servicer, and certain actions by or on behalf of the master servicer or the special servicer indicating its insolvency
or inability to pay its obligations;
Â 
(f)Â either of Moodyâs
or KBRA (or, in the case of Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Securities, any Companion Loan Rating Agency) has (i)Â qualified,
downgraded or withdrawn its rating or ratings of one or more classes of certificates or serviced companion loan securities, as
applicable, or (ii)Â has placed one or more classes of certificates or serviced companion loan securities, as applicable, on
âwatch statusâ in contemplation of a ratings downgrade or withdrawal (and in the case of clauseÂ (i) or (ii), such
action has not been withdrawn by Moodyâs or KBRA (or, in the case of Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Securities, any Companion
Loan Rating Agency) within 60 days) and, in the case of either of clausesÂ (i) or (ii), publicly citing servicing concerns
with the
Â 

433
Â 
Â 
master servicer or the special servicer, as the case may be, as the sole or a material factor in such action; or
Â 
(g)Â the master servicer or
the special servicer, as the case may be, is no longer rated at least âCMS3â or âCSS3â, respectively, by
Fitch and such master servicer or special servicer is not reinstated to at least that rating within 60 days of the delisting.
Â 
âServiced Pari Passu Companion
Loan Securitiesâ means, for so long as the related Mortgage Loan or any successor REO Loan is part of the Mortgage Pool,
any class of securities issued by another securitization and backed by a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan.
Â 
Rights Upon Servicer Termination
Event
Â 
If a Servicer Termination Event occurs with
respect to the master servicer or the special servicer under the PSA, then, so long as the Servicer Termination Event remains unremedied,
the depositor or the trustee will be authorized, and at the written direction of Certificateholders entitled to a majority of the
Voting Rights or, for so long as no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the Directing Certificateholder (solely
with respect to the special servicer and other than with respect to an Excluded Loan), the trustee will be required to terminate
all of the rights and obligations of the defaulting party as master servicer or the special servicer, as the case may be (other
than certain rights in respect of indemnification and certain items of servicing compensation), under the PSA. The trustee will
then succeed to all of the responsibilities, duties and liabilities of the defaulting party as master servicer or special servicer,
as the case may be, under the PSA and will be entitled to similar compensation arrangements. If the trustee is unwilling or unable
to so act, it may (or, at the written request of Certificateholders entitled to a majority of the Voting Rights, or, for so long
as no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing and other than in respect of an Excluded Loan, the Directing Certificateholder,
it will be required to) appoint, or petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint, a mortgage loan servicing institution,
subject to the trusteeâs receipt of a Rating Agency Confirmation from each of the Rating Agencies and, with respect to a
successor special servicer, for so long as no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, that has been approved
by the Directing Certificateholder, which approval may not be unreasonably withheld. In addition, none of the asset representations
reviewer, the operating advisor and their respective affiliates may be appointed as a successor master servicer or special servicer.
Â 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in the section above, if a Servicer Termination Event on the part of the special servicer remains unremedied and affects
the holder of a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, and the special servicer has not otherwise been terminated, the holder of such
Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan (or, if applicable, the related trustee, acting at the direction of the related directing certificateholder
(or similar entity)) will be entitled to direct the trustee to terminate the special servicer solely with respect to the related
Serviced Pari Passu Mortgage Loan. The appointment (or replacement) of a special servicer with respect to a Serviced Whole Loan
will in any event be subject to Rating Agency Confirmation from each Rating Agency. A replacement special servicer will be selected
by the trustee or, prior to a Consultation Termination Event, by the Directing Certificateholder; provided, however,
that any successor special servicer appointed to replace the special servicer with respect to a Serviced Pari Passu Mortgage Loan
cannot at any time be the person (or an affiliate of such person) that was terminated at the direction of the holder of the related
Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, without the prior written consent of such holder of the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion
Loan.
Â 


434
Â 
Â 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in the section above, if a servicer termination event on the part of a Non-Serviced Special Servicer remains unremedied
and affects the holder of the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, and such Non-Serviced Special Servicer has not otherwise been
terminated, the trustee, acting at the direction of the Directing Certificateholder, will generally be entitled to direct the related
Non-Serviced Trustee to terminate such Non-Serviced Special Servicer solely with respect to the related Non-Serviced Whole Loan(s),
and a successor will be appointed in accordance with the related Non-Serviced PSA.
Â 
In addition, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in the section described above, if the master servicer receives notice of termination solely due to a Servicer
Termination Event described in clausesÂ (f) or (g) under ââTermination of Master Servicer and Special Servicer
for CauseâServicer Termination Eventsâ above, and prior to being replaced as described in the third preceding paragraph,
the master servicer will have 45 days after receipt of the notice of termination to find, and sell its rights and obligations to,
a successor master servicer that meets the requirements of a master servicer under the PSA; provided that the Rating Agencies
have each provided a Rating Agency Confirmation. The termination of the master servicer will be effective when such successor master
servicer has succeeded the terminated master servicer, as successor master servicer and such successor master servicer has assumed
the terminated master servicerâs servicing obligations and responsibilities under the PSA. If a successor has not entered
into the PSA as successor master servicer within 45 days after notice of the termination of the master servicer, the master servicer
will be replaced by the trustee as described above.
Â 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1)Â if
any Servicer Termination Event on the part of the master servicer affects a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, the related holder
of a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan or the rating on any class of certificates backed, wholly or partially, by any Serviced
Pari Passu Companion Loan, and if the master servicer is not otherwise terminated, or (2)Â if a Servicer Termination Event
on the part of the master servicer affects only a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, the related holder of a Serviced Pari Passu
Companion Loan or the rating on any class of certificates backed, wholly or partially, by any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan,
then the master servicer may not be terminated by or at the direction of the related holder of such Serviced Pari Passu Companion
Loan or the holders of any certificates backed, wholly or partially, by such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, but upon the written
direction of the related holder of such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, the master servicer will be required to appoint a sub-servicer
that will be responsible for servicing the related Serviced Whole Loan.
Â 
Further, if replaced as a result of a Servicer
Termination Event, the master servicer or special servicer, as the case may be, will be responsible for the costs and expenses
associated with the transfer of its duties.
Â 
Waiver of Servicer Termination
Event
Â 
The Certificateholders representing at least
66 -2/3% of the Voting Rights allocated to certificates affected by any Servicer Termination Event may waive such Servicer Termination
Event; provided, however, that a Servicer Termination Event under clauseÂ (a), (b) or (f) of the definition of
âServicer Termination Eventâ may be waived only with the consent of all of the Certificateholders of the affected classes
and a Servicer Termination Event under clauseÂ (c) of the definition of âServicer Termination Eventâ relating to
Exchange Act reporting may be waived only with the consent of the depositor. Upon any such waiver of a Servicer Termination Event,
such Servicer Termination Event will cease to exist and will be deemed to have been remedied. Upon any such waiver of a Servicer
Termination Event by Certificateholders, the trustee and the certificate administrator will be entitled to recover
Â 

435
Â 
Â 
all costs and
expenses incurred by it in connection with enforcement actions taken with respect to such Servicer Termination Event prior to such
waiver from the issuing entity.
Â 
Resignation of the
Master Servicer and Special Servicer
Â 
The PSA permits the master servicer and
the special servicer to resign from their respective obligations only upon (a) the appointment of, and the acceptance of the appointment
by, a successor (which may be appointed by the resigning master servicer or special servicer, as applicable) and receipt by the
certificate administrator and the trustee of a Rating Agency Confirmation from each of the Rating Agencies and confirmation of
the applicable rating agencies that such action will not result in the downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of its then-current
ratings of any securities related to a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan (provided that such rating agency confirmation
may be considered satisfied in the same manner as any Rating Agency Confirmation required under the PSA may be considered satisfied
with respect to the certificates as described in this prospectus); and, as to the special servicer only, for so long as no Control
Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the approval of such successor by the Directing Certificateholder, which approval
will not be unreasonably withheld or (b) a determination that their respective obligations are no longer permissible with respect
to the master servicer or the special servicer, as the case may be, under applicable law. In the event that the master servicer
or special servicer resigns as a result of the determination that their respective obligations are no longer permissible under
applicable law, the trustee will then succeed to all of the responsibilities, duties and liabilities of the defaulting party as
master servicer or special servicer, as the case may be, under the PSA and will be entitled to similar compensation arrangements.
If the trustee is unwilling or unable to so act, it may appoint, or petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint, a mortgage
loan servicing institution, subject to the trusteeâs receipt of a Rating Agency Confirmation from each of the Rating Agencies
and, with respect to a successor special servicer, for so long as no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing,
which has been approved by the Directing Certificateholder, which approval may not be unreasonably withheld.
Â 
No resignation will become effective until
the trustee or other successor has assumed the obligations and duties of the resigning master servicer or special servicer, as
the case may be, under the PSA. Further, the resigning master servicer or special servicer, as the case may be, must pay all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses associated with the transfer of its duties. Other than as described under ââTermination
of Master Servicer and Special Servicer for CauseâServicer Termination Eventsâ above, in no event will the master
servicer or the special servicer have the right to appoint any successor master servicer or special servicer if such master servicer
or special servicer, as applicable, is terminated or removed pursuant to the PSA. In addition, the PSA will prohibit the appointment
of the asset representations reviewer, the operating advisor or one of their respective affiliates as successor to the master servicer
or the special servicer.
Â 
Limitation on Liability;
Indemnification
Â 
The PSA will provide that none of the master
servicer (including in its capacity as the paying agent for any Companion Loan), the special servicer, the depositor, the operating
advisor, the asset representations reviewer or any partner, shareholder, member, manager, director, officer, employee or agent
of any of them will be under any liability to the issuing entity, Certificateholders or holders of the related Companion Loan,
as applicable, for any action taken, or not taken, in good faith pursuant to the PSA or for errors in judgment; provided,
however, that none of the master servicer (including in its capacity as the paying agent for any Companion Loan), the special
servicer, the depositor, the operating advisor,
Â 

436
Â 
Â 
the asset representations reviewer or similar person will be protected against
any breach of a representation or warranty made by such party, as applicable, in the PSA or any liability that would otherwise
be imposed by reason of willful misconduct, bad faith or negligence in the performance of obligations or duties under the PSA or
by reason of negligent disregard of such obligations and duties. For the purposes of indemnification of the master servicer or
the special servicer and limitation of liability, the master servicer or special servicer will be deemed not to have engaged in
willful misconduct or committed bad faith or negligence in the performance of its respective obligations and duties under the PSA
or acted in negligent disregard of such obligations and duties if the master servicer or special servicer, as applicable, fails
to follow the terms of the Mortgage Loan documents because the master servicer or special servicer, as applicable, in accordance
with the Servicing Standard, determines that compliance with any Mortgage Loan documents would or potentially would cause any Trust
REMIC to fail to qualify as a REMIC or cause a tax to be imposed on the trust or cause the Grantor Trust to fail to qualify as
a grantor trust under the relevant provisions of the Code (for which determination, the master servicer and the special servicer
will be entitled to rely on advice of counsel, the cost of which will be reimbursed as an additional trust fund expense). The PSA
will also provide that the master servicer (including in its capacity as the paying agent for any Companion Loan), the special
servicer, the depositor, the operating advisor, the asset representations reviewer and their respective affiliates and any partner,
shareholder, member, manager, director, officer, employee or agent of any of them will be entitled to indemnification by the issuing
entity against any claims, losses, penalties, fines, forfeitures, reasonable legal fees and related costs, judgments, and other
costs, liabilities, fees and expenses incurred in connection with any actual or threatened legal or administrative action or claim
that relates to the PSA, the Mortgage Loans, any related Companion Loan, the issuing entity or the certificates; provided,
however, that the indemnification will not extend to any loss, liability or expense specifically required to be borne by
such party pursuant to the terms the PSA, incurred in connection with any breach of a representation or warranty made by such party,
as applicable, in the PSA or incurred by reason of willful misconduct, bad faith or negligence in the performance of obligations
or duties under the PSA, by reason of negligent disregard of such partyâs obligations or duties, or in the case of the depositor
and any of its partners, shareholders, directors, officers, members, managers, employees and agents, any violation by any of them
of any state or federal securities law. In addition, absent actual fraud (as determined by a final non-appealable court order),
neither the trustee nor the certificate administrator (including its capacity as custodian) will be liable for special, punitive,
indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if the trustee
or the certificate administrator has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.
The PSA will also provide that any related master servicer, depositor, special servicer, operating advisor (or the equivalent),
asset representations reviewer, paying agent or trustee under any Non-Serviced PSA with respect to a Non-Serviced Companion Loan
and any partner, director, officer, shareholder, member, manager, employee or agent of any of them will be entitled to indemnification
by the issuing entity and held harmless against the issuing entityâs pro rata share (subject to the applicable Intercreditor
Agreement) of any and all claims, losses, penalties, fines, forfeitures, legal fees and related costs, judgments and any other
costs, liabilities, fees and expenses incurred in connection with servicing and administration of such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan
and the related Mortgaged Property (as and to the same extent the securitization trust formed under the related Non-Serviced PSA
is required to indemnify such parties in respect of other mortgage loans in the securitization trust formed under the related Non-Serviced
PSA pursuant to the terms of such Non-Serviced PSA).
Â 


437
Â 
Â 
In addition, the PSA will provide that none
of the master servicer (including in its capacity as the paying agent for any Companion Loans), the special servicer, the depositor,
operating advisor or asset representations reviewer will be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any legal or
administrative action, proceeding, hearing or examination that is not incidental to its respective responsibilities under the PSA
or that in its opinion may involve it in any expense or liability not recoverable from the issuing entity. However, each of the
master servicer, the special servicer, the depositor, the operating advisor and the asset representations reviewer will be permitted,
in the exercise of its discretion, to undertake any action, proceeding, hearing or examination that it may deem necessary or desirable
with respect to the enforcement and/or protection of the rights and duties of the parties to the PSA and the interests of the Certificateholders
(and, in the case of a Serviced Whole Loan, the rights of the Certificateholders and the holders of the related Serviced Pari Passu
Companion Loan (as a collective whole), taking into account the pari passu nature of such Serviced Pari Passu Companion
Loan) under the PSA; provided, however, that if a Serviced Whole Loan and/or the holder of the related Companion
Loan are involved, such expenses, costs and liabilities will be payable out of funds related to such Serviced Whole Loan in accordance
with the related Intercreditor Agreement and will also be payable out of the other funds in the Collection Account if amounts on
deposit with respect to such Serviced Whole Loan are insufficient therefor. If any such expenses, costs or liabilities relate to
a Mortgage Loan or Companion Loan, then any subsequent recovery on that Mortgage Loan or Companion Loan, as applicable, will be
used to reimburse the issuing entity for any amounts advanced for the payment of such expenses, costs or liabilities. In that event,
the legal expenses and costs of the action, proceeding, hearing or examination and any liability resulting therefrom, will be expenses,
costs and liabilities of the issuing entity, and the master servicer (including in its capacity as the paying agent for any Companion
Loans), the special servicer, the depositor, the asset representations reviewer or the operating advisor, as the case may be, will
be entitled to be reimbursed out of the Collection Account for the expenses.
Â 
Pursuant to the PSA, the master servicer
and the special servicer will each be required to maintain a fidelity bond and errors and omissions policy or their equivalent
with a qualified insurer that provides coverage against losses that may be sustained as a result of an officerâs or employeeâs
misappropriation of funds or errors and omissions, subject to certain limitations as to amount of coverage, deductible amounts,
conditions, exclusions and exceptions permitted by the PSA. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the master servicer and the special
servicer will be allowed to self-insure with respect to an errors and omissions policy and a fidelity bond so long as certain conditions
set forth in the PSA are met.
Â 
Any person into which the master servicer,
the special servicer, the depositor, operating advisor, or asset representations reviewer may be merged or consolidated, or any
person resulting from any merger or consolidation to which the master servicer, the special servicer, the depositor, operating
advisor or asset representations reviewer is a party, or any person succeeding to the business of the master servicer, the special
servicer, the depositor, operating advisor or asset representations reviewer, will be the successor of the master servicer, the
special servicer, the depositor, operating advisor or asset representations reviewer, as the case may be, under the PSA, subject
to certain conditions set forth in the PSA. The master servicer, the special servicer, the operating advisor and the asset representations
reviewer may have other normal business relationships with the depositor or the depositorâs affiliates.
Â 
The trustee and the certificate administrator
make no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of the PSA (other than as to it being a valid obligation of the trustee
and the certificate administrator), the certificates, the Mortgage Loans, this prospectus (other than
Â 

438
Â 
Â 
as to the accuracy of the
information provided by the trustee and the certificate administrator as set forth above) or any related documents and will not
be accountable for the use or application by the depositor of any of the certificates issued to it or of the proceeds of such certificates,
or for the use or application of any funds paid to the depositor in respect of the assignment of the Mortgage Loans to the issuing
entity, or any funds deposited in or withdrawn from the Collection Account or any other account by or on behalf of the depositor,
the master servicer, the special servicer or, in the case of the trustee, the certificate administrator. The PSA provides that
no provision of such agreement will be construed to relieve the trustee and the certificate administrator from liability for their
own negligent action, their own negligent failure to act or their own willful misconduct or bad faith.
Â 
The PSA provides that neither the trustee
nor the certificate administrator, as applicable, will be liable for an error of judgment made in good faith by a responsible officer
of the trustee or the certificate administrator, unless it is proven that the trustee or the certificate administrator, as applicable,
was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts. In addition, neither the trustee nor the certificate administrator, as applicable,
will be liable with respect to any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction
of holders of certificates entitled to greater than 25% of the percentage interest of each affected class, or of the aggregate
Voting Rights of the certificates, relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available
to the trustee and the certificate administrator, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the trustee and the certificate
administrator, under the PSA (unless a higher percentage of Voting Rights is required for such action).
Â 
The trustee and the certificate administrator
and any director, officer, employee, representative or agent of the trustee and the certificate administrator, will be entitled
to indemnification by the issuing entity, to the extent of amounts held in the Collection Account or the Lower-Tier REMIC Distribution
Account from time to time, for any loss, liability, damages, claims or unanticipated expenses (including reasonable attorneysâ
fees and expenses) arising out of or incurred by the trustee or the certificate administrator in connection with their participation
in the transaction and any act or omission of the trustee or the certificate administrator relating to the exercise and performance
of any of the powers and duties of the trustee and the certificate administrator (including in any capacities in which they serve,
e.g., paying agent, REMIC administrator, authenticating agent, custodian, certificate registrar and 17g-5 Information Provider)
under the PSA. However, the indemnification will not extend to any loss, liability or expense that constitutes a specific liability
imposed on the trustee or the certificate administrator pursuant to the PSA, or to any loss, liability or expense incurred by reason
of willful misconduct, bad faith or negligence on the part of the trustee or the certificate administrator in the performance of
their obligations and duties under the PSA, or by reason of their negligent disregard of those obligations or duties, or as may
arise from a breach of any representation or warranty of the trustee or the certificate administrator made in the PSA.
Â 
The rights and protections afforded to the
trustee and the certificate administrator as set forth above and under the PSA will also apply to the custodian.
Â 
Enforcement of Mortgage
Loan Sellerâs Obligations Under the MLPA
Â 
In the event any party to the PSA receives
a request or demand from a Requesting Certificateholder to the effect that a Mortgage Loan should be repurchased or replaced due
to a Material Defect, or if such party to the PSA determines that a Mortgage Loan should be repurchased or replaced due to a Material
Defect, that party to the PSA will be required to promptly forward such request or demand to the master servicer and the special
servicer,
Â 

439
Â 
Â 
and the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, will be required to promptly forward it to the related
mortgage loan seller. The special servicer will be required to enforce the obligations of the mortgage loan sellers under the MLPAs
pursuant to the terms of the PSA and the MLPAs. These obligations include obligations resulting from a Material Defect. Subject
to the provisions of the applicable MLPA relating to the dispute resolutions as described under âDescription of the Mortgage
Loan Purchase AgreementsâDispute Resolution Provisionsâ, such enforcement, including, without limitation, the legal
prosecution of claims, if any, will be required to be carried out in such form, to such extent and at such time as the special
servicer would require were it, in its individual capacity, the owner of the affected Mortgage Loan.
Â 
Within 30Â days after receipt of an
Asset Review Report with respect to any Mortgage Loan, the special servicer will be required to determine, based on the Servicing
Standard, whether there exists a Material Defect with respect to such Mortgage Loan. If the special servicer determines that a
Material Defect exists, the special servicer will be required to enforce the obligations of the applicable mortgage loan seller
under the MLPA with respect to such Material Defect as discussed in the preceding paragraph. See ââThe Asset Representations
ReviewerâAsset Reviewâ above.
Â 
Any costs incurred by the special servicer
with respect to the enforcement of the obligations of a mortgage loan seller under the applicable MLPA will be deemed to be Servicing
Advances, to the extent not recovered from the mortgage loan seller or the Requesting Investor. See âDescription of the
Mortgage Loan Purchase AgreementsâDispute Resolution Provisionsâ.
Â 
Dispute Resolution
Provisions
Â 
Certificateholderâs
Rights When a Repurchase Request Is Initially Delivered by a Certificateholder
Â 
In the event an Initial Requesting Certificateholder
delivers a written request to a party to the PSA that a Mortgage Loan be repurchased by the applicable mortgage loan seller alleging
the existence of a Material Defect with respect to such Mortgage Loan and setting forth the basis for such allegation (a âCertificateholder
Repurchase Requestâ), the receiving party will be required to promptly forward that Certificateholder Repurchase Request
to the special servicer, and the special servicer will be required to promptly forward it to the applicable mortgage loan seller
and each other party to the PSA. An âInitial Requesting Certificateholderâ is the first Certificateholder or
Certificate Owner to deliver a Certificateholder Repurchase Request as described above with respect to a Mortgage Loan, and there
may not be more than one Initial Requesting Certificateholder with respect to any Mortgage Loan. Subject to the provisions described
below under this heading ââDispute Resolution Provisionsâ, the special servicer (the âEnforcing
Servicerâ) will be the Enforcing Party with respect to the Certificateholder Repurchase Request.
Â 
An âEnforcing Partyâ
is the person obligated to or that elects pursuant to the terms of the PSA to enforce the rights of the issuing entity against
the related mortgage loan seller with respect to a Repurchase Request.
Â 
Repurchase Request Delivered
by a Party to the PSA
Â 
In the event that the depositor, the master
servicer, the special servicer, the trustee, the certificate administrator, the operating advisor (solely in its capacity as operating
advisor) or the directing certificateholder has knowledge of a Material Defect with respect to a Mortgage Loan, that party will
be required to deliver prompt written notice of such
Â 

440
Â 
Â 
Material Defect to each other party to the PSA and the applicable mortgage
loan seller, identifying the applicable Mortgage Loan and setting forth the basis for such allegation (a âPSA Party Repurchase
Requestâ and, each of a Certificateholder Repurchase Request or a PSA Party Repurchase Request, a âRepurchase
Requestâ), and the Enforcing Servicer will be required to promptly send the PSA Party Repurchase Request to the related
mortgage loan seller. The Enforcing Servicer will be required to act as the Enforcing Party and enforce the rights of the issuing
entity against the related mortgage loan seller with respect to the PSA Party Repurchase Request. However, if a Resolution Failure
occurs with respect to the PSA Party Repurchase Request, the provisions described below under ââResolution of a
Repurchase Requestâ will apply.
Â 
In the event the Repurchase Request is not
Resolved within 180 days after the mortgage loan seller receives the Repurchase Request (a âResolution Failureâ),
then the provisions described below under ââResolution of a Repurchase Requestâ will apply. Receipt of
the Repurchase Request will be deemed to occur 2 business days after the Repurchase Request is sent to the related mortgage loan
seller. A Resolved Repurchase Request will not preclude the master servicer (in the case of non-Specially Serviced Loans) or the
special servicer (in the case of Specially Serviced Loans) from exercising any of their respective rights related to a Material
Defect in the manner and timing otherwise set forth in the PSA, in the related MLPA or as provided by law. âResolvedâ
means, with respect to a Repurchase Request, (i) that the related Material Defect has been cured, (ii) the related Mortgage Loan
has been repurchased in accordance with the related MLPA, (iii) a mortgage loan has been substituted for the related Mortgage Loan
in accordance with the related MLPA, (iv) the applicable mortgage loan seller makes a Loss of Value Payment, (v) a contractually
binding agreement is entered into between the Enforcing Servicer, on behalf of the issuing entity, and the related mortgage loan
seller that settles the related mortgage loan sellerâs obligations under the related MLPA or (vi) the related Mortgage Loan
is no longer property of the issuing entity as a result of a sale or other disposition in accordance with the PSA.
Â 
Resolution of a Repurchase
Request
Â 
After a Resolution Failure occurs with respect
to a Repurchase Request regarding a Mortgage Loan (whether the Repurchase Request was initiated by an Initial Requesting Certificateholder
or by a party to the PSA), the Enforcing Servicer will be required to send a notice (a âProposed Course of Action Noticeâ)
to the Initial Requesting Certificateholder, if any, to the address specified in the Initial Requesting Certificateholderâs
Repurchase Request, and to the certificate administrator who will make such notice available to all other Certificateholders and
Certificate Owners (by posting such notice on the certificate administratorâs website) indicating the Enforcing Servicerâs
intended course of action with respect to the Repurchase Request. Such notice will be required to include a request to Certificateholders
to indicate their agreement with or dissent from such Proposed Course of Action, as well as notice that in the event any Certificateholder
disagrees with the Proposed Course of Action, the Enforcing Servicer will be compelled to follow the course of action agreed to
and/or proposed by the majority of the responding Certificateholders that involves referring the matter to mediation or arbitration,
as the case may be. If (a)Â the Enforcing Servicerâs intended course of action with respect to the Repurchase Request
does not involve pursuing further action to exercise rights against the related mortgage loan seller with respect to the Repurchase
Request and the Initial Requesting Certificateholder, if any, or any other Certificateholder or Certificate Owner wishes to exercise
its right to refer the matter to mediation (including nonbinding arbitration) or arbitration, as discussed below under ââMediation
and Arbitration Provisionsâ, or (b)Â the Enforcing Servicerâs intended course of action is to pursue further
action to exercise rights against the related mortgage loan seller with respect to the Repurchase Request but the Initial Requesting
Â 

441
Â 
Â 
Certificateholder, if any, or any other Certificateholder or Certificate Owner does not agree with the dispute resolution method
selected by the Enforcing Servicer, then the Initial Requesting Certificateholder, if any, or such other Certificateholder or Certificate
Owner may deliver to the Enforcing Servicer a written notice (a âPreliminary Dispute Resolution Election Noticeâ)
within 30 days from the date the Proposed Course of Action Notice is posted on the certificate administratorâs website (the
âDispute Resolution Cut-off Dateâ) indicating its intent to exercise its right to refer the matter to either
mediation or arbitration. In the event any Certificateholder or Certificate Owner delivers a Preliminary Dispute Resolution Election
Notice, and the Enforcing Servicer has also received responses from other Certificateholders or Certificate Owners supporting the
Enforcing Servicerâs initial Proposed Course of Action, such responses will be considered Preliminary Dispute Resolution
Election Notices supporting the Proposed Course of Action.
Â 
If neither the Initial Requesting Certificateholder,
if any, nor any other Certificateholder or Certificate Owner delivers a Preliminary Dispute Resolution Election Notice prior to
the Dispute Resolution Cut-off Date, no Certificateholder or Certificate Owner will have the right to refer the Repurchase Request
to mediation or arbitration, and the Enforcing Servicer, as the Enforcing Party, will be the sole party entitled to determine a
course of action, including, but not limited to, enforcing the issuing entityâs rights against the related mortgage loan
seller, subject to any consent or consultation rights of the Directing Certificateholder.
Â 
Promptly and in any event within 10 business
days following receipt of a Preliminary Dispute Resolution Election Notice from (i)Â the Initial Requesting Certificateholder,
if any, or (ii)Â any other Certificateholder or Certificate Owner (each of clausesÂ (i) and (ii), a âRequesting
Certificateholderâ), the Enforcing Servicer will be required to consult with each Requesting Certificateholder regarding
such Requesting Certificateholderâs intention to elect either mediation (including nonbinding arbitration) or arbitration
as the dispute resolution method with respect to the Repurchase Request (the âDispute Resolution Consultationâ)
so that such Requesting Certificateholder may consider the views of the Enforcing Servicer as to the claims underlying the Repurchase
Request and possible dispute resolution methods, such discussions to occur and be completed no later than 10 business days following
the Dispute Resolution Cut-off Date. The Enforcing Servicer will be entitled to establish procedures the Enforcing Servicer deems
in good faith to be appropriate relating to the timing and extent of such consultations. No later than 5 business days after completion
of the Dispute Resolution Consultation, a Requesting Certificateholder may provide a final notice to the Enforcing Servicer indicating
its decision to exercise its right to refer the matter to either mediation or arbitration (âFinal Dispute Resolution Election
Noticeâ).
Â 
If, following the Dispute Resolution Consultation,
no Requesting Certificateholder timely delivers a Final Dispute Resolution Election Notice to the Enforcing Servicer, then the
Enforcing Servicer will continue to act as the Enforcing Party and remain obligated under the PSA to determine a course of action,
including, but not limited to, enforcing the rights of the issuing entity with respect to the Repurchase Request and no Certificateholder
or Certificate Owner will have any further right to elect to refer the matter to mediation or arbitration.
Â 
If a Requesting Certificateholder timely
delivers a Final Dispute Resolution Election Notice to the Enforcing Servicer, then such Requesting Certificateholder will become
the Enforcing Party and must promptly submit the matter to mediation (including nonbinding arbitration) or arbitration. If there
are more than one Requesting Certificateholder that timely deliver a Final Dispute Resolution Election Notice, then such Requesting
Certificateholders will collectively become the Enforcing Party, and the holder or holders of a majority of the Voting Rights among
such Requesting Certificateholders will be entitled to make all decisions relating to such mediation or arbitration. If, however,
no Requesting Certificateholder commences arbitration or mediation pursuant to the terms of the PSA
Â 

442
Â 
Â 
within 30 days after delivery
of its Final Dispute Resolution Election Notice to the Enforcing Servicer, then (i)Â the rights of a Requesting Certificateholder
to act as the Enforcing Party will terminate and no Certificateholder or Certificate Owner will have any further right to elect
to refer the matter to mediation or arbitration, (ii)Â if the Proposed Course of Action Notice indicated that the Enforcing
Servicer will take no further action with respect to the Repurchase Request, then the related Material Defect will be deemed waived
for all purposes under the PSA and related MLPA; provided, however, that such Material Defect will not be deemed
waived with respect to a Requesting Certificateholder, any other Certificateholder or Certificate Owner or the Enforcing Servicer
to the extent there is a material change in the facts and circumstances known to such party at the time when the Proposed Course
of Action Notice was delivered to the Enforcing Servicer and (iii)Â if the Proposed Course of Action Notice had indicated a
course of action other than the course of action under clauseÂ (ii), then the special servicer will again become the Enforcing
Party and, as such, will be the sole party entitled to enforce the issuing entityâs rights against the related mortgage loan
seller.
Â 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the dispute
resolution provisions described under this heading ââResolution of a Repurchase Requestâ will not apply,
and the Enforcing Servicer will remain the Enforcing Party, if the Enforcing Servicer has commenced litigation with respect to
the Repurchase Request, or determines in accordance with the Servicing Standard that it is in the best interest of Certificateholders
to commence litigation with respect to the Repurchase Request to avoid the running of any applicable statute of limitations.
Â 
In the event a Requesting Certificateholder
becomes the Enforcing Party, the Enforcing Servicer, on behalf of the issuing entity, will remain a party to any proceedings against
the related mortgage loan seller as further described below. For the avoidance of doubt, the depositor, the mortgage loan sellers
and any of their respective affiliates will not be entitled to be an Initial Requesting Certificateholder or a Requesting Certificateholder.
Â 
The Requesting Certificateholder is entitled
to elect either mediation or arbitration in its sole discretion; however, the Requesting Certificateholder may not elect to then
utilize the alternative method in the event that the initial method is unsuccessful.
Â 
Mediation and Arbitration
Provisions
Â 
If the Enforcing Party elects mediation
(including nonbinding arbitration) or arbitration, the mediation or arbitration will be administered by a nationally recognized
arbitration or mediation organization selected by the related mortgage loan seller. A single mediator or arbitrator will be selected
by the mediation or arbitration organization from a list of neutrals maintained by it according to its mediation or arbitration
rules then in effect. The mediator or arbitrator must be impartial, an attorney admitted to practice in the State of New York and
have at least 15Â years of experience in commercial litigation and, if possible, commercial real estate finance or commercial
mortgage-backed securitization matters.
Â 
The expenses of any mediation will be allocated
among the parties to the mediation, including, if applicable, between the Enforcing Party and Enforcing Servicer, as mutually agreed
by the parties as part of the mediation.
Â 
In any arbitration, the arbitrator will
be required to resolve the dispute in accordance with the MLPA and PSA, and may not modify or change those agreements in any way
or award remedies not consistent with those agreements. The arbitrator will not have the power to award punitive or consequential
damages. In its final determination, the arbitrator will determine and award the costs of the arbitration to the parties to the
arbitration in its
Â 

443
Â 
Â 
reasonable discretion. In the event a Requesting Certificateholder is the Enforcing Party, the Requesting Certificateholder
will be required to pay any expenses allocated to the Enforcing Party in the arbitration proceedings or any expenses that the Enforcing
Party agrees to bear in the mediation proceedings.
Â 
The final determination of the arbitrator
will be final and non-appealable, except for actions to confirm or vacate the determination permitted under federal or state law,
and may be entered and enforced in any court with jurisdiction over the parties and the matter. By selecting arbitration, the Enforcing
Party would be waiving its right to sue in court, including the right to a trial by jury.
Â 
In the event a Requesting Certificateholder
is the Enforcing Party, the agreement with the arbitrator or mediator, as the case may be, will be required under the PSA to contain
an acknowledgment that the issuing entity, or the Enforcing Servicer on its behalf, will be a party to any arbitration or mediation
proceedings solely for the purpose of being the beneficiary of any award in favor of the Enforcing Party; provided that
the degree and extent to which the Enforcing Servicer actively prepares for and participates in such proceeding will be determined
by such Enforcing Servicer in consultation with the Directing Certificateholder (provided that no Consultation Termination
Event has occurred and is continuing), and in accordance with the Servicing Standard. All amounts recovered by the Enforcing Party
will be required to be paid to the issuing entity, or the Enforcing Servicer on its behalf, and deposited in the Collection Account.
The agreement with the arbitrator or mediator, as the case may be, will provide that in the event a Requesting Certificateholder
is allocated any related costs and expenses pursuant to the terms of the arbitratorâs decision or the agreement reached in
mediation, neither the issuing entity nor the Enforcing Servicer acting on its behalf will be responsible for any such costs and
expenses allocated to the Requesting Certificateholder.
Â 
The issuing entity (or the Enforcing Servicer
or the trustee, acting on its behalf), the depositor or any mortgage loan seller will be permitted to redact any personally identifiable
customer information included in any information provided for purposes of any mediation or arbitration. Each party to the proceedings
will be required to agree to keep confidential the details related to the Repurchase Request and the dispute resolution identified
in connection with such proceedings; provided, however, the Certificateholders will be permitted to communicate prior
to the commencement of any such proceedings to the extent described under âDescription of the CertificatesâCertificateholder
Communicationâ.
Â 
For avoidance of doubt, in no event will
the exercise of any right of a Requesting Certificateholder to refer a Repurchase Request to mediation or arbitration or participation
in such mediation or arbitration affect in any manner the ability of the special servicer to perform its obligations with respect
to a Specially Serviced Loan (including without limitation, a liquidation, foreclosure, negotiation of a loan modification or workout,
acceptance of a discounted pay off or deed in lieu of foreclosure, or bankruptcy or other litigation) or the exercise of any rights
of a Directing Certificateholder.
Â 
Servicing of the Non-Serviced
Mortgage Loans
Â 
The master servicer, the special servicer,
the certificate administrator and the trustee under the PSA have no obligation or authority to (a) supervise any related Non-Serviced
Master Servicer, Non-Serviced Special Servicer, Non-Serviced Certificate Administrator or Non-Serviced Trustee or (b) make Servicing
Advances with respect to any Non-Serviced Whole Loan. The obligation of the master servicer to provide information and collections
and make P&I Advances to the certificate administrator for the benefit of the Certificateholders with respect to each Non-Serviced
Mortgage Loan is dependent on its
Â 

444
Â 
Â 
receipt of the corresponding information and/or collections from the applicable Non-Serviced
Master Servicer or Non-Serviced Special Servicer.
Â 
Servicing of the Empire Mall Mortgage
Loan
Â 
Following the Empire Mall Companion Loan
Securitization Date, the Empire Mall Whole Loan will be a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan and will be serviced by the related Non-Serviced
Master Servicer and the related Non-Serviced Special Servicer pursuant to the terms of the Empire Mall Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
Although the related Intercreditor Agreement imposes some requirements regarding the terms of the Empire Mall Pooling and Servicing
Agreement (and it is expected that the Empire Mall Pooling and Servicing Agreement will contain servicing provisions similar to,
but not identical with, the provisions of the PSA) the securitization to which the Empire Mall Controlling Pari Passu Companion
Loan is to be contributed has not been determined, and accordingly, the servicing terms of the Empire Mall Pooling and Servicing
Agreement are unknown. See âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâThe Whole LoansâThe Serviced Pari Passu Whole
LoansâThe Empire Mall Whole Loanâ in this prospectus.
Â 
Servicing of the Harbor Pointe Apartments
Mortgage Loan, the Anchorage Marriott Downtown Mortgage Loan and the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Mortgage Loan
Â 
Each of the Harbor Pointe Apartments Mortgage
Loan, the Anchorage Marriott Downtown Mortgage Loan and the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Mortgage Loan (collectively, the
âGC35 Serviced Mortgage Loansâ) and any related REO Property is expected to be serviced under the CGCMT 2015-GC35
Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
Â 
The servicing arrangements under the CGCMT
2015-GC35 Pooling and Servicing Agreement are generally similar to, but differ in certain respects from, the servicing arrangements
under the PSA. In that regard, in the case of the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the following are considerations
relating to servicing, including the identification of some (but not all) of the differences in servicing provisions between the
CGCMT 2015-GC35 Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the PSA:
Â 

Â·The CGCMT 2015-GC35 Master Servicer will earn a primary servicing fee with respect to each of the
GC35 Serviced Mortgage Loans that is to be calculated at 0.0025% per annum.
Â 

Â·The CGCMT 2015-GC35 Special Servicer will earn a special servicing fee payable monthly with respect
to each of the GC35 Serviced Mortgage Loans accruing at a rate equal to the greater of 0.25% per annum or such rate as would result
in a special servicing fee of $3,500 for the related month.
Â 

Â·The CGCMT 2015-GC35 Special Servicer will be entitled to a workout fee in respect of any workout
of a GC35 Serviced Mortgage Loan generally calculated in a manner similar, but not necessarily identical, to the corresponding
fee under the PSA, except that such workout fee will accrue at a rate equal to the lesser of 1.0% and such rate as would result
in a workout fee of $1,000,000 and, except as provided under the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the workout fee
payable in respect of any workout of a GC35 Serviced Mortgage Loan will in no event be less than $25,000.
Â 

Â·The CGCMT 2015-GC35 Special Servicer will be entitled to a liquidation fee in respect of any liquidation
or other resolution of a GC35 Serviced Mortgage Loan generally calculated in a manner similar, but not necessarily identical, to
the 
Â 


445
Â 
Â 


corresponding fee under the PSA, except that such liquidation fee will accrue at a rate equal to the lesser of 1.0% and such
rate as would result in a liquidation fee of $1,000,000 and, except as provided under the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, the liquidation fee payable in respect of any liquidation or other resolution of a GC35 Serviced Mortgage Loan will
not be less than $25,000.
Â 

Â·The master servicer or the trustee, as applicable, will be required to make P&I Advances with
respect to each of the GC35 Serviced Mortgage Loans, unless the master servicer or the trustee, as applicable, or the special servicer,
has determined that such Advance would not be recoverable from collections on such Mortgage Loan. The special servicer may, at
its option, make a determination in accordance with the Servicing Standard that any proposed P&I Advance, if made, would be
a Nonrecoverable Advance, which determination will be conclusive and binding on the master servicer and the trustee.
Â 

Â·The CGCMT 2015-GC35 Master Servicer is obligated to make property protection advances with respect
to each of the GC35 Serviced Mortgage Loans (and any related Companion Loans). If the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Master Servicer determines
that a property protection advance it made with respect to any such Mortgage Loan or the related Mortgaged Property is nonrecoverable,
it will be entitled to be reimbursed first from collections on, and proceeds of, the related Mortgage Loan and the related Companion
Loan, on a pro rata basis (based on each such loanâs outstanding principal balance), and then from general collections
on all the Mortgage Loans and from general collections of the CGCMT 2015-GC35 issuing entity, on a pro rata basis (based
on each such loanâs outstanding principal balance).
Â 

Â·Amounts payable with respect to each of the GC35 Serviced Mortgage Loans that are the equivalent
of ancillary fees, penalty charges, assumption fees and/or modification fees and that are allocated as additional servicing compensation
under the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Pooling and Servicing Agreement may be allocated between the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Master Servicer and the
CGCMT 2015-GC35 Special Servicer in proportions that are different from the proportions of similar fees allocated between the master
servicer and the special servicer with respect to Mortgage Loans serviced under the PSA.
Â 

Â·The CGCMT 2015-GC35 Special Servicer will be required to take actions with respect to each of the
GC35 Serviced Mortgage Loans if such Mortgage Loan becomes a defaulted loan, which actions are similar to the actions described
under ââSale of Defaulted Loans and REO Propertiesâ in this prospectus.
Â 

Â·With respect to each of the GC35 Serviced Mortgage Loans, the servicing provisions relating to
performing inspections and collecting operating information are similar to those of the PSA.
Â 

Â·The requirement of the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Master Servicer to make compensating interest payments in
respect of each of the GC35 Serviced Mortgage Loans is similar to the requirement of the master servicer to make Compensating Interest
Payments in respect of the Mortgage Loans serviced under the PSA.
Â 

Â·The CGCMT 2015-GC35 Master Servicer and the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Special Servicer (a)Â have rights
related to resignation similar to those of the master servicer and the Special Servicer under the PSA and (b)Â are subject
to servicer termination events similar to those in the PSA.
Â 


446
Â 
Â 

Â·No amounts payable with respect to the Whole Loans related to the GC35 Serviced Mortgage Loans
that are the equivalent of ancillary fees, assumption fees, modification fees and/or penalty charges will be allocated to the master
servicer or the special servicer under the PSA as additional servicing compensation or otherwise applied in accordance with the
PSA except to the extent that such items are received by the issuing entity with respect to any of the GC35 Serviced Mortgage Loans.
Â 

Â·Penalty charges with respect to each of the Whole Loans related to the GC35 Serviced Mortgage Loans
will be allocated in accordance with the related Intercreditor Agreement.
Â 

Â·The servicing transfer events of the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Pooling and Servicing Agreement that would
cause a GC35 Serviced Mortgage Loan to become specially serviced are similar in all material respects to, but not identical to,
the corresponding provisions under the PSA.
Â 

Â·The specific types of actions constituting major decisions under the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Pooling and
Servicing Agreement differ in certain respects from those actions that constitute Major Decisions under the PSA, and therefore
the specific types of servicer actions with respect to which the applicable Non-Serviced Directing Certificateholder will be permitted
to consent will correspondingly differ.
Â 

Â·With respect to non-specially serviced mortgage loans under the CGCMT 2015-GC35 PSA, each of the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Master Servicer
and the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Special Servicer shall have the power and authority thereunder (as compared to the Special Servicer with
respect to non-Specially Serviced Loans under the PSA), to direct, manage, prosecute and/or defend any action, suit or proceeding
brought by a borrower, guarantor, other obligor under the related mortgage loan documents or any affiliates thereof against the
trust and represent the interests of the trust in any litigation relating to the rights and obligations of a borrower, guarantor
or other obligor under the related mortgage loan documents, or with respect to the related mortgaged property or other collateral
securing a mortgage loan, or of the trust or the enforcement of the obligations of a borrower, guarantor or other obligor under
the related mortgage loan documents.
Â 

Â·The CGCMT 2015-GC35 Special Servicer will be entitled to consent to certain loan-level decisions
(that are not otherwise major decisions) with respect to non-specially serviced mortgage loans, including (i)Â certain waivers
regarding receipt of financial statements, (ii)Â where no lender discretion is permitted other than confirming that the conditions
in the related mortgage loan documents have been satisfied, certain incurrences of additional debt and releases of collateral,
(iii)Â approval of material easements and (iv)Â requests for the funding or disbursement of amounts from escrow accounts,
reserve funds or letters of credit held as âperformance,â âearn-outâ or âholdbackâ escrows
or reserves (other than certain routine and/or customary fundings or disbursements).
Â 

Â·The liability of the parties to the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Pooling and Servicing Agreement will be limited
in a manner similar, but not necessarily identical, to the liability of the parties to the PSA.
Â 

Â·Collections on each of GC35 Serviced Mortgage Loans will be maintained under the CGCMT 2015-GC35
Pooling and Servicing Agreement in a manner similar, but not necessarily identical, to collections on the Mortgage Loans serviced
under the PSA, 
Â 


447
Â 
Â 


provided that rating requirements for accounts and permitted investments may vary under those two pooling and servicing
agreements.
Â 

Â·The CGCMT 2015-GC35 Pooling and Servicing Agreement does not provide for an asset representations
reviewer and does not provide for any asset representations review similar to that described under ââThe Asset Representations
Reviewerâ.
Â 

Â·The CGCMT 2015-GC35 Pooling and Servicing Agreement does not provide for dispute resolution mechanisms
similar to those described under ââDispute Resolution Provisionsâ.
Â 

Â·The CGCMT 2015-GC35 Pooling and Servicing Agreement does not require deliver of a Diligence File
as described under ââAssignment of the Mortgage Loansâ.
Â 

Â·The CGCMT 2015-GC35 Pooling and Servicing Agreement differs from the PSA in certain respects relating
to one or more of the following: timing, control or consultation triggers or thresholds, terminology, allocation of ministerial
duties between multiple servicers or other service providers, certificateholder or investor voting or consent thresholds, master
servicer and special servicer termination events and the circumstances under which approvals, consents, consultation, notices or
rating agency confirmations may be required.
Â 

Â·The applicable Non-Serviced Directing Certificateholder under the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Pooling and Servicing
Agreement will, under certain circumstances, be entitled to continue to exercise consent and consultation rights despite the existence
of appraisal reduction amounts that result in a related control termination event.
Â 
The CGCMT 2015-GC35 Special Servicer may
be removed as described under âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâThe Whole LoansâThe Non-Serviced
Pari Passu Whole LoansâThe Harbor Pointe Apartments Whole LoanâSpecial Servicer Appointment Rightsâ,
ââThe Anchorage Marriott Downtown Whole LoanâSpecial Servicer Appointment Rightsâ and ââThe
JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Whole LoanâSpecial Servicer Appointment Rightsâ in this prospectus.
Â 
The CGCMT 2015-GC35 depositor, the CGCMT
2015-GC35 Master Servicer, the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Special Servicer, the CGCMT 2015-GC35 Certificate Administrator, the CGCMT 2015-GC35
Trustee and various related persons and entities will be entitled to be indemnified by the issuing entity for certain losses and
liabilities incurred by such party in accordance with the terms and conditions of the related Intercreditor Agreement and the PSA.
Â

PoolâThe Whole LoansâThe Non-Serviced Pari Passu Whole LoansâThe Harbor Pointe Apartments

Â 

Servicing of the Harvey Building Products
Portfolio Mortgage Loan
Â 
The Harvey Building Products Portfolio Mortgage
Loan and any related REO Property will be serviced under the COMM 2015-LC23 Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
Â 


448
Â 
Â 
The servicing arrangements under the COMM
2015-LC23 Pooling and Servicing Agreement are generally similar to, but differ in certain respects from, the servicing arrangements
under the PSA. In that regard, in the case of the COMM 2015-LC23 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the following are considerations
relating to servicing, including the identification of some (but not all) of the differences in expected servicing provisions between
the COMM 2015-LC23 Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the PSA:
Â 

Â·The COMM 2015-LC23 Master Servicer will earn a primary
servicing fee with respect to the Harvey Building Products Portfolio Mortgage Loan that is to be calculated at 0.0025% per
annum.

Â 

Â·The COMM 2015-LC23 Special Servicer will earn a special
servicing fee accruing at a rate equal to the greater of 0.25% per annum or such rate as would result in a special servicing
fee of $1,000 for the related month.

Â 

Â·The COMM 2015-LC23 Special Servicer will be entitled to
a workout fee accruing at a rate equal to the lesser of 1.0% and such rate as would result in a workout fee of $1,000,000.

Â 

Â·The COMM 2015-LC23 Special Servicer will be entitled to
a liquidation fee accruing at a rate equal to the lesser of 1.0% and such rate as would result in a liquidation fee of $1,000,000.

Â 

Â·The master servicer or the trustee, as applicable, will
be required to make P&I Advances with respect to the Harvey Building Products Portfolio Mortgage Loan, unless the master servicer
or the trustee, as applicable, or the special servicer, has determined that such Advance would not be recoverable from collections
on such Mortgage Loan.

Â 

Â·No items with respect to the Harvey Building Products
Portfolio Whole Loan that are the equivalent of ancillary fees, assumption fees, modification fees and/or penalty charges will
be allocated to the master servicer or the special servicer as additional servicing compensation or otherwise applied in accordance
with the PSA (except that penalty charges may be used to offset interest on P&I Advances made by the master servicer) rather
such items will be allocated as additional servicing compensation to the COMM 2015-LC23 Master Servicer and the COMM 2015-LC23
Special Servicer, which allocation may be in proportions that are different from the proportions of similar fees allocated between
the master servicer and the special servicer in the case of Mortgage Loans serviced under the PSA.

Â 

Â·The COMM 2015-LC23 Special Servicer will be required to
take actions with respect to the Harvey Building Products Portfolio Mortgage Loan if such Mortgage Loan becomes the equivalent
of a Defaulted Loan, which actions are similar to the actions described under ââSale of Defaulted Loans and REO
Propertiesâ in this prospectus.

Â 

Â·The servicing provisions relating to performing inspections
and collecting operating information are similar to those of the PSA.

Â 

Â·The requirement of the COMM 2015-LC23 Master Servicer
to make compensating interest payments in respect of the Harvey Building Products Portfolio Mortgage Loan is similar, but not
necessarily identical, to the requirement of the master servicer to make Compensating Interest Payments in respect of the Serviced
Pari Passu Mortgage Loans under the PSA.

Â 


449
Â 
Â 

Â·The COMM 2015-LC23 Master Servicer and COMM 2015-LC23
Special Servicer (a) have rights related to resignation similar, but not necessarily identical, to those of the master servicer
and the special servicer and (b) are subject to servicer termination events similar to those in the PSA, as well as the rights
related thereto.

Â 

Â·The specific types of actions constituting major decisions
under the COMM 2015-LC23 Pooling and Servicing Agreement differ in certain respects from those actions that constitute Major Decisions
under the PSA, and therefore the specific types of servicer actions with respect to which the applicable Non-Serviced Directing
Certificateholder will be permitted to consent will correspondingly differ.

Â 

Â·The liability of the parties to the COMM 2015-LC23 Pooling
and Servicing Agreement will be limited in a manner similar, but not necessarily identical, to the liability of the parties to
the PSA.

Â 

Â·Collections on the Harvey Building Products Portfolio
Whole Loan will be maintained under the COMM 2015-LC23 Pooling and Servicing Agreement in a manner similar, but not necessarily
identical, to collections on the Serviced Pari Passu Mortgage Loans and the Serviced Whole Loans under the PSA, except that rating
requirements for accounts and permitted investments may vary under those two pooling and servicing agreements.

Â 

Â·The COMM 2015-LC23 Pooling and Servicing Agreement does
not provide for an asset representations reviewer and does not provide for any asset representations review similar to that described
under ââThe Asset Representations Reviewerâ.

Â 

Â·The COMM 2015-LC23 Pooling and Servicing Agreement does
not provide for resolution mechanisms similar to those described under ââDispute Resolution Provisionsâ.

Â 

Â·The COMM 2015-LC23 Pooling and Servicing Agreement differs
from the PSA in certain respects relating to one or more of the following: timing, control or consultation triggers or thresholds,
terminology, allocation of ministerial duties between multiple servicers or other service providers, certificateholder or investor
voting or consent thresholds, master servicer and special servicer termination events and the circumstances under which approvals,
consents, consultation, notices or rating agency confirmations may be required.

Â 
The COMM 2015-LC23 Special Servicer may
be removed as described under âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâThe Whole LoansâThe Non-Serviced Pari Passu Whole
LoansâThe Harvey Building Products Portfolio Whole LoanâSpecial Servicer Appointment Rightsâ in this prospectus.
Â 
The COMM 2015-LC23 depositor, the COMM 2015-LC23
Master Servicer, the COMM 2015-LC23 Special Servicer, the COMM 2015-LC23 Certificate Administrator, the COMM 2015-LC23 Trustee
and various related persons and entities will be entitled to be indemnified by the issuing entity for certain losses and liabilities
incurred by such party in accordance with the terms and conditions of the related Intercreditor Agreement.

Rating
Agency Confirmations
Â 
The PSA will provide that, notwithstanding
the terms of the related Mortgage Loan documents or other provisions of the PSA, if any action under such Mortgage Loan documents
or the PSA requires a Rating Agency Confirmation from each of the Rating Agencies as a condition precedent to such action, if the
party (the âRequesting Partyâ) required to obtain such Rating Agency Confirmations has made a request to any
Rating Agency for such Rating Agency Confirmation and, within 10 business days of such request being posted to the 17g-5 Information
Providerâs website, such Rating Agency has not replied to such request or has responded in a manner that indicates that such
Rating Agency is neither reviewing such request nor waiving the requirement for Rating Agency Confirmation, then such Requesting
Party will be required to confirm (through direct communication and not by posting any confirmation on the 17g-5 Information Providerâs
website) that the applicable Rating Agency has received the Rating Agency Confirmation request, and, if it has, promptly request
the related Rating Agency Confirmation again. The circumstances described in the preceding sentence are referred to in this prospectus
as a âRAC No-Response Scenarioâ.
Â 
If there is no response to either such Rating
Agency Confirmation request within 5 business days of such second request in a RAC No-Response Scenario or if such Rating Agency
has responded in a manner that indicates such Rating Agency is neither reviewing such request nor waiving the requirement for Rating
Agency Confirmation, then (x)Â with respect to any condition in any Mortgage Loan document requiring such Rating Agency Confirmation,
or with respect to any other matter under the PSA relating to the servicing of the Mortgage Loans (other than as set forth in clauseÂ (y)
below), the requirement to obtain a Rating Agency Confirmation will be deemed not to apply (as if such requirement did not exist)
with respect to such Rating Agency, and the master servicer or the special servicer, as the case may be, may then take such action
if the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, confirms its original determination (made prior to making such request)
that taking the action with respect to which it requested the Rating Agency Confirmation would still be consistent with the Servicing
Standard, and (y)Â with respect to a replacement of the master servicer or special servicer, such condition will be deemed
not to apply (as if such requirement did not exist) if (i)Â it has been appointed and currently serves as a master servicer
or special servicer on a transaction-level basis on a transaction currently rated by Moodyâs that currently has securities
outstanding and for which Moodyâs has not cited servicing concerns of the applicable replacement as the sole or material
factor in any qualification, downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings (or placement on âwatch statusâ in contemplation
of a ratings downgrade or withdrawal) of securities in a CMBS transaction serviced by the applicable replacement master servicer
or special servicer prior to the time of determination, if Moodyâs is the non-responding Rating Agency, (ii)Â the applicable
replacement master servicer or special servicer is rated at least âCMS3â (in the case of the master servicer) or âCSS3â
(in the case of the special servicer), if Fitch is the non-responding Rating Agency or (iii)Â KBRA has not cited servicing
concerns of the applicable replacement master servicer or special servicer as the sole or material factor in any qualification,
downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings (or placement on âwatch statusâ in contemplation of a ratings downgrade or withdrawal)
of securities in any other commercial mortgage-backed securitization transaction serviced by the applicable replacement master
servicer or special servicer prior to the time of determination, if KBRA is the non-responding Rating Agency. Promptly following
the master servicerâs or special servicerâs determination to take any action discussed above following any requirement
to obtain Rating Agency Confirmation being deemed not to apply (as if such requirement did not exist) as described in clauseÂ (x)
above, the master servicer or special servicer will be required to provide
Â 


451
Â 
Â 
electronic written notice to the 17g-5 Information Provider,
who will promptly post such notice to the 17g-5 Information Providerâs website pursuant to the PSA, of the action taken.
Â 
For all other matters or actions not specifically
discussed above, the applicable Requesting Party will be required to obtain a Rating Agency Confirmation from each of the Rating
Agencies. In the event an action otherwise requires a Rating Agency Confirmation from each of the Rating Agencies, in absence of
such Rating Agency Confirmation, we cannot assure you that any Rating Agency will not downgrade, qualify or withdraw its ratings
as a result of any such action taken by the master servicer or the special servicer in accordance with the procedures discussed
above.
Â 
As used above, âRating Agency Confirmationâ
means, with respect to any matter, confirmation in writing (which may be in electronic form) by each applicable Rating Agency that
a proposed action, failure to act or other event specified in this prospectus will not, in and of itself, result in the downgrade,
withdrawal or qualification of the then-current rating assigned to any class of certificates (if then rated by the Rating Agency);
provided that a written waiver or acknowledgment from the Rating Agency indicating its decision not to review the matter
for which the Rating Agency Confirmation is sought will be deemed to satisfy the requirement for the Rating Agency Confirmation
from the Rating Agency with respect to such matter. The âRating Agenciesâ mean Moodyâs Investors Service,
Inc. (âMoodyâsâ), Fitch Ratings, Inc. (âFitchâ) and Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Inc.
(âKBRAâ).
Â 
Any Rating Agency Confirmation requests
made by the master servicer, special servicer, certificate administrator, or trustee, as applicable, pursuant to the PSA, will
be required to be made in writing, which writing must contain a cover page indicating the nature of the Rating Agency Confirmation
request, and must contain all back-up material necessary for the Rating Agency to process such request. Such written Rating Agency
Confirmation requests must be provided in electronic format to the 17g-5 Information Provider (who will be required to post such
request on the 17g-5 Information Providerâs website in accordance with the PSA).
Â 
The master servicer, the special servicer,
the certificate administrator and the trustee will be permitted (but not obligated) to orally communicate with the Rating Agencies
regarding any of the Mortgage Loan documents or any matter related to the Mortgage Loans, the related Mortgaged Properties, the
related borrowers or any other matters relating to the PSA or any related Intercreditor Agreement; provided that such party
summarizes the information provided to the Rating Agencies in such communication in writing and provides the 17g-5 Information
Provider with such written summary the same day such communication takes place; provided, further, that the summary
of such oral communications will not identify with which Rating Agency the communication was. The 17g-5 Information Provider will
be required to post such written summary on the 17g-5 Information Providerâs website in accordance with the provisions of
the PSA. All other information required to be delivered to the Rating Agencies pursuant to the PSA or requested by the Rating Agencies,
will first be provided in electronic format to the 17g-5 Information Provider, who will be required to post such information to
the 17g-5 Information Providerâs website in accordance with the PSA.
Â 
The PSA will provide that the PSA may be
amended to change the procedures regarding compliance with Rule 17g-5 without any Certificateholder consent; provided that
notice of any such amendment must be provided to the 17g-5 Information Provider (who will post such notice to the 17g-5 Information
Providerâs website) and to the certificate administrator (which will post such report to the certificate administratorâs
website).
Â 


452
Â 
Â 
To the extent required under the PSA, in
the event a rating agency confirmation is required by the applicable rating agencies that any action under any Mortgage Loan documents
or the PSA will not result in the downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of any such rating agencyâs then-current ratings
of any securities related to a Companion Loan, then such rating agency confirmation may be considered satisfied in the same manner
as described above with respect to any Rating Agency Confirmation from a Rating Agency.
Â 
Evidence
as to Compliance
Â 
Each of the master servicer, the special
servicer (regardless of whether the special servicer has commenced special servicing of a Mortgage Loan), the custodian, the trustee
(provided, however, that the trustee will not be required to deliver an assessment of compliance with respect to
any period during which there was no relevant servicing criteria applicable to it) and the certificate administrator will be required
to furnish (and each such party will be required, with respect to each servicing function participant with which it has entered
into a servicing relationship with respect to the Mortgage Loans, to cause (or, in the case of a sub-servicer that is also a servicing
function participant that a mortgage loan seller requires the master servicer to retain, to use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause) such servicing function participant to furnish), to the depositor, the certificate administrator, the trustee and the
17g-5 Information Provider, an officerâs certificate of the officer responsible for the servicing activities of such party
stating, among other things, that (i)Â a review of that partyâs activities during the preceding calendar year or portion
of that year and of performance under the PSA or any sub-servicing agreement in the case of an additional master servicer or special
servicer, as applicable, has been made under such officerâs supervision and (ii)Â to the best of such officerâs
knowledge, based on the review, such party has fulfilled all of its obligations under the PSA or the sub-servicing agreement in
the case of an additional master servicer or special servicer, as applicable, in all material respects throughout the preceding
calendar year or portion of such year, or, if there has been a failure to fulfill any such obligation in any material respect,
specifying each such failure known to such officer and the nature and status of the failure.
Â 
In addition, each of the master servicer,
the special servicer (regardless of whether the special servicer has commenced special servicing of any Mortgage Loan), the trustee
(but only if an advance was made by the trustee in the calendar year), the custodian, the certificate administrator and the operating
advisor, each at its own expense, will be required to furnish (and each such party will be required, with respect to each servicing
function participant with which it has entered into a servicing relationship with respect to the Mortgage Loans, to cause (or,
in the case of a sub-servicer that is also a servicing function participant that a mortgage loan seller requires the master servicer
to retain, to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause) such servicing function participant to furnish) to the trustee, the
certificate administrator, the 17g-5 Information Provider and the depositor (and, with respect to the special servicer, also to
the operating advisor) a report (an âAssessment of Complianceâ) assessing compliance by that party with the
servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB (as described below) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the âSecurities Actâ) that contains the following:
Â 

Â·a statement of the partyâs responsibility for
assessing compliance with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 of Regulation AB applicable to it;

Â 

Â·a statement that the party used the criteria in Item
1122(d) of Regulation AB to assess compliance with the applicable servicing criteria;

Â 

Â·the partyâs assessment of compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria during and as of the end of the fiscal year, covered by the Form 10-K required to be filed 

Â 


453
Â 
Â 


 pursuant
to the PSA setting forth any material instance of noncompliance identified by the party, a discussion of each such failure and
the nature and status of such failure; and


Â 

Â·a statement that a registered public accounting firm
has issued an attestation report (an âAttestation Reportâ) on the partyâs assessment of compliance with
the applicable servicing criteria during and as of the end of the prior fiscal year.

Â 
Each party that is required to deliver an
Assessment of Compliance will also be required to simultaneously deliver an Attestation Report of a registered public accounting
firm, prepared in accordance with the standards for attestation engagements issued or adopted by the public company accounting
oversight board, that expresses an opinion, or states that an opinion cannot be expressed (and the reasons for this), concerning
the partyâs assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB.
Â 
With respect to each Non-Serviced Whole
Loan, each of the Non-Serviced Master Servicer, the Non-Serviced Special Servicer, the Non-Serviced Trustee and the Non-Serviced
Certificate Administrator will have obligations under the related Non-Serviced PSA similar to those described above.
Â 
âRegulation ABâ means
subpart 229.1100 â Asset Backed Securities (Regulation AB), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§229.1100â229.1125, as such may be
amended from time to time, and subject to such clarification and interpretation as have been provided by the SEC or by the staff
of the SEC, or as may be provided by the SEC or its staff from time to time.
Â 
Limitation
on Rights of Certificateholders to Institute a Proceeding
Â 
Other than with respect to any rights to
deliver a Certificateholder Repurchase Request and exercise the rights described under ââDispute Resolution Provisionsâ,
no Certificateholder will have any right under the PSA to institute any proceeding with respect to the PSA or with respect to the
certificates, unless the holder previously has given to the trustee and the certificate administrator written notice of default
and the continuance of the default and unless (except in the case of a default by the trustee) the holders of certificates of any
class evidencing not less than 25% of the aggregate Percentage Interests constituting the class have made written request upon
the trustee to institute a proceeding in its own name (as trustee) and have offered to the trustee reasonable indemnity satisfactory
to it, and the trustee for 60 days after receipt of the request and indemnity has neglected or refused to institute the proceeding.
However, the trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the trusts or powers vested in it by the PSA or the certificates
or to institute, conduct or defend any related litigation at the request, order or direction of any of the Certificateholders,
unless the Certificateholders have offered to the trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities
that may be incurred as a result.
Â 
Each Certificateholder will be deemed under
the PSA to have expressly covenanted with every other Certificateholder and the trustee, that no one or more Certificateholders
will have any right in any manner whatsoever by virtue of any provision of the PSA or the certificates to affect, disturb or prejudice
the rights of the holders of any other certificates, or to obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference to any other Certificateholder,
or to enforce any right under the PSA or the certificates, except in the manner provided in the PSA or the certificates and for
the equal, ratable and common benefit of all Certificateholders.
Â 


454
Â 
Â 
Termination;
Retirement of Certificates
Â 
The obligations created by the PSA will
terminate upon payment (or provision for payment) to all Certificateholders of all amounts held by the certificate administrator
on behalf of the trustee and required to be paid on the Distribution Date following the earlier of (1)Â the final payment (or
related Advance) or other liquidation of the last Mortgage Loan and REO Property (as applicable) subject to the PSA, (2)Â the
voluntary exchange of all the then-outstanding certificates (other than the ClassÂ V and ClassÂ R certificates) for the
Mortgage Loans and REO Properties remaining in the issuing entity (provided, however, that (a)Â the aggregate
certificate balance of the ClassÂ A-1, ClassÂ A-2A, ClassÂ A-2B, ClassÂ A-3, ClassÂ A-4, ClassÂ A-SB, ClassÂ A-S,
ClassÂ B, ClassÂ C and ClassÂ D certificates is reduced to zero, (b)Â there is only one holder (or multiple holders
acting unanimously) of the then-outstanding certificates (other than the ClassÂ V and ClassÂ R certificates) and (c)Â the
master servicer consents to the exchange) or (3)Â the purchase or other liquidation of all of the assets of the issuing entity
as described below by the holders of the Controlling Class, the special servicer, the master servicer or the holders of the ClassÂ R
certificates, in that order of priority. Written notice of termination of the PSA will be given by the certificate administrator
to each Certificateholder, each holder of a Serviced Companion Loan and the 17g-5 Information Provider (who will promptly post
such notice to the 17g-5 Information Providerâs website). The final distribution will be made only upon surrender and cancellation
of the certificates at the office of the certificate registrar or other location specified in the notice of termination.
Â 
The holders of the Controlling Class, the
special servicer, the master servicer and the holders of the ClassÂ R certificates (in that order) will have the right to purchase
all of the assets of the issuing entity. This purchase of all the Mortgage Loans and other assets in the issuing entity is required
to be made at a price equal to (a) the sum of (1)Â the aggregate Purchase Price of all the Mortgage Loans (exclusive of REO
Loans) then included in the issuing entity, (2)Â the appraised value of the issuing entityâs portion of all REO Properties
then included in the issuing entity (which fair market value for any REO Property may be less than the Purchase Price for the corresponding
REO Loan), as determined by an appraiser selected by the special servicer and approved by the master servicer and the Controlling
Class, (3)Â the reasonable out of pocket expenses of the master servicer related to such purchase, unless the master servicer
is the purchaser and (4)Â if the Mortgaged Property secures a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan and is an REO Property under the terms
of the related Non-Serviced PSA, the pro rata portion of the fair market value of the related property, as determined by
the related Non-Serviced Master Servicer in accordance with clausesÂ (2) and (3) above, less (b) solely in the case where the
master servicer is exercising such purchase right, the aggregate amount of unreimbursed Advances and unpaid Servicing Fees remaining
outstanding and payable solely to the master servicer (which items will be deemed to have been paid or reimbursed to the master
servicer in connection with such purchase). This purchase will effect early retirement of the then-outstanding certificates, but
the rights of the holders of the Controlling Class, the special servicer, the master servicer or the holders of the ClassÂ R
certificates to effect the termination is subject to the requirements that the then aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the pool
of Mortgage Loans be less than 1.0% of the Initial Pool Balance. The voluntary exchange of certificates (other than the ClassÂ V
and ClassÂ R certificates), for the remaining Mortgage Loans is not subject to the above described percentage limits but is
limited to each such class of outstanding certificates being held by one Certificateholder (or group of Certificateholders acting
unanimously) who must voluntarily participate.
Â 
On the applicable Distribution Date, the
aggregate amount paid by the holders of the Controlling Class, the special servicer, the master servicer or the holders of the
ClassÂ R
Â 


455
Â 
Â 
certificates,
as the case may be, for the Mortgage Loans and other applicable assets in the issuing entity, together with all other amounts
on deposit in the Collection Account and not otherwise payable to a person other than the Certificateholders, will be applied
generally as described above under âDescription of the CertificatesâDistributionsâPriority of Distributionsâ.
Â 
Amendment
Â 
The PSA may be amended by the parties to
the PSA, without the consent of any of the holders of certificates or holders of any Companion Loan:
Â 
(a)Â 
to correct any defect or ambiguity in the PSA;
Â 
(b)Â 
to cause the provisions in the PSA to conform or be consistent with or in furtherance of the statements made in the prospectus
(or in an offering document for any related non-offered certificates) with respect to the certificates, the issuing entity or the
PSA or to correct or supplement any of its provisions which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provisions in the PSA
or to correct any error;
Â 
(c)Â 
to change the timing and/or nature of deposits in the Collection Account, the Distribution Accounts or any REO Account,
provided that (A) the Master Servicer Remittance Date will in no event be later than the business day prior to the related
Distribution Date and (B) the change would not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any Certificateholder,
as evidenced in writing by an opinion of counsel at the expense of the party requesting such amendment or as evidenced by a Rating
Agency Confirmation from each of the Rating Agencies with respect to such amendment;
Â 
(d)Â 
to modify, eliminate or add to any of its provisions to the extent as will be necessary to maintain the qualification of

any certificate is outstanding, or to avoid or minimize the risk of imposition of any tax on the issuing entity, any Trust REMIC
or the Grantor Trust; provided that the trustee and the certificate administrator have received an opinion of counsel (at
the expense of the party requesting the amendment) to the effect that (1)Â the action is necessary or desirable to maintain
such qualification or to avoid or minimize the risk of imposition of any such tax and (2)Â the action will not adversely affect
in any material respect the interests of any holder of the certificates or holder of a Companion Loan;
Â 
(e)Â 
to modify, eliminate or add to any of its provisions to restrict (or to remove any existing restrictions with respect to)
the transfer of the Residual Certificates; provided that the depositor has determined that the amendment will not, as evidenced
by an opinion of counsel, give rise to any tax with respect to the transfer of the Residual Certificates to a non-permitted transferee;
Â 
(f)Â Â Â 
to revise or add any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the PSA or any other change, provided
that the required action will not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any Certificateholder or any holder
of a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan not consenting to such revision or addition, as evidenced in writing by an opinion of counsel
at the expense of the party requesting such amendment or as evidenced by a Rating Agency Confirmation from each of the Rating Agencies
with respect to such amendment or supplement and confirmation of the applicable rating agencies that such action will not result
in the downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of its then-current ratings of any securities related to a Companion Loan, if any
(provided that such rating agency confirmation may be considered satisfied in the
Â 


456
Â 

Â 
same
manner as any Rating Agency Confirmation may be considered satisfied with respect to the certificates as described in this prospectus);
Â 
(g)Â 
to amend or supplement any provision of the PSA to the extent necessary to maintain the then-current ratings assigned to
each class of Offered Certificates by each Rating Agency, as evidenced by a Rating Agency Confirmation from each of the Rating
Agencies and confirmation of the applicable rating agencies that such action will not result in the downgrade, withdrawal or qualification
of its then-current ratings of any securities related to a Companion Loan, if any (provided that such rating agency confirmation
may be considered satisfied in the same manner as any Rating Agency Confirmation may be considered satisfied with respect to the
certificates as described in this prospectus); provided that such amendment or supplement would not adversely affect in
any material respect the interests of any Certificateholder not consenting to such amendment or supplement, as evidenced by an
opinion of counsel;
Â 
(h)Â 
to modify the provisions of the PSA with respect to reimbursement of Nonrecoverable Advances and Workout-Delayed Reimbursement
Amounts if (a) the depositor, the master servicer, the trustee and, with respect to any Mortgage Loan other than an Excluded Loan
and for so long as no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the Directing Certificateholder, determine that
the commercial mortgage-backed securities industry standard for such provisions has changed, in order to conform to such industry
standard, (b) such modification does not adversely affect the status of any Trust REMIC as a REMIC or the status of the Grantor
Trust as a grantor trust under the relevant provisions of the Code, as evidenced by an opinion of counsel and (c) a Rating Agency
Confirmation from each Rating Agency and confirmation of the applicable rating agencies that such action will not result in the
downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of its then-current ratings of any securities related to a Serviced Pari Passu Companion
Loan, if any (provided that such rating agency confirmation may be considered satisfied in the same manner as any Rating
Agency Confirmation may be considered satisfied with respect to the certificates as described in this prospectus);
Â 
(i)Â Â Â Â 
to modify the procedures set forth in the PSA relating to compliance with Rule 17g-5, provided that the change would
not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any Certificateholder, as evidenced by (A) an opinion of counsel
or (B) if any certificate is then rated, receipt of Rating Agency Confirmation from each Rating Agency rating such certificates;
and provided, further, that the certificate administrator must give notice of any such amendment to the 17g-5 Information
Provider for posting on the 17g-5 Information Providerâs website and the certificate administration must post such notice
to its website; or
Â 
(j)Â Â Â 
to modify, eliminate or add to any of its provisions to such extent as will be necessary to comply with the requirements
for use of Form SF-3 in registered offerings to the extent provided in CFR 239.45(b)(1)(ii), (iii) or (iv).
Â 
The PSA may also be amended by the parties
to the PSA with the consent of the holders of certificates of each class affected by such amendment evidencing, in each case, a
majority of the aggregate Percentage Interests constituting the class for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in
any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the PSA or of modifying in any manner the rights of the holders of the certificates,
except that the amendment may not directly (1)Â reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay the timing of, payments received
on the Mortgage Loans that are required to be distributed on a certificate of any class without the consent of the holder of such
certificate or which are required to be distributed to a holder of a Companion Loan without the consent of such holder, (2)Â reduce
the aforesaid percentage of certificates of any class the holders of which
Â 


457
Â 

Â 
are
required to consent to the amendment or remove the requirement to obtain consent of any holder of a Companion Loan, without the
consent of the holders of all certificates of that class then-outstanding or such holder of the related Companion Loan, (3)Â adversely
affect the Voting Rights of any class of certificates, without the consent of the holders of all certificates of that class then-outstanding,
(4)Â change in any manner any defined term used in any MLPA or the obligations or rights of any mortgage loan seller under
any MLPA or change any rights of any mortgage loan seller as third party beneficiary under the PSA without the consent of the
related mortgage loan seller, or (5)Â amend the Servicing Standard without the consent of 100% of the holders of certificates
or a Rating Agency Confirmation by each Rating Agency and confirmation of the applicable rating agencies that such action will
not result in the downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of its then-current ratings of any securities related to a Companion
Loan, if any (provided that such rating agency confirmation may be considered satisfied in the same manner as any Rating
Agency Confirmation may be considered satisfied with respect to the certificates as described in this prospectus).
Â 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment
to the PSA may be made that changes in any manner the obligations of any mortgage loan seller under any MLPA or the rights of any
mortgage loan seller, including as a third party beneficiary, under the PSA, without the consent of such mortgage loan seller.
In addition, no amendment to the PSA may be made that changes any provisions specifically required to be included in the PSA by
the related Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the holder of the related Companion Loan.
Â 
Also, notwithstanding the foregoing, no
party will be required to consent to any amendment to the PSA without the trustee, the certificate administrator, the master servicer,
the special servicer, the asset representations reviewer and the operating advisor having first received an opinion of counsel
(at the issuing entityâs expense) to the effect that the amendment does not conflict with the terms of the PSA, and that
the amendment or the exercise of any power granted to the master servicer, the special servicer, the depositor, the certificate
administrator, the trustee, the operating advisor, the asset representations reviewer or any other specified person in accordance
with the amendment will not result in the imposition of a tax on any portion of the issuing entity or cause any Trust REMIC to
fail to qualify as a REMIC or cause the Grantor Trust to fail to qualify as a grantor trust under the relevant provisions of the
Code.
Â 
Resignation
and Removal of the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator
Â 
Each of the trustee and the certificate
administrator will at all times be, and will be required to resign if it fails to be, (i)Â a corporation, national bank, national
banking association or a trust company, organized and doing business under the laws of any state or the United States of America,
authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers and to accept the trust conferred under the PSA, having a combined
capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority and, in the
case of the trustee, will not be an affiliate of the master servicer or the special servicer (except during any period when the
trustee is acting as, or has become successor to, the master servicer or the special servicer, as the case may be), (ii)Â an
institution insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, (iii)Â an institution whose long-term senior unsecured debt
is rated at least âA2â by Moodyâs, âAâ by Fitch and âAâ by KBRA (if rated by KBRA); provided
that the trustee will not become ineligible to serve based on a failure to satisfy such rating requirements as long as (a)Â it
maintains a long-term unsecured debt rating of
no less than âBaa2â by Moodyâs and âA-â by Fitch, (b)Â its short-term debt obligations have
a short-term rating of not less than âP-2â from Moodyâs and âF1â by Fitch and (c)Â the master
servicer maintains a long-term unsecured debt rating 
Â 


458
Â 
Â 
of at least âA2â by Moodyâs and âA+â by Fitch
(provided that nothing in this proviso will impose on the master servicer any obligation to maintain such rating); provided,
further, that if any such institution is not rated by KBRA, it maintains an equivalent (or higher) rating by any two other
NRSROs (which may include Moodyâs and/or Fitch), or such other rating with respect to which the Rating Agencies have provided
a Rating Agency Confirmation, and (iv)Â an entity that is not on the depositorâs âprohibited partyâ list.
Â 
The trustee and the certificate administrator
will be also permitted at any time to resign from their obligations and duties under the PSA by giving written notice (which notice
will be posted to the certificate administratorâs website pursuant to the PSA) to the depositor, the master servicer, the
special servicer, the trustee or the certificate administrator, as applicable, all Certificateholders, the operating advisor, the
asset representations reviewer and the 17g-5 Information Provider (who will promptly post such notice to the 17g-5 Information
Providerâs website). Upon receiving this notice of resignation, the depositor will be required to use its reasonable best
efforts to promptly appoint a successor trustee or certificate administrator acceptable to the master servicer and, prior to the
occurrence and continuance of a Control Termination Event, the Directing Certificateholder. If no successor trustee or certificate
administrator has accepted an appointment within 90 days after the giving of notice of resignation, the resigning trustee or certificate
administrator, as applicable, may petition any court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor trustee or certificate administrator,
as applicable, and such petition will be an expense of the issuing entity.
Â 
If at any time the trustee or certificate
administrator ceases to be eligible to continue as trustee or certificate administrator, as applicable, under the PSA, and fails
to resign after written request therefor by the depositor or the master servicer, or if at any time the trustee or certificate
administrator becomes incapable of acting, or if certain events of, or proceedings in respect of, bankruptcy or insolvency occur
with respect to the trustee or certificate administrator, or if the trustee or certificate administrator fails to timely publish
any report to be delivered, published, or otherwise made available by the certificate administrator pursuant to the PSA, and such
failure continues unremedied for a period of 5 days, or if the certificate administrator fails to make distributions required pursuant
to the PSA, the depositor will be authorized to remove the trustee or certificate administrator, as applicable, and appoint a successor
trustee or certificate administrator acceptable to the master servicer. If no successor trustee or certificate administrator has
accepted an appointment within 90 days after the giving of notice of removal, the removed trustee or certificate administrator,
as applicable, may petition any court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor trustee or certificate administrator, as
applicable, and such petition will be an expense of the issuing entity.
Â 
In addition, holders of the certificates
entitled to at least 75% of the Voting Rights may upon 30 days prior written notice, with or without cause, remove the trustee
or certificate administrator under the PSA and appoint a successor trustee or certificate administrator. In the event that holders
of the certificates entitled to at least 75% of the Voting Rights elect to remove the trustee or certificate administrator without
cause and appoint a successor, the successor trustee or certificate administrator, as applicable, will be responsible for all expenses
necessary to effect the transfer of responsibilities from its predecessor.
Â 
Any resignation or removal of the trustee
or certificate administrator and appointment of a successor trustee or certificate administrator will not become effective until
(i)Â acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee or certificate administrator, as applicable, and (ii)Â the certificate
administrator files any required Form 8-K. Further, the resigning trustee or certificate administrator, as the case may be, must
pay all costs and expenses associated with the transfer of its duties.
Â 


459
Â 
Â 
The PSA will prohibit the appointment of
the asset representations reviewer or one of its affiliates as successor to the trustee or certificate administrator.
Â 
Governing
Law; Waiver of Jury Trial; and Consent to Jurisdiction
Â 
The PSA will be governed by the laws of
the State of New York. Each party to the PSA will waive its respective right to a jury trial for any claim or cause of action based
upon or arising out of or related to the PSA or certificates. Additionally, each party to the PSA will consent to the jurisdiction
of any New York State and Federal courts sitting in New York City with respect to matters arising out of or related to the PSA.
Â 
Certain Legal Aspects of Mortgage Loans
Â 
The following discussion contains general
summaries of certain legal aspects of mortgage loans secured by commercial and multifamily residential properties. Because such
legal aspects are governed by applicable local law (which laws may differ substantially), the summaries do not purport to be complete,
to reflect the laws of any particular jurisdiction, or to encompass the laws of all jurisdictions in which the security for the
mortgage loans is situated.
Â 
California. Mortgage loans in California
are generally secured by deeds of trust on the related real estate. Foreclosure of a deed of trust in California may be accomplished
by a non-judicial trusteeâs sale (so long as it is permitted under a specific provision in the deed of trust) or by judicial
foreclosure, in each case subject to and in accordance with the applicable procedures and requirements of California law. Public
notice of either the trusteeâs sale or the judgment of foreclosure is given for a statutory period of time after which the
mortgaged real estate may be sold by the trustee, if foreclosed pursuant to the trusteeâs power of sale, or by court appointed
sheriff under a judicial foreclosure. Following a judicial foreclosure sale, the borrower or its successor-in-interest may, for
a period of up to one year, redeem the property; however, there is no redemption following a trusteeâs power of sale. Californiaâs
âsecurity firstâ and âone actionâ rules require the lender to complete foreclosure of all real estate provided
as security under the deed of trust in a single action in an attempt to satisfy the full debt before bringing a personal action
(if otherwise permitted) against the borrower for recovery of the debt, except in certain cases involving environmentally impaired
real property where foreclosure of the real property is not required before making a claim under the indemnity. This restriction
may apply to property which is not located in California if a single promissory note is secured by property located in California
and other jurisdictions. California case law has held that acts such as (but not limited to) an offset of an unpledged account
constitute violations of such statutes. Violations of such statutes may result in the loss of some or all of the security under
the mortgage loan and a loss of the ability to sue for the debt. A sale by the trustee under the deed of trust does not constitute
an âactionâ for purposes of the âone action ruleâ. Other statutory provisions in California limit any deficiency
judgment (if otherwise permitted) against the borrower following a judicial foreclosure to the amount by which the indebtedness
exceeds the fair value at the time of the public sale and in no event greater than the difference between the foreclosure sale
price and the amount of the indebtedness. Further, under California law, once a property has been sold pursuant to a power of sale
clause contained in a deed of trust (and in the case of certain types of purchase money acquisition financings, under all circumstances),
the lender is precluded from seeking a deficiency judgment from the borrower or, under certain circumstances, guarantors.
Â 


460
Â 
Â 
General
Â 
Each mortgage loan will be evidenced by
a promissory note and secured by an instrument granting a security interest in real property, which may be a mortgage, deed of
trust or a deed to secure debt, depending upon the prevailing practice and law in the state in which the related mortgaged property
is located. Mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt are in this prospectus collectively referred to as âmortgagesâ.
A mortgage creates a lien upon, or grants a title interest in, the real property covered thereby, and represents the security for
the repayment of the indebtedness customarily evidenced by a promissory note. The priority of the lien created or interest granted
will depend on the terms of the mortgage and, in some cases, on the terms of separate subordination agreements or intercreditor
agreements with others that hold interests in the real property, the knowledge of the parties to the mortgage and, generally, the
order of recordation of the mortgage in the appropriate public recording office. However, the lien of a recorded mortgage will
generally be subordinate to later-arising liens for real estate taxes and assessments and other charges imposed under governmental
police powers.
Â 
Types
of Mortgage Instruments
Â 
There are two parties to a mortgage: a mortgagor
(the borrower and usually the owner of the applicable property) and a mortgagee (the lender). In contrast, a deed of trust is a
three-party instrument, among a trustor (the equivalent of a borrower), a trustee to whom the real property is conveyed, and a
beneficiary (the lender) for whose benefit the conveyance is made. Under a deed of trust, the trustor grants the property, irrevocably
until the debt is paid, in trust and generally with a power of sale, to the trustee to secure repayment of the indebtedness evidenced
by the related note. A deed to secure debt typically has two parties, pursuant to which the borrower, or grantor, conveys title
to the real property to the grantee, or lender generally with a power of sale, until such time as the debt is repaid. In a case
where the borrower is a land trust, there would be an additional party because legal title to the property is held by a land trustee
under a land trust agreement for the benefit of the borrower. At origination of a mortgage loan involving a land trust, the borrower
may execute a separate undertaking to make payments on the promissory note. The land trustee would not be personally liable for
the promissory note obligation. The mortgageeâs authority under a mortgage, the trusteeâs authority under a deed of
trust and the granteeâs authority under a deed to secure debt are governed by the express provisions of the related instrument,
the law of the state in which the real property is located, certain federal laws and, in some deed of trust transactions, the directions
of the beneficiary.
Â 
Leases
and Rents
Â 
Mortgages that encumber income-producing
property often contain an assignment of rents and leases, and/or may be accompanied by a separate assignment of rents and leases,
pursuant to which the borrower assigns to the lender the borrowerâs right, title and interest as landlord under each lease
and the income derived from the lease, while (unless rents are to be paid directly to the lender) retaining a revocable license
to collect the rents for so long as there is no default. If the borrower defaults, the license terminates and the lender is entitled
to collect the rents. Local law may require that the lender take possession of the property and/or obtain a court-appointed receiver
before becoming entitled to collect the rents.
Â 
In most states, hotel property and motel
room rates are considered accounts receivable under the Uniform Commercial Code (âUCCâ). In cases where hotel
properties or motels constitute loan security, the revenues are generally pledged by the borrower as additional
Â 


461
Â 
Â 
security
for the loan. In general, the lender must file financing statements in order to perfect its security interest in the room revenues
and must file continuation statements, generally every 5 years, to maintain perfection of such security interest. In certain cases,
mortgage loans secured by hotel properties or motels may be included in the issuing entity even if the security interest in the
room revenues was not perfected. Even if the lenderâs security interest in room revenues is perfected under applicable nonbankruptcy
law, it will generally be required to commence a foreclosure action or otherwise take possession of the property in order to enforce
its rights to collect the room revenues following a default. In the bankruptcy setting, however, the lender will be stayed from
enforcing its rights to collect room revenues, but those room revenues constitute âcash collateralâ and therefore
generally cannot be used by the bankruptcy debtor without a hearing or lenderâs consent or unless the lenderâs interest
in the room revenues is given adequate protection (e.g., cash payment for otherwise encumbered funds or a replacement lien
on unencumbered property, in either case in value equivalent to the amount of room revenues that the debtor proposes to use, or
other similar relief). See ââBankruptcy Lawsâ below.
Â 
Personalty
Â 
In the case of certain types of mortgaged
properties, such as hotel properties, motels, nursing homes and manufactured housing, personal property (to the extent owned by
the borrower and not previously pledged) may constitute a significant portion of the propertyâs value as security.
The creation and enforcement of liens on personal property are governed by the UCC. Accordingly, if a borrower pledges personal
property as security for a mortgage loan, the lender generally must file UCC financing statements in order to perfect
its security interest in that personal property, and must file continuation statements, generally every five years,
to maintain that perfection. Certain mortgage loans secured in part by personal property may be included in the issuing entity
even if the security interest in such personal property was not perfected.
Â 
Foreclosure
Â 
General
Â 
Foreclosure is a legal procedure that allows
the lender to recover its mortgage debt by enforcing its rights and available legal remedies under the mortgage. If the borrower
defaults in payment or performance of its obligations under the promissory note or mortgage, the lender has the right to institute
foreclosure proceedings to sell the real property at public auction to satisfy the indebtedness.
Â 
Foreclosure
Procedures Vary from State to State
Â 
Two primary methods of foreclosing a mortgage
are judicial foreclosure, involving court proceedings, and nonjudicial foreclosure pursuant to a power of sale granted in the mortgage
instrument. Other foreclosure procedures are available in some states, but they are either infrequently used or available only
in limited circumstances.
Â 
A foreclosure action is subject to most
of the delays and expenses of other lawsuits if defenses are raised or counterclaims are interposed, and sometimes requires several
years to complete.
Â 
See also âRisk FactorsâRisks
Relating to the Mortgage LoansâRisks Associated with One Action Rulesâ.
Â 


462
Â 
Â 
Judicial
Foreclosure
Â 
A judicial foreclosure proceeding is conducted
in a court having jurisdiction over the mortgaged property. Generally, the action is initiated by the service of legal pleadings
upon all parties having a subordinate interest of record in the real property and all parties in possession of the property, under
leases or otherwise, whose interests are subordinate to the mortgage. Delays in completion of the foreclosure may occasionally
result from difficulties in locating defendants. When the lenderâs right to foreclose is contested, the legal proceedings
can be time-consuming. Upon successful completion of a judicial foreclosure proceeding, the court generally issues a judgment of
foreclosure and appoints a referee or other officer to conduct a public sale of the mortgaged property, the proceeds of which are
used to satisfy the judgment. Such sales are made in accordance with procedures that vary from state to state.
Â 
Equitable
and Other Limitations on Enforceability of Certain Provisions
Â 
United States courts have traditionally
imposed general equitable principles to limit the remedies available to lenders in foreclosure actions. These principles are generally
designed to relieve borrowers from the effects of mortgage defaults perceived as harsh or unfair. Relying on such principles, a
court may alter the specific terms of a loan to the extent it considers necessary to prevent or remedy an injustice, undue
oppression or overreaching, or may require the lender to undertake affirmative actions to determine the cause of the borrowerâs
default and the likelihood that the borrower will be able to reinstate the loan. In some cases, courts have substituted their judgment
for the lenderâs and have required that lenders reinstate loans or recast payment schedules in order to accommodate borrowers
who are suffering from a temporary financial disability. In other cases, courts have limited the right of the lender to foreclose
in the case of a nonmonetary default, such as a failure to adequately maintain the mortgaged property or an impermissible further
encumbrance of the mortgaged property. Finally, some courts have addressed the issue of whether federal or state constitutional
provisions reflecting due process concerns for adequate notice require that a borrower receive notice in addition to statutorily-prescribed
minimum notice. For the most part, these cases have upheld the reasonableness of the notice provisions or have found that a public
sale under a mortgage providing for a power of sale does not involve sufficient state action to trigger constitutional protections.
Â 
In addition, some states may have statutory
protection such as the right of the borrower to reinstate a mortgage loan after commencement of foreclosure proceedings but prior
to a foreclosure sale.
Â 
Nonjudicial
Foreclosure/Power of Sale
Â 
In states permitting nonjudicial foreclosure
proceedings, foreclosure of a deed of trust is generally accomplished by a nonjudicial trusteeâs sale pursuant to a power
of sale typically granted in the deed of trust. A power of sale may also be contained in any other type of mortgage instrument
if applicable law so permits. A power of sale under a deed of trust allows a nonjudicial public sale to be conducted generally
following a request from the beneficiary/lender to the trustee to sell the property upon default by the borrower and after
notice of sale is given in accordance with the terms of the mortgage and applicable state law. In some states, prior to such sale,
the trustee under the deed of trust must record a notice of default and notice of sale and send a copy to the borrower and to any
other party who has recorded a request for a copy of a notice of default and notice of sale. In addition, in some states the trustee
must provide notice to any other party having an interest of record in the real property, including junior lienholders. A notice
of sale must be posted in a public place and, in most states, published for a specified period of time in one or more
Â 


463
Â 
Â 
newspapers.
The borrower or junior lienholder may then have the right, during a reinstatement period required in some states, to cure the
default by paying the entire actual amount in arrears (without regard to the acceleration of the indebtedness), plus the lenderâs
expenses incurred in enforcing the obligation. In other states, the borrower or the junior lienholder is not provided a period
to reinstate the loan, but has only the right to pay off the entire debt to prevent the foreclosure sale. Generally, state law
governs the procedure for public sale, the parties entitled to notice, the method of giving notice and the applicable time periods.
Â 
Public
Sale
Â 
A third party may be unwilling to purchase
a mortgaged property at a public sale because of the difficulty in determining the exact status of title to the property (due to,
among other things, redemption rights that may exist) and because of the possibility that physical deterioration of the mortgaged
property may have occurred during the foreclosure proceedings. Potential buyers may also be reluctant to purchase mortgaged property
at a foreclosure sale as a result of the 1980 decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Durrett
v. Washington National Insurance Co., 621 F.2d 2001 (5th Cir. 1980) and other decisions that have followed its reasoning. The
court in Durrett held that even a non-collusive, regularly conducted foreclosure sale was a fraudulent transfer under the
Bankruptcy Code and, thus, could be rescinded in favor of the bankruptâs estate, if (1)Â the foreclosure sale was held
while the debtor was insolvent and not more than one year prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition and (2)Â the price
paid for the foreclosed property did not represent âfair considerationâ, which is âreasonably equivalent valueâ
under the Bankruptcy Code. Although the reasoning and result of Durrett in respect of the Bankruptcy Code was rejected by
the United States Supreme Court in BFP v. Resolution Trust Corp., 511 U.S. 531 (1994), the case could nonetheless be persuasive
to a court applying a state fraudulent conveyance law which has provisions similar to those construed in Durrett. Therefore,
it is common for the lender to purchase the mortgaged property for an amount equal to the secured indebtedness and accrued and
unpaid interest plus the expenses of foreclosure, in which event the borrowerâs debt will be extinguished, or for a lesser
amount in order to preserve its right to seek a deficiency judgment if such is available under state law and under the terms
of the mortgage loan documents. Thereafter, subject to the borrowerâs right in some states to remain in possession during
a redemption period, the lender will become the owner of the property and have both the benefits and burdens of ownership,
including the obligation to pay debt service on any senior mortgages, to pay taxes, to obtain casualty insurance and to make such
repairs as are necessary to render the property suitable for sale. Frequently, the lender employs a third-party management company
to manage and operate the property. The costs of operating and maintaining a property may be significant and may be greater
than the income derived from that property. The costs of management and operation of those mortgaged properties which are hotels,
motels, restaurants, nursing or convalescent homes, hospitals or casinos may be particularly significant because of the expertise,
knowledge and, with respect to certain property types, regulatory compliance, required to run those operations and the effect which
foreclosure and a change in ownership may have on the publicâs and the industryâs, including franchisorsâ, perception
of the quality of those operations. The lender also will commonly obtain the services of a real estate broker and pay the brokerâs
commission in connection with the sale or lease of the property. Depending upon market conditions, the ultimate proceeds of the
sale of a property may not equal the lenderâs investment in the property. Moreover, a lender commonly incurs substantial
legal fees and court costs in acquiring a mortgaged property through contested foreclosure and/or bankruptcy proceedings. Because
of the expenses associated with acquiring, owning and selling a mortgaged property, a lender could realize an overall loss on a
mortgage loan even if the
Â 


464
Â 
Â 
mortgaged
property is sold at foreclosure, or resold after it is acquired through foreclosure, for an amount equal to the full outstanding
principal amount of the loan plus accrued interest.
Â 
Furthermore, an increasing number of states
require that any environmental contamination at certain types of properties be cleaned up before a property may be resold. In addition,
a lender may be responsible under federal or state law for the cost of cleaning up a mortgaged property that is environmentally
contaminated. See ââEnvironmental Considerationsâ below.
Â 
The holder of a junior mortgage that forecloses
on a mortgaged property does so subject to senior mortgages and any other prior liens, and may be obliged to keep senior mortgage
loans current in order to avoid foreclosure of its interest in the property. In addition, if the foreclosure of a junior mortgage
triggers the enforcement of a âdue-on-saleâ clause contained in a senior mortgage, the junior mortgagee could be required
to pay the full amount of the senior mortgage indebtedness or face foreclosure.
Â 
Rights
of Redemption
Â 
The purposes of a foreclosure action are
to enable the lender to realize upon its security and to bar the borrower, and all persons who have interests in the property that
are subordinate to that of the foreclosing lender, from exercise of their âequity of redemptionâ. The doctrine of equity
of redemption provides that, until the property encumbered by a mortgage has been sold in accordance with a properly conducted
foreclosure and foreclosure sale, those having interests that are subordinate to that of the foreclosing lender have an equity
of redemption and may redeem the property by paying the entire debt with interest. Those having an equity of redemption must generally
be made parties and joined in the foreclosure proceeding in order for their equity of redemption to be terminated.
Â 
The equity of redemption is a common-law
(nonstatutory) right which should be distinguished from post-sale statutory rights of redemption. In some states, after sale pursuant
to a deed of trust or foreclosure of a mortgage, the borrower and foreclosed junior lienors are given a statutory period in which
to redeem the property. In some states, statutory redemption may occur only upon payment of the foreclosure sale price. In other
states, redemption may be permitted if the former borrower pays only a portion of the sums due. The effect of a statutory right
of redemption is to diminish the ability of the lender to sell the foreclosed property because the exercise of a right of redemption
would defeat the title of any purchaser through a foreclosure. Consequently, the practical effect of the redemption right is to
force the lender to maintain the property and pay the expenses of ownership until the redemption period has expired. In some states,
a post-sale statutory right of redemption may exist following a judicial foreclosure, but not following a trusteeâs sale
under a deed of trust.
Â 
Anti-Deficiency
Legislation
Â 
Some or all of the mortgage loans are nonrecourse
loans, as to which recourse in the case of default will be limited to the mortgaged property and such other assets, if any, that
were pledged to secure the mortgage loan. However, even if a mortgage loan by its terms provides for recourse to the borrowerâs
other assets, a lenderâs ability to realize upon those assets may be limited by state law. For example, in some states a
lender cannot obtain a deficiency judgment against the borrower following foreclosure or sale under a deed of trust.
Â 


465
Â 
Â 
A deficiency judgment is a personal
judgment against the former borrower equal to the difference between the net amount realized upon the public sale of the real property
and the amount due to the lender. Other statutes may require the lender to exhaust the security afforded under a mortgage before
bringing a personal action against the borrower. In certain other states, the lender has the option of bringing a personal action
against the borrower on the debt without first exhausting that security; however, in some of those states, the lender, following
judgment on that personal action, may be deemed to have elected a remedy and thus may be precluded from foreclosing upon the security.
Consequently, lenders in those states where such an election of remedy provision exists will usually proceed first against
the security. Finally, other statutory provisions, designed to protect borrowers from exposure to large deficiency judgments
that might result from bidding at below-market values at the foreclosure sale, limit any deficiency judgment to the excess
of the outstanding debt over the fair market value of the property at the time of the sale.
Â 
Leasehold
Considerations
Â 
Mortgage loans may be secured by a mortgage
on the borrowerâs leasehold interest in a ground lease. Leasehold mortgage loans are subject to certain risks not associated
with mortgage loans secured by a lien on the fee estate of the borrower. The most significant of these risks is that if the
borrowerâs leasehold were to be terminated upon a lease default, the leasehold mortgagee would lose its security. This risk
may be lessened if the ground lease requires the lessor to give the leasehold mortgagee notices of lessee defaults and an opportunity
to cure them, permits the leasehold estate to be assigned to and by the leasehold mortgagee or the purchaser at a foreclosure sale,
and contains certain other protective provisions typically included in a âmortgageableâ ground lease. Certain mortgage
loans, however, may be secured by ground leases which do not contain these provisions.
Â 
In addition, where a lender has as its security
both the fee and leasehold interest in the same property, the grant of a mortgage lien on its fee interest by the land owner/ground
lessor to secure the debt of a borrower/ground lessee may be subject to challenge as a fraudulent conveyance. Among other things,
a legal challenge to the granting of the liens may focus on the benefits realized by the land owner/ground lessor from the
loan. If a court concluded that the granting of the mortgage lien was an avoidable fraudulent conveyance, it might take actions
detrimental to the holders of the offered certificates, including, under certain circumstances, invalidating the mortgage
lien on the fee interest of the land owner/ground lessor.
Â 
Cooperative
Shares
Â 
Mortgage loans may be secured by a security
interest on the borrowerâs ownership interest in shares, and the related proprietary leases, allocable to cooperative dwelling
units that may be vacant or occupied by non-owner tenants. Such loans are subject to certain risks not associated with mortgage
loans secured by a lien on the fee estate of a borrower in real property. Such a loan typically is subordinate to the mortgage,
if any, on the cooperativeâs building which, if foreclosed, could extinguish the equity in the building and the proprietary
leases of the dwelling units derived from ownership of the shares of the cooperative. Further, transfer of shares in a cooperative
are subject to various regulations as well as to restrictions under the governing documents of the cooperative, and the shares
may be cancelled in the event that associated maintenance charges due under the related proprietary leases are not paid. Typically,
a recognition agreement between the lender and the cooperative provides, among other things, the lender with an opportunity to
cure a default under a proprietary lease.
Â 


466
Â 
Â 
Under the laws applicable in many states,
âforeclosureâ on cooperative shares is accomplished by a sale in accordance with the provisions of ArticleÂ 9 of
the UCC and the security agreement relating to the shares. ArticleÂ 9 of the UCC requires that a sale be conducted in a âcommercially
reasonableâ manner, which may be dependent upon, among other things, the notice given the debtor and the method, manner,
time, place and terms of the sale. ArticleÂ 9 of the UCC provides that the proceeds of the sale will be applied first
to pay the costs and expenses of the sale and then to satisfy the indebtedness secured by the lenderâs security interest.
A recognition agreement, however, generally provides that the lenderâs right to reimbursement is subject to the right of
the cooperative to receive sums due under the proprietary leases.
Â 
Bankruptcy
Laws
Â 
Operation of the federal Bankruptcy Code
in Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended from time to time (âBankruptcy Codeâ) and related state laws
may interfere with or affect the ability of a lender to obtain payment of a loan, realize upon collateral and/or to enforce a deficiency
judgment. For example, under the Bankruptcy Code, virtually all actions (including foreclosure actions and deficiency judgment
proceedings) are automatically stayed upon the filing of the bankruptcy petition, and, usually, no interest or principal
payments are made during the course of the bankruptcy case. The delay and the consequences of a delay caused by an automatic stay
can be significant. For example, the filing of a petition in bankruptcy by or on behalf of a junior mortgage lien holder
may stay the senior lender from taking action to foreclose out such junior lien. At a minimum, the senior lender would suffer delay
due to its need to seek bankruptcy court approval before taking any foreclosure or other action that could be deemed in violation
of the automatic stay under the Bankruptcy Code.
Â 
Under the Bankruptcy Code, a bankruptcy
trustee, or a borrower as debtor-in-possession, may under certain circumstances sell the related mortgaged property or other collateral
free and clear of all liens, claims, encumbrances and interests, which liens would then attach to the proceeds of such sale, despite
the provisions of the related mortgage or other security agreement to the contrary. Such a sale may be approved by a bankruptcy
court even if the proceeds are insufficient to pay the secured debt in full.
Â 
Under the Bankruptcy Code, provided certain
substantive and procedural safeguards for a lender are met, the amount and terms of a mortgage or other security agreement secured
by property of a debtor may be modified under certain circumstances. Pursuant to a confirmed plan of reorganization, lien avoidance
or claim objection proceeding, the secured claim arising from a loan secured by real property or other collateral may be reduced
to the then-current value of the property (with a corresponding partial reduction of the amount of lenderâs security interest),
thus leaving the lender a secured creditor to the extent of the then current value of the property and a general unsecured creditor
for the difference between such value and the outstanding balance of the loan. Such general unsecured claims may be paid less than
100% of the amount of the debt or not at all, depending upon the circumstances. Other modifications may include the reduction in
the amount of each scheduled payment, which reduction may result from a reduction in the rate of interest and/or the alteration
of the repayment schedule (with or without affecting the unpaid principal balance of the loan), and/or an extension (or reduction)
of the final maturity date. Some courts have approved bankruptcy plans, based on the particular facts of the reorganization case,
that effected the curing of a mortgage loan default by paying arrearages over a number of years. Also, under the Bankruptcy Code,
a bankruptcy court may permit a debtor through its plan of reorganization to reinstate the loan even though the lender accelerated
the mortgage loan and final judgment of foreclosure had been entered in
Â 


467
Â 
Â 
state
court (provided that no sale of the property had yet occurred) prior to the filing of the debtorâs petition. This
may be done even if the plan of reorganization does not provide for payment of the full amount due under the original loan. Thus,
the full amount due under the original loan may never be repaid. Other types of significant modifications to the terms of mortgage
loan may be acceptable to the bankruptcy court, such as making distributions to the mortgage holder of property other than cash,
or the substitution of collateral which is the âindubitable equivalentâ of the real property subject to the mortgage,
or the subordination of the mortgage to liens securing new debt (provided that the lenderâs secured claim is âadequately
protectedâ as such term is defined and interpreted under the Bankruptcy Code), often depending on the particular facts and
circumstances of the specific case.
Â 
Federal bankruptcy law may also interfere
with or otherwise adversely affect the ability of a secured mortgage lender to enforce an assignment by a borrower of rents and
leases (which ârentsâ may include revenues from hotels and other lodging facilities specified in the Bankruptcy Code)
related to a mortgaged property if the related borrower is in a bankruptcy proceeding. Under the Bankruptcy Code, a lender may
be stayed from enforcing the assignment, and the legal proceedings necessary to resolve the issue can be time consuming and may
result in significant delays in the receipt of the rents. Rents (including applicable hotel and other lodging revenues) and leases
may also escape such an assignment, among other things, (i)Â if the assignment is not fully perfected under state law prior
to commencement of the bankruptcy proceeding, (ii)Â to the extent such rents and leases are used by the borrower to maintain
the mortgaged property, or for other court authorized expenses, (iii)Â to the extent other collateral may be substituted for
the rents and leases, (iv)Â to the extent the bankruptcy court determines that the lender is adequately protected, or (v)Â to
the extent the court determines based on the equities of the case that the post-petition rents are not subject to the lenderâs
pre-petition securities interest.
Â 
Under the Bankruptcy Code, a security interest
in real property acquired before the commencement of the bankruptcy case does not extend to income received after the commencement
of the bankruptcy case unless such income is a proceed, product or rent of such property. Therefore, to the extent a business conducted
on the mortgaged property creates accounts receivable rather than rents or results from payments under a license rather than payments
under a lease, a valid and perfected pre-bankruptcy lien on such accounts receivable or license income generally would not continue
as to post-bankruptcy accounts receivable or license income.
Â 
The Bankruptcy Code provides that a lenderâs
perfected pre-petition security interest in leases, rents and hotel revenues continues in the post-petition leases, rents and hotel
revenues, unless a bankruptcy court orders to the contrary âbased on the equities of the caseâ. The equities of a particular
case may permit the discontinuance of security interests in pre-petition leases and rents. Thus, unless a court orders otherwise,
revenues from a mortgaged property generated after the date the bankruptcy petition is filed will constitute âcash
collateralâ under the Bankruptcy Code. Debtors may only use cash collateral upon obtaining the lenderâs consent or
a prior court order finding that the lenderâs interest in the mortgaged hotel, motel or other lodging property and
the cash collateral is âadequately protectedâ as the term is defined and interpreted under the Bankruptcy Code. In
addition to post-petition rents, any cash held by a lender in a lockbox or reserve account generally would also constitute âcash
collateralâ under the Bankruptcy Code. So long as the lender is adequately protected, a debtorâs use of cash collateral
may be for its own benefit or for the benefit of any affiliated entity group that is also subject to bankruptcy proceedings, including
use as collateral for new debt. It should be noted, however, that the court may find that the lender has no security interest
in either pre-petition or post-petition revenues if
Â 


468
Â 
Â 
the court finds that the loan documents do not contain language covering
accounts, room rents, or other forms of personality necessary for a security interest to attach to such revenues.
Â 
The Bankruptcy Code provides generally that
rights and obligations under an unexpired lease of the debtor/lessee may not be terminated or modified at any time after
the commencement of a case under the Bankruptcy Code solely because of a provision in the lease to that effect or because of certain
other similar events. This prohibition on so-called âipso factoâ clauses could limit the ability of a lender to exercise
certain contractual remedies with respect to the leases on any mortgaged property. In addition, section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code
operates as an automatic stay of, among other things, any act to obtain possession of property from a debtorâs estate, which
may delay a lenderâs exercise of those remedies, including foreclosure, in the event that a lessee becomes the subject of
a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code. Thus, the filing of a petition in bankruptcy by or on behalf of a lessee of a mortgaged
property would result in a stay against the commencement or continuation of any state court proceeding for past due rent, for accelerated
rent, for damages or for a summary eviction order with respect to a default under the related lease that occurred prior to the
filing of the lesseeâs petition. While relief from the automatic stay to enforce remedies may be requested, it can
be denied for a number of reasons, including where the collateral is ânecessary to an effective reorganizationâ for
the debtor, and if a debtorâs case has been administratively consolidated with those of its affiliates, the court may also
consider whether the property is ânecessary to an effective reorganizationâ of the debtor and its affiliates, taken
as a whole.
Â 
The Bankruptcy Code generally provides that
a trustee in bankruptcy or debtor-in-possession may, with respect to an unexpired lease of non-residential real property, before
the earlier of (i)Â 120 days after the filing of a bankruptcy case or (ii)Â the entry of an order confirming a plan, subject
to approval of the court, (a)Â assume the lease and retain it or assign it to a third party or (b)Â reject the lease. If
the trustee or debtor-in-possession fails to assume or reject the lease within the time specified in the preceding sentence, subject
to any extensions by the bankruptcy court, the lease will be deemed rejected and the property will be surrendered to the lessor.
The bankruptcy court may for cause shown extend the 120-day period up to 90 days for a total of 210 days. If the lease is assumed,
the trustee in bankruptcy on behalf of the lessee, or the lessee as debtor-in-possession, or the assignee, if applicable, must
cure any defaults under the lease, compensate the lessor for its losses and provide the lessor with âadequate assuranceâ
of future performance. These remedies may be insufficient, however, as the lessor may be forced to continue under the lease with
a lessee that is a poor credit risk or an unfamiliar tenant (if the lease was assigned), and any assurances provided to the lessor
may, in fact, be inadequate. If the lease is rejected, the rejection generally constitutes a breach of the executory contract or
unexpired lease as of the date immediately preceding the filing date of the bankruptcy petition. As a consequence, the other party
or parties to the lease, such as the borrower, as lessor under a lease, generally would have only an unsecured claim against the
debtor, as lessee, for damages resulting from the breach, which could adversely affect the security for the related mortgage loan.
In addition, under the Bankruptcy Code, a lease rejection damages claim is limited to the â(a)Â rent reserved by the
lease, without acceleration, for the greater of one year, or 15 percent, not to exceed 3Â years, of the remaining term of such
lease, following the earlier of the date of the bankruptcy petition and the date on which the lessor regained possession of the
real property, (b)Â plus any unpaid rent due under such lease, without acceleration, on the earlier of such dates.â
Â 
If a trustee in bankruptcy on behalf of
a lessor, or a lessor as debtor-in-possession, rejects an unexpired lease of real property, the lessee may treat the lease as terminated
by
Â 


469
Â 
Â 
the rejection or, in the alternative, the lessee may remain in possession of the leasehold for the balance of the term and for
any renewal or extension of the term that is enforceable by the lessee under applicable non-bankruptcy law. The Bankruptcy Code
provides that if a lessee elects to remain in possession after a rejection of a lease, the lessee may offset against rents reserved
under the lease for the balance of the term after the date of rejection of the lease, and the related renewal or extension of the
lease, any damages occurring after that date caused by the nonperformance of any obligation of the lessor under the lease after
that date.
Â 
Similarly, bankruptcy risk is associated
with an insolvency proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code of either a borrower ground lessee or a ground lessor. In general, upon
the bankruptcy of a lessor or a lessee under a lease of nonresidential real property, including a ground lease, that has not been
terminated prior to the bankruptcy filing date, the debtor entity has the statutory right to assume or reject the lease. Given
that the Bankruptcy Code generally invalidates clauses that terminate contracts automatically upon the filing by one of the parties
of a bankruptcy petition or that are conditioned on a partyâs insolvency, following the filing of a bankruptcy petition,
a debtor would ordinarily be required to perform its obligations under such lease until the debtor decides whether to assume or
reject the lease. The Bankruptcy Code provides certain additional protections with respect to non-residential real property leases,
such as establishing a specific timeframe in which a debtor must determine whether to assume or reject the lease. The bankruptcy
court may extend the time to perform for up to 60 days for cause shown. Even if the agreements were terminated prior to bankruptcy,
a bankruptcy court may determine that the agreement was improperly terminated and therefore remains part of the debtorâs
bankruptcy estate. The debtor also can seek bankruptcy court approval to assume and assign the lease to a third party, and to modify
the lease in connection with such assignment. In order to assume the lease, the debtor or assignee generally will have to cure
outstanding defaults and provide âadequate assurance of future performanceâ in addition to satisfying other requirements
imposed under the Bankruptcy Code. Under the Bankruptcy Code, subject to certain exceptions, once a lease is rejected by a debtor
lessee, it is deemed breached, and the non-debtor lessor will have a claim for lease rejection damages, as described above.
Â 
If the ground lessor files for bankruptcy,
it may determine until the confirmation of its plan of reorganization whether to reject the ground lease. On request of any party
to the lease, the bankruptcy court may order the debtor to determine within a specific period of time whether to assume or reject
the lease or to comply with the terms of the lease pending its decision to assume or reject. In the event of rejection, the non-debtor
lessee will have the right to treat the lease as terminated by virtue of its terms, applicable nonbankruptcy law, or any agreement
made by the lessee. The non-debtor lessee may also, if the lease term has begun, retain its rights under the lease, including its
rights to remain in possession of the leased premises under the rent reserved in the lease for the balance of the term of the lease
(including renewals). The term âlesseeâ includes any âsuccessor, assign or mortgagee permitted under the terms
of such leaseâ. If, pre-petition, the ground lessor had specifically granted the leasehold mortgagee such right, the leasehold
mortgagee may have the right to succeed to the lessee/borrowerâs position under the lease.
Â 
In the event of concurrent bankruptcy proceedings
involving the ground lessor and the lessee/borrower, actions by creditors against the borrower/lessee debtor would be subject to
the automatic stay, and a lender may be unable to enforce both the bankrupt lesseeâs/borrowerâs pre-petition agreement
to refuse to treat a ground lease rejected by a bankrupt lessor as terminated and any agreement by the ground lessor to grant the
lender a new lease upon such termination. In such circumstances, a lease could be terminated
Â 


470
Â 
Â 
notwithstanding lender protection
provisions contained in that lease or in the mortgage. A lender could lose its security unless the lender holds a fee mortgage
or the bankruptcy court, as a court of equity, allows the mortgagee to assume the ground lesseeâs obligations under the ground
lease and succeed to the ground lesseeâs position. Although consistent with the Bankruptcy Code, such position may not be
adopted by the bankruptcy court.
Â 
Further, in an appellate decision by the
United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (Precision Indus. v. Qualitech Steel SBQ, LLC, 327 F.3d 537 (7th
Cir, 2003)), the court ruled with respect to an unrecorded lease of real property that where a statutory sale of leased property
occurs under the Bankruptcy Code upon the bankruptcy of a landlord, that sale terminates a lesseeâs possessory interest in
the property, and the purchaser assumes title free and clear of any interest, including any leasehold estates. Pursuant to the
Bankruptcy Code, a lessee may request the bankruptcy court to prohibit or condition the statutory sale of the property so as to
provide adequate protection of the leasehold interest; however, the court ruled that, at least where a memorandum of lease had
not been recorded, this provision does not ensure continued possession of the property, but rather entitles the lessee to compensation
for the value of its leasehold interest, typically from the sale proceeds. As a result, we cannot assure you that, in the event
of a statutory sale of leased property pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code, the lessee would be able to maintain possession of the
property under the ground lease. In addition, we cannot assure you that a leasehold mortgagor and/or a leasehold mortgagee (to
the extent it has standing to intervene) would be able to recover the full value of the leasehold interest in bankruptcy court.
Â 
Because of the possible termination of the
related ground lease, whether arising from a bankruptcy, the expiration of a lease term or an uncured defect under the related
ground lease, lending on a leasehold interest in a real property is riskier than lending on the fee interest in the property.
Â 
In a bankruptcy or similar proceeding involving
a borrower, action may be taken seeking the recovery as a preferential transfer of any payments made by such borrower, or made
directly by the related lessee, under the related mortgage loan to the issuing entity. Payments on long term debt may be protected
from recovery as preferences if they qualify for the âordinary courseâ exception under the Bankruptcy Code or if certain
other defenses in the Bankruptcy Code are applicable. Whether any particular payment would be protected depends upon the facts
specific to a particular transaction.
Â 
In addition, in a bankruptcy or similar
proceeding involving any borrower or an affiliate, an action may be taken to avoid the transaction (or any component of the transaction,
such as joint and several liability on the related mortgage loan) as an actual or constructive fraudulent conveyance under state
or federal law. Any payment by a borrower in excess of its allocated share of the loan could be challenged as a fraudulent conveyance
by creditors of that borrower in an action outside a bankruptcy case or by the representative of the borrowerâs bankruptcy
estate in a bankruptcy case. Generally, under federal and most state fraudulent conveyance statutes, the incurrence of an obligation
or the transfer of property by a person will be subject to avoidance under certain circumstances if the person transferred such
property with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud its creditors or the person did not receive fair consideration or reasonably
equivalent value in exchange for such obligation or transfer and (i)Â was insolvent or was rendered insolvent by such obligation
or transfer, (ii)Â was engaged in business or a transaction, or was about to engage in business or a transaction, for which
any property remaining with the person constituted unreasonably small capital, or (iii)Â intended to, or believed that it would,
incur debts that would be beyond the personâs ability to pay as such debts matured. The measure of insolvency will vary depending
on the law of the applicable jurisdiction. However, an entity
Â 


471
Â 
Â 
will generally be considered insolvent if the present fair salable
value of its assets is less than (x)Â the sum of its debts or (y)Â the amount that would be required to pay its probable
liabilities on its existing debts as they become absolute and matured. Accordingly, a lien granted by a borrower to secure repayment
of the loan in excess of its allocated share could be avoided if a court were to determine that (i)Â such borrower was insolvent
at the time of granting the lien, was rendered insolvent by the granting of the lien, was left with inadequate capital, or was
not able to pay its debts as they matured and (ii)Â the borrower did not, when it allowed its property to be encumbered by
a lien securing the entire indebtedness represented by the loan, receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for
pledging such property for the equal benefit of each other borrower.
Â 
A bankruptcy court may, under certain circumstances,
authorize a debtor to obtain credit after the commencement of a bankruptcy case, secured among other things, by senior, equal or
junior liens on property that is already subject to a lien. In the bankruptcy case of General Growth Properties filed on
April 16, 2009, the debtors initially sought approval of a debtor-in-possession loan to the corporate parent entities guaranteed
by the property-level single purpose entities and secured by second liens on their properties. Although the debtor-in-possession
loan subsequently was modified to eliminate the subsidiary guarantees and second liens, we cannot assure you that, in the event
of a bankruptcy of the borrower sponsor, the borrower sponsor would not seek approval of a similar debtor-in-possession loan, or
that a bankruptcy court would not approve a debtor-in-possession loan that included such subsidiary guarantees and second liens
on such subsidiariesâ properties.
Â 
Certain of the borrowers may be partnerships.
The laws governing limited partnerships in certain states provide that the commencement of a case under the Bankruptcy Code with
respect to a general partner will cause a person to cease to be a general partner of the limited partnership, unless otherwise
provided in writing in the limited partnership agreement. This provision may be construed as an âipso factoâ clause
and, in the event of the general partnerâs bankruptcy, may not be enforceable. Certain limited partnership agreements of
the borrowers may provide that the commencement of a case under the Bankruptcy Code with respect to the related general partner
constitutes an event of withdrawal (assuming the enforceability of the clause is not challenged in bankruptcy proceedings or, if
challenged, is upheld) that might trigger the dissolution of the limited partnership, the winding up of its affairs and the distribution
of its assets, unless (i)Â at the time there was at least one other general partner and the written provisions of the limited
partnership permit the business of the limited partnership to be carried on by the remaining general partner and that general partner
does so or (ii)Â the written provisions of the limited partnership agreement permit the limited partners to agree within a
specified time frame (often 60 days) after the withdrawal to continue the business of the limited partnership and to the
appointment of one or more general partners and the limited partners do so. In addition, the laws governing general partnerships
in certain states provide that the commencement of a case under the Bankruptcy Code or state bankruptcy laws with respect to a
general partner of the partnerships triggers the dissolution of the partnership, the winding up of its affairs and the distribution
of its assets. Those state laws, however, may not be enforceable or effective in a bankruptcy case. Limited liability companies
may be subjected to similar treatment as that described in this prospectus with respect to limited partnerships. The dissolution
of a borrower, the winding up of its affairs and the distribution of its assets could result in an acceleration of its payment
obligation under the borrowerâs mortgage loan, which may reduce the yield on the Offered Certificates in the same manner
as a principal prepayment.
Â 


472
Â 
Â 
In addition, the bankruptcy of the general
or limited partner of a borrower that is a partnership, or the bankruptcy of a member of a borrower that is a limited liability
company or the bankruptcy of a shareholder of a borrower that is a corporation may provide the opportunity in the bankruptcy case
of the partner, member or shareholder to obtain an order from a court consolidating the assets and liabilities of the partner,
member or shareholder with those of the mortgagor pursuant to the doctrines of substantive consolidation or piercing the corporate
veil. In such a case, the respective mortgaged property, for example, would become property of the estate of the bankrupt partner,
member or shareholder. Not only would the mortgaged property be available to satisfy the claims of creditors of the partner, member
or shareholder, but an automatic stay would apply to any attempt by the trustee to exercise remedies with respect to the mortgaged
property. However, such an occurrence should not affect a lenderâs status as a secured creditor with respect to the mortgagor
or its security interest in the mortgaged property.
Â 
A borrower that is a limited partnership,
in many cases, may be required by the loan documents to have a single purpose entity as its sole general partner, and a borrower
that is a general partnership, in many cases, may be required by the loan documents to have as its general partners only entities
that are single purpose entities. A borrower that is a limited liability company may be required by the loan documents to have
a single purpose member or a springing member. All borrowers that are tenants-in-common may be required by the loan documents to
be single purpose entities. These provisions are designed to mitigate the risk of the dissolution or bankruptcy of the borrower
partnership or its general partner, a borrower limited liability company or its member (if applicable), or a borrower that is a
tenant-in-common. However, we cannot assure you that any borrower partnership or its general partner, or any borrower limited liability
company or its member (if applicable), or a borrower that is a tenant-in-common, will not dissolve or become a debtor under the
Bankruptcy Code.
Â 
Environmental
Considerations
Â 
General
Â 
A lender may be subject to environmental
risks when taking a security interest in real property. Of particular concern may be properties that are or have been used for
industrial, manufacturing, military or disposal activity. Such environmental risks include the possible diminution of the value
of a contaminated property or, as discussed below, potential liability for clean-up costs or other remedial actions that could
exceed the value of the property or the amount of the lenderâs loan. In certain circumstances, a lender may decide to abandon
a contaminated mortgaged property as collateral for its loan rather than foreclose and risk liability for clean-up costs.
Â 
Superlien
Laws
Â 
Under the laws of many states, contamination
on a property may give rise to a lien on the property for clean-up costs. In several states, such a lien has priority over all
existing liens, including those of existing mortgages. In these states, the lien of a mortgage may lose its priority to such a
âsuperlien.â
Â 
CERCLA
Â 
The federal Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (âCERCLAâ), imposes strict liability on present
and past âownersâ and âoperatorsâ of contaminated real property for the costs of clean-up. A secured lender
may be liable as an âownerâ or âoperatorâ of a contaminated mortgaged property if agents or
Â 


473
Â 
Â 
employees
of the lender have participated in the management or operation of such mortgaged property. Such liability may exist even if the
lender did not cause or contribute to the contamination and regardless of whether the lender has actually taken possession of
a mortgaged property through foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise. Moreover, such liability is not limited to
the original or unamortized principal balance of a loan or to the value of the property securing a loan. Excluded from CERCLAâs
definition of âownerâ or âoperator,â however, is a person âwho, without participating in the
management of the facility, holds indicia of ownership primarily to protect his security interestâ. This is the so called
âsecured creditor exemption.â
Â 
The Asset Conservation, Lender Liability
and Deposit Insurance Protection Act of 1996 (the â1996 Actâ) amended, among other things, the provisions of
CERCLA with respect to lender liability and the secured creditor exemption. The 1996 Act offers protection to lenders by defining
the activities in which a lender can engage and still have the benefit of the secured creditor exemption. In order for a
lender to be deemed to have participated in the management of a mortgaged property, the lender must actually participate in the
operational affairs of the property of the borrower. The 1996 Act provides that âmerely having the capacity to influence,
or unexercised right to controlâ operations does not constitute participation in management. A lender will lose the protection
of the secured creditor exemption if it exercises decision-making control over the borrowerâs environmental compliance and
hazardous substance handling or disposal practices, or assumes day-to-day management of environmental or substantially all other
operational functions of the mortgaged property. The 1996 Act also provides that a lender will continue to have the benefit
of the secured creditor exemption even if it forecloses on a mortgaged property, purchases it at a foreclosure sale or accepts
a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, provided that the lender seeks to sell the mortgaged property at the earliest practicable
commercially reasonable time on commercially reasonable terms.
Â 
Certain
Other Federal and State Laws
Â 
Many states have statutes similar to CERCLA,
and not all of those statutes provide for a secured creditor exemption. In addition, under federal law, there is potential liability
relating to hazardous wastes and underground storage tanks under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
Â 
Some federal, state and local laws, regulations
and ordinances govern the management, removal, encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos-containing materials. These laws, as well
as common law standards, may impose liability for releases of or exposure to asbestos-containing materials, and provide for third
parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injuries associated with those releases.
Â 
Federal legislation requires owners of residential
housing constructed prior to 1978 to disclose to potential residents or purchasers any known lead-based paint hazards and will
impose treble damages for any failure to disclose. In addition, the ingestion of lead-based paint chips or dust particles by children
can result in lead poisoning. If lead-based paint hazards exist at a property, then the owner of that property may be held liable
for injuries and for the costs of removal or encapsulation of the lead-based paint.
Â 
In a few states, transfers of some types
of properties are conditioned upon clean-up of contamination prior to transfer. In these cases, a lender that becomes the owner
of a property through foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise, may be required to clean-up the contamination before
selling or otherwise transferring the property.
Â 


474
Â 
Â 
Beyond statute-based environmental liability,
there exist common law causes of action (for example, actions based on nuisance or on toxic tort resulting in death, personal injury
or damage to property) related to hazardous environmental conditions on a property. While it may be more difficult to hold a lender
liable under common law causes of action, unanticipated or uninsured liabilities of the borrower may jeopardize the borrowerâs
ability to meet its loan obligations or may decrease the re-sale value of the collateral.
Â 
Additional
Considerations
Â 
The cost of remediating hazardous substance
contamination at a property can be substantial. If a lender becomes liable, it can bring an action for contribution against the
owner or operator who created the environmental hazard, but that individual or entity may be without substantial assets. Accordingly,
it is possible that such costs could become a liability of the issuing entity and occasion a loss to the certificateholders.
Â 
If a lender forecloses on a mortgage secured
by a property, the operations on which are subject to environmental laws and regulations, the lender will be required to operate
the property in accordance with those laws and regulations. Such compliance may entail substantial expense, especially in the case
of industrial or manufacturing properties.
Â 
In addition, a lender may be obligated to
disclose environmental conditions on a property to government entities and/or to prospective buyers (including prospective buyers
at a foreclosure sale or following foreclosure). Such disclosure may decrease the amount that prospective buyers are willing to
pay for the affected property, sometimes substantially, and thereby decrease the ability of the lender to recover its investment
in a loan upon foreclosure.
Â 
Due-on-Sale
and Due-on-Encumbrance Provisions
Â 
Certain of the mortgage loans may contain
âdue-on-saleâ and âdue-on-encumbranceâ clauses that purport to permit the lender to accelerate the maturity
of the loan if the borrower transfers or encumbers the related mortgaged property. The Garn-St Germain Depository Institutions
Act of 1982 (the âGarn Actâ) generally preempts state laws that prohibit the enforcement of due-on-sale clauses
and permits lenders to enforce these clauses in accordance with their terms, subject to certain limitations as set forth in the
Garn Act and related regulations. Accordingly, a lender may nevertheless have the right to accelerate the maturity of a mortgage
loan that contains a âdue-on-saleâ provision upon transfer of an interest in the property, without regard to the lenderâs
ability to demonstrate that a sale threatens its legitimate security interest.
Â 
Subordinate
Financing
Â 
The terms of certain of the mortgage loans
may not restrict the ability of the borrower to use the mortgaged property as security for one or more additional loans, or such
restrictions may be unenforceable. Where a borrower encumbers a mortgaged property with one or more junior liens, the senior lender
is subjected to additional risk. First, the borrower may have difficulty servicing and repaying multiple loans. Moreover, if the
subordinate financing permits recourse to the borrower (as-is frequently the case) and the senior loan does not, a borrower
may have more incentive to repay sums due on the subordinate loan. Second, acts of the senior lender that prejudice the junior
lender or impair the junior lenderâs security may create a superior equity in favor of the junior lender. For example, if
the borrower and the senior lender agree to an increase in the principal amount of or the interest rate payable on the senior loan,
the senior lender may lose its priority to the extent any existing junior lender is harmed or the borrower is additionally burdened.
Third, if the
Â 


475
Â 
Â 
borrower defaults on the senior loan and/or any junior loan or loans, the existence of junior loans and actions taken
by junior lenders can impair the security available to the senior lender and can interfere with or delay the taking of action by
the senior lender. Moreover, the bankruptcy of a junior lender may operate to stay foreclosure or similar proceedings by the senior
lender.
Â 
Default
Interest and Limitations on Prepayments
Â 
Promissory notes and mortgages may contain
provisions that obligate the borrower to pay a late charge or additional interest if payments are not timely made, and in some
circumstances, may prohibit prepayments for a specified period and/or condition prepayments upon the borrowerâs payment
of prepayment fees or yield maintenance penalties. In certain states, there are or may be specific limitations upon the late
charges which a lender may collect from a borrower for delinquent payments. Certain states also limit the amounts that a lender
may collect from a borrower as an additional charge if the loan is prepaid. In addition, the enforceability of provisions that
provide for prepayment fees or penalties upon an involuntary prepayment is unclear under the laws of many states.
Â 
Applicability
of Usury Laws
Â 
Title V of the Depository Institutions Deregulation
and Monetary Control Act of 1980 (âTitle Vâ) provides that state usury limitations will not apply to certain
types of residential (including multifamily) first mortgage loans originated by certain lenders after March 31, 1980. Title
V authorized any state to reimpose interest rate limits by adopting, before April 1, 1983, a law or constitutional provision that
expressly rejects application of the federal law. In addition, even where Title V is not so rejected, any state is authorized by
the law to adopt a provision limiting discount points or other charges on mortgage loans covered by Title V. Certain states have
taken action to reimpose interest rate limits and/or to limit discount points or other charges.
Â 
Statutes differ in their provisions as to
the consequences of a usurious loan. One group of statutes requires the lender to forfeit the interest due above the applicable
limit or impose a specified penalty. Under this statutory scheme, the borrower may cancel the recorded mortgage or deed of
trust upon paying its debt with lawful interest, and the lender may foreclose, but only for the debt plus lawful interest. A second
group of statutes is more severe. A violation of this type of usury law results in the invalidation of the transaction, thereby
permitting the borrower to cancel the recorded mortgage or deed of trust without any payment or prohibiting the lender from foreclosing.
Â 
Americans
with Disabilities Act
Â 
Under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities
Act of 1990 and related regulations (collectively, the âADAâ), in order to protect individuals with disabilities,
public accommodations (such as hotel properties, restaurants, shopping centers, hospitals, schools and social service center establishments)
must remove architectural and communication barriers which are structural in nature from existing places of public accommodation
to the extent âreadily achievableâ. In addition, under the ADA, alterations to a place of public accommodation or a
commercial facility are to be made so that, to the maximum extent feasible, such altered portions are readily accessible to and
usable by disabled individuals. The âreadily achievableâ standard takes into account, among other factors, the financial
resources of the affected site, owner, landlord or other applicable person. In addition to imposing a possible financial
burden on the borrower in its capacity as owner or landlord, the ADA may also impose such requirements on a foreclosing lender
who succeeds to the interest of the borrower as owner or landlord. Furthermore, since the âreadily achievableâ
Â 


476
Â 
Â 
standard
may vary depending on the financial condition of the owner or landlord, a foreclosing lender who is financially more
capable than the borrower of complying with the requirements of the ADA may be subject to more stringent requirements than those
to which the borrower is subject.
Â 
Servicemembers
Civil Relief Act
Â 
Under the terms of the Servicemembers Civil
Relief Act as amended (the âRelief Actâ), a borrower who enters military service after the origination of such
borrowerâs mortgage loan (including a borrower who was in reserve status and is called to active duty after origination of
the mortgage loan), upon notification by such borrower, will not be charged interest, including fees and charges, in excess
of 6% per annum during the period of such borrowerâs active duty status. In addition to adjusting the interest, the
lender must forgive any such interest in excess of 6% unless a court or administrative agency orders otherwise upon application
of the lender. The Relief Act applies to individuals who are members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, National Guard, Reserves,
Coast Guard and officers of the U.S. Public Health Service or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration assigned to duty
with the military. Because the Relief Act applies to individuals who enter military service (including reservists who are called
to active duty) after origination of the related mortgage loan, no information can be provided as to the number of loans with individuals
as borrowers that may be affected by the Relief Act. Application of the Relief Act would adversely affect, for an indeterminate
period of time, the ability of a master servicer or special servicer to collect full amounts of interest on certain of the mortgage
loans. Any shortfalls in interest collections resulting from the application of the Relief Act would result in a reduction of the
amounts distributable to the holders of certificates, and would not be covered by advances or, any form of credit support
provided in connection with the certificates. In addition, the Relief Act imposes limitations that would impair the ability
of a lender to foreclose on an affected mortgage loan during the borrowerâs period of active duty status, and, under certain
circumstances, during an additional three-month period thereafter.
Â 
Anti-Money
Laundering, Economic Sanctions and Bribery
Â 
Many jurisdictions have adopted wide-ranging
anti-money laundering, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, and regulations (collectively,
the âRequirementsâ). Any of the depositor, the issuing entity, the underwriters or other party to the PSA could
be requested or required to obtain certain assurances from prospective investors intending to purchase certificates and to retain
such information or to disclose information pertaining to them to governmental, regulatory or other authorities or to financial
intermediaries or engage in due diligence or take other related actions in the future. Failure to honor any request by the depositor,
the issuing entity, the underwriters or other party to the PSA to provide requested information or take such other actions as may
be necessary or advisable for the depositor, the issuing entity, the underwriters or other party to the PSA to comply with any
Requirements, related legal process or appropriate requests (whether formal or informal) may result in, among other things, a forced
sale to another investor of such investorâs certificates. In addition, it is expected that each of the depositor, the issuing
entity, the underwriters and the other parties to the PSA will comply with the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, the
Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (also
known as the âPatriot Actâ) and any other anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism, economic and trade sanctions,
and anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws, and regulations of the United States and other countries, and will disclose any information
required or requested by authorities in connection with such compliance.
Â 


477
Â 
Â 
Potential
Forfeiture of Assets
Â 
Federal law provides that assets (including
property purchased or improved with assets) derived from criminal activity or otherwise tainted, or used in the commission of certain
offenses, is subject to the blocking requirements of economic sanctions laws and regulations, and can be blocked and/or seized
and ordered forfeited to the United States of America. The offenses that can trigger such a blocking and/or seizure and forfeiture
include, among others, violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, the anti-money
laundering, anti-terrorism, economic sanctions, and anti-bribery laws and regulations, including the Patriot Act and the regulations
issued pursuant to that act, as well as the narcotic drug laws. In many instances, the United States may seize the property even
before a conviction occurs.
Â 
In the event of a forfeiture proceeding,
a lender may be able to establish its interest in the property by proving that (a)Â its mortgage was executed and recorded
before the commission of the illegal conduct from which the assets used to purchase or improve the property were derived or before
the commission of any other crime upon which the forfeiture is based, or (b)Â the lender, at the time of the execution of the
mortgage, âdid not know or was reasonably without cause to believe that the property was subject to forfeitureâ. However,
there is no assurance that such a defense will be successful.
Â 
Certain
Affiliations, Relationships and Related Transactions Involving Transaction Parties
Â 
Wells Fargo Bank and its affiliates are
playing several roles in this transaction. Wells Fargo Bank, a sponsor, originator and mortgage loan seller, is also the master
servicer, the certificate administrator, the tax administrator, the custodian and the certificate registrar under this securitization
and an affiliate of Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Securities,Â Inc., the depositor, and of Wells Fargo Securities,Â LLC,
one of the underwriters. In addition, Wells Fargo Bank is the master servicer, the certificate administrator, the custodian, the
tax administrator and the certificate registrar of the Harvey Building Products Portfolio Whole Loan under the COMM 2015-LC23 Pooling
and Servicing Agreement, which governs the servicing and administration of the Harvey Building Products Portfolio Whole Loan.
Â 
Wells Fargo Bank, Deutsche Bank AG, Cayman
Islands Branch (an affiliate of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., an underwriter) and certain other third party lenders provide warehouse
financing to the LCF Financing Affiliates through various repurchase facilities and other lending arrangements. Some or all of
the LCF Mortgage Loans are (or as of the securitization closing date may be) subject to such repurchase facilities and other lending
arrangements. If such is the case at the time the certificates are issued, then LCF will use the proceeds from its sale of the
LCF Mortgage Loans to the depositor to, among other things, acquire the financed LCF Mortgage Loans from the Financing Affiliates,
and the Financing Affiliates will, in turn, use the funds that they receive from LCF to, among other things, reacquire or otherwise
obtain the release of the warehoused LCF Mortgage Loans from the repurchase agreement counterparties or other types of lenders
free and clear of any liens. As of NovemberÂ 30, 2015, Wells Fargo Bank was the repurchase agreement counterparty with respect
to one (1) of the LCF Mortgage Loans, with a Cut-off Date Balance of $88,000,000, and Deutsche Bank AG, Cayman Islands Branch was
the repurchase agreement counterparty with respect to one (1) LCF Mortgage Loan, with a Cut-off Date Principal Balance of $32,922,772,
although such circumstances may change prior to the closing of this securitization transaction. The certificate administrator is
the interim custodian of the loan documents with respect to all of the LCF Mortgage Loans other than
Â

Â 
Yield
and Maturity Considerations
Â 
Yield Considerations
Â 
General
Â 
The yield to maturity on the Offered Certificates
will depend upon the price paid by the investors, the rate and timing of the distributions in reduction of the Certificate Balance
or Notional Amount of the applicable class of Offered Certificates, the extent to which Yield Maintenance Charges and Prepayment
Premiums allocated to the class of Offered Certificates are collected, and the rate, timing and severity of losses on the Mortgage
Loans and the extent to which such losses are allocable in reduction of the Certificate Balance or Notional Amount of the class
of Offered Certificates, as well as prevailing interest rates at the time of payment or loss realization.
Â 
Rate and Timing of Principal
Payments
Â 
The rate and amount of distributions in
reduction of the Certificate Balance of any class of Offered Certificates that are also Principal Balance Certificates and the
yield to maturity of any class of Offered Certificates will be directly related to the rate of payments of principal (both scheduled
and unscheduled) on the Mortgage Loans, as well as borrower defaults and the severity of losses occurring upon a default and the
resulting rate and timing of collections made in connection with liquidations of Mortgage Loans due to these defaults. Principal
payments on the Mortgage Loans will be affected by their amortization schedules, lockout periods, defeasance provisions, provisions
relating to the release and/or application of earnout reserves, provisions requiring prepayments in connection with the release
of real property collateral, requirements to pay Yield Maintenance Charges or Prepayment Premiums in connection with principal
payments, the dates on which balloon payments are due, incentives for a borrower to repay an ARD Loan by the related Anticipated
Repayment Date, property release provisions, provisions relating to the application or release of earnout reserves, and any extensions
of maturity dates by the master servicer or the special servicer. While voluntary prepayments of some Mortgage Loans are generally
prohibited during applicable prepayment lockout periods, effective prepayments may occur if a sufficiently significant portion
of a mortgaged property is lost due to casualty or condemnation. In addition, such distributions in reduction of Certificate Balances
of the

Â 


481
Â 
Â 
respective classes of Offered Certificates that are also Principal Balance Certificates may result from repurchases of,
or substitutions for, Mortgage Loans made by the sponsors due to missing or defective documentation or breaches of representations
and warranties with respect to the Mortgage Loans as described under âDescription of the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreementsâ
or purchases of the Mortgage Loans in the manner described under âPooling and Servicing AgreementâTermination; Retirement
of Certificatesâ. To the extent a Mortgage Loan requires payment of a Yield Maintenance Charge or Prepayment Premium
in connection with a voluntary prepayment, any such Yield Maintenance Charge or Prepayment Premium generally is not due in connection
with a prepayment due to casualty or condemnation, is not included in the purchase price of a Mortgage Loan purchased or repurchased
due to a breach of a representation or warranty or otherwise, and may not be enforceable or collectible upon a default.
Â 
Because the certificates with Notional
Amounts are not entitled to distributions of principal, the yield on such certificates will be extremely sensitive to prepayments
received in respect of the Mortgage Loans to the extent distributed to reduce the related Notional Amount of the applicable class
of certificates. In addition, although the borrower under an ARD Loan may have certain incentives to prepay such ARD Loan on its
Anticipated Repayment Date, we cannot assure you that the borrower will be able to prepay such ARD Loan on its related Anticipated
Repayment Date. The failure of the borrower to prepay an ARD Loan on its Anticipated Repayment Date will not be an event of default
under the terms of such ARD Loan, and pursuant to the terms of the PSA, neither the master servicer nor the special servicer will
be permitted to take any enforcement action with respect to the borrowerâs failure to pay Excess Interest until the scheduled
maturity of such ARD Loan; provided that the master servicer or the special servicer, as the case may be, may take action
to enforce the issuing entityâs right to apply excess cash flow to principal in accordance with the terms of the respective
ARD Loan documents. With respect to the ClassÂ A-SB certificates, the extent to which the planned balances are achieved and
the sensitivity of the ClassÂ A-SB certificates to principal prepayments on the mortgage loans will depend in part on the period
of time during which the ClassÂ A-1, ClassÂ A-2A, ClassÂ A-2B, ClassÂ A-3 and ClassÂ A-4 certificates remain
outstanding. As such, the ClassÂ A-SB certificates will become more sensitive to the rate of prepayments on the mortgage loans
than they were when the ClassÂ A-1, ClassÂ A-2A, ClassÂ A-2B, ClassÂ A-3 and ClassÂ A-4 certificates were outstanding.
Â 
The extent to which the yield to maturity
of any class of Offered Certificates may vary from the anticipated yield will depend upon the degree to which the certificates
are purchased at a discount or premium and when, and to what degree, payments of principal on the Mortgage Loans are in turn distributed
on the certificates or, in the case of the ClassÂ X-A or ClassÂ X-B certificates with a Notional Amount, applied to reduce
their Notional Amounts. An investor should consider, in the case of any certificate (other than a certificate with a Notional Amount)
purchased at a discount, the risk that a slower than anticipated rate of principal payments on the Mortgage Loans could result
in an actual yield to such investor that is lower than the anticipated yield and, in the case of any certificate purchased at a
premium (including certificates with Notional Amounts), the risk that a faster than anticipated rate of principal payments could
result in an actual yield to such investor that is lower than the anticipated yield. In general, the earlier a payment of principal
on the Mortgage Loans is distributed or otherwise results in reduction of the Certificate Balance of a certificate purchased at
a discount or premium, the greater will be the effect on an investorâs yield to maturity. As a result, the effect on an investorâs
yield of principal payments distributed on an investorâs certificates occurring at a rate higher (or lower) than the rate
anticipated by the investor during any particular period would not be fully offset by a subsequent like reduction (or increase)
in the rate of principal payments.
Â 

482
Â 
Â 
The yield on each of the classes of
certificates that have a Pass-Through Rate equal to, limited by, or based on, the WAC Rate could (or in the case of any class
of certificates with a Pass-Through Rate equal to, or based on, the WAC Rate, would) be adversely affected if Mortgage Loans
with higher Mortgage Rates prepay faster than Mortgage Loans with lower Mortgage Rates. The Pass-Through Rates on these
classes of certificates may be adversely affected by a decrease in the WAC Rate even if principal prepayments do not
occur.
Â 
Losses and Shortfalls
Â 
The Certificate Balance or Notional Amount
of any class of Offered Certificates may be reduced without distributions of principal as a result of the occurrence and allocation
of Realized Losses, reducing the maximum amount distributable in respect of principal on the Offered Certificates that are Principal
Balance Certificates as well as the amount of interest that would have otherwise been payable on the Offered Certificates in the
absence of such reduction. In general, a Realized Loss occurs when the principal balance of a Mortgage Loan is reduced without
an equal distribution to applicable Certificateholders in reduction of the Certificate Balances of the certificates. Realized
Losses may occur in connection with a default on a Mortgage Loan, acceptance of a discounted pay-off, the liquidation of the related
Mortgaged Properties, a reduction in the principal balance of a Mortgage Loan by a bankruptcy court or pursuant to a modification,
a recovery by the master servicer or trustee of a Nonrecoverable Advance on a Distribution Date or the incurrence of certain unanticipated
or default-related costs and expenses (such as interest on Advances, Workout Fees, Liquidation Fees and Special Servicing Fees).
Any reduction of the Certificate Balances of the classes of certificates indicated in the table below as a result of the application
of Realized Losses will also reduce the Notional Amount of the related certificates.

Certificateholders are not entitled to
receive distributions of Periodic Payments when due except to the extent they are either covered by a P&I Advance or actually
received. Consequently, any defaulted Periodic Payment for which no such P&I Advance is made will tend to extend the weighted
average lives of the Offered Certificates, whether or not a permitted extension of the due date of the related Mortgage Loan has
been completed.
Â 
Certain Relevant Factors
Affecting Loan Payments and Defaults
Â 
The rate and timing of principal payments
and defaults and the severity of losses on the Mortgage Loans may be affected by a number of factors, including, without limitation,
the availability of credit for commercial or multifamily real estate, prevailing interest rates, the terms of the Mortgage Loans
(for example, due-on-sale clauses, lockout periods or Yield Maintenance Charges, release of property provisions, amortization terms
that require balloon payments and incentives for a borrower to repay its mortgage loan by an anticipated repayment date), the demographics
and relative economic vitality of the areas in which the Mortgaged Properties are located and the general supply and demand for
rental properties in those areas, the quality of management of the Mortgaged Properties, the servicing of the Mortgage Loans, possible
changes in tax laws and other opportunities for investment. See âRisk Factorsâ and âDescription of
the Mortgage Poolâ.
Â 


483
Â 
Â 
The rate of prepayment on the pool of
Mortgage Loans is likely to be affected by prevailing market interest rates for Mortgage Loans of a comparable type, term and
risk level as the Mortgage Loans. When the prevailing market interest rate is below a mortgage interest rate, a borrower may
have an increased incentive to refinance its Mortgage Loan. Although the Mortgage Loans contain provisions designed to
mitigate the likelihood of an early loan repayment, we cannot assure you that the related borrowers will refrain from
prepaying their Mortgage Loans due to the existence of these provisions, or that involuntary prepayments will not occur. See
âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâCertain Terms of the Mortgage Loansâ.
Â 
With respect to certain Mortgage Loans,
the related Mortgage Loan documents allow for the sale of individual properties and the severance of the related debt and the assumption
by the transferee of such portion of the Mortgage Loan as-is allocable to the individual property acquired by that transferee,
subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. In addition, with respect to certain Mortgage Loans, the related Mortgage Loan
documents allow for partial releases of individual Mortgaged Properties during a lockout period or during such time as a Yield
Maintenance Charge would otherwise be payable, which could result in a prepayment of a portion of the initial principal balance
of the related Mortgage Loan without payment of a Yield Maintenance Charge or Prepayment Premium. Additionally, in the case of
a partial release of an individual Mortgaged Property, the related release amount in many cases is greater than the allocated loan
amount for the Mortgaged Property being released, which would result in a greater than proportionate paydown of the Mortgage Loan.
See âDescription of the Mortgage PoolâCertain Terms of the Mortgage LoansâPartial Releasesâ.
Â 
Depending on prevailing market interest
rates, the outlook for market interest rates and economic conditions generally, some borrowers may sell Mortgaged Properties in
order to realize their equity in the Mortgaged Property, to meet cash flow needs or to make other investments. In addition, some
borrowers may be motivated by federal and state tax laws (which are subject to change) to sell Mortgaged Properties prior to the
exhaustion of tax depreciation benefits.
Â 
We make no representation as to the particular
factors that will affect the rate and timing of prepayments and defaults on the Mortgage Loans, as to the relative importance of
those factors, as to the percentage of the principal balance of the Mortgage Loans that will be prepaid or as to which a default
will have occurred as of any date or as to the overall rate of prepayment or default on the Mortgage Loans.
Â 
Delay in Payment of Distributions
Â 
Because each monthly distribution is made
on each Distribution Date, which is at least 15 days after the end of the related Interest Accrual Period for the certificates,
the effective yield to the holders of such certificates will be lower than the yield that would otherwise be produced by the applicable
Pass-Through Rates and purchase prices (assuming the prices did not account for the delay).
Â 
Yield on the Certificates
with Notional Amounts
Â 
The yield to maturity of the certificates
with Notional Amounts will be highly sensitive to the rate and timing of reductions made to the Certificate Balances of the classes
of certificates indicated in the table below, including by reason of prepayments and principal losses on the Mortgage Loans and
other factors described above.

Â 
Any optional termination by the holders
of the Controlling Class, the special servicer, the master servicer or the holders of the ClassÂ R certificates would result
in prepayment in full of the Offered Certificates and would have an adverse effect on the yield of a class of the certificates
with Notional Amounts because a termination would have an effect similar to a principal prepayment in full of the Mortgage Loans
and, as a result, investors in these certificates and any other Offered Certificates purchased at premium might not fully recoup
their initial investment. See âPooling and Servicing AgreementâTermination; Retirement of Certificatesâ.
Â 
Investors in the certificates with Notional
Amounts should fully consider the associated risks, including the risk that an extremely rapid rate of prepayment or other liquidation
of the Mortgage Loans could result in the failure of such investors to recoup fully their initial investments.
Â 
Weighted Average
Life
Â 
The weighted average life of a Principal
Balance Certificate refers to the average amount of time that will elapse from the date of its issuance until each dollar to be
applied in reduction of the aggregate certificate balance of those certificates is paid to the related investor. The weighted average
life of a Principal Balance Certificate will be influenced by, among other things, the rate at which principal on the Mortgage
Loans is paid or otherwise received, which may be in the form of scheduled amortization, voluntary prepayments, Insurance and Condemnation
Proceeds and Liquidation Proceeds. Distributions among the various classes of certificates will be made as set forth under âDescription
of the CertificatesâDistributionsâPriority of Distributionsâ.
Â 
Prepayments
on Mortgage Loans may be measured by a prepayment standard or model. The âConstant Prepayment Rateâ or âCPRâ
model represents an assumed constant annual rate of prepayment each month, expressed as a per annum percentage of the then-scheduled
principal balance of the pool of Mortgage Loans. The âCPYâ model represents an assumed CPR prepayment rate
after any applicable lockout period, any applicable period in which defeasance is permitted and any applicable yield maintenance
period. The depositor also may utilize the âCPPâ model, which represents an assumed CPR prepayment rate after
any applicable lockout period, any applicable period in which defeasance is permitted, any applicable yield maintenance period
and after any fixed penalty period. The model used in this prospectus is the CPP model. As used in each of the following tables,
the column headed â0% CPPâ assumes that none of the Mortgage Loans is prepaid before its maturity date or Anticipated
Repayment Date, as the case may be. The columns headed â25% CPPâ, â50% CPPâ, â75% CPPâ and
â100% CPPâ assume that prepayments on the Mortgage Loans are made at those levels of CPP. We cannot assure you, however,
that prepayments of the Mortgage Loans will conform to any level of CPP, and we make no representation that the Mortgage Loans
will prepay at the levels of CPP shown or at any other prepayment rate.

The following tables indicate the percentage
of the initial Certificate Balance of each class of the Principal Balance Certificates that would be outstanding after each of
the dates shown at various CPPs and the corresponding weighted average life of each class of Offered Certificates. The tables have
been prepared on the basis of the following assumptions (the âStructuring Assumptionsâ), among others:
Â 

âexcept as otherwise set forth below, the Mortgage Loans have the characteristics set forth on AnnexÂ A-1 to this prospectus
and the aggregate Cut-off Date Balance of the Mortgage Loans is as described in this prospectus;
Â 

âthe initial aggregate certificate balance or notional amount, as the case may be, of each interest-bearing class of certificates
is as described in this prospectus;
Â 

âthe pass-through rate for each interest-bearing class of certificates is as described in this prospectus;
Â 

âno delinquencies, defaults or losses occur with respect to any of the Mortgage Loans;
Â 

âno additional trust fund expenses (including Operating Advisor Expenses) arise, no Servicing Advances are made under the PSA
and the only expenses of the issuing entity consist of the Certificate Administrator/Trustee Fees, the Servicing Fees, the CREFCÂ®
Intellectual Property Royalty License Fees, the Asset Representations Reviewer Fees and the Operating Advisor fees, each as set
forth on AnnexÂ A-1 to this prospectus;
Â 

âthere are no modifications, extensions, waivers or amendments affecting the monthly debt service payments by borrowers on the
Mortgage Loans;
Â 

âeach of the Mortgage Loans provides for monthly debt service payments to be due on the first day of each month, regardless
of the actual day of the month on which those payments are otherwise due and regardless of whether the subject date is a business
day or not;
Â 

âall monthly debt service or balloon payments on the Mortgage Loans are timely received by a master servicer on behalf of the
issuing entity on the day on which they are assumed to be due or paid as described in the immediately preceding bullet;
Â 

âeach ARD Loan in the trust fund is paid in full on its Anticipated Repayment Date;
Â 

âno involuntary prepayments are received as to any Mortgage Loan at any time (including, without limitation, as a result of
any application of escrows, reserve or holdback amounts if performance criteria are not satisfied);
Â 

âexcept as described in the next two succeeding bullets, no voluntary prepayments are received as to any Mortgage Loan during
that Mortgage Loanâs prepayment lockout period, any period when defeasance is permitted, or during any period when principal
prepayments on that Mortgage Loan are required to be accompanied by a Prepayment Premium or Yield Maintenance Charge;
Â 

âexcept as otherwise assumed in the immediately preceding two bullets, prepayments are made on each of the Mortgage Loans at
the indicated CPPs set forth in the subject
  tables or other relevant part of this prospectus, without regard to any limitations in
  those Mortgage Loans on partial voluntary principal prepayments;
Â 


486
Â 

Â 

â
all
  prepayments on the Mortgage Loans are assumed to be accompanied by a full monthâs
  interest and no Prepayment Interest Shortfalls occur;
Â 

â
no
  Yield Maintenance Charges or Prepayment Premiums are collected;
Â 

â
no
  person or entity entitled thereto exercises its right of optional termination as described
  in this prospectus;
Â 

â
no
  Mortgage Loan is required to be repurchased;
Â 

â
distributions
  on the Offered Certificates are made on the 15thÂ day of each month, commencing in
  January 2016; and
Â 

â
the
  Offered Certificates are settled with investors on DecemberÂ 23, 2015.
Â 
To
the extent that the Mortgage Loans have characteristics that differ from those assumed in preparing the tables set forth below,
a class of Principal Balance Certificates may mature earlier or later than indicated by the tables. The tables set forth below
are for illustrative purposes only and it is highly unlikely that the Mortgage Loans will actually prepay at any constant rate
until maturity or that all the Mortgage Loans will prepay at the same rate. In addition, variations in the actual prepayment experience
and the balance of the Mortgage Loans that prepay may increase or decrease the percentages of initial Certificate Balances (and
weighted average lives) shown in the following tables. These variations may occur even if the average prepayment experience of
the Mortgage Loans were to equal any of the specified CPP percentages. Investors should not rely on the prepayment assumptions
set forth in this prospectus and are urged to conduct their own analyses of the rates at which the Mortgage Loans may be expected
to prepay, based on their own assumptions. Based on the foregoing assumptions, the following tables indicate the resulting weighted
average lives of each class of Offered Certificates and set forth the percentage of the initial Certificate Balance of the class
of the certificate that would be outstanding after each of the dates shown at the indicated CPPs.

Pre-Tax
Yield to Maturity Tables
Â 
The
following tables indicate the approximate pre-tax yield to maturity on a corporate bond equivalent basis on the Offered Certificates
for the specified CPPs based on the assumptions set forth under ââWeighted Average Lifeâ above. It was
further assumed that the purchase price of the Offered Certificates is as specified in the tables below, expressed as a percentage
of the initial Certificate Balance or Notional Amount, as applicable, plus accrued interest from DecemberÂ 1, 2015 to the
Closing Date.
Â 
The
yields set forth in the following tables were calculated by determining the monthly discount rates that, when applied to the assumed
streams of cash flows to be paid on the applicable class of Offered Certificates, would cause the discounted present value of
such assumed stream of cash flows to equal the assumed purchase price of such class plus accrued interest, and by converting such
monthly rates to semi-annual corporate bond equivalent rates. Such calculations do not take into account shortfalls in collection
of interest due to prepayments (or other liquidations) of the Mortgage Loans or the interest rates at which investors may be able
to reinvest funds received by them as distributions on the applicable class of certificates (and, accordingly, do not purport
to reflect the return on any investment in the applicable class of Offered Certificates when such reinvestment rates are considered).
Â 
The
characteristics of the Mortgage Loans may differ from those assumed in preparing the tables below. In addition, we cannot assure
you that the Mortgage Loans will prepay in accordance with the above assumptions at any of the rates shown in the tables or at
any other particular rate, that the cash flows on the applicable class of Offered Certificates will correspond to the cash flows
shown in this prospectus or that the aggregate purchase price of such class of Offered Certificates will be as assumed. In addition,
it is unlikely that the Mortgage Loans will prepay in accordance with the above assumptions at any of the specified CPPs until
maturity or that all the Mortgage Loans will so prepay at the same rate. Timing of changes in the rate of prepayments may significantly
affect the actual yield to maturity to investors, even if the average rate of principal prepayments is consistent with the expectations
of investors. Investors must make their own decisions as to the appropriate prepayment assumption to be used in deciding whether
to purchase any class of Offered Certificates.
Â

Â 
Â 
For
purposes of this prospectus, prepayment assumptions with respect to the Mortgage Loans are presented in terms of the CPP model
described under ââWeighted Average Lifeâ above.

Material
Federal Income Tax Considerations
Â 
General
Â 
The
following is a general discussion of the anticipated material federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition
of the certificates. The discussion below does not purport to address all federal income tax consequences that may be applicable
to particular categories of investors (such as banks, insurance companies, securities dealers, foreign persons, investors whose
functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, and investors that hold the certificates as part of a âstraddleâ or âconversion
transactionâ), some of which may be subject to special rules. The authorities on which this discussion is based are subject
to change or differing interpretations, and any such change or interpretation could apply retroactively. This discussion reflects
the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the âCodeâ), as well as regulations
(the âREMIC Regulationsâ) promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the IRS. Investors are encouraged
to consult their tax advisors in determining the federal, state, local or any other tax consequences to them of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the certificates.
Â 
Two
separate real estate mortgage investment conduit (âREMICâ) elections will be made with respect to designated
portions of the issuing entity (the âLower-Tier REMICâ and the âUpper-Tier REMICâ, and,
together, the âTrust REMICsâ). The Lower-Tier REMIC will hold the Mortgage Loans (excluding Excess Interest)
and certain other assets and will issue (i)Â one or more classes of regular interests (the âLower-Tier Regular Interestsâ)
to the Upper-Tier REMIC and (ii)Â an uncertificated interest represented by the ClassÂ R certificates as the sole class
of âresidual interestsâ in the Lower-Tier REMIC.
Â 
The
Upper-Tier REMIC will hold the Lower-Tier Regular Interests and will issue (i)Â the ClassÂ A-1, ClassÂ A-2A, ClassÂ A-2B,
ClassÂ A-3, ClassÂ A-4, ClassÂ A-SB, ClassÂ X-A, ClassÂ X-B, ClassÂ X-D, ClassÂ A-S, ClassÂ B,
ClassÂ C, ClassÂ D, ClassÂ E, ClassÂ F and ClassÂ G certificates (the âRegular Interestsâ),
each representing a regular interest in the Upper-Tier REMIC and (ii)Â an uncertificated interest represented by the ClassÂ R
certificates as the sole class of âresidual interestsâ in the Upper-Tier REMIC.
Â 
Qualification
as a REMIC requires ongoing compliance with certain conditions. Assuming (i)Â the making of appropriate elections, (ii)Â compliance
with the PSA and any other governing documents, (iii)Â compliance with the provisions of any Non-Serviced PSA and any amendments
thereto and the continued qualification of the REMICs formed under any Non-Serviced PSA and (iv)Â compliance with any changes
in the law, including any amendments to the Code or applicable Treasury regulations thereunder, in the opinion of Cadwalader,
Wickersham & Taft LLP, special tax counsel to the depositor, (a)Â each Trust REMIC will qualify as a REMIC on the Closing
Date and thereafter, (b)Â each of the Lower-Tier Regular Interests will constitute a âregular interestâ in the
Lower-Tier REMIC, (c)Â each of the Regular Interests will constitute a âregular interestâ in the Upper-Tier REMIC
and (d)Â the ClassÂ R certificates will evidence the sole class of âresidual interestsâ in each Trust REMIC.
Â 
In
addition, in the opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP, special tax counsel to the depositor, the Excess Interest and
the related distribution account will be treated as a grantor trust (the âGrantor Trustâ) for federal income
tax purposes under subpart E, part I of subchapter J of the Code. Accordingly, the ClassÂ V certificates will represent undivided
beneficial interests in the Grantor Trust.
Â Â 


495
Â 

Â 
Qualification
as a REMIC
Â 
In
order for each Trust REMIC to qualify as a REMIC, there must be ongoing compliance on the part of such Trust REMIC with the requirements
set forth in the Code. Each Trust REMIC must fulfill an asset test, which requires that no more than a de minimis portion
of the assets of such Trust REMIC, as of the close of the third calendar month beginning after the Closing Date (which for purposes
of this discussion is the date of the issuance of the Regular Interests, the âStartup Dayâ) and at all times
thereafter, may consist of assets other than âqualified mortgagesâ and âpermitted investmentsâ. The REMIC
Regulations provide a safe harbor pursuant to which the de minimis requirements will be met if at all times the aggregate
adjusted basis of the nonqualified assets is less than 1% of the aggregate adjusted basis of all such Trust REMICâs assets.
Each Trust REMIC also must provide âreasonable arrangementsâ to prevent its residual interest from being held by âdisqualified
organizationsâ or their agents and must furnish applicable tax information to transferors or agents that violate this restriction.
The PSA will provide that no legal or beneficial interest in the ClassÂ R certificates may be transferred or registered unless
certain conditions, designed to prevent violation of this restriction, are met. Consequently, it is expected that each Trust REMIC
will qualify as a REMIC at all times that any of its regular interests are outstanding.
Â 
A
qualified mortgage is any obligation that is principally secured by an interest in real property and that is either transferred
to a REMIC on the Startup Day or is purchased by a REMIC within a 3Â month period thereafter pursuant to a fixed price contract
in effect on the Startup Day. Qualified mortgages include (i)Â whole mortgage loans or split-note interests in such mortgage
loans, such as the Mortgage Loans; provided that, in general, (a)Â the fair market value of the real property security
(including buildings and structural components of the real property security) (reduced by (1)Â the amount of any lien on the
real property security that is senior to the Mortgage Loan and (2)Â a proportionate amount of any lien on the real property
security that is in parity with the Mortgage Loan) is at least 80% of the aggregate principal balance of such Mortgage Loan either
at origination or as of the Startup Day (a loan-to-value ratio of not more than 125% with respect to the real property security)
or (b)Â substantially all the proceeds of the Mortgage Loan or the underlying mortgages were used to acquire, improve or protect
an interest in real property that, at the date of origination, was the only security for the Mortgage Loan, and (ii)Â regular
interests in another REMIC, such as the Lower-Tier Regular Interests that will be held by the Upper-Tier REMIC. If a Mortgage
Loan was not in fact principally secured by real property or is otherwise not a qualified mortgage, it must be disposed of within
90 days of discovery of such defect, or otherwise ceases to be a qualified mortgage after such 90-day period.
Â 
Permitted
investments include âcash flow investmentsâ, âqualified reserve assetsâ and âforeclosure propertyâ.
A cash flow investment is an investment, earning a return in the nature of interest, of amounts received on or with respect to
qualified mortgages for a temporary period, not exceeding 13 months, until the next scheduled distribution to holders of interests
in the REMIC. A qualified reserve asset is any intangible property held for investment that is part of any reasonably required
reserve maintained by the REMIC to provide for payments of expenses of the REMIC or amounts due on its regular or residual interests
in the event of defaults (including delinquencies) on the qualified mortgages, lower than expected reinvestment returns, Prepayment
Interest Shortfalls and certain other contingencies. The Trust REMICs will not hold any qualified reserve assets. Foreclosure
property is real property acquired by a REMIC in connection with the default or imminent default of a qualified mortgage and maintained
by the REMIC in compliance with applicable rules and personal property that is incidental to such real property; provided
that the mortgage loan sellers had no knowledge or reason to know, as of the Startup Day, that such 
Â 

496
Â 
Â 
a default had occurred or
would occur. Foreclosure property may generally not be held after the close of the third calendar year beginning after the date
the issuing entity acquires such property, with one extension that may be granted by the IRS.
Â 
A
mortgage loan held by a REMIC will fail to be a qualified mortgage if it is âsignificantly modifiedâ unless default
is âreasonably foreseeableâ or where the servicer believes there is a âsignificant risk of defaultâ upon
maturity of the mortgage loan or at an earlier date, and that by making such modification the risk of default is substantially
reduced. A mortgage loan held by a REMIC will not be considered to have been âsignificantly modifiedâ following the
release of the lien on a portion of the real property collateral if (a)Â the release is pursuant to a defeasance permitted
under the mortgage loan documents that occurs more than two years after the startup day of the REMIC or (b)Â following the
release the loan-to-value ratio for the mortgage loan is not more than 125% with respect to the real property security. Furthermore,
if the release is not pursuant to a defeasance and following the release the loan-to-value ratio for the mortgage loan is greater
than 125%, the mortgage loan will continue to be a qualified mortgage if the release is part of a âqualified paydown transactionâ
in accordance with Revenue Procedure 2010-30.
Â 
In
addition to the foregoing requirements, the various interests in a REMIC also must meet certain requirements. All of the interests
in a REMIC must be either of the following: (i)Â one or more classes of regular interests or (ii)Â a single class of residual
interests on which distributions, if any, are made pro rata. A regular interest is an interest in a REMIC that is issued
on the Startup Day with fixed terms, is designated as a regular interest, and unconditionally entitles the holder to receive a
specified principal amount (or other similar amount), and provides that interest payments (or other similar amounts), if any,
at or before maturity either are payable based on a fixed rate or a qualified variable rate, or consist of a specified, nonvarying
portion of the interest payments on the qualified mortgages. The rate on the specified portion may be a fixed rate, a variable
rate, or the difference between one fixed or qualified variable rate and another fixed or qualified variable rate. The specified
principal amount of a regular interest that provides for interest payments consisting of a specified, nonvarying portion of interest
payments on qualified mortgages may be zero. An interest in a REMIC may be treated as a regular interest even if payments of principal
with respect to such interest are subordinated to payments on other regular interests or the residual interest in the REMIC, and
are dependent on the absence of defaults or delinquencies on qualified mortgages or permitted investments, lower than reasonably
expected returns on permitted investments, expenses incurred by the REMIC or Prepayment Interest Shortfalls. A residual interest
is an interest in a REMIC other than a regular interest that is issued on the Startup Day that is designated as a residual interest.
Accordingly, each of the Lower-Tier Regular Interests will constitute a class of regular interests in the Lower-Tier REMIC, each
class of the Regular Interests will constitute a class of regular interests in the Upper-Tier REMIC, and the ClassÂ R certificates
will represent the sole class of residual interests in each Trust REMIC.
Â 
If
an entity fails to comply with one or more of the ongoing requirements of the Code for status as a REMIC during any taxable year,
the Code provides that the entity or applicable portion of it will not be treated as a REMIC for such year and thereafter. In
this event, any entity with debt obligations with two or more maturities, such as the Trust REMICs, may be treated as a separate
association taxable as a corporation under Treasury regulations, and the certificates may be treated as equity interests in such
an association. The Code, however, authorizes the Treasury Department to issue regulations that address situations where failure
to meet one or more of the requirements for REMIC status occurs inadvertently and in good faith. Investors should be aware, however,
that the Conference Committee Report to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (the â1986 Actâ) indicates that the relief
Â 


497
Â 
Â 
may be accompanied by sanctions, such as the imposition of a corporate tax on all or a portion of a REMICâs income for the
period of time in which the requirements for REMIC status are not satisfied.
Â 
Status
of Offered Certificates
Â 
Offered
Certificates held by a real estate investment trust will constitute âreal estate assetsâ within the meaning of Code
SectionÂ 856(c)(5)(B), and interest (including original issue discount) on the Offered Certificates will be considered âinterest
on obligations secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real propertyâ within the meaning of Code SectionÂ 856(c)(3)(B)
in the same proportion that, for both purposes, the assets of the issuing entity would be so treated. If at all times 95% or more
of the assets of the issuing entity qualify for each of the foregoing treatments, the Offered Certificates will qualify for the
corresponding status in their entirety. For the purposes of the foregoing determinations, the Trust REMICs will be treated as
a single REMIC. For purposes of Code SectionÂ 856(c)(5)(B), payments of principal and interest on the Mortgage Loans that
are reinvested pending distribution to holders of Offered Certificates qualify for such treatment. Offered Certificates held by
a domestic building and loan association will be treated as âloansÂ .Â .Â . secured by an interest in real property
which isÂ .Â .Â . residential real propertyâ within the meaning of Code SectionÂ 7701(a)(19)(C)(v) or as
other assets described in Code SectionÂ 7701(a)(19)(C) only to the extent the Mortgage Loans are secured by residential real
property. As of the Cut-off Date, 9 of the Mortgaged Properties securing 9 Mortgage Loans representing 19.1% of the Initial Pool
Balance, are multifamily properties. Holders of Offered Certificates should consult their tax advisors whether the foregoing percentage
or some other percentage applies to their Offered Certificates. In addition, Mortgage Loans that have been defeased with government
securities will not qualify for such treatment. Offered Certificates will be âqualified mortgagesâ within the meaning
of Code SectionÂ 860G(a)(3) for another REMIC if transferred to that REMIC within a prescribed time period in exchange for
regular or residual interests in that REMIC. Moreover, Offered Certificates held by certain financial institutions will constitute
an âevidence of indebtednessâ within the meaning of Code SectionÂ 582(c)(1).
Â 
Taxation
of Regular Interests
Â 
General
Â 
Each
class of Regular Interests (whether held directly or indirectly) represents one or more regular interests in the Upper-Tier REMIC.
The Regular Interests will represent newly originated debt instruments for federal income tax purposes. In general, interest,
original issue discount and market discount on a Regular Interest will be treated as ordinary income to the holder of a Regular
Interest (a âRegular Interestholderâ), and principal payments on a Regular Interest will be treated as a return
of capital to the extent of the Regular Interestholderâs basis in the Regular Interest. Regular Interestholders must use
the accrual method of accounting with regard to the Regular Interests, regardless of the method of accounting otherwise used by
such Regular Interestholders.
Â 
Original
Issue Discount
Â 
Holders
of Regular Interests issued with original issue discount generally must include original issue discount in ordinary income for
federal income tax purposes as it accrues in accordance with the constant yield method, which takes into account the compounding
of interest, in advance of receipt of the cash attributable to such income. The following discussion is based in part on temporary
and final Treasury regulations (the âOID 
Â 

498
Â 
Â 
Regulationsâ) under Code SectionsÂ 1271 through 1273 and 1275
and in part on the provisions of the 1986 Act. Regular Interestholders should be aware, however, that the OID Regulations do not
adequately address certain issues relevant to prepayable securities, such as the Regular Interests. To the extent such issues
are not addressed in the OID Regulations, the certificate administrator will apply the methodology described in the Conference
Committee Report to the 1986 Act. No assurance can be provided that the IRS will not take a different position as to those matters
not currently addressed by the OID Regulations. Moreover, the OID Regulations include an anti-abuse rule allowing the IRS to apply
or depart from the OID Regulations if necessary or appropriate to ensure a reasonable tax result in light of the applicable statutory
provisions. A tax result will not be considered unreasonable under the anti-abuse rule, however, in the absence of a substantial
effect on the present value of a taxpayerâs tax liability. Investors are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to
the discussion in this prospectus and the appropriate method for reporting interest and original issue discount with respect to
the Regular Interests.
Â 
Each
Regular Interest will be treated as an installment obligation for purposes of determining the original issue discount includible
in a Regular Interestholderâs income. The total amount of original issue discount on a Regular Interest is the excess of
the âstated redemption price at maturityâ of the Regular Interest over its âissue priceâ. The issue price
of a class of Regular Interests is the first price at which a substantial amount of Regular Interests of such class is sold to
investors (excluding bond houses, brokers and underwriters). Although unclear under the OID Regulations, the certificate administrator
will treat the issue price of Regular Interests for which there is no substantial sale as of the issue date as the fair market
value of such Regular Interests as of the issue date. The issue price of the Regular Interests also includes the amount paid by
an initial Regular Interestholder for accrued interest that relates to a period prior to the issue date of such class of Regular
Interests. The stated redemption price at maturity of a Regular Interest is the sum of all payments provided by the debt instrument
other than any qualified stated interest payments. Under the OID Regulations, qualified stated interest generally means interest
payable at a single fixed rate or a qualified variable rate; provided that such interest payments are unconditionally payable
at intervals of one year or less during the entire term of the obligation. Because there is no penalty or default remedy in the
case of nonpayment of interest with respect to a Regular Interest, it is possible that no interest on any class of Regular Interests
will be treated as qualified stated interest. However, because the Mortgage Loans provide for remedies in the event of default,
the certificate administrator will treat all payments of stated interest on the Regular Interests (other than the ClassÂ X
Certificates) as qualified stated interest (other than accrued interest distributed on the first Distribution Date for the number
of days that exceed the interval between the Closing Date and the first Distribution Date). 
Â 
It
is anticipated that the certificate administrator will treat the ClassÂ X-A and ClassÂ X-B certificates as having no qualified
stated interest. Accordingly, such classes will be considered to be issued with original issue discount in an amount equal to
the excess of all distributions of interest expected to be received on such classes over their respective issue prices (including
interest accrued prior to the Closing Date). Any ânegativeâ amounts of original issue discount on such classes attributable
to rapid prepayments with respect to the Mortgage Loans will not be deductible currently. The holder of a ClassÂ X-A or ClassÂ X-B
certificate may be entitled to a deduction for a loss, which may be a capital loss, to the extent it becomes certain that such
holder will not recover a portion of its basis in such class, assuming no further prepayments. In the alternative, it is possible
that rules similar to the ânoncontingent bond methodâ of the contingent interest rules of the OID Regulations may
be promulgated with respect to such classes. Unless and until required otherwise by applicable authority, it is not anticipated
that the contingent interest rules will apply.
Â 


499
Â 
Â Â 
Under
a de minimis rule, original issue discount on a Regular Interest will be considered to be zero if such original issue discount
is less than 0.25% of the stated redemption price at maturity of the Regular Interest multiplied by the weighted average maturity
of the Regular Interest. For this purpose, the weighted average maturity of the Regular Interest is computed as the sum of the
amounts determined by multiplying the number of full years (i.e., rounding down partial years) from the issue date until
each distribution in reduction of stated redemption price at maturity is scheduled to be made by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the amount of each distribution included in the stated redemption price at maturity of the Regular Interest and the denominator
of which is the stated redemption price at maturity or anticipated repayment date of the Regular Interest. The Conference Committee
Report to the 1986 Act provides that the schedule of such distributions should be determined in accordance with the assumed rate
of prepayment on the Mortgage Loans used in pricing the transaction; provided that it is assumed that any ARD Loan prepays
on its anticipated repayment date (the âPrepayment Assumptionâ). See âYield and Maturity ConsiderationsâWeighted
Average Lifeâ above. Holders generally must report de minimis original issue discount pro rata as principal
payments are received, and such income will be capital gain if the Regular Interest is held as a capital asset. Under the OID
Regulations, however, Regular Interestholders may elect to accrue all de minimis original issue discount, as well as market
discount and premium, under the constant yield method. See ââElection To Treat All Interest Under the Constant
Yield Methodâ below. Based on the foregoing, it is anticipated that the Class C certificates
will be issued with de minimis original issue discount for federal income tax purposes.
Â 
A
holder of a Regular Interest issued with original issue discount generally must include in gross income for any taxable year the
sum of the âdaily portionsâ, as defined below, of the original issue discount on the Regular Interest accrued during
an accrual period for each day on which it holds the Regular Interest, including the date of purchase but excluding the date of
disposition. With respect to each such Regular Interest, a calculation will be made of the original issue discount that accrues
during each successive full accrual period that ends on the day prior to each Distribution Date with respect to the Regular Interests,
assuming that prepayments and extensions with respect to the Mortgage Loans will be made in accordance with the Prepayment Assumption.
The original issue discount accruing in a full accrual period will be the excess, if any, of (i)Â the sum of (a)Â the
present value of all of the remaining distributions to be made on the Regular Interest as of the end of that accrual period and
(b)Â the distributions made on the Regular Interest during the accrual period that are included in the Regular Interestâs
stated redemption price at maturity, over (ii)Â the adjusted issue price of the Regular Interest at the beginning of the accrual
period. The present value of the remaining distributions referred to in the preceding sentence is calculated based on (i)Â the
yield to maturity of the Regular Interest as of the Startup Day, (ii)Â events (including actual prepayments) that have occurred
prior to the end of the accrual period and (iii)Â the assumption that the remaining payments will be made in accordance with
the original Prepayment Assumption. For these purposes, the adjusted issue price of a Regular Interest at the beginning of any
accrual period equals the issue price of the Regular Interest, increased by the aggregate amount of original issue discount with
respect to the Regular Interest that accrued in all prior accrual periods and reduced by the amount of distributions included
in the Regular Interestâs stated redemption price at maturity that were made on the Regular Interest that were attributable
to such prior periods. The original issue discount accruing during any accrual period (as determined in this paragraph) will then
be divided by the number of days in the period to determine the daily portion of original issue discount for each day in the period.
Â 
Under
the method described above, the daily portions of original issue discount required to be included as ordinary income by a Regular
Interestholder (other than a holder of a
Â 

500
Â 
Â Â 
ClassÂ X-A or ClassÂ X-B certificate) generally will increase to take into account
prepayments on the Regular Interests as a result of prepayments on the Mortgage Loans that exceed the Prepayment Assumption, and
generally will decrease (but not below zero for any period) if the prepayments are slower than the Prepayment Assumption. Due
to the unique nature of interest-only certificates, the preceding sentence may not apply in the case of the ClassÂ X-A or
ClassÂ X-B certificates.
Â 
Acquisition
Premium
Â 
A
purchaser of a Regular Interest at a price greater than its adjusted issue price and less than its remaining stated redemption
price at maturity will be required to include in gross income the daily portions of the original issue discount on the Regular
Interest reduced pro rata by a fraction, the numerator of which is the excess of its purchase price over such adjusted
issue price and the denominator of which is the excess of the remaining stated redemption price at maturity over the adjusted
issue price. Alternatively, such a purchaser may elect to treat all such acquisition premium under the constant yield method,
as described under the heading ââElection To Treat All Interest Under the Constant Yield Methodâ below.
Â 
Market
Discount
Â 
A
purchaser of a Regular Interest also may be subject to the market discount rules of Code SectionsÂ 1276 through 1278. Under
these Code sections and the principles applied by the OID Regulations in the context of original issue discount, âmarket
discountâ is the amount by which the purchaserâs original basis in the Regular Interest (i)Â is exceeded by the
remaining outstanding principal payments and non-qualified stated interest payments due on the Regular Interest, or (ii)Â in
the case of a Regular Interest having original issue discount, is exceeded by the adjusted issue price of such Regular Interest
at the time of purchase. Such purchaser generally will be required to recognize ordinary income to the extent of accrued market
discount on such Regular Interest as distributions includible in its stated redemption price at maturity are received, in an amount
not exceeding any such distribution. Such market discount would accrue in a manner to be provided in Treasury regulations and
should take into account the Prepayment Assumption. The Conference Committee Report to the 1986 Act provides that until such regulations
are issued, such market discount would accrue, at the election of the holder, either (i)Â on the basis of a constant interest
rate or (ii)Â in the ratio of interest accrued for the relevant period to the sum of the interest accrued for such period
plus the remaining interest after the end of such period, or, in the case of classes issued with original issue discount, in the
ratio of original issue discount accrued for the relevant period to the sum of the original issue discount accrued for such period
plus the remaining original issue discount after the end of such period. Such purchaser also generally will be required to treat
a portion of any gain on a sale or exchange of the Regular Interest as ordinary income to the extent of the market discount accrued
to the date of disposition under one of the foregoing methods, less any accrued market discount previously reported as ordinary
income as partial distributions in reduction of the stated redemption price at maturity were received. Such purchaser will be
required to defer deduction of a portion of the excess of the interest paid or accrued on indebtedness incurred to purchase or
carry the Regular Interest over the interest (including original issue discount) distributable on the Regular Interest. The deferred
portion of such interest expense in any taxable year generally will not exceed the accrued market discount on the Regular Interest
for such year. Any such deferred interest expense is, in general, allowed as a deduction not later than the year in which the
related market discount income is recognized or the Regular Interest is disposed of. As an alternative to the inclusion of market
discount in income on the foregoing basis, the Regular Interestholder may elect to

Â 

501
Â 
Â 
include market discount in income currently as it accrues on
all market discount instruments acquired by such Regular Interestholder in that taxable year or thereafter, in which case the
interest deferral rule will not apply. See ââElection To Treat All Interest Under the Constant Yield Methodâ
below regarding making the election under Code SectionÂ 171 and an alternative manner in which such election may be deemed
to be made.
Â 
Market
discount with respect to a Regular Interest will be considered to be zero if such market discount is less than 0.25% of the remaining
stated redemption price at maturity of such Regular Interest multiplied by the weighted average maturity of the Regular Interest
remaining after the date of purchase. For this purpose, the weighted average maturity is determined by multiplying the number
of full years (i.e., rounding down partial years) from the issue date until each distribution in reduction of stated redemption
price at maturity is scheduled to be made by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of each such distribution included
in the stated redemption price at maturity of the Regular Interest and the denominator of which is the total stated redemption
price at maturity of the Regular Interest. It appears that de minimis market discount would be reported pro rata
as principal payments are received. Treasury regulations implementing the market discount rules have not yet been proposed, and
investors should therefore consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules as well as the advisability
of making any of the elections with respect to such rules. Investors should also consult Revenue Procedure 92-67 concerning the
elections to include market discount in income currently and to accrue market discount on the basis of the constant yield method.
Â 
Premium
Â 
A
Regular Interest purchased upon initial issuance or in the secondary market at a cost greater than its remaining stated redemption
price at maturity generally is considered to be purchased at a premium. If the Regular Interestholder holds such Regular Interest
as a âcapital assetâ within the meaning of Code SectionÂ 1221, the Regular Interestholder may elect under Code
SectionÂ 171 to amortize such premium under the constant yield method. See ââElection To Treat All Interest
Under the Constant Yield Methodâ below regarding making the election under Code SectionÂ 171 and an alternative
manner in which the Code SectionÂ 171 election may be deemed to be made. Final Treasury regulations under Code SectionÂ 171
do not, by their terms, apply to prepayable obligations such as the Regular Interests. The Conference Committee Report to the
1986 Act indicates a Congressional intent that the same rules that will apply to the accrual of market discount on installment
obligations will also apply to amortizing bond premium under Code SectionÂ 171 on installment obligations such as the Regular
Interests, although it is unclear whether the alternatives to the constant interest method described above under ââMarket
Discountâ are available. Amortizable bond premium will be treated as an offset to interest income on a Regular Interest
rather than as a separate deduction item. It is anticipated that the Class A-1, Class A-2A, Class A-2B, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-SB, Class A-S and Class B certificates will
be issued at a premium for federal income tax purposes.
Â 
Election
To Treat All Interest Under the Constant Yield Method
Â 
A
holder of a debt instrument such as a Regular Interest may elect to treat all interest that accrues on the instrument using the
constant yield method, with none of the interest being treated as qualified stated interest. For purposes of applying the constant
yield  method to a debt instrument subject to such an election, (i)Â âinterestâ includes stated interest, original
issue discount, de minimis original issue discount, market discount and de minimis market discount, as adjusted
by any amortizable bond premium or acquisition premium and (ii)Â the debt instrument is treated as if the instrument were
issued on the
Â 

502
Â 
Â 

holderâs acquisition date in the amount of the holderâs adjusted basis immediately after acquisition.
It is unclear whether, for this purpose, the initial Prepayment Assumption would continue to apply or if a new prepayment assumption
as of the date of the holderâs acquisition would apply. A holder generally may make such an election on an instrument by
instrument basis or for a class or group of debt instruments. However, if the holder makes such an election with respect to a
debt instrument with amortizable bond premium or with market discount, the holder is deemed to have made elections to amortize
bond premium or to report market discount income currently as it accrues under the constant yield method, respectively, for all
premium bonds held or acquired or market discount bonds acquired by the holder on the first day of the year of the election or
thereafter. The election is made on the holderâs federal income tax return for the year in which the debt instrument is
acquired and is irrevocable except with the approval of the IRS. Investors are encouraged to consult their tax advisors regarding
the advisability of making such an election.
Â 
Treatment
of Losses
Â 
Holders
of the Regular Interests will be required to report income with respect to the Regular Interests on the accrual method of accounting,
without giving effect to delays or reductions in distributions attributable to defaults or delinquencies on the Mortgage Loans,
except to the extent it can be established that such losses are uncollectible. Accordingly, a Regular Interestholder may have
income, or may incur a diminution in cash flow as a result of a default or delinquency, but may not be able to take a deduction
(subject to the discussion below) for the corresponding loss until a subsequent taxable year. In this regard, investors are cautioned
that while they generally may cease to accrue interest income if it reasonably appears that the interest will be uncollectible,
the IRS may take the position that original issue discount must continue to be accrued in spite of its uncollectibility until
the debt instrument is disposed of in a taxable transaction or becomes worthless in accordance with the rules of Code SectionÂ 166.
The following discussion may not apply to holders of interest-only Regular Interests. Under Code SectionÂ 166, it appears
that the holders of Regular Interests that are corporations or that otherwise hold the Regular Interests in connection with a
trade or business should in general be allowed to deduct as an ordinary loss any such loss sustained (and not previously deducted)
during the taxable year on account of any such Regular Interests becoming wholly or partially worthless, and that, in general,
the Regular Interestholders that are not corporations and do not hold the Regular Interests in connection with a trade or business
will be allowed to deduct as a short term capital loss any loss with respect to principal sustained during the taxable year on
account of a portion of any class of such Regular Interests becoming wholly worthless. Although the matter is not free from doubt,
such non-corporate holders of Regular Interests should be allowed a bad debt deduction at such time as the certificate balance
of any class of such Regular Interests is reduced to reflect losses on the Mortgage Loans below such holderâs basis in the
Regular Interests. The IRS, however, could take the position that non-corporate holders will be allowed a bad debt deduction to
reflect such losses only after the classes of Regular Interests have been otherwise retired. The IRS could also assert that losses
on a class of Regular Interests are deductible based on some other method that may defer such deductions for all holders, such
as reducing future cash flow for purposes of computing original issue discount. This may have the effect of creating ânegativeâ
original issue discount that, with the possible exception of the method discussed in the following sentence, would be deductible
only against future positive original issue discount or otherwise upon termination of the applicable class. Although not free
from doubt, a holder of Regular Interests with negative original issue discount may be entitled to deduct a loss to the extent
that its remaining basis would exceed the maximum amount of future payments to which such holder was entitled, assuming no further
prepayments. No bad debt losses will be allowed with respect to the classes of interest-only Regular Interests, such as the
Â 


503
Â 
Â 

ClassÂ X
Certificates. Regular Interestholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the appropriate timing, amount and
character of any loss sustained with respect to such Regular Interests. Special loss rules are applicable to banks and thrift
institutions, including rules regarding reserves for bad debts. Such taxpayers are advised to consult their tax advisors regarding
the treatment of losses on the Regular Interests.
Â 
Yield
Maintenance Charges and Prepayment Premiums
Â 
Yield
Maintenance Charges and Prepayment Premiums actually collected on the Mortgage Loans will be distributed as described in âDescription
of the CertificatesâAllocation of Yield Maintenance Charges and Prepayment Premiumsâ. It is not entirely clear
under the Code when the amount of Yield Maintenance Charges and Prepayment Premiums so allocated should be taxed to the holders
of such classes of certificates, but it is not expected, for federal income tax reporting purposes, that Yield Maintenance Charges
and Prepayment Premiums will be treated as giving rise to any income to the holder of such class of certificates prior to the
certificate administratorâs actual receipt of Yield Maintenance Charges and Prepayment Premiums. Yield Maintenance Charges
and Prepayment Premiums, if any, may be treated as paid upon the retirement or partial retirement of such classes of certificates.
The IRS may disagree with these positions. Certificateholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the treatment of
Yield Maintenance Charges and Prepayment Premiums.
Â 
Sale
or Exchange of Regular Interests
Â 
If
a Regular Interestholder sells or exchanges a Regular Interest, such Regular Interestholder will recognize gain or loss equal
to the difference, if any, between the amount received and its adjusted basis in the Regular Interest. The adjusted basis of a
Regular Interest generally will equal the cost of the Regular Interest to the seller, increased by any original issue discount
or market discount previously included in the sellerâs gross income with respect to the Regular Interest and reduced by
amounts included in the stated redemption price at maturity of the Regular Interest that were previously received by the seller,
by any amortized premium, and by any deductible losses on the Regular Interest.
Â 
Except
as described above with respect to market discount, and except as provided in this paragraph, any gain or loss on the sale or
exchange of a Regular Interest realized by an investor that holds the Regular Interest as a capital asset will be capital gain
or loss and will be long term or short term depending on whether the Regular Interest has been held for the long term capital
gain holding period (more than one year). Such gain will be treated as ordinary income: (i)Â if the Regular Interest is held
as part of a âconversion transactionâ as defined in Code SectionÂ 1258(c), up to the amount of interest that would
have accrued on the Regular Interestholderâs net investment in the conversion transaction at 120% of the appropriate applicable
federal rate under Code SectionÂ 1274(d) in effect at the time the taxpayer entered into the transaction minus any amount
previously treated as ordinary income with respect to any prior disposition of property that was held as part of such transaction;
(ii)Â in the case of a non-corporate taxpayer, to the extent such taxpayer has made an election under Code SectionÂ 163(d)(4)
to have net capital gains taxed as investment income at ordinary income rates; or (iii)Â to the extent that such gain does
not exceed the excess, if any, of (a)Â the amount that would have been includible in the gross income of the Regular Interestholder
if his yield on such Regular Interest were 110% of the applicable federal rate as of the date of purchase, over (b)Â the amount
of income actually includible in the gross income of such Regular Interestholder with respect to the Regular Interest. In addition,
gain or loss recognized from the sale of a Regular Interest by certain banks or thrift institutions will be treated as ordinary
income or loss pursuant to Code
Â 


504
Â 
Â 

SectionÂ 582(c). Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate taxpayers generally are
subject to a lower maximum tax rate than ordinary income of such taxpayers for property held for more than one year. The maximum
tax rate for corporations is the same with respect to both ordinary income and capital gains.
Â 
Taxes
That May Be Imposed on a REMIC
Â 
Prohibited
Transactions
Â 
Income
from certain transactions by any Trust REMIC, called prohibited transactions, will not be part of the calculation of income or
loss includible in the federal income tax returns of holders of the ClassÂ R certificates, but rather will be taxed directly
to the Trust REMIC at a 100% rate. Prohibited transactions generally include (i)Â the disposition of a qualified mortgage
other than for (a)Â substitution within two years of the Startup Day for a defective (including a defaulted) obligation (or
repurchase in lieu of substitution of a defective (including a defaulted) obligation at any time) or for any qualified mortgage
within 3Â months of the Startup Day, (b)Â foreclosure, default or imminent default of a qualified mortgage, (c)Â bankruptcy
or insolvency of the REMIC, or (d)Â a qualified (complete) liquidation, (ii)Â the receipt of income from assets that are
not the type of mortgages or investments that the REMIC is permitted to hold, (iii)Â the receipt of compensation for services
or (iv)Â the receipt of gain from disposition of cash flow investments other than pursuant to a qualified liquidation. Notwithstanding
(i) and (iv), it is not a prohibited transaction to sell REMIC property to prevent a default on regular interests as a result
of a default on qualified mortgages or to facilitate a qualified liquidation or a clean-up call. The REMIC Regulations indicate
that the modification of a mortgage loan generally will not be treated as a disposition if it is occasioned by a default or reasonably
foreseeable default, an assumption of a mortgage loan or the waiver of a âdue-on-saleâ or âdue-on-encumbranceâ
clause. It is not anticipated that the Trust REMICs will engage in any prohibited transactions.
Â 
Contributions
to a REMIC After the Startup Day
Â 
In
general, a REMIC will be subject to a tax at a 100% rate on the value of any property contributed to the REMIC after the Startup
Day. Exceptions are provided for cash contributions to the REMIC (i)Â during the 3Â months following the Startup Day,
(ii)Â made to a qualified reserve fund by a holder of a ClassÂ R certificate, (iii)Â in the nature of a guarantee,
(iv)Â made to facilitate a qualified liquidation or clean-up call, and (v)Â as otherwise permitted in Treasury regulations
yet to be issued. It is not anticipated that there will be any taxable contributions to the Trust REMICs.
Â 
Net
Income from Foreclosure Property
Â 
The
Lower-Tier REMIC will be subject to federal income tax at the highest corporate rate on ânet income from foreclosure propertyâ,
determined by reference to the rules applicable to real estate investment trusts. Generally, property acquired by foreclosure
or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure would be treated as âforeclosure propertyâ until the close of the third calendar year
beginning after the Lower-Tier REMICâs acquisition of a REO Property, with a possible extension. Net income from foreclosure
property generally means gain from the sale of a foreclosure property that is inventory property and gross income from foreclosure
property other than qualifying rents and other qualifying income for a real estate investment trust.
Â 
In
order for a foreclosed property to qualify as foreclosure property, any operation of the foreclosed property by the Lower-Tier
REMIC generally must be conducted through an independent contractor. Further, such operation, even if conducted through an independent
contractor, may give rise to ânet income from foreclosure propertyâ, taxable at the highest
Â 

505
Â 

Â 
corporate rate. Payment
of such tax by the Lower-Tier REMIC would reduce amounts available for distribution to Certificateholders.
Â 
The
special servicer will be required to determine generally whether the operation of foreclosed property in a manner that would subject
the Lower-Tier REMIC to such tax would be expected to result in higher after-tax proceeds than an alternative method of operating
such property that would not subject the Lower-Tier REMIC to such tax.
Â 
Bipartisan
Budget Act of 2015
Â 
On
November 2, 2015, President Obama signed into law the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (the â2015 Budget Actâ),
which includes new audit rules affecting entities treated as partnerships, their partners and the persons that are authorized
to represent entities treated as partnerships in IRS audits and related procedures. Under the 2015 Budget Act, these rules will
also apply to REMICs, the holders of their residual interests and the trustees authorized to represent REMICs in IRS audits and
related procedures (âtax matters personsâ or âTMPsâ). These new audit rules are scheduled to become effective
for taxable years beginning with 2018 and will apply to both new and existing REMICs.
Â 
In
addition to other changes, under the 2015 Budget Act, (1) unless a REMIC elects otherwise, taxes arising from IRS audit adjustments
are required to be paid by the REMIC rather than by its residual interest holders, (2) a REMIC appoints one person to act as its
sole representative in connection with IRS audits and related procedures and that representativeâs actions, including agreeing
to adjustments to REMIC taxable income, will be binding on residual interest holders more so than a tax matters personâs
actions under the current rules and (3) if the IRS makes an adjustment to a REMICâs taxable year, the holders of residual
interests for the audited taxable year may have to take the adjustment into account for the taxable year in which the adjustment
is made rather than for the audited taxable year.
Â 
The
certificate administrator will have the authority to utilize, and will be directed to utilize, any exceptions available under
the new provisions (including any changes) and IRS regulations so that holders of the Class R certificates, to the fullest extent
possible, rather than either Trust REMIC itself, will be liable for any taxes arising from audit adjustments to either Trust REMICâs
taxable income. It is unclear how any such exceptions may affect the procedural rules available to challenge any audit adjustment
that would otherwise be available in the absence of any such exceptions. Investors should discuss with their own tax advisors
the possible effect of the new rules on them.
Â 
Taxation
of Certain Foreign Investors
Â 
Interest,
including original issue discount, distributable to the Regular Interestholders that are nonresident aliens, foreign corporations
or other Non-U.S. Persons will be considered âportfolio interestâ and, therefore, generally will not be subject to
a 30% United States withholding tax; provided that such Non-U.S. Person (i)Â is not a â10 percent shareholderâ
within the meaning of Code SectionÂ 871(h)(3)(B) or a controlled foreign corporation described in Code SectionÂ 881(c)(3)(C)
with respect to the Trust REMICs and (ii)Â provides the certificate administrator, or the person that would otherwise be required
to withhold tax from such distributions under Code SectionÂ 1441 or 1442, with an appropriate statement, signed under penalties
of perjury, identifying the beneficial owner and stating, among other things, that the beneficial owner of the Regular Interest
is a Non-U.S. Person. The appropriate documentation includes IRS Form W-8BEN-E or W-8BEN, if the Non-U.S. Person is an entity
(such as a corporation) or individual, respectively, eligible for the benefits of the portfolio interest exemption or an exemption
based on a treaty; IRS Form
Â 

506
Â 
Â 

W-8ECI if the Non-U.S. Person is eligible for an exemption on the basis of its income from the Regular
Interest being effectively connected to a United States trade or business; IRS Form W-8BEN-E or W-8IMY if the Non-U.S. Person
is a trust, depending on whether such trust is classified as the beneficial owner of the Regular Interest; and Form W-8IMY, with
supporting documentation as specified in the Treasury regulations, required to substantiate exemptions from withholding on behalf
of its partners, if the Non-U.S. Person is a partnership. With respect to IRS Forms W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8IMY and W-8ECI, each
(other than IRS Form W-8IMY) expires after 3Â full calendar years or as otherwise provided by applicable law. An intermediary
(other than a partnership) must provide IRS Form W-8IMY, revealing all required information, including its name, address, taxpayer
identification number, the country under the laws of which it is created, and certification that it is not acting for its own
account. A âqualified intermediaryâ must certify that it has provided, or will provide, a withholding statement as
required under Treasury regulations SectionÂ 1.1441-1(e)(5)(v), but need not disclose the identity of its account holders
on its IRS Form W-8IMY, and may certify its account holdersâ status without including each beneficial ownerâs certification.
A ânon-qualified intermediaryâ must additionally certify that it has provided, or will provide, a withholding statement
that is associated with the appropriate IRS Forms W-8 and W-9 required to substantiate exemptions from withholding on behalf of
its beneficial owners. The term âintermediaryâ means a person acting as a custodian, a broker, nominee or otherwise
as an agent for the beneficial owner of a Regular Interest. A âqualified intermediaryâ is generally a foreign financial
institution or clearing organization or a non-U.S. branch or office of a U.S. financial institution or clearing organization that
is a party to a withholding agreement with the IRS.
Â 
If
such statement, or any other required statement, is not provided, 30% withholding will apply unless reduced or eliminated pursuant
to an applicable tax treaty or unless the interest on the Regular Interest is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade
or business within the United States by such Non-U.S. Person. In the latter case, such Non-U.S. Person will be subject to United
States federal income tax at regular rates. Investors that are Non-U.S. Persons should consult their own tax advisors regarding
the specific tax consequences to them of owning a Regular Interest.
Â 
The
term âU.S. Personâ means a citizen or resident of the United States, a corporation, partnership (except to
the extent provided in the applicable Treasury regulations) or other entity created or organized in or under the laws of the United
States, any State or the District of Columbia, including any entity treated as a corporation or partnership for federal income
tax purposes, an estate that is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of the source of income, or a trust if a court within
the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust, and one or more such U.S. Persons
have the authority to control all substantial decisions of such trust (or, to the extent provided in the applicable Treasury regulations,
certain trusts in existence on AugustÂ 20, 1996 that have elected to be treated as U.S. Persons). The term âNon-U.S.
Personâ means a person other than a U.S. Person.
Â 
FATCA
Â 
Under
the âForeign Account Tax Compliance Actâ (âFATCAâ) provisions of the Hiring Incentives to Restore
Employment Act, a 30% withholding tax is generally imposed on certain payments, including U.S.-source interest and, beginning
on January 1, 2019, and gross proceeds from the disposition of debt obligations that give rise to U.S.-source interest to âforeign
financial institutionsâ and certain other foreign financial entities if those foreign entities fail to comply with the requirements
of FATCA. The certificate administrator will be required to withhold amounts under FATCA on payments made to holders who are subject
Â 


507
Â 
Â 

to the FATCA requirements and who fail to provide the certificate administrator with proof that they have complied with such requirements.
Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the applicability of FATCA to their certificates.
Â 
Backup
Withholding
Â 
Distributions
made on the certificates, and proceeds from the sale of the certificates to or through certain brokers, may be subject to a âbackupâ
withholding tax under Code SectionÂ 3406 at the rate of 28% on âreportable paymentsâ (including interest distributions,
original issue discount and, under certain circumstances, principal distributions) unless the Certificateholder is a U.S. Person
and provides IRS Form W-9 with the correct taxpayer identification number; in the case of the Regular Interests, is a Non-U.S.
Person and provides IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, identifying the Non-U.S. Person and stating that the beneficial
owner is not a U.S. Person; or can be treated as an exempt recipient within the meaning of Treasury regulations SectionÂ 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii).
Any amounts to be withheld from distribution on the certificates would be refunded by the IRS or allowed as a credit against the
Certificateholderâs federal income tax liability. Information reporting requirements may also apply regardless of whether
withholding is required. Holders are urged to contact their own tax advisors regarding the application to them of backup withholding
and information reporting.
Â 
Information
Reporting
Â 
Holders
who are individuals (and certain domestic entities that are formed or availed of for purposes of holding, directly or indirectly,
âspecified foreign financial assetsâ) may be subject to certain foreign financial asset reporting obligations with
respect to their certificates held through a financial account maintained by a foreign financial institution if the aggregate
value of their certificates and their other âspecified foreign financial assetsâ exceeds $50,000. Significant penalties
can apply if a holder fails to disclose its specified foreign financial assets. We urge you to consult your tax advisor with respect
to this and other reporting obligations with respect to your certificates.
Â 
3.8%
Medicare Tax on âNet Investment Incomeâ
Â 
Certain
non-corporate U.S. holders will be subject to an additional 3.8% tax on all or a portion of their ânet investment incomeâ,
which may include the interest payments and any gain realized with respect to the certificates, to the extent of their net investment
income that, when added to their other modified adjusted gross income, exceeds $200,000 for an unmarried individual, $250,000
for a married taxpayer filing a joint return (or a surviving spouse), or $125,000 for a married individual filing a separate return.
The 3.8% Medicare tax is determined in a different manner than the regular income tax. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors
with respect to their consequences with respect to the 3.8% Medicare tax.
Â 
Reporting
Requirements
Â 
Each
Trust REMIC will be required to maintain its books on a calendar year basis and to file federal income tax returns in a manner
similar to a partnership. The form for such returns is IRS Form 1066, U.S. Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit (REMIC) Income
Tax Return. The trustee will be required to sign each Trust REMICâs returns.
Â 
Reports
of accrued interest, original issue discount, if any, and information necessary to compute the accrual of any market discount
on the Regular Interests will be made annually to the IRS and to individuals, estates, non-exempt and non-charitable trusts, and
Â 

508
Â 

Â 
partnerships that are either Regular Interestholders or beneficial owners that own Regular Interests through a broker or middleman
as nominee. All brokers, nominees and all other nonexempt Regular Interestholders (including corporations, non-calendar year taxpayers,
securities or commodities dealers, placement agents, real estate investment trusts, investment companies, common trusts, thrift
institutions and charitable trusts) may request such information for any calendar quarter by telephone or in writing by contacting
the person designated in IRS Publication 938 with respect to the REMIC. Holders through nominees must request such information
from the nominee.
Â 
Treasury
regulations require that, in addition to the foregoing requirements, information must be furnished annually to the Regular Interestholders
and filed annually with the IRS concerning the percentage of each Trust REMICâs assets meeting the qualified asset tests
described under ââQualification as a REMICâ above.
Â 
These
regulations also require that the certificate administrator make available information regarding interest income and information
necessary to compute any original issue discount to (i)Â exempt recipients (including middlemen) and non-calendar year taxpayers,
upon request, in accordance with the requirements of the regulations and (ii)Â Certificateholders who do not hold their certificates
through a middleman. The information must be provided to parties specified in clauseÂ (i)Â on or before the later of the
30th day after the close of the calendar year to which the request relates and 14 days after the receipt of the request.
The information must be provided to parties specified in clauseÂ (ii) on or before March 15 of the calendar year for which
the statement is being furnished.
Â 
DUE
TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THESE RULES AND THE CURRENT UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE MANNER OF THEIR APPLICATION TO THE ISSUING ENTITY AND CERTIFICATEHOLDERS,
IT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT THAT POTENTIAL INVESTORS CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE TAX TREATMENT OF THEIR ACQUISITION,
OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF THE CERTIFICATES.
Â 
Certain
State and Local Tax Considerations
Â 
In
addition to the federal income tax consequences described in âMaterial Federal Income Tax Considerationsâ above,
purchasers of Offered Certificates should consider the state and local income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership,
and disposition of the Offered Certificates. State and local income tax law may differ substantially from the corresponding
federal law, and this discussion does not purport to describe any aspect of the income tax laws of any state or locality.
Â 
It
is possible that one or more jurisdictions may attempt to tax nonresident holders of offered certificates solely by reason of
the location in that jurisdiction of the depositor, the trustee, the certificate administrator, the sponsors, a related borrower
or a mortgaged property or on some other basis, may require nonresident holders of certificates to file returns in such jurisdiction
or may attempt to impose penalties for failure to file such returns; and it is possible that any such jurisdiction will ultimately
succeed in collecting such taxes or penalties from nonresident holders of offered certificates. We cannot assure you that holders
of offered certificates will not be subject to tax in any particular state, local or other taxing jurisdiction.
Â 
You
should consult with your tax advisor with respect to the various state and local, and any other, tax consequences of an investment
in the Offered Certificates.
Â 

509
Â 
Â 
Method
of Distribution (Underwriter)
Â 
Subject
to the terms and conditions set forth in an underwriting agreement (the âUnderwriting Agreementâ), among the
depositor and the underwriters, the depositor has agreed to sell to the underwriters, and the underwriters have severally, but
not jointly, agreed to purchase from the depositor the respective Certificate Balance or the Notional Amount, as applicable, of
each class of Offered Certificates set forth below subject in each case to a variance of 5%.Â Â

The
Underwriting Agreement provides that the obligations of the underwriters will be subject to certain conditions precedent and that
the underwriters will be obligated to purchase all Offered Certificates if any are purchased. In the event of a default by any
underwriter, the Underwriting Agreement provides that, in certain circumstances, purchase commitments of the non-defaulting underwriter(s)
may be increased or the Underwriting Agreement may be terminated.
Â 
Additionally,
the parties to the PSA have severally agreed to indemnify the underwriters, and the underwriters have agreed to indemnify the
depositor and controlling persons of the depositor, against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act,
and have agreed, if required, to contribute to payments required to be made in respect of these liabilities.
Â 
The depositor has been advised by the underwriters
that they propose to offer the Offered Certificates to the public from time to time in one or more negotiated transactions, or
otherwise, at varying prices to be determined at the time of sale. Proceeds to the depositor from the sale of Offered Certificates
will be approximately 109.36% of the initial aggregate Certificate Balance of the Offered Certificates, plus accrued interest
on the Offered Certificates from December 1, 2015, before deducting expenses payable by the depositor (estimated at $5,567,157,
excluding underwriting discounts and commissions). The underwriters may effect the transactions by selling the Offered Certificates
to or through dealers, and the dealers may receive compensation in the form of underwriting discounts, concessions or commissions
from the Underwriters. In connection with the purchase and sale of the Offered Certificates offered by this prospectus, the underwriters 
Â 

510
Â 
Â 
may be deemed to have received compensation from the depositor in the form of underwriting discounts.
Â Â 
We
anticipate that the Offered Certificates will be sold primarily to institutional investors. Purchasers of Offered Certificates,
including dealers, may, depending on the facts and circumstances of those purchases, be deemed to be âunderwritersâ
within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with reoffers and resales by them of Offered Certificates. If you purchase
Offered Certificates, you should consult with your legal advisors in this regard prior to any reoffer or resale. The underwriters
expect to make, but are not obligated to make, a secondary market in the Offered Certificates. See âRisk FactorsâOther
Risks Relating to the CertificatesâThe Certificates May Have Limited Liquidity and the Market Value of the Certificates
May Declineâ.
Â 
The
primary source of ongoing information available to investors concerning the Offered Certificates will be the monthly statements
discussed under âDescription of the CertificatesâReports to Certificateholders; Certain Available Informationâ.
We cannot assure you that any additional information regarding the Offered Certificates will be available through any other source.
In addition, we are not aware of any source through which price information about the Offered Certificates will be generally available
on an ongoing basis. The limited nature of that information regarding the Offered Certificates may adversely affect the liquidity
of the Offered Certificates, even if a secondary market for the Offered Certificates becomes available.

Â 
Certain
ERISA Considerations
Â 
General
Â 
The
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or ERISA, and Code SectionÂ 4975 impose certain requirements
on retirement plans, and on certain other employee benefit plans and arrangements, including individual retirement accounts and
annuities, Keogh plans, collective investment funds, insurance company separate accounts and some insurance company general accounts
in which those plans, accounts or arrangements are invested that are subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA
or Code SectionÂ 4975 (all of which are referred to as âPlansâ), and on persons who are fiduciaries with
respect to Plans, in connection with the investment of Plan assets. Certain employee benefit plans, such as governmental plans
(as defined in ERISA SectionÂ 3(32)), and, if no election has been made under Code SectionÂ 410(d), church plans (as defined
in SectionÂ 3(33) of ERISA) are not subject to ERISA requirements. However, those plans may be subject to the provisions of
other applicable federal, state or local law (âSimilar Lawâ) materially similar to the foregoing provisions
of ERISA or the Code. Moreover, those plans, if qualified and exempt from taxation under Code SectionsÂ 401(a) and 501(a),
are subject to the prohibited transaction rules set forth in Code SectionÂ 503.
Â 
ERISA
generally imposes on Plan fiduciaries certain general fiduciary requirements, including those of investment prudence and diversification
and the requirement that a Planâs investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the Plan. In addition,
ERISA and the Code prohibit a broad range of transactions involving assets of a Plan and persons (âParties in Interestâ)
who have certain specified relationships to the Plan, unless a statutory, regulatory or administrative exemption is available.
Certain Parties in Interest that participate in a prohibited transaction may be subject to an excise tax imposed pursuant to Code
SectionÂ 4975, unless a statutory, regulatory or administrative exemption is available. These prohibited transactions generally
are set forth in SectionÂ 406 of ERISA and Code SectionÂ 4975. Special caution should be exercised before the assets of
a Plan are used to purchase an offered certificate if, with respect to those assets, the depositor, any servicer or the trustee
or any of their affiliates, either: (a)Â has investment discretion with respect to the investment of those assets of that
Plan; or (b)Â has authority or responsibility to give, or regularly gives, investment advice with respect to those assets
for a fee and pursuant to an agreement or understanding that the advice will serve as a primary basis for investment decisions
with respect to those assets and that the advice will be based on the particular investment needs of the Plan; or (c)Â is
an employer maintaining or contributing to the Plan.
Â 
Before
purchasing any offered certificates with Plan assets, a Plan fiduciary should consult with its counsel and determine whether there
exists any prohibition to that purchase under the requirements of ERISA or Code SectionÂ 4975, whether any prohibited transaction
class exemption or any individual administrative prohibited transaction exemption (as described below) applies, including whether
the appropriate conditions set forth in those exemptions would be met, or whether any statutory prohibited transaction exemption
is applicable. Fiduciaries of plans subject to a Similar Law should consider the need for, and the availability of, an exemption
under such applicable Similar Law.
Â 
Plan
Asset Regulations
Â 
A
Planâs investment in offered certificates may cause the assets of the issuing entity to be deemed Plan assets. SectionÂ 2510.3-101
of the regulations of the United States Department of Labor (âDOLâ), as modified by SectionÂ 3(42) of ERISA,
provides that when a Plan acquires an equity interest in an entity, the Planâs assets include both the equity
Â 


514
Â 
Â 
interest and
an undivided interest in each of the underlying assets of the entity, unless certain exceptions not applicable to this discussion
apply, or unless the equity participation in the entity by âbenefit plan investorsâ (that is, Plans and entities whose
underlying assets include plan assets) is not âsignificantâ. For this purpose, in general, equity participation in
an entity will be âsignificantâ on any date if, immediately after the most recent acquisition of any certificate,
25% or more of any class of certificates is held by benefit plan investors.
Â 
In
general, any person who has discretionary authority or control respecting the management or disposition of Plan assets, and any
person who provides investment advice with respect to those assets for a fee, is a fiduciary of the investing Plan. If the assets
of the issuing entity constitute Plan assets, then any party exercising management or discretionary control regarding those assets,
such as a master servicer, a special servicer or any sub-servicer, may be deemed to be a Plan âfiduciaryâ with respect
to the investing Plan, and thus subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA
and Code SectionÂ 4975. In addition, if the assets of the issuing entity constitute Plan assets, the purchase of offered certificates
by a Plan, as well as the operation of the issuing entity, may constitute or involve a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the
Code.
Â 
Administrative
Exemptions
Â 
The
U.S. Department of Labor has issued to the predecessor of Wells Fargo Securities, LLC an individual prohibited transaction exemption,
PTE 96-22, 61 Fed. Reg. 14,828 (April 3, 1996), as amended by PTE 97-34, 62 Fed. Reg. 39,021 (July 21, 1997), PTE 2000-58, 65
Fed. Reg. 67,765 (November 13, 2000), PTE 2002-41, 67 Fed. Reg. 54,487 (August 22, 2002), PTE 2007-05, 72 Fed. Reg. 13,130 (March
20, 2007) and PTE 2013-08, 78 Fed. Reg. 41,091 (July 9, 2013) (the âExemptionâ). The Exemption generally exempts
from the application of the prohibited transaction provisions of SectionsÂ 406 and 407 of ERISA, and the excise taxes imposed
on prohibited transactions pursuant to Code SectionsÂ 4975(a) and (b), certain transactions, among others, relating to the
servicing and operation of pools of mortgage loans, such as the pool of mortgage loans held by the issuing entity, and the purchase,
sale and holding of mortgage pass-through certificates, such as the Offered Certificates, underwritten by Wells Fargo Securities,
LLC, provided that certain conditions set forth in the Exemption are satisfied. The depositor expects that the Exemption
generally will apply to the Offered Certificates.
Â 
The
Exemption sets forth 5 general conditions that must be satisfied for a transaction involving the purchase, sale and holding of
the Offered Certificates to be eligible for exemptive relief. First, the acquisition of the Offered Certificates by a Plan must
be on terms (including the price paid for the Offered Certificates) that are at least as favorable to the Plan as they would be
in an armâs-length transaction with an unrelated party. Second, the Offered Certificates at the time of acquisition by the
Plan must be rated in one of the four highest generic rating categories by at least one NRSRO that meets the requirements of the
Exemption (an âExemption Rating Agencyâ). Third, the trustee cannot be an affiliate of any other member of
the Restricted Group other than an underwriter. The âRestricted Groupâ consists of any underwriter, the depositor,
the trustee, the master servicer, the special servicer, any sub-servicer, any entity that provides insurance or other credit support
to the issuing entity and any borrower with respect to mortgage loans constituting more than 5% of the aggregate unamortized principal
balance of the mortgage loans as of the date of initial issuance of the Offered Certificates, and any affiliate of any of the
foregoing entities. Fourth, the sum of all payments made to and retained by the underwriters must represent not more than reasonable
compensation for underwriting the Offered Certificates, the sum of all payments made to and retained by the depositor pursuant
to the assignment of the mortgage loans to the issuing entity must represent not more than the fair market value of 
Â 

515
Â 
Â 
the mortgage
loans and the sum of all payments made to and retained by the master servicer, the special servicer and any sub-servicer must
represent not more than reasonable compensation for that personâs services under the PSA and reimbursement of the personâs
reasonable expenses in connection therewith. Fifth, the investing Plan must be an accredited investor as defined in Rule 501(a)(1)
of Regulation D under the Securities Act.
Â 
It
is a condition of the issuance of the Offered Certificates that they have the ratings described above required by the Exemption
and the depositor believes that each of the Rating Agencies qualifies as an Exemption Rating Agency. Consequently, the second
general condition set forth above will be satisfied with respect to the Offered Certificates as of the Closing Date. As of the
Closing Date, the third general condition set forth above will be satisfied with respect to the Offered Certificates. In addition,
the depositor believes that the fourth general condition set forth above will be satisfied with respect to the Offered Certificates.
A fiduciary of a Plan contemplating purchasing an Offered Certificate in the secondary market must make its own determination
that, at the time of purchase, the Offered Certificates continue to satisfy the second general condition set forth above. A fiduciary
of a Plan contemplating purchasing an Offered Certificate, whether in the initial issuance of the Offered Certificates or in the
secondary market, must make its own determination that the first and fifth general conditions set forth above will be satisfied
with respect to the related Offered Certificate.
Â 
The
Exemption also requires that the issuing entity meet the following requirements: (1)Â the issuing entity must consist solely
of assets of the type that have been included in other investment pools; (2)Â certificates in those other investment pools
must have been rated in one of the four highest categories by at least one of the Exemption Rating Agencies for at least one year
prior to the Planâs acquisition of Offered Certificates; and (3)Â certificates in those other investment pools must
have been purchased by investors other than Plans for at least one year prior to any Planâs acquisition of Offered Certificates.
Â 
The
depositor believes that the conditions to the applicability of the Exemption will generally be met with respect to the Offered
Certificates, other than those conditions which are dependent on facts unknown to the depositor or which it cannot control, such
as those relating to the circumstances of the Plan purchaser or the Plan fiduciary making the decision to purchase any such Offered
Certificates.
Â 
If
the general conditions of the Exemption are satisfied, the Exemption may provide an exemption from the restrictions imposed by
SectionsÂ 406(a) and 407(a) of ERISA (as well as the excise taxes imposed by Code SectionsÂ 4975(a) and (b) by reason
of Code SectionsÂ 4975(c)(1)(A) through (D)) in connection with (1)Â the direct or indirect sale, exchange or transfer
of Offered Certificates in the initial issuance of certificates between the depositor or the underwriters and a Plan when the
depositor, any of the underwriters, the trustee, the master servicer, the special servicer, a sub-servicer or a borrower is a
party in interest with respect to the investing Plan, (2)Â the direct or indirect acquisition or disposition in the secondary
market of the Offered Certificates by an Plan and (3)Â the holding of Offered Certificates by a Plan. However, no exemption
is provided from the restrictions of SectionsÂ 406(a)(1)(E), 406(a)(2) and 407 of ERISA for the acquisition or holding of
an Offered Certificate on behalf of an âExcluded Planâ by any person who has discretionary authority or renders investment
advice with respect to the assets of the Excluded Plan. For purposes of this prospectus, an âExcluded Planâ
is a Plan sponsored by any member of the Restricted Group.
Â 
If
certain specific conditions of the Exemption are also satisfied, the Exemption may provide an exemption from the restrictions
imposed by SectionsÂ 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) of ERISA and the taxes imposed by Code SectionÂ 4975(c)(1)(E) in connection
with (1)Â the 
Â 

516
Â 
Â 
direct or indirect sale, exchange or transfer of Offered Certificates in the initial issuance of certificates
between the depositor or the underwriters and a Plan when the person who has discretionary authority or renders investment advice
with respect to the investment of Plan assets in those certificates is (a)Â a borrower with respect to 5% or less of the fair
market value of the mortgage loans or (b)Â an affiliate of that person, (2)Â the direct or indirect acquisition or disposition
in the secondary market of Offered Certificates by a Plan and (3)Â the holding of Offered Certificates by a Plan.
Â 
Further,
if certain specific conditions of the Exemption are satisfied, the Exemption may provide an exemption from the restrictions imposed
by SectionsÂ 406(a), 406(b) and 407(a) of ERISA, and the taxes imposed by Code SectionsÂ 4975(a) and (b) by reason of
Code SectionÂ 4975(c) for transactions in connection with the servicing, management and operation of the pool of mortgage
loans.
Â 
A
fiduciary of a Plan should consult with its counsel with respect to the applicability of the Exemption. The fiduciary of a plan
not subject to ERISA or Code SectionÂ 4975, such as a governmental plan, should determine the need for and availability of
exemptive relief under applicable Similar Law. A purchaser of an Offered Certificate should be aware, however, that even if the
conditions specified in one or more exemptions are satisfied, the scope of relief provided by an exemption may not cover all acts
which might be construed as prohibited transactions.
Â 
Insurance
Company General Accounts
Â 
SectionsÂ I
and III of Prohibited Transaction ClassÂ Exemption (âPTCEâ) 95-60 exempt from the application of the prohibited
transaction provisions of SectionsÂ 406(a), 406(b) and 407(a) of ERISA and Code SectionÂ 4975 transactions in connection
with the acquisition of a security (such as a certificate issued by the issuing entity) as well as the servicing, management and
operation of a trust (such as the issuing entity) in which an insurance company general account has an interest as a result of
its acquisition of certificates issued by the issuing entity, provided that certain conditions are satisfied. If these
conditions are met, insurance company general accounts investing assets that are treated as assets of Plans would be allowed to
purchase certain classes of certificates which do not meet the ratings requirements of the Exemption. All other conditions of
the Exemption would have to be satisfied in order for PTCE 95-60 to be available. Before purchasing any class of offered certificates,
an insurance company general account seeking to rely on SectionsÂ I and III of PTCE 95-60 should itself confirm that all applicable
conditions and other requirements have been satisfied.
Â 
SectionÂ 401(c)
of ERISA provides certain exemptive relief from the provisions of Part 4 of Title I of ERISA and Code SectionÂ 4975, including
the prohibited transaction restrictions imposed by ERISA and the related excise taxes imposed by the Code, for transactions involving
an insurance company general account. Pursuant to SectionÂ 401(c) of ERISA, the DOL issued regulations (â401(c) Regulationsâ),
generally effective July 5, 2001, to provide guidance for the purpose of determining, in cases where insurance policies supported
by an insuredâs general account are issued to or for the benefit of a Plan on or before DecemberÂ 31, 1998, which general
account assets constitute Plan assets. Any assets of an insurance company general account which support insurance policies issued
to a Plan after DecemberÂ 31, 1998 or issued to Plans on or before DecemberÂ 31, 1998 for which the insurance company
does not comply with the 401(c) Regulations may be treated as Plan assets. In addition, because SectionÂ 401(c) of ERISA does
not relate to insurance company separate accounts, separate account assets are still generally treated as Plan assets of any Plan
invested in that separate account. Insurance companies contemplating the investment
Â 


517
Â 
Â 
of general account assets in the offered certificates
should consult with their counsel with respect to the applicability of SectionÂ 401(c) of ERISA.
Â 
Due
to the complexity of these rules and the penalties imposed upon persons involved in prohibited transactions, it is particularly
important that potential investors who are Plan fiduciaries or who are investing Plan assets consult with their counsel regarding
the consequences under ERISA and the Code of their acquisition and ownership of certificates.
Â 
THE
SALE OF OFFERED CERTIFICATES TO A PLAN IS IN NO RESPECT A REPRESENTATION BY THE DEPOSITOR OR ANY OF THE UNDERWRITERS THAT THIS
INVESTMENT MEETS ANY RELEVANT LEGAL REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO INVESTMENTS BY PLANS GENERALLY OR ANY PARTICULAR PLAN, OR THAT
THIS INVESTMENT IS APPROPRIATE FOR PLANS GENERALLY OR ANY PARTICULAR PLAN.

Investment
Â 
None
of the classes of Offered Certificates will constitute âmortgage related securitiesâ for purposes of the Secondary
Mortgage Market Enhancement Act of 1984, as amended (âSMMEAâ). Generally, the only classes of Offered Certificates
which will qualify as âmortgage related securitiesâ will be those that (1)Â are rated in one of the two highest
rating categories by at least one NRSRO; and (2)Â are part of a series evidencing interests in a trust consisting of loans
originated by certain types of originators specified in SMMEA and secured by first liens on real estate.
Â 
Although
SectionÂ 939(e) of the Dodd-Frank Act amended SMMEA, effective July 21, 2012, so as to require the SEC to establish creditworthiness
standards by that date in substitution for the foregoing ratings test, the SEC has neither proposed nor adopted a rule establishing
new creditworthiness standards for purposes of SMMEA as of the date of this prospectus. However, the SEC has issued a transitional
interpretation (Release No.Â 34-67448 (effective July 20, 2012)), which provides that, until such time as final rules establishing
new standards of creditworthiness become effective, the standard of creditworthiness for purposes of the definition of the term
âmortgage related securityâ is a security that is rated in one of the two highest rating categories by at least one
NRSRO. Depending on the standards of creditworthiness that are ultimately established by the SEC, it is possible that certain
classes of Offered Certificates specified to be âmortgage related securitiesâ for purposes of SMMEA may no longer
qualify as such as of the time such new standards are effective.

appropriate characterization of the Offered Certificates under various legal investment restrictions, and thus the ability of
investors subject to those restrictions to purchase the Offered Certificates, are subject to significant interpretive uncertainties.
We make no representation as to the proper characterization of the Offered Certificates for legal investment, financial institution
regulatory, or other purposes, or as to the ability of particular investors to purchase any Offered Certificates under applicable
legal investment restrictions. Further, any ratings downgrade of a class of Offered Certificates by an NRSRO to less than an âinvestment
gradeâ rating (i.e., lower than the top four rating categories) may adversely affect the ability of an investor to
purchase or retain, or otherwise impact the regulatory characteristics of, that class. The uncertainties described above (and
any unfavorable future determinations concerning the legal investment or financial institution regulatory characteristics of the
Offered Certificates) may adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the Offered Certificates.
Â 

518
Â 

Â 
Accordingly,
if your investment activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements, or review
by regulatory authorities, you should consult with your own legal advisors in determining whether and to what extent the Offered
Certificates constitute legal investments or are subject to investment, capital, or other regulatory restrictions.
Â 
The
issuing entity will not be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The issuing entity will be relying
on an exclusion or exemption from the definition of âinvestment companyâ under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended contained in SectionÂ 3(c)(5) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or Rule 3a-7 under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, although there may be additional exclusions or exemptions available to the issuing entity. The
issuing entity is being structured so as not to constitute a âcovered fundâ for purposes of the Volcker Rule under
the Dodd-Frank Act.
Â 
Legal
Matters
Â 
The
validity of the Offered Certificates and certain federal income tax matters will be passed upon for the Depositor by Cadwalader,
Wickersham & TaftÂ LLP, Charlotte, North Carolina, and certain other legal matters will be passed upon for the underwriters
by Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, NewÂ York, NewÂ York.
Â 
Ratings
Â 
It
is a condition to their issuance that the Offered Certificates receive investment grade credit ratings from each of the three
(3) Rating Agencies engaged by the Depositor to rate the offered certificates.
Â 
We
are not obligated to maintain any particular rating with respect to any class of Offered Certificates. Changes affecting the Mortgaged
Properties, the parties to the PSA or another person may have an adverse effect on the ratings of the Offered Certificates, and
thus on the liquidity, market value and regulatory characteristics of the Offered Certificates, although such adverse changes
would not necessarily be an event of default under the related Mortgage Loan.
Â 
The
ratings address the likelihood of full and timely receipt by the Certificateholders of all distributions of interest at the applicable
Pass-Through Rate on the Offered Certificates to which they are entitled on each Distribution Date and the ultimate payment in
full of the Certificate Balance of each class of Offered Certificates on a date that it not later than the Rated Final Distribution
Date with respect to such class of certificates. The Rated Final Distribution Date will be the Distribution Date in December 2048.
See âYield and Maturity Considerationsâ and âPooling and Servicing AgreementâAdvancesâ.
Any ratings of each Offered Certificates should be evaluated independently from similar ratings on other types of securities.
Â 
The
ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, a measure of asset value or an indication of the suitability
of an investment, and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by any Rating Agency. In addition, these ratings do
not address: (a)Â the likelihood, timing, or frequency of prepayments (both voluntary and involuntary) and their impact on
interest payments or the degree to which such prepayments might differ from those originally anticipated, (b)Â the possibility
that a Certificateholder might suffer a lower than anticipated yield, (c)Â the likelihood of receipt of Yield Maintenance
Charges, prepayment charges, Prepayment Premiums, prepayment fees or penalties,
Â 


519
Â 
Â 
default interest or post-anticipated repayment
date additional interest, (d)Â the likelihood of experiencing any Prepayment Interest Shortfalls, an assessment of whether
or to what extent the interest payable on any class of Offered Certificates may be reduced in connection with any Prepayment Interest
Shortfalls, or of receiving Compensating Interest Payments, (e)Â the tax treatment of the Offered Certificates or effect of
taxes on the payments received, (f)Â the likelihood or willingness of the parties to the respective documents to meet their
contractual obligations or the likelihood or willingness of any party or court to enforce, or hold enforceable, the documents
in whole or in part, (g)Â an assessment of the yield to maturity that investors may experience, (h)Â the likelihood, timing
or receipt of any payments of interest to the holders of the Offered Certificates resulting from an increase in the interest rate
on any Mortgage Loan in connection with a Mortgage Loan modification, waiver or amendment, (i)Â Excess Interest, or (j)Â other
non-credit risks, including, without limitation, market risks or liquidity.
Â 
The
ratings take into consideration the credit quality of the underlying Mortgaged Properties and the Mortgage Loans, structural and
legal aspects associated with the Offered Certificates, and the extent to which the payment stream of the Mortgage Loans is adequate
to make payments required under the Offered Certificates. However, as noted above, the ratings do not represent an assessment
of the likelihood, timing or frequency of principal prepayments (both voluntary and involuntary) by the borrowers, or the degree
to which such prepayments might differ from those originally anticipated. In general, the ratings address credit risk and not
prepayment risk. Ratings are forward-looking opinions about credit risk and express an agencyâs opinion about the ability
and willingness of an issuer of securities to meet its financial obligations in full and on time. Ratings are not indications
of investment merit. In addition, the ratings do not represent an assessment of the yield to maturity that investors may experience
or the possibility that investors might not fully recover their initial investment in the event of delinquencies or defaults or
rapid prepayments on the Mortgage Loans (including both voluntary and involuntary prepayments) or the application of any realized
losses. In the event that holders of such certificates do not fully recover their investment as a result of rapid principal prepayments
on the Mortgage Loans, all amounts âdueâ to such holders will nevertheless have been paid, and such result is consistent
with the ratings assigned to such certificates. As indicated in this prospectus, holders of the certificates with Notional Amounts
are entitled only to payments of interest on the related Mortgage Loans. If the Mortgage Loans were to prepay in the initial month,
with the result that the holders of the certificates with Notional Amounts receive only a single monthâs interest and therefore,
suffer a nearly complete loss of their investment, all amounts âdueâ to such holders will nevertheless have been paid,
and such result is consistent with the rating received on those certificates. The Notional Amounts of the certificates with Notional
Amounts on which interest is calculated may be reduced by the allocation of realized losses and prepayments, whether voluntary
or involuntary. The ratings do not address the timing or magnitude of reductions of such Notional Amount, but only the obligation
to pay interest timely on the Notional Amount, as so reduced from time to time. Therefore, the ratings of the certificates with
Notional Amounts should be evaluated independently from similar ratings on other types of securities. See âRisk FactorsâOther
Risks Relating to the CertificatesâYour Yield May Be Affected by Defaults, Prepayments and Other Factorsâ and
âYield and Maturity Considerationsâ.
Â 
Although
the depositor will prepay fees for ongoing rating surveillance by certain of the Rating Agencies, the depositor has no obligation
or ability to ensure that any Rating Agency performs ratings surveillance. In addition, a Rating Agency may cease ratings surveillance
if the information furnished to that Rating Agency is insufficient to allow it to perform surveillance.
Â 

520
Â 

Â 
Any
of the three NRSROs that we hired may issue unsolicited credit ratings on one or more classes of certificates that we did not
hire it to rate. Additionally, other NRSROs that we have not engaged to rate the Offered Certificates may nevertheless issue unsolicited
credit ratings on one or more Classes of Offered Certificates relying on information they receive pursuant to RuleÂ 17g-5
or otherwise. If any such unsolicited ratings are issued, we cannot assure you that they will not be different from those ratings
assigned by the Rating Agencies. The issuance of unsolicited ratings of a Class of the Offered Certificates that are lower than
the ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies may adversely impact the liquidity, market value and regulatory characteristics of
that class. As part of the process of obtaining ratings for the Offered Certificates, the depositor had initial discussions with
and submitted certain materials to five NRSROs. Based on final feedback from those five NRSROs at that time, the depositor hired
the Rating Agencies to rate the Offered Certificates and not the other two NRSROs due, in part, to those NRSROsâ initial
subordination levels for the various Classes of Offered Certificates. Had the depositor selected such other NRSROs to rate the
Offered Certificates, we cannot assure you as to the ratings that such other NRSROs would ultimately have assigned to the Certificates.
In the case of one NRSRO hired by the depositor, the depositor only requested ratings for certain Classes of rated Offered Certificates,
due in part to the final subordination levels provided by that NRSRO for the Classes of Offered Certificates. If the depositor
had selected that NRSRO to rate those other Classes of Offered Certificates not rated by it, its ratings of those other Offered
Certificates may have been different, and potentially lower, than those ratings ultimately assigned to those certificates by the
other two NRSROs hired by the depositor. Although unsolicited ratings may be issued by any NRSRO, an NRSRO might be more likely
to issue an unsolicited rating if it was not selected after having provided preliminary feedback to the depositor.

Information regarding mortgage loans that are cross-collateralized with other mortgage loans is based upon the individual loan balances, except that the applicable loan-to-value ratio, debt service coverage ratio or debt yield for each such mortgage loan is based upon the ratio or yield (as applicable) for the aggregate indebtedness evidenced by all mortgage loans in the group. On an individual basis, without regard to the cross-collateralization feature, any mortgage loan that is part of a cross-collateralized group of mortgage loans may have a higher loan-to-value ratio, lower debt service coverage ratio and/or lower debt yield than is presented herein.

Each such mortgage loan can also be separately defeased in full, without full defeasance of the other such mortgage loan, upon satisfaction of similar conditions.

Â 

(1) A mortgaged property
is classified as shadow anchored if it is located in close proximity to an anchored retail property.
Â 
(2) Because
this table presents information relating to the mortgaged properties and not the mortgage loans, the information for mortgage
loans secured by more than one mortgaged property is based on allocated amounts (allocating the mortgage loan principal balance
to each of those properties according to the relative appraised values of the mortgaged properties or the allocated loan amounts
or property-specific release prices set forth in the related mortgage loan documents or in such other manner as the related mortgage
loan seller deemed appropriate).

The
Property. The Empire Mall Property is a regional mall located in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The Empire Mall Property contains
approximately 1,124,451 square feet of retail space, inclusive of several ground leased outparcels. Built in 1974, the Empire
Mall Property is comprised of one main building and five outparcel buildings situated on an approximately 121.7 acre parcel. The
Empire Mall Property is anchored by Dickâs Clothing & Sport, Sears, J.C. Penney, Younkers, and Macys (on a ground lease).
Other major tenants include a Hy-Vee grocery store, Richman Gordman and standalone outparcels including large tenants such as

replacement of floor finishes, ceiling and lighting retrofits, replacement of furniture, fixtures and equipment and the construction
of a flagship Dickâs Clothing & Sport. The Empire Mall Property contains 6,470 surface parking spaces, resulting in

Â 
Escrows.
The loan documents provide for an upfront escrow of $75,000 for outstanding tenant improvement and leasing obligations for
J.C. Penney. The loan documents do not require monthly escrows for real estate taxes, insurance, replacement reserves or tenant
improvements and leasing commissions reserves, provided no Debt Service Coverage Ratio Trigger Period (as defined below) has occurred
and is continuing under the Empire Mall Whole Loan. In the event that a Debt Service Coverage Ratio Trigger Period has occurred,
the borrower is required to make monthly deposits: (i) for the payment of real estate taxes in an amount equal to one-twelfth
of the estimated annual taxes payable and for the payment of insurance in an amount equal to one-twelfth of the estimated annual
insurance premiums payable; provided that so long as no event of default has occurred and is continuing, the borrower will not
be required to make such deposits for so long as the borrower provides satisfactory evidence to the lender that the taxes have
been paid prior to delinquency and the insurance policies are being maintained as part of a reasonably acceptable blanket insurance

leasing commissions in an amount equal to $49,099 (subject to a cap of $1,000,000). Monthly reserves for ground lease funds
are required during the continuance of a Lockbox Event (see âLockbox and Cash Managementâ section).
Â 
A
âDebt Service Coverage Ratio Trigger Periodâ will commence if, as of the date of determination, the amortizing debt
service coverage ratio based on the trailing four-calendar quarter period immediately preceding the date of such determination
falls below 1.20x.
Â 
Lockbox
and Cash Management. The Empire Mall Whole Loan requires a lender-controlled lockbox account, which is already in place, and
that the borrower direct tenants to deposit all rents directly into the lockbox account and that the borrower and the property
manager deposit all rents received into the lockbox account within two business days of receipt. Prior to the occurrence of a
Lockbox Event (as defined below), all funds on deposit in the lockbox account will be released to the borrower on a weekly basis.
Upon the occurrence and continuance of a Lockbox Event, funds on deposit in the lockbox account will be swept on a weekly basis
and on the 30th day of each calendar month (or on each business day, during the continuance of an event of default)
into a lender controlled cash management account.
Â 
A
âLockbox Eventâ will commence upon the occurrence of: (i) an event of default; (ii) any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding
of the borrower or the property manager (if the property manager is an affiliate of the borrower); (iii) if, as of the date of
determination, the debt service coverage ratio based on the trailing four-calendar quarter period immediately preceding the date
of such determination falls below 1.20x for two consecutive calendar quarters; or (iv) an Anchor Tenant Trigger Event (as defined
below). A Lockbox Event will end with respect to clause (i), upon the acceptance by the lender of a cure of such event of default;
with respect to clause (ii), if the borrower replaces the property manager with a qualified property manager pursuant to a replacement
management agreement or such bankruptcy action is discharged or dismissed within 90 days; with respect to clause (iii), when the
amortizing debt service coverage ratio based on the trailing four-calendar quarters of at least 1.20x has been achieved for two
consecutive calendar quarters; or with respect to clause (iv), if such Anchor Tenants (as defined below) re-commence operations
at the applicable premises and the borrower has delivered certification of such to the lender; provided, however, that (x) no
event of default has occurred and is continuing under the loan agreement or any of the other Empire Mall Whole Loan documents;
(y) the borrower has paid all of the lenderâs reasonable out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred in connection with such
Lockbox Event, including reasonable attorneyâs fees and expenses; and (z) a Lockbox Event may not be cured more than five
times in the aggregate during the term of the Empire Mall Whole Loan.
Â 
An
âAnchor Tenant Trigger Eventâ will commence if two or more anchor tenants (i) go dark, vacate or cease to occupy their
respective premises, (ii) reject their respective leases at the Empire Mall Property in a bankruptcy action or proceeding, or
(iii) otherwise give notice to vacate during the term of the loan.
Â 
âAnchor

Â 
The
borrower has the right to transfer the Empire Mall Property, or greater than 50% of the aggregate interests in the borrower, in
one, or a series of, related transactions to one or more Qualified Transferees (as defined below) (other than a transfer to a
Key Principal (as defined below) or any person wholly owned by one or more Key Principals, so long as such Key Principals owned
49% of the aggregate interests in the borrower prior to such transfer), 60 days after the WFCM 2015-P2 Trust closing date, provided
that no event of default has occurred and is continuing and certain other conditions are satisfied, including, but not limited
to delivery of an additional insolvency opinion.

any person, provided the lender has received written confirmation from each of Fitch, KBRA and Moodyâs that the transfer
to such person will not, in and of itself, cause a downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of the then current ratings of the Series
WFCM 2015-P2 Certificates and similar confirmations with respect to ratings of any securities backed by the Empire Mall Companion
Loans; provided, however, that no person will be deemed to be a Qualified Transferee if such person (x) is an embargoed person,
(y) except for General Growth Properties or its affiliates, is or has during the previous seven years been the subject of a bankruptcy
or insolvency proceeding or (z) has been convicted in a criminal proceeding for a felony or any crime involving moral turpitude

Â 
Market Overview and Competition. The
Pineapple Hotel Portfolio Properties are located in Seattle, Washington. According to the appraisal, the Hotel Five Property is
located in downtown Seattle, within one block of Amazon.comâs new 4.1 million square foot world headquarters (which is currently
under construction) and walking distance to the Washington State Convention Center, Puget Sound Central Waterfront, Pike Place
Market and several other major institutions and corporations. The Watertown Hotel Property and the University Inn Property are
each located in the University District Neighborhood of Seattle within walking distance to the University of Washington, University
of Washington Medical Center, and the Childrenâs Hospital and Regional Medical Center. The University of Washington is one
of the oldest and largest state-assisted universities on the west coast with over 40,000 undergraduate and graduate students, and
contributes approximately $12.5 billion to the economy of the State of Washington annually.
Â

of Washington (29,800 employees), Providence Health & Services (20,240 employees), Amazon.com (>10,000 employees), Starbucks
(10,837 employees) and Nordstrom (9,281 employees). Leisure demand is generated by tourism, University of Washington Pacific 12

team) and Century Link Field (home of the Seattle Seahawks), Pike Place Market and the Seattle Center. Meeting and group demand
is generated by a number of sources, most notably the Washington State Convention and Trade Center. The Washington State Convention
and Trade Center comprises 102,201 square feet of dedicated meeting space and 205,700 square feet of heavy load exhibit space.
The Washington State Convention and Trade Center has planned a $1.4 billion expansion slated to begin in early 2017 that is expected
to double its current capacity which is anticipated to create significant hotel demand for the Seattle market.

and group and 34% leisure. Demand segmentation for the Watertown Hotel Property is 60% commercial/university, 26% leisure and 14%

(1)The sponsor
  does not submit data from the University Inn Property to the provider of the third party
  hospitality research reports described above given the University Inn Propertyâs
  proximity to the Watertown Hotel Property. Information in the table above was derived
  by using third party hospitality reports dated September 17, 2015, January 16, 2015 and
  January 17, 2014, the borrowersâ provided trailing 12-month operating statement
  as of August 31, 2015, and year-end 2014 and year-end 2013 operating statements. In the
  appraisal of the University Inn Property dated October 28, 2015, the appraiser concluded
  the competitive set is identical to the Watertown Hotel Property and includes the following
  hotels: Hotel Nexus, Hotel Deca, Silver Cloud Inn Seattle University, Courtyard Seattle
  Downtown Lake Union and Silver Cloud Inn Seattle Lake Union.

Â 
The Borrowers. The borrowers are
Dream Legacy PRU SPE LLC and PHC PRU SPE LLC, each of which is a single purpose entity and Delaware limited liability company with
two independent directors. Dream Legacy PRU SPE LLC, as landlord, leases the hotels to PHC PRU SPE LLC, as tenant under three separate
master operating leases. Legal counsel to the borrowers delivered a non-consolidation opinion in connection with the origination
of the Pineapple Hotel Portfolio Mortgage Loan. Michelle Foreman Barnet is the guarantor of certain non-recourse carveouts under
the Pineapple Hotel Portfolio Mortgage Loan. Michelle Foreman Barnet is the indirect owner of 100% of PHC Pru SPE LLC, the master
operating lessee borrower, and a family trust of which Michelle Foreman Barnet is a trustee (âthe MFB Family Trustâ)
owns a 49% interest in Dream Legacy LLC, which owns 100% of Dream Legacy PRU SPE LLC, the fee borrower. The remaining 51% interest
in Dream Legacy LLC, is owned by a family trust of which Ms. Barnetâs mother, Diane Foreman, is a trustee. A pledge of an
indirect ownership interest in the fee borrower has been permitted as follows: the MFB Family Trust obtained its 49% equity ownership
interest in Dream Legacy LLC from Diane Foreman and, in connection therewith, executed a promissory note in favor of Diane Foreman,
and the MFB Family Trust has pledged its equity ownership interest in Dream Legacy LLC to Diane Foreman to secure such promissory
note.
Â 
The Sponsor. The sponsor is Michelle
Foreman Barnet. Since 1996, Ms. Barnet has served as president of Columbia West Properties (âColumbia Westâ), a company
established in 1988 to manage a family-owned portfolio of commercial and hospitality real estate holdings. As of June 18, 2015,
Columbia West managed real estate assets valued at approximately $350.0 million. In 2010, Pineapple Hospitality Company was formed
specifically to manage the operational aspects of all portfolio hospitality assets, and Ms. Barnet also serves as its president.
Presently, Columbia West and Pineapple Hospitality Company own and manage seven hotels, including four in Seattle (inclusive of
the Pineapple Hotel Portfolio Properties), one in Portland, Oregon, one in San Francisco and one in San Diego.
Â 
Escrows. The loan documents provide
for upfront escrows of $87,785 for real estate taxes, $67,625 for deferred maintenance and $200,000 for a seasonality reserve.
The loan documents provide for ongoing monthly deposits in an amount determined by the lender (currently $43,892) for real estate
taxes, $50,000 for seasonality reserves (during the months of March through October only; capped at $400,000), and FF&E reserves
in an amount equal to one-twelfth of the greater of (i) 4.0% of the estimated total annual gross revenues (as set forth in the
borrowersâ current fiscal year budget approved by the lender) and (ii)Â the amount required to be reserved for capital
expenses and FF&E expenses under any future franchise agreement (or in the management agreement) (initially $56,600 per month
and capped at $2,500,000, subject to the borrowers providing evidence reasonably acceptable to the lender indicating a minimum
of $750,000 has been spent to renovate the 42 rooms located in the original wing of the University Inn

Â 
Property on or prior to
June 30, 2016). No reserve for insurance premiums is required so long as the borrowers maintain insurance under an acceptable blanket
insurance policy, provide proof of payment of renewal premiums and no event of default exists.
Â 
Lockbox and Cash Management. Upon
the occurrence and during the continuance of a Cash Sweep Trigger Event (as defined below), the Pineapple Hotel Portfolio Mortgage
Loan requires that the borrowers or property manager establish a lockbox account and direct all rents to be deposited directly
into such lockbox account. Documents relating to the establishment of the lockbox account were signed at closing. During the continuance
of a Cash Sweep Trigger Event, all cash flow is required to be swept from the lockbox account to a lender-controlled cash management
account. If a Cash Sweep Cure occurs, funds in the lockbox account will be swept to a borrower-controlled operating account
Â 
A âCash Sweep Trigger Eventâ
will occur upon the earlier of (i) the occurrence and continuance of an event of default; or (ii) the amortizing debt service coverage
ratio falling below 1.20x at the end of any calendar quarter.
Â 
A âCash Sweep Cureâ will occur,
with respect to clause (i) above, upon the cure of such event of default; and with respect to clause (ii) above, upon the amortizing
debt service coverage ratio being equal to or greater than 1.25x for two consecutive calendar quarters.
Â 
Property Management. The Pineapple
Hotel Portfolio Properties are managed by an affiliate of the borrowers.
Â 
Assumption. The borrowers have
the ongoing right to transfer the Pineapple Hotel Portfolio Properties provided that certain conditions are satisfied, including
(i) no event of default has occurred and is continuing; (ii) approval of the proposed transferee and transfer by the lender, in
its commercially reasonable discretion, including but not limited to the transfereeâs creditworthiness, financial strength
and real estate management, hotel management and leasing expertise; (iii) if the original guarantor is released (from and after
the date of the transfer) in connection with the transfer, then any guarantorâs obligations are assumed by a person acceptable
to the lender in its reasonable discretion; and (iv) at the lenderâs option, and if required by the procedures of Fitch,
KBRA or Moodyâs, a confirmation from such rating agency that such assumption will not result in a downgrade, withdrawal or
qualification of its ratings assigned to the Series 2015-P2 Certificates.
Â 
Partial Release. Following the
lockout period, the borrowers may obtain the release of any individual property from the lien on the Pineapple Hotel Portfolio
Mortgage Loan upon a third-party sale of such property provided that certain requirements are satisfied, including: (i) defeasance
or prepayment of 120% of the allocated loan amount for such property being sold and, in the case of a prepayment, payment of the
greater of (i) a 1% prepayment premium and (ii) a yield maintenance premium, in each case based on the amount of principal balance
being prepaid; (ii) no event of default then exists under the loan documents; (iii) after giving effect to such release, the amortizing
debt service coverage ratio for the remaining properties shall be no less than the greater of (x) the amortizing debt service coverage
ratio immediately preceding such release and (y) 1.95x; (iv) after giving effect to such release, the loan-to-value ratio of the
remaining properties shall not be greater than the lesser of (a) the loan-to-value ratio of the properties immediately preceding
such release and (b) 60.0% (v) receipt of a REMIC opinion and (vi) at the lenderâs option, receipt of a rating confirmation
from Fitch, KBRA and Moodyâs that such partial release will not result in a requalification, reduction or withdrawal of the
rating assigned to the Series 2015-P2 Certificates by such rating agency. In the event of a prepayment in connection with a partial
release, the loan documents provide that the monthly debt service payment will be reamortized based on the then remaining portion
of the original 30-year amortization period.
Â 
Real Estate Substitution. Not permitted.
Â 
Subordinate and Mezzanine Indebtedness.
Not permitted. See âThe Borrowersâ section above regarding pledge of an indirect ownership interest in the fee
borrower to secure a promissory note between certain indirect owners.
Â 
Ground Lease. None.
Â 
Terrorism Insurance. The loan documents
require that the âall riskâ insurance policy required to be maintained by the borrowers provides coverage for terrorism
in an amount equal to the full replacement cost of the Pineapple Hotel Portfolio Properties, as well as business interruption insurance
covering no less than the 12-month period following the occurrence of a casualty event, together with a 6-month extended period
of indemnity; provided that if the policies contain an exclusion for loss or damage incurred as a result of an act of terrorism
or similar acts of sabotage, the borrowers are required to maintain separate insurance against such loss or damage provided such
insurance (a) is commercially available and (b) can be obtained at a commercially reasonable cost as reasonably determined by lender.
Â 
Earthquake Insurance. The loan
documents do not require earthquake insurance. Seismic reports prepared in connection with the origination of the Pineapple Hotel
Portfolio Mortgage Loan indicated a probable maximum loss of 10.0% for the Hotel Five Property, 7.0% for the Watertown Hotel Property
and 11.0% for the University Inn Property.

(1)The
  downward trend in historical operating performance occurred during the construction of
  a $600.0 million road and infrastructure improvement project that has been underway directly
  east and south of the subject property since 2013. These improvements are scheduled to
  be completed by early 2016; however, there can be no assurance as to the effect of such
  completion or as to future occupancy or rental or reimbursement income.

(2)U/W
  Base Rent includes rent steps through June 2016 totalling $57,492 and income from four
  new leases (50,165 square feet of net rentable area and $1,067,082 in annual base rent)
  that are required to commence paying full rent by February 1, 2016. Escrows for all new
  leases were collected at closing for free rent and outstanding tenant improvements and
  leasing commissions (see âEscrowsâ section).


(3)The
  underwritten economic vacancy is 14.7%. The Adler Office property was 85.6% physically
  occupied as of November 3, 2015.


(4)The
  increase in U/W Net Operating Income from TTM 9/30/2015 is largely due to new leasing
  which includes four new leases that are required to commence paying full rent by February
1, 2016. The full base rent amounts for all tenants have been included in the underwritten
  cash flow (differential of approximately $749,912 from the current combined annual base
  rent amount for such four tenants of $317,170 (which represents the current annual base
  rent required to be paid by Fight Club America, Inc.)).

Â Â 
Lockbox
and Cash Management.  The Adler Office and Adler Industrial Crossed Mortgage Loans are
structured with a hard lockbox and springing cash management. The Adler Office and Adler Industrial Crossed Mortgage Loans
require all rents to be directly deposited by tenants of the Adler Office and Adler Industrial Properties
into the lockbox account. The loan documents also require that all rents received by the borrowers or the property manager be deposited
into the lockbox account within two business days of receipt. With respect to each of the Adler Office and Adler Industrial mortgage
loan, prior to the occurrence of a Cash Sweep Trigger Event (as defined below), all funds from the related lockbox account are
swept into the respective borrowerâs operating account. Upon the occurrence of a Cash Sweep Trigger Event with respect to
the respective mortgage loan, all cash flow is required to be swept from the related lockbox account into a lender-controlled cash
management account.
Â 
With respect
to each of the Adler Office and Adler Industrial mortgage loans, a âCash Sweep Trigger Eventâ shall occur upon
the earlier of: (i) the occurrence and continuance of an event of default or (ii) the amortizing debt service coverage ratio falling
below 1.15x at the end of any calendar quarter. With respect to each of the Adler Office and Adler
Industrial mortgage loans, a Cash Sweep Trigger Event will expire, with respect to clause (i), upon the cure of such event
of default, and with respect to clause (ii), upon the amortizing debt service coverage ratio being at least 1.15x for two consecutive
calendar quarters.
Â 
Property
Management.  The Adler Office and Adler Industrial Properties are managed by an affiliate
of the borrowers.
Â 
Assumption.
The borrowers have the right to transfer the Adler Office and Adler Industrial Properties,
in whole but not in part, provided that certain conditions are satisfied, including (i) no event of default has occurred
and is continuing; (ii) approval of the proposed transferee and transfer by the lender, in its commercially reasonable discretion,
including, but not limited to, the proposed transfereeâs creditworthiness, financial strength, and real estate management
and leasing expertise; (iii) if the original guarantor is released (from and after the date of the transfer) in connection
with the transfer, then any guarantorâs obligations are assumed by a person acceptable to the lender in its reasonable
discretion; and (iv) at the lenderâs option, and if required by the procedures of Fitch, KBRA or Moodyâs, a confirmation
from such rating agency that the transfer will not result in a downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of the respective ratings
assigned to the Series 2015-P2 Certificates by such rating agency.
Â 
Partial
Release. At any time following the lockout date and prior to the open period, the respective borrowers have the right to obtain
the release of any release parcel within the Adler Office and Adler Industrial Properties (see âThe Propertiesâ section
above for a table identifying the release parcels) from the lien of the Adler Office and Adler Industrial Crossed Mortgage Loans
in connection with a bona fide sale to a third party and subject to the terms and conditions of the loan documents, which
include but are not limited to: (i) the amortizing debt service coverage ratio for the Adler Office and Adler Industrial Crossed
Mortgage Loans (on a combined basis) after the release is no less than the greater of (a) the amortizing debt service coverage
ratio (on a combined basis) immediately preceding the release and (b) 1.25x; (ii) the loan-to-value ratio for the Adler Office
and Adler Industrial Crossed Mortgage Loans (on a combined basis) after the release does not exceed the lesser of (1) the loan-to-value
ratio (on a combined basis) immediately preceding the release and (2) 64.0%; (iii) rollover for the remaining Adler Office or Adler
Industrial Properties, as applicable, in any given year of the remainder of the loan term shall not be greater than 30% of net
rentable area; (iv) defeasance of a portion of the loan equal to the greater of (A) 115% of the allocated loan amount of the property
being released, and (b) 100% of the net proceeds received in connection with the related sale; (v) receipt of a REMIC opinion;
and (vi) at the lenderâs option, a confirmation from Fitch, KBRA and Moodyâs that the transfer will not result in a
downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of the rating assigned to the Series 2015-P2 Certificates by such rating agency.
Â 
In addition, each of the Adler Office and
Adler Industrial Crossed Mortgage Loans may be separately defeased in full, without full defeasance of the other such mortgage
loan upon satisfaction of conditions similar to those set forth above. Upon the full defeasance of either the Adler Office mortgage
loan or Adler Industrial mortgage loan, the related Mortgaged Properties securing the defeased mortgage loan will be released.
In addition, the related loan documents provide that any funds remaining in the upfront reserve for future tenant improvement and
leasing commissions under the defeased mortgage loan are to be retained by the lender as security for the remaining mortgage loan
and deposited into the related reserve under the remaining mortgage loan and held and disbursed in accordance with the remaining
mortgage loanâs documents.
Â

Â 
Escrows.
The loan documents provide for upfront reserves in an amount of $178,371 for payment-in-lieu of real estate taxes, $33,867
for insurance and $54,835 for deferred maintenance.
Â 
On
each due date, the borrowers are required to pay to deposit: (i) one-twelfth of the taxes (or payment-in-lieu thereof) that the
lender estimates will be payable over the then succeeding 12-month period (initially $89,186), (ii) an insurance reserve in an
amount equal to one-twelfth of the amount that the lender estimates will be necessary to pay insurance premiums over the then
succeeding 12-month period, (initially $16,934) and (iii) a replacement reserve in the amount of $9,067.
Â 
Lockbox
and Cash Management. The Harbor Pointe Apartments Whole Loan documents require a springing lockbox with springing cash management.
The Harbor Pointe Apartments Whole Loan documents require the borrowers, upon the first occurrence of a Trigger Period, to (or
to direct the property manager to) deposit within two business days following receipt of all revenue derived from the Harbor Pointe
Apartments Property and all other money payable to the borrowers with respect to the Harbor Pointe Apartments Property directly
to a lender-controlled lockbox account and to send a notice to all commercial tenants directing them to pay all rents directly
into the lender controlled lockbox account. So long as a Trigger Period is not in effect, all funds in the lockbox account are
required to be swept and remitted on each business day to the borrowersâ operating account. During the continuance of a
Trigger Period, all funds in the lockbox account are required to be transferred on each business day to a lender-controlled cash
management account. If no event of default under the loan documents is continuing, applied to pay debt service and operating expenses
of the Harbor Pointe Apartments Property and to fund required reserves in accordance with the loan documents. After the foregoing
disbursements are made and so long as a Harbor Pointe Apartments Trigger Period is continuing, all excess cash is trapped in an
excess cash account and held as additional collateral for the Harbor Pointe Apartments Whole Loan. During the continuance of an
event of default under the loan documents, the lender may apply any funds in the cash management account to amounts payable under
the Harbor Pointe Apartments Loan or toward the payment of expenses of the Harbor Pointe Apartments Property, in such order of
priority as the lender may determine.
Â 
A
âTrigger Periodâ means a period commencing upon the earliest of (i) the occurrence and continuance of an event of
default or (ii) the trailing 12-month debt service coverage ratio being less than 1.25x and ending, with respect to a Harbor Pointe
Apartments Trigger Period clause by (i) above, upon the cure of such event of default; and with respect to a Trigger Period caused
by (ii) above, upon the debt service coverage ratio being equal to or greater than 1.30x for two consecutive calendar quarters.
Â 
Property
Management. The Harbor Pointe Apartments Property is currently managed by Alliance Southwest, LLC.
Â 
PILOT
Program. The Harbor Pointe Apartments Property is operating under a PILOT Program that expires in 2039 under which the
borrowers do not pay real estate taxes and instead make quarterly payments to the city of Bayonne. From January 2016 through
December 2021 the annual charge will be the greater of the Base Amount (as defined below) or 20% of the taxes otherwise due
on the land and improvements; and from January 2022 through December 2027, the greater of the Base Amount or 40% of the taxes
otherwise due on the land and improvements. In addition to the annual charge, a 2% administrative fee based on the annual
charge is payable to the city of Bayonne. The payments under the PILOT Program (âBase Amountâ) are calculated as
10% of 80% of annual gross revenue of the Harbor Pointe Apartments Property through December 2025 and 10% of the full annual
gross revenue of the Harbor Pointe Apartments Property thereafter and until the expiration of the program. The
borrowersâ interest in the PILOT Agreement may be transferred to a successor owner (including a mortgagee in
foreclosure) upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, including, without limitation, that the transferee forms an urban renewal entity in accordance with the New Jersey Long Term Tax Exemption
Law and that the transferee agrees to abide by all terms and conditions of the PILOT Program.

discounted payoff was effected, during the period between 2007 through 2012. See âDescription of the Mortgage Pool â
Loan Purpose; Default History, Bankruptcy Issues and Other Proceedingsâ in the Prospectus.
Â 
Escrows.
The loan documents provide for upfront escrows in the amount of $88,889 for deferred maintenance, $800,000 for tenant improvements
and leasing commissions for space other than Staples (the âGeneral TI/LC Reserveâ), $694,723 for real estate taxes
and $64,203 for insurance premiums. The loan documents require ongoing monthly deposits in the amount determined by the lender
for real estate taxes and insurance (currently $141,872 for real estate taxes and $16,051 for insurance premiums), $21,517 for
replacement reserves and $32,250 into the General TI/LC Reserve (subject to a cap of $500,000).
Â 
The
loan documents require escrows to cover the costs of tenant improvements and leasing commissions for the Staples space (the âStaples
TI/LC Reserveâ) consisting of monthly deposits of $33,333 for the first 15 months of the loan term and $83,333 beginning
on the first payment date 12 months prior to Staplesâ lease expiration (subject to a combined cap of $1,500,000). In lieu
of the $83,333 monthly deposits, a $1,000,000 letter of credit may be provided by the borrowers no later than 13 months prior
to Staples lease expiration. The loan documents also require monthly deposits of $100,000 starting on the first payment date on
or after the date that is 18 months prior to a subsequent lease expiration for Staples (or for any replacement tenant that leases
all of Staplesâ space) until such time as funds have accumulated to $1,800,000 for the reimbursement of tenant improvements
and leasing commissions for the Staples space; provided that in lieu of such deposits an $1,800,000 letter of credit may be provided
by the borrowers. In addition, if only a portion of the Staples space has been leased to a replacement tenant(s), monthly deposits
are required starting 18 months prior to the then-scheduled expiration date of such lease in an amount equal to $0.16 per square
foot for such tenantâs space (provided that if such replacement lease is for less than five years, the required deposit
will be equal to the foregoing amount multiplied by the number of years for such lease divided by five). If a Cash Sweep Trigger
Event is continuing, and funds in the cash management account are insufficient to pay monthly debt service payments on the Heritage
Industrial Portfolio Whole Loan, and no event of default exists, at the borrowersâ request, the lender is required to apply
funds in the Staples TI/LC Reserve to pay monthly debt service payments; provided that the maximum aggregate amount of such reserve
permitted to be applied for such purpose is $480,000.

HERITAGE
  INDUSTRIAL PORTFOLIOÂ 


Â 
Lockbox
and Cash Management. The Heritage Industrial Portfolio Whole Loan is structured with a hard lockbox and springing cash management.
The Heritage Industrial Portfolio Whole Loan requires all rents to be directly deposited by tenants of the Heritage Industrial
Portfolio Properties into the lockbox account. The loan documents also require that, the borrowers or property manager deposit
all rents into the lockbox account within three business days of receipt. Prior to the occurrence of a Cash Sweep Trigger Event
(as defined below), all funds in the lockbox account are swept into the borrowersâ operating account. Upon the occurrence
and during the continuance of a Cash Sweep Trigger Event, all cash flow is required to be swept from the lockbox account into
a lender-controlled cash management account.
Â 
A
âCash Sweep Trigger Eventâ means the occurrence of any one or more of the following as determined by lender in its
sole discretion: (a) an event of default, (b) the amortizing debt service coverage ratio is less than 1.10x as of the last day
of any calendar quarter for such quarter, or (c) Staples (i) ceases to operate its business from all or any material portion of
the Staples space for more than 30 consecutive days, (ii) becomes the subject of any proceeding or action relating to its bankruptcy,
reorganization or other arrangement pursuant to federal bankruptcy law or any similar federal or state law or files for bankruptcy
or other insolvency proceedings, (iii) provides notice of its intent to terminate the Staples lease, or (iv) defaults under any
monetary or material non-monetary term of the Staples lease and such monetary or material non-monetary default continues after
any applicable notice and cure period and such monetary or material non-monetary default would allow the borrowers to terminate
the Staples lease.
Â 
A
âCash Sweep Cureâ will occur, with respect to clause (a) above, upon the cure of such event of default; with respect
to clause (b) above, upon the amortizing debt service coverage ratio being equal to or greater than 1.15x for two consecutive
calendar quarters; with respect to clause (c) above, upon the amortizing debt service coverage ratio being equal to or greater
than 1.20x for two consecutive calendar quarters; provided, however, that, such Cash Sweep Cure set forth in this definition shall
be subject to the following conditions, (x) no event of default shall have occurred and be continuing under the cash management
agreement or any of the loan documents, (y) no other Cash Sweep Trigger Event shall have occurred and be continuing, and (z) the
borrowers shall have paid all of the lenderâs expenses in connection with such Cash Sweep Cure including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneyâs fees and expenses.
Â 
Property
Management. The Heritage Industrial Portfolio Properties are managed by affiliates of the sponsors.
Â 
Assumption.
The borrowers have the ongoing right to transfer the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Properties provided that certain conditions
are satisfied, including (i) no event of default has occurred and is continuing; (ii) approval of the proposed transferee and
transfer by the lender, in its commercially reasonable discretion, including but not limited to the transfereeâs creditworthiness,
financial strength and real estate management and leasing expertise; (iii) if the original guarantor is released (from and after
the date of the transfer) in connection with the transfer, then any guarantorâs obligations are assumed by a person acceptable
to lender in its reasonable discretion; and (iv) at the lenderâs option, and if required by the procedures of Fitch, KBRA
or Moodyâs, a confirmation from such rating agency that such assumption will not result in a downgrade, withdrawal or qualification
of the ratings assigned by it to the Series 2015-P2 Certificates, along with similar confirmations from each applicable rating
agency rating any securities backed by the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Companion Loan.
Â 
Purchase
Option. Midwest Express Inc., the sole tenant at the 16725 Square Drive property, has the right to purchase such property
at any time after the 25th payment date after the securitization of the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Whole Loan, for a purchase
price equal to $4,000,000 plus all applicable defeasance costs.
Â 
Partial
Release. Following the lockout period, the borrowers are permitted to obtain the partial release of any of the Heritage Industrial
Portfolio Properties in connection with a partial defeasance, subject to certain conditions including: (i) the principal balance
defeased equals the greater of (a) 120% of the allocated loan amount for the mortgaged properties located in Pennsylvania (2294
Molly Pitcher Highway; 1001 & 1011 Air Park Drive) and Guilderland, New York (8 Northeastern Industrial Park; 21 Northeastern
Industrial Park and 22 Northeastern Industrial Park) or 110% of the allocated loan amount for all other mortgaged properties;
and (b) an amount equal to 100% of the net proceeds of the sale of the released property; (ii) the remaining portfolio, following
release, would have (x) an amortizing debt service coverage ratio utilizing annual net operating income (without deduction for
tenant improvements, leasing commissions or replacement reserves) from leases on the remaining premises that have remaining terms
of at least 18 months of at least 1.25x and (y) a loan-to-value ratio of not more than 75.0%; (iv) at the lenderâs option,
the lender has received confirmation from Fitch, KBRA and Moodyâs that such release will not result in a downgrade, withdrawal
or qualification of the respective ratings assigned to the Series 2015-P2 Certificates, along with similar confirmations from
each rating agency rating any securities backed by the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Companion Loan; and (v) receipt of a REMIC
opinion.
Â 
Real
Estate Substitution. Not permitted.
Â 
Subordinate
and Mezzanine Indebtedness. Not permitted.

Insurance. The loan documents require that the âall riskâ insurance policy required to be maintained by the borrowers
provide coverage for terrorism in an amount equal to the full replacement cost of the Heritage Industrial Portfolio Properties
and business interruption insurance covering no less than the 12-month period following the occurrence of a casualty event, together
with a six-month extended period of indemnity; provided that if the policies contain an exclusion for loss or damage incurred
as a result of an act of terrorism or similar acts of sabotage, the borrowers are required to maintain separate insurance against
such loss or damage provided such insurance (a) is commercially available and (b) can be obtained at a commercially reasonable
cost as reasonably determined by lender.

for the payment of, among other things, debt service and property operating expenses, and for the funding of monthly escrows,

collateral by the lender until the expiration of the applicable Anchorage Marriott Downtown Trigger Period after which it is returned

than 1.35x for two consecutive calendar quarters; (c) commencing upon the occurrence of a Franchise Agreement Trigger Event (as
defined below) and continuing until the borrower has cured all defaults under the franchise agreement, the borrower and the franchisor
have reaffirmed the franchise agreement, the Anchorage Marriott Downtown Property continues to be operated pursuant to the franchise
agreement and all permits applicable to the franchise agreement are in full force and effect; (d) commencing upon the non-delivery
of an estoppel attesting to an extension of the franchise agreement or its replacement with a qualifying agreement for a term
no shorter than expiring three years after the maturity date of the Anchorage Marriott Downtown Whole Loan, which franchise agreement
or qualified replacement is in full force and effect without defaults thereunder, and for which any required renovation reserve
has been deposited, on or before eighteen months prior to the expiration of the franchise agreement, and continuing until the
delivery of such estoppel; (e) commencing upon the occurrence of a bankruptcy action of the property manager and continuing until

Â 
The
Borrower. The borrower is CW Hotel Limited Partnership, an Ohio limited partnership and single purpose entity with two independent
directors. Legal counsel to the borrower delivered a non-consolidation opinion in connection with the origination of the JW Marriott
Santa Monica Le Merigot Whole Loan. Columbia Sussex Corporation and CSC Holdings, LLC are the guarantors of certain nonrecourse
carveouts under the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Whole Loan. The guarantors are required to maintain a combined net worth
of $85.0 million and combined liquidity of $10.0 million through the term of the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Whole Loan.
Â 
The
Sponsor. The sponsor is William J. Yung III. The sponsor is an experienced developer, owner and operator of hotel properties.
William J. Yung founded Columbia Sussex Corporation in 1972. Columbia Sussex Corporation is a large privately owned hotel company
and the largest domestic full-service Marriott franchisee with a portfolio that consisting of 35 total hotels (11,502 keys), 27
(8,318 keys) of which are Marriott flags. See also âDescription of the Mortgage Pool â Loan Purpose; Default History,
Bankruptcy Issues and Other Proceedingsâ in the Prospectus.
Â 
Escrows.
The loan documents provide for upfront escrows in the amount of $533,964 for real estate taxes, $70,120 for insurance premiums,
$272,250 for current ground rent payments and $2,500 to be paid to any franchisor for fees related to the issuance of a replacement
comfort letter with respect to the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Property. The loan documents also provide for monthly escrows
in an amount equal to $66,746 for real estate taxes, $23,373 for insurance premiums and $136,125 for current ground rent payments.
The loan documents provide for an upfront escrow in the amount of $389,819 for a seasonality reserve and an ongoing amount which
is equal to 110% of the quotient of (x) the aggregate amount by which operating income at the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot
Property for the calendar month is insufficient to establish a debt service coverage ratio of 1.00x based on the then-current
annual budget (âNegative Monthly Amountâ) for the 12-month period divided by (y) the number of months for which there
is no Negative Monthly Amount, based on the then-current seasonality annual budget.
Â 
The
loan documents also provide for an upfront escrow in the amount of $9,881,593 for a rent adjustment reserve which is held as additional
cash collateral for the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Whole Loan until the determination of the new annual base rent pursuant
to the terms of the ground lease (see âGround Leaseâ section). After the ground rent determination date and provided
that no event of default exists under the loan documents (i) the Rent Adjustment Reserve Surplus (as defined below) may be disbursed
to the borrower, provided that, in the event that an event of default exists under the mezzanine loan documents, the Rent Adjustment
Reserve Surplus will instead be paid to the mezzanine lender, and (ii) at the lenderâs election, rent adjustment reserves
remaining after deduction of the Rent Adjustment Reserve Surplus may be used to pay down the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot
Whole Loan rather than be held as additional collateral. If a portion of the reserve is used to pay down the JW Marriott Santa
Monica Le Merigot Whole Loan, the mezzanine borrower is required to simultaneously proportionately pay down the mezzanine loan.
Â 
âRent
Adjustment Reserve Surplusâ is defined as 9.0% multiplied by the difference between the $37,200,000 (a value deemed to be
the maximum probable reset value of the land underlying the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Property) and the fair market
value of the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Property at the time of the next ground rent reset, divided by 9.29% (representing
the closing debt yield for the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Whole Loan and Mezzanine Loan); provided that, if the fair
market value of the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Property at the ground rent reset is equal to or less than $27,000,000,
the entire rent adjustment reserve constitutes Rent Adjustment Reserve Surplus.
Â 
No
property improvement plan (âPIPâ) was required under the franchise agreement at origination. In the event that a PIP
is required by a franchisor, the borrower will be required to deposit an amount equal to 120% of the costs of the related PIP
work (as estimated by the lender in its reasonable discretion) (A) in the case of any existing or renewal franchise agreement,
prior to the required 
Â 

A-3-74
Â 
Â 


JW MARRIOTT SANTA MONICA LE MERIGOT

Â Â 
commencement date of any PIP imposed thereunder and (B) in the case of any new franchise agreement on or
prior to the date such new franchise agreement is executed and delivered. Additionally, if 18 months prior to the expiration of
the franchise agreement (âFranchise Renewal Dateâ) a Franchise Renewal Event (as defined below) has not occurred,
within 12 months of the Franchise Renewal Date, the borrower is required to post a letter of credit or cash in amount equal to
120% of the estimated PIP costs, less any sums then on deposit in the FF&E escrow and the PIP escrow.
Â 
The
loan documents require an ongoing monthly FF&E reserve in an amount equal to the greater of (a) the FF&E Payment (as defined
below) and (b) the amount of the deposit (if any) then required by the franchisor on account of FF&E under the franchise agreement.
Â 
âFF&E
Paymentâ means, with respect to the monthly payment date, an amount equal to one-twelfth of 5% of the greater (x) the annual
gross revenues for the hotel related operations at the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Property for the immediately preceding
calendar year as reasonably determined by the lender and (y) the projected annual gross revenues for the hotel related operations
at the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Property for the calendar year in which such monthly payment date occurs as set forth
in, generally, (i) during the continuance of a JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Trigger Period or JW Marriott Santa Monica
Le Merigot Mezzanine Trigger Period (see âLockbox and Cash Managementâ section), the approved annual budget or (ii)
otherwise, the annual budget approved for such calendar year by the mezzanine lender pursuant to the mezzanine loan documents,
in each case as more particularly set for in the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Loan documents. The FF&E reserve monthly
deposit is initially determined for the balance of the 2015 calendar year as of the origination date and thereafter adjusted annually.
The lender may require the borrower to increase the monthly deposits required if (1) an JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Trigger
Period is continuing and the lender determines in its reasonable discretion that an increase is necessary to maintain proper maintenance
and operation of the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Property and/or (2) the lender determines in its reasonable discretion
that an increase is necessary to reflect increased FF&E expenditures required under the franchise agreement and/or set forth
in any amendment to the most recently determined approved annual budget.
Â 
A
âFranchise Renewal Eventâ means the lenderâs receipt of evidence reasonably acceptable to the lender (which
such evidence must include, without limitation, a duly executed estoppel certificate from the applicable franchisor) that (i)
the related franchise agreement has not been extended or replaced by a new franchise agreement in accordance with the terms of
the loan documents, in each case, for a term expiring no earlier than three years after the maturity date of the JW Marriott Santa
Monica Le Merigot Whole Loan, (ii) such franchise agreement (as so extended) or such replacement franchise agreement, as applicable,
is in full force and effect with no defaults thereunder, and (iii) to the extent a PIP is required in connection with the foregoing,
a deposit has been made to the PIP escrow in accordance with the terms of the loan documents.
Â 
Lockbox
and Cash Management. The JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Whole Loan requires a lender-controlled lockbox, which is already
in place, and that the borrower directs all credit card companies to pay all sums directly into such lockbox account. The loan
documents also require that all funds received by the borrower be deposited into such lockbox account, and all funds in the lockbox
account are swept directly into the cash management account for the payment of debt service and property operating expenses and
funding of reserves. Prior to the occurrence of a JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Trigger Period or a JW Marriott Santa Monica
Le Merigot Mezzanine Trigger Period (as defined below), any excess is released to the borrower. During a JW Marriott Santa Monica
Le Merigot Trigger Period, (i) to the extent the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Trigger Period was caused solely by the failure
of a Franchise Renewal Event to occur on or before eighteen months prior to the expiration of the franchise agreement, excess
cash flow will be deposited into the PIP reserve and, (ii) to the extent the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Trigger Period
was caused by any event other than as described in the preceding clause (i), excess cash flow will be held as additional collateral
by the lender. To the extent a JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Mezzanine Trigger Period has occurred and is then continuing
and no JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Trigger Period exists, excess cash flow will be deposited an account which is distributed
to the mezzanine lender for the purpose of paying monthly debt service on the mezzanine loan.
Â 
A
âJW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Trigger Periodâ will commence upon the earlier of any of the following: (a) an
event of default; (b) the debt yield falling below 8.25%; (c) the borrower defaulting under, providing notice of termination of,
or the cancellation or expiration of the franchise agreement; (d) the borrower failing to deliver evidence (including an estoppel
from the franchisor) relating to the extension of the franchise agreement or its replacement with a qualifying agreement for a
term no shorter than expiring three years after the maturity date of the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Whole Loan, which
franchise agreement or qualified replacement is in full force and effect without defaults thereunder, and for which any required
renovation reserve has been deposited, on or before eighteen months prior to the expiration of the franchise agreement; (e) a
bankruptcy action of the manager.
Â 
A
JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Trigger Period will cease with respect to clause (a) above, upon the cure or the lenderâs
waiver of such event of default; with respect to clause (b), upon the achievement of a debt yield equal to or greater than 8.5%
for two consecutive calendar quarters; with respect to clause (c), if the borrower (i) has cured all defaults under the franchise
agreement, the borrower and the franchisor have reaffirmed the franchise agreement, the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Property
continues to be operated pursuant to the franchise agreement and all permits applicable to the franchise agreement are in full
force and effect or (ii) has flagged the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Property pursuant to a replacement franchise agreement
in accordance with the loan documents; with respect to clause (d), upon the delivery of such evidence; and with respect to clause
(e), if the manager is replaced in accordance with the loan documents.
Â 
A
âJW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Mezzanine Trigger Periodâ commences upon the date that the lender has received
written notice from the mezzanine lender that an event of default exists under the mezzanine loan documents.
Â 
Property
Management. The JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Property is managed by an affiliate of the borrower.
Â

Â 
Â 


JW MARRIOTT SANTA MONICA LE MERIGOT

Â Â 
Assumption.
The borrower has a one-time right to transfer the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Property provided that certain conditions
are satisfied, including (i) no event of default has occurred and is continuing; (ii) if requested by the lender, rating agency
confirmation from Fitch, KBRA and Moodyâs that the transfer will not result in a downgrade, withdrawal or qualification
of the respective ratings assigned to the Series WFCM 2015-P2 Certificates, along with similar confirmations from each rating
agency rating any securities backed by the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Companion Loan; (iii) the borrower pays a non-refundable
fee of one percent of the then outstanding principal balance of the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Whole Loan; (iv) after
the applicable transfer, the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Property will continue to be operated pursuant to a franchise
agreement permitted under the loan documents; and (v) if the mezzanine loan is outstanding, the mezzanine lender has confirmed
the mezzanine borrower has complied with related requirements of the mezzanine loan agreement.
Â 
Partial
Release. Not permitted.
Â 
Real
Estate Substitution. Not permitted.
Â 
Subordinate
and Mezzanine Indebtedness. Concurrently with the funding of the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Whole Loan, SMHF Cayman
Hotel, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, funded a mezzanine loan in the amount of $17,000,000 to CP Santa Monica Mezz,
LLC, as mezzanine borrower, which is the direct owner of 99% of the limited liability company interests in the borrower. The mezzanine
loan is secured by a pledge of the mezzanine borrowerâs 99% limited liability company interests in the borrower and 100%
of the limited liability company interests in the general partner of the borrower (which owns a 1% limited liability company interest
in the borrower). The mezzanine loan carries an interest rate of 9.500% per annum and is co-terminus with the JW Marriott Santa
Monica Le Merigot Whole Loan. The mezzanine loan is interest only for the term of the loan and is subject to a customary intercreditor
agreement with the lender.
Â 
Ground
Lease. The borrower for the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Property is a tenant under a ground lease underlying the entire
JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Property. The current term of the ground lease expires on October 15, 2086, without any option
to renew. The annual ground rent for the five year period ending on October 31, 2015 was $1,316,000. The annual rent to be paid
by the lessee equals 9.0% of the fair market value of the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Property with rent resets to occur
every five years. The next reset is to be effective as of November 1, 2015. As of the date of origination, the annual ground rent
to be paid pursuant to the aforementioned rent reset had not yet been determined. The lender has taken a reserve in the amount
of $9,881,593 (see âEscrowsâ section), a portion of which may, at the lenderâs option, be used to partially
prepay the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Whole Loan in the event that the fair market value used for the purpose of determining
the annual ground rent exceeds the underwritten fair market value of the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Property.
Â 
Terrorism
Insurance. The borrower is required to maintain an âall-riskâ insurance policy that provides coverage for terrorism
in an amount equal to the full replacement cost of the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Property. The loan documents also require
business interruption coverage no less than the 18âmonth period following the occurrence of a casualty event, together with
a six-month extended period of indemnity. The âall-riskâ policy containing terrorism insurance is required to contain
a deductible that is acceptable to the lender and is no larger than $100,000.
Â 
Earthquake
Insurance. The loan documents do not require earthquake insurance. Seismic reports prepared in connection with the origination
of the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot Whole Loan indicated a probable maximum loss of 12.0% with respect to the JW Marriott
Santa Monica Le Merigot Property.

Â 
The
Borrower. The borrower is 444 Warehouse Associates, L.P., a single purpose entity and New York limited partnership. Legal
counsel to the borrower provided a non-consolidation opinion in connection with the origination of the Keeperâs Self Storage
Manhattan Mortgage Loan. David Haver is the guarantor of certain nonrecourse carveouts under the Keeperâs Self Storage Manhattan
Mortgage Loan.
Â 
The
Sponsors. The sponsors are David Haver and David Haver 2007 GRAT. Mr. Haver has been involved in the self-storage business
since the 1980s, having built, converted, bought, and sold numerous properties over the years. Mr. Haverâs schedule of real
estate owned includes commercial properties located in New York, New Jersey, and Florida. His company, Keepers Storage, owns and
operates facilities in New York, Staten Island, Nyack, Jersey City, and Bergenfield with total estimated market value of $86 million.
Â 
Escrows.
The loan documents provide for upfront escrows in the amount of $181,750 for deferred maintenance. The loan documents also
provide for ongoing monthly reserves in the amount of $31,109 for real estate taxes and $1,119 for replacement reserves (subject
to a cap of $67,125). At the option of the lender, if the liability or casualty policy maintained by the borrower does not constitute
an approved blanket or umbrella insurance policy under the loan documents, the borrower
will fund an insurance reserve in an amount equal to one-twelfth of the amount that the lender estimates will be necessary to
pay insurance premiums over the then succeeding 12-month period.
Â 
Lockbox
and Cash Management. Upon the occurrence of a Cash Trap Event Period (as defined below), the borrower will be required to
establish a lender-controlled lockbox account and direct all credit card companies and banks to deposit all rents directly into
such lockbox account and direct the manager to deposit all revenue derived from the Keeperâs Self Storage Manhattan Property
in the lockbox account. During a Cash Trap Event Period, all funds on deposit in the lockbox account are swept daily to
a lender-controlled cash management account, where the funds are used to pay debt service and operating expenses and to fund required
reserves. Excess funds in the lender-controlled cash management account are disbursed to the borrower if no Cash Trap Event Period
exists or held by the lender as an excess cash flow reserve for so long as a Cash Trap Event Period exists.
Â 
A âCash
Trap Event Periodâ will commence upon the earlier of (i) the occurrence and continuance of an event of default; and (ii)
the debt service coverage ratio for the trailing 12-month period falling below 1.20x at the end of any calendar month.
A Cash Trap Event Period will expire, with regard to clause (i), upon the cure of such event of default; and with regard to clause,
(ii) upon the debt service coverage ratio being equal to or greater than 1.25x for two consecutive calendar quarters.
Â 
Property
Management. The Keeperâs Self Storage Manhattan Property is managed by an affiliate of the borrower.
Â 
Assumption.
The borrower has the right to transfer the Keeperâs Self Storage Manhattan Property at any time other than the 60 days
prior to and following any secondary market transaction, provided that no event of default has occurred and is continuing and
certain other conditions are satisfied, including (i) the lenderâs reasonable determination that the proposed transferee
and guarantor satisfy the lenderâs credit review and underwriting standards, taking into consideration transferee experience,
financial strength and general business standing; (ii) execution of a recourse guaranty with respect to such transfer and an environmental
indemnity by an affiliate of the transferee; (iii) if requested by the lender, rating agency confirmation; and (iv) payment of
an assumption fee.

  is continuing; (ii) Veolia pays taxes prior to delinquency; (iii) no event of default
  under the Veolia lease has occurred; and (iv) the borrower provides the lender with acceptable
  evidence that taxes have been paid.

(4)The
  appraiser also concluded to an unencumbered land value of $59.6 million, which assumes
  the highest and best use of a multifamily residential development, which value would
  be subject to obtaining necessary public and private approvals. Assuming this land value,
  the Cut-off Date LTV Ratio and the LTV Ratio at Maturity or ARD would be 50.3%.
Â 
The
2052 Century Park East mortgage loan is evidenced by a single promissory note that is secured by a first mortgage encumbering
an approximate 1.6-acre parcel of land that is improved with the Century City Central Plant located in Los Angeles, California
(the â2052 Century Park East Propertyâ). The 2052 Century Park East Property is ground leased to two tenants: Trigen-LA
Energy Corporation (99.98% of the underwritten base rent) and Century City Medical Plaza Land Co. (âCentury City Medicalâ)
(0.02% of the underwritten base rent), which have ground lease expirations in 2041 and 2039, respectively. Built in 1965 and 1973
and last renovated in 2007, the Century City Central Plant is operated by Trigen-LA Energy Corporation, which was acquired by
Veolia Energy North America in 2007. The Century City Central Plant has a 22,000 ton capacity and supplies chilled water, hot
water and/or steam to eight properties. Unlike typical commercial properties, the customers of the Century City Central Plant
do not have the on-site equipment required to provide to their tenants the steam, hot water and chilled water necessary for heating,
ventilation and air conditioning. The Century City Central Plant provides those properties with hot water and chilled water through
an underground pipeline network with rates set through customer contracts. Century City Medical also ground leases a narrow strip
of land along the shared access driveway to store equipment including a fuel tank, emergency generator, oxygen tanks and other
tanks for medical gases. The 2052 Century Park East Property benefits from strong demographics with an estimated 2015 population
within a one-, three- and five-mile radius of the 2052 Century Park East Property of 25,809, 286,616 and 691,364, respectively;
while the 2015Â  estimated average household income within the same radii was $128,176, $100,357 and $96,185, respectively.
As of October 19, 2015, the 2052 Century Park East Property was 100.0% ground leased to two tenants.

(1)The
  loan documents do not require monthly escrows for real estate taxes so long as (i) there
  is no cancelation, termination or expiration of the Ground Sublease (as defined below)
  between the borrower and Home Depot USA, Inc. (âHome Depotâ), (ii) there
  is no continuing monetary or other material event of default by Home Depot under the
  Ground Sublease, and (iii) Home Depot continues to be obligated under the Ground Sublease
  to maintain and pay taxes and assessments directly.



(2)Ongoing
  monthly reserves for insurance are waived so long as (i) there is no cancelation, termination
  or expiration of the Ground Sublease, (ii) there is no continuing monetary or other material
  event of default by Home Depot under the Ground Sublease, and (iii) Home Depot continues
  to be obligated under the Ground Sublease to maintain property insurance. In addition
  Home Depot may self insure if it (i) maintains a minimum net worth of $100.0 million;
  (ii) is in compliance with the self-insurance requirements of, and is not in default
  under, the Ground Sublease; and (iii) provides lender written evidence confirming its
  agreement to self-insure. In such event no insurance premiums would be due, and therefore
  no insurance reserve required.



(3)Ongoing
  TI/LC reserves or capital improvements reserves are not required unless there is a continuing
  âCash Sweep Trigger Event,â which means (i) Home Depot goes dark; (ii) subleases
  substantially all its premises; (iii) is downgraded below BBB-/Baa3 (collectively, the
  âPartial Sweep Eventsâ); (iv) fails to rebuild after a casualty; (v) is bankrupt/insolvent;
  (vi) defaults under, terminates its lease; (vii) fails to renew its lease nine months
  prior to expiration; or (viii) an event of default. Partial Sweep Events require a sweep
  of $81,250 during the interest only period, and $52,000 thereafter (each capped at $30.00
  per square foot) into a lender controlled cash management account; all other Cash Sweep
  Trigger Events require a full sweep.



(4)See
  âCash Flow Analysisâ section.

fee and leasehold interest in land located in Jamaica, New York (the âHome Depot Jamaica Propertyâ), in the
central section of the Borough of Queens. The land consists of 3.0 acres within nine contiguous parcels. Six parcels are
owned fee simple (2.3 acres or approximately 76.0% of the net rentable area) and three parcels (0.7 acres or approximately
24.0% of the net rentable area), which are located under the Home Depot parking garage, loading docks and access drives are
ground leased parcels. Each ground lease has an initial Â term that expires September 1, 2025 with five five-year
extension options (provided, that in the case of one ground lease, the final extension option is for four years and 364
days).Â  See âDescription of the Mortgage Pool â Mortgage Pool Characteristics â Fee & Leasehold

building on the site. Home Depot has four five-year extension options, as well as a final option through June 17, 2053.

enclosed/covered, a separate contractor pick-up area, two entrances/exits, and a roof level containing a garden center and
outdoor product sales area. The Home Depot Jamaica Property features 250 parking spaces resulting in a parking ratio of 2.4
spaces per 1,000 square feet of net rentable area. The building and other improvements are owned by Home Depot. The

  U/W Base Rent and Annual U/W Base Rent PSF reflect Home Depotâs contractual rent
  increase that occurs in January 2016. Home Depotâs in-place annual rent is $2,620,000
  ($24.91 per square foot). In addition, $144,100 of straight-lined rent increases were

  Depot has four, five-year lease extension options, and one, 7.8-year renewal option to
  extend the lease to June 17, 2053. All renewal options require nine monthsâ notice;
  provided that if the tenant fails to give notice within such time limit, its right to
  renew continues until the earlier of (x) 95 days prior to the expiration of the current
  term and (y) 30 days after the borrower gives the tenant notice of its election to terminate
  the renewal option. Home Depot has the right to terminate in the last two years of the
  term, if greater than 25% of the building is damaged; however, the borrower or Home Depot
  is required to obtain 24 months of rent loss insurance under the loan documents (provided
  that Home Depot may self-insure for such insurance if the conditions in the loan documents
  are satisfied). In addition, Home Depot has the option to either rebuild the improvements
  or to raze such improvements and place the premises in a safe condition. While Home Depot
  has the general right to raze the improvements at any time, Home Depot will remain obligated
  under its lease except in the circumstance of a casualty as described in the prior sentence.

(1)The
  franchisor or an affiliate previously funded to the ERGS HI Nashville REO, L.L.C (the
  âSellerâ) of the Aloft Nashville West End Property (as defined below) key
  money in the amount of $1,250,000 pursuant to the terms of the prior license agreement
  between the franchisor and the Seller dated August 29, 2012. The Sheraton LLC (âStarwoodâ),
  in connection with the new franchise agreement with the borrower, transferred to the
  borrower the obligation to pay the balance of the unamortized key money if the franchise
  agreement is terminated prior to its stated expiration date. The borrowerâs obligation
  to repay these funds, if any, is unsecured and no ongoing payments are required to be
  made by the borrower to Starwood. If the obligation to repay the financing is triggered,
  the unamortized portion of the key money financing will be payable to Starwood. The amortization
  is calculated on a straight-line basis over the 20 year term of the franchise agreement.
  The current balance of the unamortized portion of the key money is $1,104,167. The parent
  company of the borrower has guaranteed the obligation to repay the unamortized portion
  of the key money. No subordination and standstill agreement or intercreditor agreement
  has been entered into in connection with this financing. The loan documents include a
  nonrecourse carve-out to the borrower and guarantor of the Aloft Nashville West End mortgage
  loan for any losses associated with this financing.Â Â 

(2)Ongoing
  monthly reserves for insurance are waived as long as (i) the Aloft Nashville West End
  Property is insured via an acceptable blanket insurance policy; (ii) no event of default
  has occurred and is continuing; and (iii) the borrower provides timely proof of payment
  of insurance premiums.

(3)Ongoing
  monthly reserves for FF&E are required in an amount equal to one-twelfth of 4.0%
  of gross revenues based on the annual budget (initially estimated to be $29,151). An
  upfront FF&E Reserve in the amount of $300,000 was collected for planned capital
  expenditures at the Aloft Nashville West End Property for the first half of 2016 in addition
  to immediate repairs identified in the property condition report.

(4)An
  upfront PIP Reserve of $1,800,000 for the Aloft Nashville West End Property was required
  for renovations planned in 2016.

(5)See
  âCash Flow Analysisâ section.

(6)The
  Appraised Value, Cut-Off Date LTV Ratio and LTV Ratio at Maturity or ARD are calculated
  based on the âas if completeâ value, which assumes the PIP renovations to
  the Aloft Nashville West End Property scheduled to be performed in 2016, as well as certain
  capital expenditures and immediate repairs, have been completed. At closing, the borrower
  reserved an aggregate of $2,100,000 for the PIP renovations and immediate repairs/capital
  expenditures. The âas-isâ value as of October 9, 2015 is $40,800,000 which
  results in a Cut-Off Date LTV and LTV Ratio at Maturity or ARD of 60.3% and 55.3%, respectively.
The
Aloft Nashville West End mortgage loan is evidenced by a single promissory note that is secured by a first mortgage encumbering
the borrowerâs fee interest in a 139-room limited service hotel located in the West End district of Nashville, Tennessee
(the âAloft Nashville West End Propertyâ), which is within walking distance to Music Row and Vanderbilt University.
The Aloft Nashville West End Property was originally built in 1956, converted from an office to a hotel in 2007, and rebranded
in 2012 as an Aloft brand of Starwood Hotels & Resorts. The franchise agreement with Starwood Hotels & Resorts expires
in November 2035. The Aloft Nashville West End Property is situated on a 0.8-acre site and comprises 139 guestrooms, which include
54 king rooms, 76Â double
queen rooms, 8 suites and a 2,500 square foot penthouse suite. Each guestroom features a flat screen television, workspace with
ergonomic desk chair, mini-refrigerator, coffee maker, luxury bed, and walk-in shower. Amenities at the Aloft Nashville West End
Property include an on-site parking garage providing 249 spaces, w xyz Bar (a self-serve eatery), a restaurant leased to Goten

ALOFT
  NASHVILLE WEST END


Japanese Restaurant, 24-hour business center, fitness center, outdoor terrace, and 2,502 square feet of meeting and event space.
Guestrooms are located on levels two through eleven of the 11-story building.
A
reported total of $3,300,000 ($23,741 per room) has been invested in the property since 2013 including a comprehensive room and
lobby renovation in 2013 and recent upgrades to guestrooms in the second quarter 2015. An upfront reserve of $1,800,000 or $12,950
per room was required for the Property Improvement Plan (âPIPâ) planned for the first half of 2016. The PIP includes
renovations to a portion of guestrooms, facilities, common areas, meeting space, recreational amenities, and plans to streamline
management operations. An additional $300,000 or $2,158 per room FF&E reserve was established at closing for planned capital
expenditures for the first half of 2016, in addition to the immediate repair items ($43,650) identified in the property condition
report.

(1)The borrower
  is permitted to incur future mezzanine debt provided that an intercreditor agreement
  is obtained and the combined debt service coverage ratio is at least 1.30x, the combined
  loan to value ratio is not greater than 75%, and the combined debt yield is at least
  8.0%.


(2)The Outstanding
  TI/LC reserve consists of Tenant Improvement allowances for the Ann Arbor Public Library
  ($1,600,000), Leasing Commissions for the Ann Arbor Public Library ($69,311), Picture
  Plus ($60,000) and Expo Kitchen ($3,000).


(3)The Gap
  Rent Holdback reserve consists of 7 months of gap rent for the Ann Arbor Public Library
  ($302,860) while the tenant expands its space and one month of gap rent for the Pictures
  Plus ($2,100) as it relocates within the center.


(4)The Specified
  Tenant Leasing Reserve will be released upon receipt of the Rite Aid Estoppel.


(5)The Cut-off
  Date LTV Ratio and LTV Ratio at Maturity or ARD are calculated based on the Westgate
  Shopping Center Propertyâs âas stabilizedâ appraised value of $30,200,000
  with an âas-stabalizedâ valuation date of July 1, 2016. The âas stabilizedâ
  appraised value assumes the Ann Arbor Public Library tenantâs improvements are
  completed and the lease has commenced. Ann Arbor Public library has been a tenant at
  the property since 1983 and executed a lease in September 2015 to expand its space from
  5,536 square feet to 21,914 square feet (12.6% of the net rentable area). The Cut-Off
  Date LTV Ratio and LTV Ratio at Maturity or ARD based on the âas isâ appraised
  value are 76.9% and 68.0%, respectively.

Â 
The Westgate Shopping Center mortgage loan
is evidenced by a single promissory note that is secured by a first mortgage encumbering an anchored retail center comprising 174,426
square feet and located in Ann Arbor, Michigan (the âWestgate Shopping Center Propertyâ). The Westgate Shopping Center
Property was built in 1960 and is anchored by TJ Maxx. The Westgate Shopping Center Property is situated on the southwest corner
of the intersection between West Stadium Boulevard and Jackson Avenue. Parking at the Westgate Shopping Center Property is provided
by 766 surface spaces, resulting in a parking ratio of 4.5 spaces per 1,000 square feet of rentable area. As of October 1, 2015,
the Westgate Shopping Center Property was 100.0% occupied by 28 tenants.

Â 
(1) Debt Service Coverage Ratios are updated periodically
  as new NOI figures become available from borrowers on an asset level. In all cases, the most recent DSCR provided by the Servicer
  is used. To the extent that no DSCR is provided by the Servicer, information from the offering document is used. The Trustee
  makes no representations as to the accuracy of the data provided by the borrower for this calculation.
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
(2) Anticipated Remaining Term and WAM are each calculated
  based upon the term from the current month to the earlier of the Anticipated Repayment Date, if applicable, and the maturity
  date.
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
(3) Data in this table was calculated by allocating
  pro-rata the current loan information to the properties based upon the Cut-off Date balance of each property as disclosed
  in theÂ Â offering document.

Specially Serviced Loans were transferred to special servicing in the prior calendar year [INSERT YEAR].

of the Special Servicerâs operational activities to service certain Specially Serviced Loans in accordance with the Servicing
Standard. Based on such limited review, the Operating Advisor [does, does not] believe there are material violations of the Special
Servicerâs compliance with its obligations under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. In addition, the Operating Advisor
notes the following: [PROVIDE SUMMARY OF ANY ADDITIONAL MATERIAL INFORMATION].

procedure manuals (including amendments and appendices), re-engineer the quantitative aspects of their net present value calculator,
visit any property, visit the Special Servicer, visit the Directing Certificateholder or interact with any borrower. In addition,
our review of the net present value calculations and Appraisal Reduction calculations is limited to the mathematical accuracy of
the calculations and the corresponding application of the non-discretionary portions of the applicable formulas, and as such, does
not take into account the reasonableness of the discretionary portions of such formulas.

of a Specially Serviced Loan prior to the utilization by the special servicer.

ANNEX D-1
Â 
MORTGAGE LOAN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
Â 
Each sponsor will make, as of the Cut-off
Date or such other date as set forth below, with respect to each Mortgage Loan sold by it that we include in the issuing entity,
representations and warranties generally to the effect set forth below. The exceptions to the representations and warranties set
forth below are identified on AnnexÂ D-2 to this prospectus. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this AnnexÂ D-1
will have the meanings set forth in this prospectus or, if not defined in this prospectus, in the related MLPA.
Â 
Each MLPA, together with the related representations
and warranties, serves to contractually allocate risk between the related sponsor, on the one hand, and the issuing entity, on
the other. We present the related representations and warranties set forth below for the sole purpose of describing some of the
terms and conditions of that risk allocation. The presentation of representations and warranties below is not intended as statements
regarding the actual characteristics of the Mortgage Loans, the Mortgaged Properties or other matters. We cannot assure you that
the Mortgage Loans actually conform to the statements made in the representations and warranties that we present below. The representations,
warranties and exceptions have been provided to you for informational purposes only and prospective investors should not rely on
the representations, warranties and exceptions as a basis for any investment decision. For disclosure regarding the characteristics,
risks and other information regarding the Mortgage Loans, Mortgaged Properties and the certificates, you should read and rely solely
on the prospectus. None of the depositor or the underwriters or their respective affiliates makes any representation regarding
the accuracy or completeness of the representations, warranties and exceptions.
Â 
1.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Whole Loan; Ownership of Mortgage Loans. Except with respect
to a Mortgage Loan that is part of a Whole Loan, each Mortgage Loan is a whole loan and not a participation interest in a Mortgage
Loan. Each Mortgage Loan that is part of a Whole Loan is a pari passu portion of a whole loan evidenced by a pari passu
note. At the time of the sale, transfer and assignment to depositor, no mortgage note or mortgage was subject to any assignment
(other than assignments to the sponsor), participation or pledge, and the sponsor had good title to, and was the sole owner of,
each Mortgage Loan free and clear of any and all liens, charges, pledges, encumbrances, participations, any other ownership interests
on, in or to such Mortgage Loan other than any servicing rights appointment or similar agreement, any other pooling and servicing
agreement with respect to a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan and rights of the holder of a related Companion Loan pursuant to an Intercreditor
Agreement. The sponsor has full right and authority to sell, assign and transfer each Mortgage Loan, and the assignment to depositor
constitutes a legal, valid and binding assignment of such Mortgage Loan free and clear of any and all liens, pledges, charges or
security interests of any nature encumbering such Mortgage Loan other than the rights of the holder of a related Companion Loan
pursuant to an Intercreditor Agreement.
Â 
2.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Loan Document Status. Each related mortgage note, mortgage,
Assignment of Leases (if a separate instrument), guaranty and other agreement executed by or on behalf of the related Mortgagor,
guarantor or other obligor in connection with such Mortgage Loan is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the related Mortgagor,
guarantor or other obligor (subject to any non-recourse provisions contained in any of the foregoing agreements and any applicable
state anti-deficiency or market value limit deficiency legislation), as applicable, and is enforceable in accordance with its terms,
except (i)Â as such enforcement may be limited by (a)Â bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
Â 


D-1-1
Â 
Â 
moratorium
or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditorsâ rights generally and (b)Â general principles of equity
(regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (ii)Â that certain provisions
in such Mortgage Loan documents (including, without limitation, provisions requiring the payment of default interest, late fees
or prepayment/yield maintenance fees, charges and/or premiums) are, or may be, further limited or rendered unenforceable by or
under applicable law, but (subject to the limitations set forth in clauseÂ (i) above) such limitations or unenforceability
will not render such Mortgage Loan documents invalid as a whole or materially interfere with the Mortgageeâs realization
of the principal benefits and/or security provided thereby (clausesÂ (i) and (ii) collectively, the âStandard Qualificationsâ).
Â 
Except as set forth in the immediately preceding
sentence, there is no valid offset, defense, counterclaim or right of rescission available to the related Mortgagor with respect
to any of the related mortgage notes, mortgages or other Mortgage Loan documents, including, without limitation, any such valid
offset, defense, counterclaim or right based on intentional fraud by the sponsor in connection with the origination of the Mortgage
Loan, that would deny the Mortgagee the principal benefits intended to be provided by the mortgage note, mortgage or other Mortgage
Loan documents.
Â 
3.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Mortgage Provisions. The Mortgage Loan documents for each
Mortgage Loan contain provisions that render the rights and remedies of the holder thereof adequate for the practical realization
against the Mortgaged Property of the principal benefits of the security intended to be provided thereby, including realization
by judicial or, if applicable, nonjudicial foreclosure subject to the limitations set forth in the Standard Qualifications.
Â 
4.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Mortgage Status; Waivers and Modifications. Since origination
and except by written instruments set forth in the related Mortgage File (a)Â the material terms of such mortgage, mortgage
note, Mortgage Loan guaranty, and related Mortgage Loan documents have not been waived, impaired, modified, altered, satisfied,
canceled, subordinated or rescinded in any respect that materially interferes with the security intended to be provided by such
mortgage; (b)Â no related Mortgaged Property or any portion thereof has been released from the lien of the related mortgage
in any manner which materially interferes with the security intended to be provided by such mortgage or the use or operation of
the remaining portion of such Mortgaged Property; and (c)Â neither the related Mortgagor nor the related guarantor has been
released from its material obligations under the Mortgage Loan.
Â 
5.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Lien; Valid Assignment. Subject to the Standard Qualifications,
each assignment of mortgage and assignment of Assignment of Leases to the issuing entity constitutes a legal, valid and binding
assignment to the issuing entity. Each related mortgage and Assignment of Leases is freely assignable without the consent of the
related Mortgagor. Each related mortgage is a legal, valid and enforceable first lien on the related Mortgagorâs fee (or
if identified on the Mortgage Loan ScheduleÂ attached as an exhibit to the applicable MLPA, leasehold) interest in the Mortgaged
Property in the principal amount of such Mortgage Loan or allocated loan amount (subject only to Permitted Encumbrances (as defined
below) and the exceptions to paragraphÂ (6) set forth on AnnexÂ D-2 (each such exception, a âTitle Exceptionâ)),
except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by the Standard Qualifications. Such Mortgaged Property (subject to and excepting
Permitted Encumbrances and the Title Exceptions) as of origination was, and as of the Cut-off Date, to the sponsorâs knowledge,
is free and clear of any recorded mechanicsâ liens, recorded materialmenâs liens and other recorded encumbrances that
are prior to or equal with the lien of the related mortgage, except those that are bonded over, escrowed for or insured against
by a lenderâs title insurance policy (as described below), and, to the sponsorâs knowledge and subject to the rights
of tenants (as tenants only) (subject to and excepting Permitted Encumbrances
Â 


D-1-2
Â 
Â 
and the Title Exceptions), no rights exist that under
law could give rise to any such lien or encumbrance that would be prior to or equal with the lien of the related mortgage, except
those that are bonded over, escrowed for or insured against by a lenderâs title insurance policy (as described below). Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, no representation is made as to the perfection of any security interest in rents or other personal
property to the extent that possession or control of such items or actions other than the filing of Uniform Commercial Code financing
statements is required in order to effect such perfection.
Â 
6.Â Â Â Â 
Permitted Liens; Title Insurance. Each Mortgaged Property
securing a Mortgage Loan is covered by an American Land Title Association loan title insurance policy or a comparable form of loan
title insurance policy approved for use in the applicable jurisdiction (or, if such policy is yet to be issued, by a pro forma
policy, a preliminary title policy with escrow instructions or a âmarked upâ commitment, in each case binding on the
title insurer) (the âTitle Policyâ) in the original principal amount of such Mortgage Loan (or with respect
to a Mortgage Loan secured by multiple properties, an amount equal to at least the allocated loan amount with respect to the Title
Policy for each such property) after all advances of principal (including any advances held in escrow or reserves), that insures
for the benefit of the owner of the indebtedness secured by the mortgage, the first priority lien of the mortgage, which lien is
subject only to (a)Â the lien of current real property taxes, water charges, sewer rents and assessments due and payable but
not yet delinquent; (b)Â covenants, conditions and restrictions, rights of way, easements and other matters of public record;
(c)Â the exceptions (general and specific) and exclusions set forth in such Title Policy; (d)Â other matters to which like
properties are commonly subject; (e)Â the rights of tenants (as tenants only) under leases (including subleases) pertaining
to the related Mortgaged Property and condominium declarations; (f)Â if the related Mortgage Loan constitutes a cross-collateralized
Mortgage Loan, the lien of the mortgage for another Mortgage Loan contained in the same cross-collateralized group; and (g)Â if
the related Mortgage Loan is part of a Whole Loan, the rights of the holder(s) of the related Companion Loan(s) pursuant to the
related Intercreditor Agreement; provided that none of items (a) through (g), individually or in the aggregate, materially
and adversely interferes with the value or current use of the Mortgaged Property or the security intended to be provided by such
mortgage or the Mortgagorâs ability to pay its obligations when they become due (collectively, the âPermitted Encumbrancesâ).
For purposes of clauseÂ (a) of the immediately preceding sentence, any such taxes, assessments and other charges shall not
be considered delinquent until the date on which interest and/or penalties would first be payable thereon. Except as contemplated
by clausesÂ (f) and (g) of the second preceding sentence, none of the Permitted Encumbrances are mortgage liens that are senior
to or coordinate and co-equal with the lien of the related mortgage. Such Title Policy (or, if it has yet to be issued, the coverage
to be provided thereby) is in full force and effect, all premiums thereon have been paid and no claims have been made by the sponsor
thereunder and no claims have been paid thereunder. Neither the sponsor, nor to the sponsorâs knowledge, any other holder
of the Mortgage Loan, has done, by act or omission, anything that would materially impair the coverage under such Title Policy.
Â 
7.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Junior Liens. It being understood that BÂ notes secured
by the same mortgage as a Mortgage Loan are not subordinate mortgages or junior liens, except for any Mortgage Loan that is cross-collateralized
and cross-defaulted with another Mortgage Loan, there are no subordinate mortgages or junior liens securing the payment of money
encumbering the related Mortgaged Property (other than Permitted Encumbrances and the Title Exceptions, taxes and assessments,
mechanicsâ and materialmenâs liens (which are the subject of the representation in paragraphÂ (5) above), and equipment
and other personal property
Â 


D-1-3
Â 
Â 
financing). Except as set forth on an exhibit to the applicable MLPA, the sponsor has no knowledge
of any mezzanine debt secured directly by interests in the related Mortgagor.
Â 
8.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
Assignment of Leases and Rents. There exists as part of the
related Mortgage File an Assignment of Leases (either as a separate instrument or incorporated into the related mortgage). Subject
to the Permitted Encumbrances and the Title Exceptions, each related Assignment of Leases creates a valid first-priority collateral
assignment of, or a valid first-priority lien or security interest in, rents and certain rights under the related lease or leases,
subject only to a license granted to the related Mortgagor to exercise certain rights and to perform certain obligations of the
lessor under such lease or leases, including the right to operate the related leased property, except as the enforcement thereof
may be limited by the Standard Qualifications. The related mortgage or related Assignment of Leases, subject to applicable law,
provides that, upon an event of default under the Mortgage Loan, a receiver is permitted to be appointed for the collection of
rents or for the related Mortgagee to enter into possession to collect the rents or for rents to be paid directly to the Mortgagee.
Â 
9.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
UCC Filings. If the related Mortgaged Property is operated
as a hospitality property, the sponsor has filed and/or recorded or caused to be filed and/or recorded (or, if not filed and/or
recorded, submitted in proper form for filing and/or recording), UCC financing statements in the appropriate public filing and/or
recording offices necessary at the time of the origination of the Mortgage Loan to perfect a valid security interest in all items
of physical personal property reasonably necessary to operate such Mortgaged Property owned by such Mortgagor and located on the
related Mortgaged Property (other than any non-material personal property, any personal property subject to a purchase money security
interest, a sale and leaseback financing arrangement as permitted under the terms of the related Mortgage Loan documents or any
other personal property leases applicable to such personal property), to the extent perfection may be effected pursuant to applicable
law by recording or filing, as the case may be. Subject to the Standard Qualifications, each related mortgage (or equivalent document)
creates a valid and enforceable lien and security interest on the items of personalty described above. No representation is made
as to the perfection of any security interest in rents or other personal property to the extent that possession or control of such
items or actions other than the filing of UCC financing statements are required in order to effect such perfection.
Â 
10.Â Â Â Â Â 
Condition of Property. The sponsor or the originator of the
Mortgage Loan inspected or caused to be inspected each related Mortgaged Property within six months of origination of the Mortgage
Loan and within thirteen months of the Cut-off Date.
Â 
An engineering report or property condition
assessment was prepared in connection with the origination of each Mortgage Loan no more than 13 months prior to the Cut-off Date.
To the sponsorâs knowledge, based solely upon due diligence customarily performed in connection with the origination of comparable
mortgage loans, as of the Closing Date, each related Mortgaged Property was free and clear of any material damage (other than deferred
maintenance for which escrows were established at origination) that would affect materially and adversely the use or value of such
Mortgaged Property as security for the Mortgage Loan.
Â 
11.Â Â Â Â Â 
Taxes and Assessments. As of the date of origination and,
to the sponsorâs knowledge, as of the Cut-off Date, all taxes, governmental assessments and other outstanding governmental
charges (including, without limitation, water and sewage charges), or installments thereof that could be a lien on the related
Mortgaged Property that would be of equal or superior priority to the lien of the mortgage and that prior to the Cut-off Date have
become delinquent in respect of each related Mortgaged Property have
Â 


D-1-4
Â 
Â 
been paid, or an escrow of funds has been established in an
amount sufficient to cover such payments and reasonably estimated interest and penalties, if any, thereon. For purposes of this
representation and warranty, real estate taxes and governmental assessments and other outstanding governmental charges and installments
thereof shall not be considered delinquent until the date on which interest and/or penalties would first be payable thereon.
Â 
12.Â Â Â Â Â 
Condemnation. As of the date of origination and to the sponsorâs
knowledge as of the Cut-off Date, there is no proceeding pending, and, to the sponsorâs knowledge as of the date of origination
and as of the Cut-off Date, there is no proceeding threatened, for the total or partial condemnation of such Mortgaged Property
that would have a material adverse effect on the value, use or operation of the Mortgaged Property.
Â 
13.Â Â Â Â Â 
Actions Concerning Mortgage Loan. As of the date of origination
and to the sponsorâs knowledge as of the Cut-off Date, there was no pending or filed action, suit or proceeding, arbitration
or governmental investigation involving any Mortgagor, guarantor, or Mortgagorâs interest in the Mortgaged Property, an adverse
outcome of which would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect (a)Â such Mortgagorâs title to the Mortgaged
Property, (b)Â the validity or enforceability of the mortgage, (c)Â such Mortgagorâs ability to perform under the
related Mortgage Loan, (d)Â such guarantorâs ability to perform under the related guaranty, (e)Â the principal benefit
of the security intended to be provided by the Mortgage Loan documents or (f)Â the current principal use of the Mortgaged Property.
Â 
14.Â Â Â Â Â 
Escrow Deposits. All escrow deposits and payments required
to be escrowed with Mortgagee pursuant to each Mortgage Loan are in the possession, or under the control, of the sponsor or its
servicer, and there are no deficiencies (subject to any applicable grace or cure periods) in connection therewith, and all such
escrows and deposits (or the right thereto) that are required to be escrowed with Mortgagee under the related Mortgage Loan documents
are being conveyed by the sponsor to depositor or its servicer.
Â 
15.Â Â Â Â Â 
No Holdbacks. The principal amount of the Mortgage Loan stated
on the Mortgage Loan ScheduleÂ attached as an exhibit to the applicable MLPA has been fully disbursed as of the Closing Date
and there is no requirement for future advances thereunder (except in those cases where the full amount of the Mortgage Loan has
been disbursed but a portion thereof is being held in escrow or reserve accounts pending the satisfaction of certain conditions
relating to leasing, repairs or other matters with respect to the related Mortgaged Property, the Mortgagor or other considerations
determined by the sponsor to merit such holdback).
Â 
16.Â Â Â Â Â 
Insurance. Each related Mortgaged Property is, and is required
pursuant to the related mortgage to be, insured by a property insurance policy providing coverage for loss in accordance with coverage
found under a âspecial cause of loss formâ or âall risk formâ that includes replacement cost valuation
issued by an insurer meeting the requirements of the related Mortgage Loan documents and having a claims-paying or financial strength
rating of at least âA-:VIIIâ from A.M. Best Company or âA3â (or the equivalent) from Moodyâs Investors
Service, Inc. or âA-â from Standard & Poorâs Ratings Services (collectively the âInsurance Rating
Requirementsâ), in an amount (subject to a customary deductible) not less than the lesser of (1)Â the original principal
balance of the Mortgage Loan and (2)Â the full insurable value on a replacement cost basis of the improvements, furniture,
furnishings, fixtures and equipment owned by the Mortgagor and included in the Mortgaged Property (with no deduction for physical
depreciation), but, in any event, not less than the amount necessary or containing such endorsements as are necessary to avoid
the operation of any coinsurance provisions with respect to the related Mortgaged Property.

Â Â 

Each related Mortgaged Property is also
covered, and required to be covered pursuant to the related Mortgage Loan documents, by business interruption or rental loss insurance
that (subject to a customary deductible) covers a period of not less than 12Â months (or with respect to each Mortgage Loan
on a single asset with a principal balance of $50Â million or more, 18Â months).
Â 
If any material part of the improvements,
exclusive of a parking lot, located on a Mortgaged Property is in an area identified in the Federal Register by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency as a âSpecial Flood Hazard Area,â the related Mortgagor is required to maintain insurance in the
maximum amount available under the National Flood Insurance Program.
Â 
If the Mortgaged Property is located within
25Â miles of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico or the Atlantic coast of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina or North Carolina, the
related Mortgagor is required to maintain coverage for windstorm and/or windstorm related perils and/or ânamed stormsâ
issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements or endorsement covering damage from windstorm and/or windstorm related
perils and/or named storms.
Â 
The Mortgaged Property is covered, and required
to be covered pursuant to the related Mortgage Loan documents, by a commercial general liability insurance policy issued by an
insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements including coverage for property damage, contractual damage and personal injury
(including bodily injury and death) in amounts as are generally required by prudent institutional commercial mortgage lenders,
and in any event not less than $1Â million per occurrence and $2Â million in the aggregate.
Â 
An architectural or engineering consultant
has performed an analysis of each of the Mortgaged Properties located in seismic zones 3 or 4 in order to evaluate the structural
and seismic condition of such property, for the sole purpose of assessing the scenario expected limit (âSELâ)
for the Mortgaged Property in the event of an earthquake. In such instance, the SEL was based on a 475-year return period, an exposure
period of 50 years and a 10% probability of exceedance. If the resulting report concluded that the SEL would exceed 20% of the
amount of the replacement costs of the improvements, earthquake insurance on such Mortgaged Property was obtained from an insurer
rated at least âA:VIIIâ by A.M. Best Company or âA3â (or the equivalent) from Moodyâs Investors Service,
Inc. or âA-â by Standard & Poorâs Ratings Services in an amount not less than 100% of the SEL.
Â 
The Mortgage Loan documents require insurance
proceeds in respect of a property loss to be applied either (a)Â to the repair or restoration of all or part of the related
Mortgaged Property, with respect to all property losses in excess of 5% of the then outstanding principal amount of the related
Mortgage Loan (or related Whole Loan), the Mortgagee (or a trustee appointed by it) having the right to hold and disburse such
proceeds as the repair or restoration progresses, or (b)Â to the payment of the outstanding principal balance of such Mortgage
Loan together with any accrued interest thereon.
Â 
All premiums on all insurance policies referred
to in this section required to be paid as of the Cut-off Date have been paid, and such insurance policies name the Mortgagee under
the Mortgage Loan and its successors and assigns as a loss payee under a mortgagee endorsement clause or, in the case of the general
liability insurance policy, as named or additional insured. Such insurance policies will inure to the benefit of the trustee. Each
related Mortgage Loan obligates the related Mortgagor to maintain all such insurance and, at such Mortgagorâs failure to
do so, authorizes the Mortgagee to maintain such insurance at the Mortgagorâs reasonable cost and expense and to charge such
Mortgagor for related premiums. All such insurance policies (other than commercial liability policies) require at
Â 


D-1-6
Â 
Â 
least 10 daysâ
prior notice to the Mortgagee of termination or cancellation arising because of nonpayment of a premium and at least 30Â daysâ
prior notice to the Mortgagee of termination or cancellation (or such lesser period, not less than 10 days, as may be required
by applicable law) arising for any reason other than non-payment of a premium and no such notice has been received by the sponsor.
Â 
17.Â Â Â Â Â 
Access; Utilities; Separate Tax Lots. Based solely on evaluation
of the Title Policy (as defined in paragraph (6) of this Annex D-1) and survey, if any, an engineering report or property condition
assessment as described in paragraph (10) of this Annex D-1, applicable local law compliance materials as described in paragraph
(24) of this Annex D-1, and the ESA (as defined in paragraph (40) of this Annex D-1), each Mortgaged Property (a)Â is located
on or adjacent to a public road and has direct legal access to such road, or has access via an irrevocable easement or irrevocable
right of way permitting ingress and egress to/from a public road, (b)Â is served by or has uninhibited access rights to public
or private water and sewer (or well and septic) and all required utilities, all of which are appropriate for the current use of
the Mortgaged Property, and (c)Â constitutes one or more separate tax parcels which do not include any property which is not
part of the Mortgaged Property or is subject to an endorsement under the related Title Policy insuring the Mortgaged Property,
or in certain cases, an application has been, or will be, made to the applicable governing authority for creation of separate tax
lots, in which case the Mortgage Loan requires the Mortgagor to escrow an amount sufficient to pay taxes for the existing tax parcel
of which the Mortgaged Property is a part until the separate tax lots are created.
Â 
18.Â Â Â Â Â 
No Encroachments. To the sponsorâs knowledge based
solely on surveys obtained in connection with origination and the Mortgageeâs Title Policy (or, if such policy is not yet
issued, a pro forma title policy, a preliminary title policy with escrow instructions or a âmarked upâ commitment)
obtained in connection with the origination of each Mortgage Loan, all material improvements that were included for the purpose
of determining the appraised value of the related Mortgaged Property at the time of the origination of such Mortgage Loan are within
the boundaries of the related Mortgaged Property, except encroachments that do not materially and adversely affect the value or
current use of such Mortgaged Property or for which insurance or endorsements were obtained under the Title Policy. No improvements
on adjoining parcels encroach onto the related Mortgaged Property except for encroachments that do not materially and adversely
affect the value or current use of such Mortgaged Property or for which insurance or endorsements were obtained under the Title
Policy. No improvements encroach upon any easements except for encroachments the removal of which would not materially and adversely
affect the value or current use of such Mortgaged Property or for which insurance or endorsements were obtained under the Title
Policy.
Â 
19.Â Â Â Â Â 
No Contingent Interest or Equity Participation. No Mortgage
Loan has a shared appreciation feature, any other contingent interest feature or a negative amortization feature or an equity participation
by the sponsor (except that any ARD Loan may provide for the accrual of the portion of interest in excess of the rate in effect
prior to its related Anticipated Repayment Date).
Â 
20.Â Â Â Â Â 
REMIC. The Mortgage Loan is a âqualified mortgageâ
within the meaning of SectionÂ 860G(a)(3) of the Code (but determined without regard to the rule in Treasury Regulations SectionÂ 1.860G-2(f)(2)
that treats certain defective mortgage loans as qualified mortgages), and, accordingly, (A)Â the issue price of the Mortgage
Loan to the related Mortgagor at origination did not exceed the non-contingent principal amount of the Mortgage Loan and (B)Â either:
(a)Â such Mortgage Loan is secured by an interest in real property (including buildings and structural components thereof,
but excluding personal property) having a fair market value (i)Â at the date the Mortgage Loan (or related Whole
Â 


D-1-7
Â 
Â 
Loan) was
originated at least equal to 80% of the adjusted issue price of the Mortgage Loan (or related Whole Loan) on such date or (ii)Â at
the Closing Date at least equal to 80% of the adjusted issue price of the Mortgage Loan (or related Whole Loan) on such date, provided
that for purposes hereof, the fair market value of the real property interest must first be reduced by (A)Â the amount of any
lien on the real property interest that is senior to the Mortgage Loan and (B)Â a proportionate amount of any lien that is
in parity with the Mortgage Loan; or (b)Â substantially all of the proceeds of such Mortgage Loan were used to acquire, improve
or protect the real property which served as the only security for such Mortgage Loan (other than a recourse feature or other third-party
credit enhancement within the meaning of Treasury Regulations SectionÂ 1.860G-2(a)(1)(ii)). If the Mortgage Loan was âsignificantly
modifiedâ prior to the Closing Date so as to result in a taxable exchange under SectionÂ 1001 of the Code, it either
(x)Â was modified as a result of the default or reasonably foreseeable default of such Mortgage Loan or (y)Â satisfies
the provisions of either sub-clauseÂ (B)(a)(i) above (substituting the date of the last such modification for the date the
Mortgage Loan was originated) or sub-clauseÂ (B)(a)(ii), including the proviso thereto. Any prepayment premium and yield maintenance
charges applicable to the Mortgage Loan constitute âcustomary prepayment penaltiesâ within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations SectionÂ 1.860G-1(b)(2). All terms used in this paragraph shall have the same meanings as set forth in the related
Treasury Regulations.
Â 
21.Â Â Â Â Â 
Compliance with Usury Laws. The mortgage rate (exclusive
of any default interest, late charges, yield maintenance charge, or prepayment premiums) of such Mortgage Loan complied as of the
date of origination with, or was exempt from, applicable state or federal laws, regulations and other requirements pertaining to
usury.
Â 
22.Â Â Â Â Â 
Authorized to do Business. To the extent required under applicable
law, as of the Cut-off Date or as of the date that such entity held the mortgage note, each holder of the mortgage note was authorized
to originate, acquire and/or hold (as applicable) the mortgage note in the jurisdiction in which each related Mortgaged Property
is located, or the failure to be so authorized does not materially and adversely affect the enforceability of such Mortgage Loan
by the Trust.
Â 
23.Â Â Â Â Â 
Trustee under Deed of Trust. With respect to each mortgage
which is a deed of trust, as of the date of origination and, to the sponsorâs knowledge, as of the Closing Date, a trustee,
duly qualified under applicable law to serve as such, currently so serves and is named in the deed of trust or has been substituted
in accordance with the mortgage and applicable law or may be substituted in accordance with the mortgage and applicable law by
the related Mortgagee.
Â 
24.Â Â Â Â Â 
Local Law Compliance. To the sponsorâs knowledge, based
upon any of a letter from any governmental authorities, a legal opinion, an architectâs letter, a zoning consultantâs
report, an endorsement to the related Title Policy, a survey or other affirmative investigation of local law compliance consistent
with the investigation conducted by the sponsor for similar commercial and multifamily mortgage loans intended for securitization,
there are no material violations of applicable zoning ordinances, building codes and land laws (collectively âZoning Regulationsâ)
with respect to the improvements located on or forming part of each Mortgaged Property securing a Mortgage Loan as of the date
of origination of such Mortgage Loan (or related Whole Loan, as applicable) or as of the Cut-off Date, other than those which (i)Â are
insured by the Title Policy or a law and ordinance insurance policy or (ii)Â would not have a material adverse effect on the
value, operation or net operating income of the Mortgaged Property. The terms of the Mortgage Loan documents require the Mortgagor
to comply in all material respects with all applicable governmental regulations, zoning and building laws.
Â 


D-1-8
Â 
Â 
25.Â Â Â Â Â 
Licenses and Permits. Each Mortgagor covenants in the Mortgage
Loan documents that it shall keep all material licenses, permits, franchises and applicable governmental authorizations necessary
for its operation of the Mortgaged Property in full force and effect, and to the sponsorâs knowledge based upon any of a
letter from any government authorities or other affirmative investigation of local law compliance consistent with the investigation
conducted by the sponsor for similar commercial and multifamily mortgage loans intended for securitization, all such material licenses,
permits, franchises and applicable governmental authorizations are in effect or the failure to obtain or maintain such material
licenses, permits, franchises and applicable governmental authorizations does not materially and adversely affect the use and/or
operation of the Mortgaged Property as it was used and operated as of the date of origination of the related Mortgage Loan or the
rights of a holder of the related Mortgage Loan. The Mortgage Loan requires the related Mortgagor to be qualified to do business
in the jurisdiction in which the related Mortgaged Property is located.
Â 
26.Â Â Â Â Â 
Recourse Obligations. The Mortgage Loan documents for each
Mortgage Loan provide that such Mortgage Loan (a)Â becomes full recourse to the Mortgagor and guarantor (which is a natural
person or persons, or an entity distinct from the Mortgagor (but may be affiliated with the Mortgagor) that has assets other than
equity in the related Mortgaged Property that are not de minimis) in any of the following events: (i)Â if any voluntary petition
for bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation pursuant to federal bankruptcy law, or any similar federal or state law,
shall be filed by the Mortgagor; (ii)Â the Mortgagor or guarantor shall have colluded with (or, alternatively, solicited or
caused to be solicited) other creditors to cause an involuntary bankruptcy filing with respect to the Mortgagor or (iii)Â voluntary
transfers of either the Mortgaged Property or equity interests in Mortgagor made in violation of the Mortgage Loan documents; and
(b)Â contains provisions providing for recourse against the Mortgagor and guarantor (which is a natural person or persons,
or an entity distinct from the Mortgagor (but may be affiliated with the Mortgagor) that has assets other than equity in the related
Mortgaged Property that are not de minimis), for losses and damages sustained by reason of Mortgagorâs (i)Â misappropriation
of rents after the occurrence of an event of default under the Mortgage Loan; (ii)Â misappropriation of (A)Â insurance
proceeds or condemnation awards or (B)Â security deposits or, alternatively, the failure of any security deposits to be delivered
to Mortgagee upon foreclosure or action in lieu thereof (except to the extent applied in accordance with leases prior to a Mortgage
Loan event of default); (iii)Â fraud or intentional material misrepresentation; (iv)Â breaches of the environmental covenants
in the Mortgage Loan documents; or (v)Â commission of intentional material physical waste at the Mortgaged Property (but, in
some cases, only to the extent there is sufficient cash flow generated by the related Mortgaged Property to prevent such waste).
Â 
27.Â Â Â Â Â 
Mortgage Releases. The terms of the related mortgage or related
Mortgage Loan documents do not provide for release of any material portion of the Mortgaged Property from the lien of the mortgage
except (a)Â a partial release, accompanied by principal repayment, of not less than a specified percentage at least equal to
the lesser of (i)Â 110% of the related allocated loan amount of such portion of the Mortgaged Property and (ii)Â the outstanding
principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, (b)Â upon payment in full of such Mortgage Loan, (c)Â upon a Defeasance defined
in (32) below, (d)Â releases of out-parcels that are unimproved or other portions of the Mortgaged Property which will not
have a material adverse effect on the underwritten value of the Mortgaged Property and which were not afforded any material value
in the appraisal obtained at the origination of the Mortgage Loan and are not necessary for physical access to the Mortgaged Property
or compliance with zoning requirements, or (e)Â as required pursuant to an order of condemnation or taking by a State or any
political subdivision or authority thereof. With
Â 


D-1-9
Â 
Â 
respect to any partial release under the preceding clausesÂ (a) or (d), either:
(x)Â such release of collateral (i)Â would not constitute a âsignificant modificationâ of the subject Mortgage
Loan within the meaning of Treasury Regulations SectionÂ 1.860G-2(b)(2) and (ii)Â would not cause the subject Mortgage
Loan to fail to be a âqualified mortgageâ within the meaning of SectionÂ 860G(a)(3)(A) of the Code; or (y)Â the
Mortgagee or servicer can, in accordance with the related Mortgage Loan documents, condition such release of collateral on the
related Mortgagorâs delivery of an opinion of tax counsel to the effect specified in the immediately preceding clauseÂ (x).
For purposes of the preceding clauseÂ (x), for all Mortgage Loans originated after DecemberÂ 6, 2010, if the fair market
value of the real property constituting such Mortgaged Property (reduced by (1) the amount of any lien on the real property that
is senior to the Mortgage Loan and (2) a proportionate amount of any lien on the real property that is in parity with the Mortgage
Loan) after the release is not equal to at least 80% of the principal balance of the Mortgage Loan (or related Whole Loan) outstanding
after the release, the Mortgagor is required to make a payment of principal in an amount not less than the amount required by the
REMIC Provisions.
Â 
With respect to any partial release under
the preceding clauseÂ (e), for all Mortgage Loans originated after DecemberÂ 6, 2010, the Mortgagor can be required to
pay down the principal balance of the Mortgage Loan (or related Whole Loan) in an amount not less than the amount required by the
REMIC Provisions and, to such extent, such amount may not be required to be applied to the restoration of the Mortgaged Property
or released to the Mortgagor, if, immediately after the release of such portion of the Mortgaged Property from the lien of the
mortgage (but taking into account the planned restoration) the fair market value of the real property constituting the remaining
Mortgaged Property (reduced by (1) the amount of any lien on the real property that is senior to the Mortgage Loan and (2) a proportionate
amount of any lien on the real property that is in parity with the Mortgage Loan) is not equal to at least 80% of the remaining
principal balance of the Mortgage Loan (or related Whole Loan).
Â 
No Mortgage Loan originated after DecemberÂ 6,
2010 that is secured by more than one Mortgaged Property or that is cross-collateralized with another Mortgage Loan permits the
release of cross-collateralization of the related Mortgaged Properties or a portion thereof, including due to partial condemnation,
other than in compliance with the REMIC Provisions.
Â 
28.Â Â Â Â Â 
Financial Reporting and Rent Rolls. The Mortgage Loan documents
for each Mortgage Loan require the Mortgagor to provide the owner or holder of the mortgage with quarterly (other than for single-tenant
properties) and annual operating statements, and quarterly (other than for single-tenant properties) rent rolls for properties
that have leases contributing more than 5% of the in-place base rent and annual financial statements.
Â 
29.Â Â Â Â Â 
Acts of Terrorism Exclusion. With respect to each Mortgage
Loan over $20Â million, the related special-form all-risk insurance policy and business interruption policy (issued by an insurer
meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements) do not specifically exclude Acts of Terrorism, as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance
Act of 2002, as amended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007, and as amended by the Terrorism Risk
Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 (collectively referred to as âTRIAâ), from coverage, or if such
coverage is excluded, it is covered by a separate terrorism insurance policy. With respect to each other Mortgage Loan, the related
special all-risk insurance policy and business interruption policy (issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements)
did not, as of the date of origination of the Mortgage Loan, and, to the sponsorâs knowledge, do not, as of the Cut-off Date,
specifically exclude Acts of Terrorism, as defined in TRIA, from coverage, or if such coverage is excluded, it is covered by a
separate terrorism insurance policy. With respect to each Mortgage Loan, the related Mortgage Loan documents do not expressly waive
or prohibit the Mortgagee from requiring
Â 


D-1-10
Â 
Â 
coverage for Acts of Terrorism, as defined in TRIA, or damages related thereto; provided,
however, that if TRIA or a similar or subsequent statute is not in effect, then, provided that terrorism insurance
is commercially available, the Mortgagor under each Mortgage Loan is required to carry terrorism insurance, but in such event the
Mortgagor shall not be required to spend more than the Terrorism Cap Amount on terrorism insurance coverage, and if the cost of
terrorism insurance exceeds the Terrorism Cap Amount, the Mortgagor is required to purchase the maximum amount of terrorism insurance
available with funds equal to the Terrorism Cap Amount. The âTerrorism Cap Amountâ is the specified percentage
(which is at least equal to 200%) of the amount of the insurance premium that is payable at such time in respect of the property
and business interruption/rental loss insurance required under the related Mortgage Loan documents (without giving effect to the
cost of terrorism and earthquake components of such casualty and business interruption/rental loss insurance).
Â 
30.Â Â Â Â Â 
Due on Sale or Encumbrance. Subject to specific exceptions
set forth below, each Mortgage Loan contains a âdue on saleâ or other such provision for the acceleration of the payment
of the unpaid principal balance of such Mortgage Loan if, without the consent of the holder of the mortgage (which consent, in
some cases, may not be unreasonably withheld) and/or complying with the requirements of the related Mortgage Loan documents (which
provide for transfers without the consent of the Mortgagee which are customarily acceptable to prudent commercial and multifamily
mortgage lending institutions lending on the security of property comparable to the related Mortgaged Property, including, without
limitation, transfers of worn-out or obsolete furnishings, fixtures, or equipment promptly replaced with property of equivalent
value and functionality and transfers by leases entered into in accordance with the Mortgage Loan documents), (a)Â the related
Mortgaged Property, or any equity interest of greater than 50% in the related Mortgagor, is directly or indirectly pledged, transferred
or sold, other than as related to (i)Â family and estate planning transfers or transfers upon death or legal incapacity, (ii)Â transfers
to certain affiliates as defined in the related Mortgage Loan documents, (iii)Â transfers of less than, or other than, a controlling
interest in the related Mortgagor, (iv)Â transfers to another holder of direct or indirect equity in the Mortgagor, a specific
Person designated in the related Mortgage Loan documents or a Person satisfying specific criteria identified in the related Mortgage
Loan documents, such as a qualified equityholder, (v)Â transfers of stock or similar equity units in publicly traded companies
or (vi)Â a substitution or release of collateral within the parameters of paragraphs (27) and (32) of this Annex D-1 or the
exceptions thereto set forth on AnnexÂ D-2, or (vii)Â as set forth on an exhibit to the applicable MLPA by reason of any
mezzanine debt that existed at the origination of the related Mortgage Loan, or future permitted mezzanine debt as set forth on
an exhibit to the applicable MLPA or (b)Â the related Mortgaged Property is encumbered with a subordinate lien or security
interest against the related Mortgaged Property, other than (i)Â any Companion Loan of any Mortgage Loan or any subordinate
debt that existed at origination and is permitted under the related Mortgage Loan documents, (ii)Â purchase money security
interests (iii)Â any Mortgage Loan that is cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with another Mortgage Loan, as set forth
on an exhibit to the applicable MLPA or (iv)Â Permitted Encumbrances. The mortgage or other Mortgage Loan documents provide
that to the extent any Rating Agency fees are incurred in connection with the review of and consent to any transfer or encumbrance,
the Mortgagor is responsible for such payment along with all other reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by the Mortgagee
relative to such transfer or encumbrance.
Â 
31.Â Â Â Â Â 
Single-Purpose Entity. Each Mortgage Loan requires the Mortgagor
to be a Single-Purpose Entity for at least as long as the Mortgage Loan is outstanding. Both the Mortgage Loan documents and (with
respect to each Mortgage Loan with a Cut-off Date Balance in excess of $10Â million) the organizational documents of the Mortgagor
provide that the Mortgagor is a Single-Purpose Entity, and each Mortgage Loan with a Cut-off Date
Â 


D-1-11
Â 
Â 
Balance of $30Â million or
more has a counselâs opinion regarding non-consolidation of the Mortgagor. For this purpose, a âSingle-Purpose Entityâ
shall mean an entity, other than an individual, whose organizational documents (or if the Mortgage Loan has a Cut-off Date Balance
equal to $10Â million or less, its organizational documents or the related Mortgage Loan documents) provide substantially to
the effect that it was formed or organized solely for the purpose of owning and operating one or more of the Mortgaged Properties
securing the Mortgage Loans and prohibit it from engaging in any business unrelated to such Mortgaged Property or Properties, and
whose organizational documents further provide, or which entity represented in the related Mortgage Loan documents, substantially
to the effect that it does not have any assets other than those related to its interest in and operation of such Mortgaged Property
or Properties, or any indebtedness other than as permitted by the related mortgage(s) or the other related Mortgage Loan documents,
that it has its own books and records and accounts separate and apart from those of any other person (other than a Mortgagor for
a Mortgage Loan that is cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with the related Mortgage Loan), and that it holds itself out
as a legal entity, separate and apart from any other person or entity.
Â 
32.Â Â Â Â Â 
Defeasance. With respect to any Mortgage Loan that, pursuant
to the Mortgage Loan documents, can be defeased (a âDefeasanceâ), (i)Â the Mortgage Loan documents provide
for defeasance as a unilateral right of the Mortgagor, subject to satisfaction of conditions specified in the Mortgage Loan documents;
(ii)Â the Mortgage Loan cannot be defeased within two years after the Closing Date; (iii)Â the Mortgagor is permitted to
pledge only United States âgovernment securitiesâ within the meaning of Treasury Regulations SectionÂ 1.860G-2(a)(8)(ii),
the revenues from which will, in the case of a full Defeasance, be sufficient to make all scheduled payments under the Mortgage
Loan when due, including the entire remaining principal balance on (A)Â the maturity date, (B)Â or on or after the first
date on which payment may be made without payment of a yield maintenance charge or prepayment penalty or (C)Â if the Mortgage
Loan is an ARD Loan, the entire principal balance outstanding on the related Anticipated Repayment Date, and if the Mortgage Loan
permits partial releases of real property in connection with partial defeasance, the revenues from the collateral will be sufficient
to pay all such scheduled payments calculated on a principal amount equal to a specified percentage at least equal to the lesser
of (A)Â 110% of the allocated loan amount for the real property to be released and (B)Â the outstanding principal balance
of the Mortgage Loan; (iv)Â the defeasance collateral is not permitted to be subject to prepayment, call, or early redemption;
(v)Â the Mortgagor is required to provide a certification from an independent certified public accountant that the collateral
is sufficient to make all scheduled payments under the mortgage note as set forth in (iii) above, (vi)Â if the Mortgagor would
continue to own assets in addition to the defeasance collateral, the portion of the Mortgage Loan secured by defeasance collateral
is required to be assumed (or the Mortgagee may require such assumption) by a Single-Purpose Entity; (vii)Â the Mortgagor is
required to provide an opinion of counsel that the Mortgagee has a perfected security interest in such collateral prior to any
other claim or interest; and (viii)Â the Mortgagor is required to pay all rating agency fees associated with defeasance (if
rating confirmation is a specific condition precedent thereto) and all other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses associated with
defeasance, including, but not limited to, accountantâs fees and opinions of counsel.
Â 
33.Â Â Â Â Â 
Fixed Interest Rates. Each Mortgage Loan bears interest at
a rate that remains fixed throughout the remaining term of such Mortgage Loan, except in the case of ARD Loans and in situations
where default interest is imposed.
Â 
34.Â Â Â Â Â 
Ground Leases. For purposes of this AnnexÂ D-1, a âGround
Leaseâ shall mean a lease creating a leasehold estate in real property where the fee owner as the ground lessor
Â 


D-1-12
Â 
Â 
conveys
for a term or terms of years its entire interest in the land and buildings and other improvements, if any, comprising the premises
demised under such lease to the ground lessee (who may, in certain circumstances, own the building and improvements on the land),
subject to the reversionary interest of the ground lessor as fee owner and does not include industrial development agency (IDA)
or similar leases for purposes of conferring a tax abatement or other benefit.
Â 
With respect to any Mortgage Loan where
the Mortgage Loan is secured by a leasehold estate under a Ground Lease in whole or in part, and the related mortgage does not
also encumber the related lessorâs fee interest in such Mortgaged Property, based upon the terms of the Ground Lease and
any estoppel or other agreement received from the ground lessor in favor of the sponsor, its successors and assigns, the sponsor
represents and warrants that:
Â 

a)The Ground Lease or a memorandum regarding such Ground Lease has been
duly recorded or submitted for recordation in a form that is acceptable for recording in the applicable jurisdiction. The Ground
Lease or an estoppel or other agreement received from the ground lessor permits the interest of the lessee to be encumbered by
the related mortgage and does not restrict the use of the related Mortgaged Property by such lessee, its successors or assigns
in a manner that would materially adversely affect the security provided by the related mortgage. No material change in the terms
of the Ground Lease had occurred since the origination of the Mortgage Loan, except as reflected in any written instruments which
are included in the related Mortgage File;
Â 

b)The lessor under such Ground Lease has agreed in a writing included
in the related Mortgage File (or in such Ground Lease) that the Ground Lease may not be amended or modified, or canceled or terminated
by agreement of lessor and lessee, without the prior written consent of the Mortgagee;
Â 

c)The Ground Lease has an original term (or an original term plus one
or more optional renewal terms, which, under all circumstances, may be exercised, and will be enforceable, by either Mortgagor
or the Mortgagee) that extends not less than 20Â years beyond the stated maturity of the related Mortgage Loan, or 10 years
past the stated maturity if such Mortgage Loan fully amortizes by the stated maturity (or with respect to a Mortgage Loan that
accrues on an actual 360 basis, substantially amortizes);
Â 

d)The Ground Lease either (i)Â is not subject to any liens or encumbrances
superior to, or of equal priority with, the mortgage, except for the related fee interest of the ground lessor and the Permitted
Encumbrances, or (ii)Â is subject to a subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement to which the Mortgagee on the
lessorâs fee interest in the Mortgaged Property is subject;
Â 

e)The Ground Lease does not place commercially unreasonably restrictions
on the identity of the Mortgagee and the Ground Lease is assignable to the holder of the Mortgage Loan and its successors and assigns
without the consent of the lessor thereunder (provided that proper notice is delivered to the extent required in accordance
with the Ground Lease), and in the event it is so assigned, it is further assignable by the holder of the Mortgage Loan and its
successors and assigns without the consent of (but with prior notice to) the lessor;
Â 

f)The
sponsor has not received any written notice of material default under or notice of termination of such Ground Lease. To the sponsorâs
knowledge, there is
Â 


D-1-13
Â 
Â 


no
material default under such Ground Lease and no condition that, but for the passage of time or giving of notice, would result
in a material default under the terms of such Ground Lease and to the sponsorâs knowledge, such Ground Lease is in full
force and effect as of the Closing Date;

Â 

g)The Ground Lease or ancillary agreement between the lessor and the
lessee requires the lessor to give to the Mortgagee written notice of any default, and provides that no notice of default or termination
is effective against the Mortgagee unless such notice is given to the Mortgagee;
Â 

h)The Mortgagee is permitted a reasonable opportunity (including, where
necessary, sufficient time to gain possession of the interest of the lessee under the Ground Lease through legal proceedings) to
cure any default under the Ground Lease which is curable after the Mortgageeâs receipt of notice of any default before the
lessor may terminate the Ground Lease;
Â 

i)The Ground Lease does not impose any restrictions on subletting that
would be viewed as commercially unreasonable by a prudent commercial mortgage lender;
Â 

j)Under the terms of the Ground Lease, an estoppel or other agreement
received from the ground lessor and the related mortgage (taken together), any related insurance proceeds or the portion of the
condemnation award allocable to the ground lesseeâs interest (other than (i)Â de minimis amounts for minor casualties
or (ii)Â in respect of a total or substantially total loss or taking as addressed in subpartÂ (k)) will be applied either
to the repair or to restoration of all or part of the related Mortgaged Property with (so long as such proceeds are in excess of
the threshold amount specified in the related Mortgage Loan documents) the Mortgagee or a trustee appointed by it having the right
to hold and disburse such proceeds as repair or restoration progresses, or to the payment of the outstanding principal balance
of the Mortgage Loan, together with any accrued interest;
Â 

k)In the case of a total or substantially total taking or loss, under
the terms of the Ground Lease, an estoppel or other agreement and the related mortgage (taken together), any related insurance
proceeds, or portion of the condemnation award allocable to the ground lesseeâs interest in respect of a total or substantially
total loss or taking of the related Mortgaged Property to the extent not applied to restoration, will be applied first to the payment
of the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, together with any accrued interest; and
Â 

l)Provided that the Mortgagee cures any defaults which are susceptible
to being cured, the ground lessor has agreed to enter into a new lease with the Mortgagee upon termination of the Ground Lease
for any reason, including rejection of the Ground Lease in a bankruptcy proceeding.
Â 
35.Â Â Â Â Â 
Servicing. The servicing and collection practices used by
the sponsor with respect to the Mortgage Loan have been, in all respects, legal and have met customary industry standards for servicing
of commercial loans for conduit loan programs.
Â 
36.Â Â Â Â Â 
Origination and Underwriting. The origination practices of
the sponsor (or the related originator if the sponsor was not the originator) with respect to each Mortgage Loan have been, in
all material respects, legal and as of the date of its origination, such Mortgage Loan (or the related Whole Loan, as applicable)
and the origination thereof complied in all material respects with, or was exempt from, all requirements of federal, state or local
law
Â 


D-1-14
Â 
Â 
relating to the origination of such Mortgage Loan; provided that such representation and warranty does not address or
otherwise cover any matters with respect to federal, state or local law otherwise covered in this AnnexÂ D-1.
Â 
37.Â Â Â Â Â 
No Material Default; Payment Record. No Mortgage Loan has
been more than 30Â days delinquent, without giving effect to any grace or cure period, in making required debt service payments
since origination, and as of the Cut-off Date, no Mortgage Loan is more than 30Â days delinquent (beyond any applicable grace
or cure period) in making required payments. To the sponsorâs knowledge, there is (a)Â no material default, breach, violation
or event of acceleration existing under the related Mortgage Loan, or (b)Â no event (other than payments due but not yet delinquent)
which, with the passage of time or with notice and the expiration of any grace or cure period, would constitute a material default,
breach, violation or event of acceleration, which default, breach, violation or event of acceleration, in the case of either (a)
or (b), materially and adversely affects the value of the Mortgage Loan or the value, use or operation of the related Mortgaged
Property, provided, however, that this representation and warranty does not cover any default, breach, violation
or event of acceleration that specifically pertains to or arises out of an exception scheduled to any other representation and
warranty made by the sponsor in this AnnexÂ D-1 (including, but not limited to, the prior sentence). No person other than the
holder of such Mortgage Loan may declare any event of default under the Mortgage Loan or accelerate any indebtedness under the
Mortgage Loan documents.
Â 
38.Â Â Â Â Â 
Bankruptcy. As of the date of origination of the related
Mortgage Loan and to the sponsorâs knowledge as of the Cut-off Date, neither the Mortgaged Property (other than any tenants
of such Mortgaged Property), nor any portion thereof, is the subject of, and no Mortgagor, guarantor or tenant occupying a single-tenant
property is a debtor in state or federal bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding.
Â 
39.Â Â Â Â Â 
Organization of Mortgagor. With respect to each Mortgage
Loan, in reliance on certified copies of the organizational documents of the Mortgagor delivered by the Mortgagor in connection
with the origination of such Mortgage Loan (or related Whole Loan, as applicable), the Mortgagor is an entity organized under the
laws of a state of the United States of America, the District of Columbia or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Except with respect
to any Mortgage Loan that is cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with another Mortgage Loan, no Mortgage Loan has a Mortgagor
that is an affiliate of another Mortgagor under another Mortgage Loan.
Â 
40.Â Â Â Â Â 
Environmental Conditions. A PhaseÂ I environmental site
assessment (or update of a previous PhaseÂ I and or PhaseÂ II site assessment) and, with respect to certain Mortgage Loans,
a PhaseÂ II environmental site assessment (collectively, an âESAâ) meeting ASTM requirements were conducted
by a reputable environmental consultant in connection with such Mortgage Loan within 12Â months prior to its origination date
(or an update of a previous ESA was prepared), and such ESA (i)Â did not identify the existence of recognized environmental
conditions (as such term is defined in ASTM E1527-05 or its successor, an âEnvironmental Conditionâ) at the
related Mortgaged Property or the need for further investigation, or (ii)Â if the existence of an Environmental Condition or
need for further investigation was indicated in any such ESA, then at least one of the following statements is true: (A)Â an
amount reasonably estimated by a reputable environmental consultant to be sufficient to cover the estimated cost to cure any material
noncompliance with applicable Environmental Laws or the Environmental Condition has been escrowed by the related Mortgagor and
is held or controlled by the related Mortgagee; (B)Â if the only Environmental Condition relates to the presence of asbestos-containing
materials, radon in indoor air, lead based paint or lead in drinking water, the only recommended action in the ESA is the institution
of such a plan, an operations or maintenance plan has been required to be
Â 


D-1-15
Â 
Â 
instituted by the related Mortgagor that, based on the
ESA, can reasonably be expected to mitigate the identified risk; (C)Â the Environmental Condition identified in the related
environmental report was remediated or abated in all material respects prior to the date hereof, and, if and as appropriate, a
no further action or closure letter was obtained from the applicable governmental regulatory authority (or the environmental issue
affecting the related Mortgaged Property was otherwise listed by such governmental authority as âclosedâ or a reputable
environmental consultant has concluded that no further action is required); (D)Â an environmental policy or a lenderâs
pollution legal liability insurance policy meeting the requirements set forth below that covers liability for the identified circumstance
or condition was obtained from an insurer rated no less than âA-â (or the equivalent) by Moodyâs Investors Service,
Inc., Standard & Poorâs Ratings Services and/or Fitch Ratings, Inc.; (E)Â a party not related to the Mortgagor was
identified as the responsible party for such condition or circumstance and such responsible party has financial resources reasonably
estimated to be adequate to address the situation; or (F)Â a party related to the Mortgagor having financial resources reasonably
estimated to be adequate to address the situation is required to take action. To the sponsorâs knowledge, except as set forth
in the ESA, there is no Environmental Condition (as such term is defined in ASTM E1527-05 or its successor) at the related Mortgaged
Property.
Â 
41.Â Â Â Â Â 
Appraisal. The Mortgage File contains an appraisal of the
related Mortgaged Property with an appraisal date within 6 months of the Mortgage Loan origination date, and within 12 months of
the Closing Date. The appraisal is signed by an appraiser who is a MAI and, to the sponsorâs knowledge, had no interest,
direct or indirect, in the Mortgaged Property or the Mortgagor or in any loan made on the security thereof, and whose compensation
is not affected by the approval or disapproval of the Mortgage Loan. Each appraiser has represented in such appraisal or in a supplemental
letter that the appraisal satisfies the requirements of the âUniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practiceâ
as adopted by the Appraisal Standards Board of the Appraisal Foundation. Each appraisal contains a statement, or is accompanied
by a letter from the appraiser, to the effect that the appraisal was performed in accordance with the requirements of the Financial
Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, as in effect on the date such Mortgage Loan was originated.
Â 
42.Â Â Â Â Â 
Mortgage Loan Schedule. The information pertaining to each
Mortgage Loan which is set forth in the Mortgage Loan ScheduleÂ attached as an exhibit to the related MLPA is true and correct
in all material respects as of the Cut-off Date and contains all information required by the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to
be contained therein.
Â 
43.Â Â Â Â Â 
Cross-Collateralization. Except with respect to a Mortgage
Loan that is part of a Whole Loan, no Mortgage Loan is cross-collateralized or cross-defaulted with any other Mortgage Loan that
is outside the Mortgage Pool, except as set forth on AnnexÂ D-2.
Â 
44.Â Â Â Â Â 
Advance of Funds by the Sponsor. After origination, no advance
of funds has been made by the sponsor to the related Mortgagor other than in accordance with the Mortgage Loan documents, and,
to the sponsorâs knowledge, no funds have been received from any person other than the related Mortgagor or an affiliate
for, or on account of, payments due on the Mortgage Loan (other than as contemplated by the Mortgage Loan documents, such as, by
way of example and not in limitation of the foregoing, amounts paid by the tenant(s) into a Mortgagee-controlled lockbox if required
or contemplated under the related lease or Mortgage Loan documents). Neither the sponsor nor any affiliate thereof has any obligation
to make any capital contribution to any Mortgagor under a Mortgage Loan, other than contributions made on or prior to the date
hereof.
Â 


D-1-16
Â 
Â 
45.Â Â Â Â Â 
Compliance with Anti-Money Laundering Laws. The sponsor has
complied in all material respects with all applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including without limitation
the USA Patriot Act of 2001 with respect to the origination of the Mortgage Loan.
Â 
For purposes of these representations and
warranties, âMortgageeâ means the mortgagee, grantee or beneficiary under any Mortgage, any holder of legal
title to any portion of any Mortgage Loan or, if applicable, any agent or servicer on behalf of such party.
Â 
For purposes of these representations and
warranties, the phrases âthe sponsorâs knowledgeâ or âthe sponsorâs beliefâ and other words
and phrases of like import mean, except where otherwise expressly set forth in these representations and warranties, the actual
state of knowledge or belief of the sponsor, its officers and employees directly responsible for the underwriting, origination,
servicing or sale of the Mortgage Loans regarding the matters expressly set forth in these representations and warranties.

  to which the lease is subject and subordinate to the mortgage and the right of first
  refusal shall not be triggered in the event that the lender, its successors or assigns,
  acquire the Mortgaged Property through a foreclosure, a deed-in-lieu, or otherwise. However,
  such right of first refusal would apply to a foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure
  if the proceeds of such event were sufficient to repay the entire Whole Loan (which has
  an original principal balance of $81,375,000). In addition, such right of first refusal
  would apply to subsequent sales by lender of the Mortgaged Property after it has acquired
  the Mortgaged Property.

  to the mortgage and the right of first offer shall not be triggered in the event the lender, its successors or assigns, acquire

  owns 100% of the equity ownership interest in the fee owner Mortgagor.Â Â The other 51% equity ownership interest
  in Dream LegacyÂ LLC is owned by a family trust of which Diane Foreman, Michelle Foreman Barnetâs mother, is a trustee.Â Â The
  MFB Family Trust obtained its 49% equity ownership interest in Dream LegacyÂ LLC from Diane Foreman and, in connection

  no later than by the date that is 3Â months from the origination date of the Mortgage Loan or such later date established

  is acquired by lender or its nominee or designee pursuant to a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.Â Â The âTender Dateâ
  is the date upon which (i) lender has received and reasonably approved certain specified items provided by the Mortgagor in

  date of the Mortgage Loan. However, with respect to one such ground leasehold parcel,
  known as the Kimaqu Ground Lease, lender has the right to exercise optional renewal terms
  only if there is an event of default under the Kimaqu Ground Lease.
Â 
(j)
  Home Depot, the sole tenant, which ground leases the 6 fee parcels of the Mortgaged Property and ground subleases the
  3 ground leased parcels of the Mortgaged Property from Mortgagor (such ground lease and sublease between Mortgagor and
  Home Depot, the âGround Subleaseâ), is the owner of the improvements on the Mortgaged Property and
  it is entitled to receive insurance proceeds with respect to all insurance it provides relating to the improvements. While
  the Ground Sublease is in effect and Home Depot provides the insurance required under the loan agreement, neither the
  Mortgagor nor the lender is entitled to receive such insurance proceeds. Home Depot has the right, at its election, to
  either rebuild the improvements or to raze such improvements and place the premises in a safe condition.
Â 
(k)
With respect to condemnation, each ground lease provides that condemnation proceeds are disbursed in the following order: (1)Â To
the fee owner for the value of the land taken. (2)Â To the tenant (Mortgagor) for the unamortized costs of the improvements.
(3)Â Remainder to fee owner. The Ground Sublease provides that condemnation proceeds belong to the party to whom such award
is made or if only one award is made, such award shall be allocated between overlandlord (the landlords under the three ground
leases),Â

  condemnation proceeds related to the improvements would be payable to Home Depot.Â Â The Mortgagor would not have
  a claim to any award for the improvements or the fee interest in the land but would be entitled to any award made for the
