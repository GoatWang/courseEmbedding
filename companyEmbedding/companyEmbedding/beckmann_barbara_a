Custom Orders Custom orders require some sort of modification to existing patterns and colorways. Handpainted, printed, and batik designs can be modified in terms of color palette, groundcloth, and configuration. Woven designs and grounds can only be modified in terms of color. Custom orders require the purchase of a strike-off prior to producing a yardage order. Strike-Offs  Price:      Pricing available to trade professionals only through our showrooms or      sales representatives.Shipping and      Handling: 2nd Day Air freight is included in the price of all strike-offs.      Overnight delivery is an additional fee.Terms: A      purchase order, along with payment in full- including shipping and      handling- is required before producing a strike-off.Delivery: 2-3      weeks.Please      include a working sample showing custom colors and their proper placement      with your strike-off order.Strike-offs      are produced using the closest matching groundcloth currently on hand. An      exact colormatch from strike-off to yardage cannot be guaranteed unless      the strike-off order is accompanied by a yardage order with a 50% deposit.      In this instance, all of the groundcloth for the order will be reserved,      and all colors will be mixed while the strike-off is being produced.An approval      form is sent with each strike-off. Written approval is required to proceed      with production of the yardage order.After the      strike-off is sent, additional adjustments in color will be provided using      color daubs. An additional strike-off must be purchased if the designer      chooses to make significant color and/or placement changes after this      point.Strike-offs      are not always a full yard and should not be considered usable for a      client's order. Yardage Orders Price: The      price usually remains the same as for standard orders, although changes      that increase the cost of the groundcloth or make the design more      labor-intensive may affect the final yardage price. Minimum      Order:handpainted, printed designs and grounds: 20 yards.multi-screen       prints and wovens: 50 yard minimum: call for quote.terms       and delivery: same as produced-to-order standard orders. Cancellations and Returns for Custom Orders Custom orders      may not be canceled once the strike-off is approved and production has      begun. Cancellations prior to this point will result in a 40% restocking      fee. Any remaining balance will be credited toward future orders.Custom orders      are not returnable.
