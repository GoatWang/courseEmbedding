Solve the riddles, save creation.

For Vikki death is only a contract away; that is until she wakes up in a strange, remote village on the edge of creation. There she meets a ghostly monk who looks after the small church and an elderly librarian and his son who appear to be the only inhabitants.
That is until Matty and Emily arrive.
Young, vivacious, these young women seem so full of life, except that Matty died in an explosion and Emily was trapped in an underground cathedral with food and water running out.
So what brought them together? What binds them to this place?
In attempting to answer these questions, they discover that creation has contracted a virus and they have been summoned by the mysterious Veil to hack into the core and eradicate the problem. Can they do this before the virus sweeps through the whole of creation and consumes it.

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.
* Denotes a required field. All required fields must be filled out for us to be able to process your form.

We help people distribute information and art spanning a wide range of subject matter while providing a safe, friendly, respectful, and serious site for all content creators. Since our community serves a broad range of ages, we do not encourage content that could make a majority of our users uncomfortable."

Lulu abides by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), which governs how we are to treat claims of copyright infringement. If someone believes in good faith that a Lulu Account Holder has infringed their copyright, they can request that we take down the infringing material by filing a DMCA Notice. To file a DMCA Notice with Lulu, click on the button "Continue".
We reserve the right to ignore a Notice that is not in compliance with the DMCA. When a clear and valid Notice is received pursuant to the guidelines, we will respond by either taking down the allegedly infringing content or blocking access to it, and we may also contact you for more information.
If you are not the copyright holder or its agent and if the content is clearly infringing the copyright of a well-known work, please select "Infringes a well-known work" from the dropdown menu.

Join Thaddeus Finn and his two lady companions Emily and Amelia on three, fast-paced, Steampunk adventures. 
Barbary: the year is 1890 and the prime minister's daughter has been kidnapped by Barbary Corsairs;
Amazon: the year is 1891 and Finn is sent deep into the Amazon basin to discover what has happened to a secret Portuguese outpost;
Himalaya: Hill Fort 9, a remote scientific outpost in British Nepal, has gone silent. Returning from the Amazon aboard the dreadnought class dirigible Armageddon, Finn gets a telegram from his masters in the admiralty. Very soon he finds himself diverted to investigate what has happened. All goes well until Amelia and Emily disappear during the flight from Calcutta to Kathmandu. Finn is left with a dilemma, should he follow his orders and solve the riddle of the missing scientists or disobey them to rescue his beautiful companions.

This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

Robert J. Clark













                    
                    I've been writing fantasy novels since the 1970's while still at school and, when time allows, am bringing them into the digital age.  Yet they were all written longhand.  Inspired by authors such as Tolkein and Moorcock and Arthur C Clark (no relation) I found my own voice and style.  At the time I gave it the name poetic prose.  I thought it was beautiful as the time but on rereading one of my very first novels I realised that often the carefully flowing words obscured the narrative.  I recently heard a little of Dylan Thomas and was surprised at the similarities as I had never read or heard him before.  Work and relationships slowed the pen but honed the style and soon I had found my true voice after a friend remarked to me on reading a short story that there was a novel in there waiting to get out.It did.  That was The Crystal of Mamanoth.  Seven more novels followed in quick succession as the story begun in that 26 page hand written short grew.  Another book was planned and would have been written but the real world interrupted my muse and the story faded.  It remains part written and may, one day, be finished.Darker story lines then presented themselves and two Dark Fantasy novels were put to paper.  These were Soul Key and Angel of St Philips.  A third Sign of Life is about a third complete but again the real world interrupted my thoughts and again the original storyline faded a little.  It will be replaced by another, brighter and better one soon I am sure.
