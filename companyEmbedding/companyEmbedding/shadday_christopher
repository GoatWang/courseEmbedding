Chris Shadday Named President of Viance Succeeding Steve Ainscough






July 08, 2011 09:33 AM Eastern Daylight Time



PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Viance LLC, a joint venture between Rockwood Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: ROC) 
      and The Dow Chemical Company (NYSE: DOW), specializing in microbial 
      control technologies for the treated wood market segment has announced 
      the appointment of Chris Shadday as President of Viance, succeeding 
      Steve Ainscough who has announced his intention to retire. The 
      appointment will take effect August 1, 2011.
    


      Shadday is currently the commercial vice president of Viance. Prior to 
      joining Viance, Shadday had a successful career with Rohm and Haas, a 
      specialty chemical company acquired by Dow in 2009. Shadday originally 
      joined Rohm and Haas in 1989 as a process engineer and subsequently held 
      several technical and commercial roles of increasing responsibility, 
      culminating in his appointment as business segment manager of the 
      consumer and industrial business unit. Shadday joined Viance in 2006 as 
      part of the joint venture between Rockwood Holdings, Inc. and Rohm and 
      Haas. Viance chairman of the board of directors and global general 
      manager for Dow Microbial Control, Mark Henning added, “Chris is an 
      excellent choice for this role and I am looking forward to the many 
      contributions he will bring to the business.”
    

      Throughout 40 years of service, including leadership of the timber 
      treatment business since 1985, Ainscough has guided the company through 
      a number of changes, most notably the formation of the Viance joint 
      venture in 2006. Commenting on the transition, Andrew M. Ross, Viance 
      board member and president of Rockwood Performance Additives, said, 
      “Rockwood and the Viance Board thank Steve for his dedicated, 40 years 
      of service. We are pleased to have identified a successor to Steve 
      within the ranks at Viance. Chris’ previous work experience at Rohm and 
      Haas and Viance, together with his knowledge of the wood treatment 
      business, will serve him well in his new role.”
