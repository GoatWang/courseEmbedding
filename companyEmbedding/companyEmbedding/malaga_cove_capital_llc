You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

					High Unemployment ... A Silver Lining?			

Details

		Created: Friday, 18 October 2013 04:53		


If you happen to be one of the unemployed, then it's probably the most important economic statistic in your life.

If you happen to be one of the unemployed, then it's probably the most important economic statistic in your life. For the investor, it might be more of a mixed blessing. For the Bad News Bears, stubborn high unemployment (over 9%) is the big mantra right now, the lead story. It's a critical economic indicator, but let's think about where it fits when trying to understand economic cycles.

					Are People Buying Stocks Yet?			

Details

		Created: Thursday, 26 April 2012 04:45		


Apparently not

No, says Tobias Levkovich of Citi Research in his February 2 comment. He notes that the retail investor has yanked nearly $400 billion from stock mutual funds over the past 3 years, even as the economic outlook has brightened. Compare this massive outflow to the 1997 – 2000 time frame where the public poured a stunning $775 billion into U.S. stock mutual funds.
“Incredible risk tolerance by retail investors has shifted to stunning stock market revulsion.”

					The Last Domino to Fall			

Details

		Created: Thursday, 19 January 2012 03:45		


The trailing indicator

This is not to make a prediction, but to make an interesting observation: Of the dozen or so, classic economic indicators, unemployment is the laggard, the last one to fall. It measures the effect of the economic cycle, rather than predicting the turn.
When we started to see the light at the end of the tunnel, around 2008, green lights began to show on the screens of different indicators, in a kind of typical sequence. Then in 2011, the hand wringing really focused on the last one standing, unemployment.

					What if			

Details

		Created: Tuesday, 16 August 2011 04:46		


Maybe there's more here than meets the eye.

What if we are missing a miracle, that is right before our eyes?
Economic pain and screaming is all you hear about today; unemployment, a gigantic inventory of repossessed homes, bankrupt governments, unprecedented market volatility and much more.  The noise level, the emergency procedures, the urgency, panic and chaos, it’s sort of like the delivery room of a hospital.

					A Home Is a Lousy Investment			

Details

		Created: Wednesday, 13 July 2011 23:28		


By ROBERT BRIDGES Wall Street JournalMonday, July 11, 2011

Today's young people would be foolish to imitate their parents and view ownership as the cornerstone of personal finance.
At the risk of heaping more misery on the struggling residential property market, an analysis of home-price and ownership data for the last 30 years in California—the Golden State with notoriously golden property prices—indicates that the average single family house has never been a particularly stellar investment.
In a society increasingly concerned with providing for retirement security and housing affordability, this finding has large implications. It means that we have put excessive emphasis on owner-occupied housing for social objectives, mistakenly relied on homebuilding for economic stimulus, and fostered misconceptions about homeownership and financial independence. We've diverted capital from more productive investments and misallocated scarce public resources.

"I am a huge bull on this country. We are not going to have a double-dip recession at all."
Warren Buffett
Warren Buffett, Jeff Immelt and Steve Ballmer are bullish. Buffett said, "I see our businesses coming back across the board." At a summit in Montana, he said "The best is yet to come". Buffett said banks are lending money again, businesses are hiring employees, and he expects the economy to come back stronger than ever.
Ballmer and Immelt chimed in with equally optimistic forecasts. These are some pretty highly respected voices in a wilderness of pessimism.
Might be worth the time to read the complete article in USA Today at www.usat.me?40117782
The opinions expressed above and in the article should not be taken as investment recommendations. They do not speak for Malaga Cove Capital and there is no guarantee that their predictions will be correct. Investing could result in loss of capital.

	Investor Resources	

The Malaga Cove Capital resource center is a collection of investment philosophies that you might find interesting and of value.
  




					Always a temptation			

Temptation to take your eye off the ball is always there. It just takes different forms . . .

Down through history, there has always been some logical argument to stray from your path as a serious, long-term investor. To stay the course sometimes requires a little extra confidence. Today’s temptation to stray is a good one . . .
Long term investing in companies, over time, has shown to be, we believe, the best proven approach to building and preserving wealth. Long term performance of stocks is determined by the success of the company.

					Diversify With Care			

By Mark Choate, Malaga Cove CapitalApril 2010

Diversification is a good thing. It also can be disastrous.
For example, an investor with a 20-year horizon for his long term portfolio might be holding 60% stocks and 40% bonds. If he happens to believe stocks are the preferred investment for this money, the question is “Why is almost half of your portfolio in bonds?” The answer typically is to smooth out short term volatility of the stock market. Notice this answer contains “short term”. So, a good part of his long-term money is now invested with a short term goal. How do bonds perform long term compare to short term? That difference can become a brutal cost in this example. Also, is there a real financial benefit to smoothing out short-term volatility? Or, is it a non-financial benefit, like peace of mind, or the ability to sleep. These might be nice, but there can be a very large cost in long-term underperformance. Cash and bonds can be very expensive shock absorbers for the jittery long-term investor.

					Circles Philosophy			

By Mark Choate, Malaga Cove CapitalMay 2010

 
 
Pause for a second. Sit back and quietly contemplate the circles. The one on the left represents all that you know. The one on the right signifies all that you do not know. The middle one we’ll talk about in a minute. Are these drawn to scale? No way! Your circle is enlarged thousands of times just to be able to see it on a piece of paper. The large one was reduced at least as much, since it would be gigantic, larger than the universe. These visuals will just have to do for our talk.

					Warren Buffet Letter - 'Buy American. I Am'			

By Warren E. Buffet, New York TimesOctober 16 2008

The financial world is a mess, both in the United States and abroad. Its problems, moreover, have been leaking into the general economy, and the leaks are now turning into a gusher. In the near term, unemployment will rise, business activity will falter and headlines will continue to be scary.
So... I’ve been buying American stocks. This is my personal account I’m talking about, in which I previously owned nothing but United States government bonds. (This description leaves aside my Berkshire Hathaway holdings, which are all committed to philanthropy.) If prices keep looking attractive, my non-Berkshire net worth will soon be 100 percent in United States equities.

					John Wooden on Investing			

By Michael Hiltzik, LA TimesJuly 6 2009

John Wooden can still identify the worst step he ever took in his retirement planning. It happened in 1948. That's when the storied UCLA basketball coach accepted the post in Westwood. It was a step up from his head coaching job at Indiana State, though his second choice after the University of Minnesota (which was an hour too late in calling to offer him the job). When the offer came in from UCLA, Wooden told me the other day, he didn't ask a lot of questions. Consequently, he didn't know that UC coaches weren't members of the faculty, but were paid by the student body through its activities arm, Associated Students. That meant he wasn't on the university's retirement plan -- a situation that persisted for 12 years, until athletics were brought under administration control in 1960. So when he retired in 1975, after 27 straight winning seasons and record 10 national titles, he was cheated (my word, not his) of 12 years of pension credit. What's the lesson? "When you make a judgment that doesn't work out, it's not a bad judgment if you've checked things out. That one was a bad judgment because I didn't investigate to begin with. There are plenty of luminaries in this world known only by their first names; Wooden is on the higher plane of those identifiable solely by their title. In this case: "Coach." So when I heard that he was interested in talking about his investment planning and his retirement principles, I leaped at the chance to listen.

I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
