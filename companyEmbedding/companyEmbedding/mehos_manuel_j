      Charges dropped against Houston bank CEO accused of beating wife in front of kids Charges dropped against alleged wife-beating bank CEO   BY  Barbara Ross   NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Friday, August 9, 2013, 11:30 PM     facebook   Tweet   email          Manuel Mehos, 58, leaves Manhattan Criminal Court on Friday. Mehos, a Houston bank CEO, was arrested in December on charges he hit his wife while their children were watching. On Friday, the charges against him were dismissed. (Jefferson Siegel/New York Daily News)       BY  Barbara Ross   NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Friday, August 9, 2013, 11:30 PM    
	Manuel Mehos, the Houston bank CEO accused in December of hitting his wife with their kids watching, was ebullient Friday after criminal charges were dismissed.

	A prosecutor said the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office was not confident it could prove the case against the 58-year-old banker.

	“None of this was ever true,” Mehos said after his case was dropped. “I’m happy and relieved that the truth finally came out and justice was done.”

	Mehos’ estranged spouse, Lisa, 37, claimed he gave her a black eye and fractured finger when he hit her repeatedly at her upper West Side apartment.

	However, Mehos’ attorney Pat Brackley said it was unclear if the injuries were self-inflicted.

	The couple continues to battle for custody of their children in Family Court.
