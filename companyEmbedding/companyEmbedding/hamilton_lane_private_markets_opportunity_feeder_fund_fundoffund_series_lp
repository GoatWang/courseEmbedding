Hamilton Lane Holds Final Close on Strategic Opportunities Fund 2016




6.14.2016
Bala Cynwyd, Penn. – June 14, 2016 – Hamilton Lane, a leading global private markets asset management firm, today announced the final closing of Hamilton Lane Strategic Opportunities Fund 2016 (“the Fund”). The Fund represents more than $210 million in limited partner commitments, exceeding its initial target of $150 million.
The Fund was created as a unique solution for LPs seeking short duration, risk-adjusted returns.  Structured as an annual series with a single-year investment period, the Fund is focused on making credit-oriented investments with consistent cash yield.
“At Hamilton Lane, we are focused on using our global private markets platform to provide solutions to our clients,” said Erik Hirsch, CIO of Hamilton Lane. “In a low-yield, public market environment, private credit provides a unique alternative for those who can access it.”
The Fund consists of new and existing Hamilton Lane investors from around the world, including insurance companies, Taft-Hartley pension plans, endowments/foundations, family offices and other financial institutions.
Hamilton Lane has long been an active investor in targeted strategies, including credit-oriented direct investments and co-investments. While the Fund represents the second dedicated vehicle of its kind, it is an extension of Hamilton Lane’s existing credit platform, which the firm has been building out for more than 17 years.
“With an investment team of more than 80 dedicated private markets professionals, our global platform, as well as our robust network of industry relationships, offers us access to a significant amount of deal flow,” said Drew Schardt, Managing Director. “We believe the Fund offers an attractive solution for investors seeking yield and attractive returns.”

Originally targeting $400 million, the Fund received strong interest from the institutional investor community, exceeding its target to close on $426.8 million.

Hamilton Lane Closes Latest Strategic Opportunities Fund Above Target

Third Annual Fund Designed to Target Private Credit Investments Around the Globe




Jun 14, 2017, 7:00am EDT














BALA CYNWYD, Pa., June 14, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Hamilton Lane (NASDAQ: HLNE) today announced the final closing of Hamilton Lane Strategic Opportunities Fund 2017 ("the Fund"). The Fund represents approximately $435 million in commitments from a wide range of global investors, far exceeding the initial target of $250 million. 
Structured as an annual series with a single-year investment period, the Fund is focused on making credit-oriented investments with consistent cash yield. The 2017 Fund is comprised of a diverse set of institutions, including Taft-Hartley pension funds, insurance companies, endowments/foundations and high net worth individuals, including a number of existing as well as new investors from Asia, the Middle East, Europe and North and South America. 
"The opportunity in the private credit market is meaningful and we expect it to continue to evolve and grow," said Drew Schardt, Managing Director and Global Head of the Private Credit Team at Hamilton Lane. "Hamilton Lane's deep experience in this space coupled with our strong private market relationships continues to drive robust deal volume, enabling us to remain highly selective. We believe the Strategic Opportunities series provides our clients with a flexible credit solution and unique access to these high-quality private market transactions."  
"We're proud to have closed our third Strategic Opportunities Fund after a successful fundraise, and welcome a great mix of investors onto our growing platform," said Emily Nomeir, Principal and Co-Head of the Product Management Group at Hamilton Lane. 
"LPs are being thoughtful in their approach to credit, and the structure of this Fund aims to deliver a high level of flexibility and optionality, while still enabling them to leverage the Hamilton Lane platform. In our recent Private Markets survey, nearly two-thirds of LPs said they planned to increase allocations to private credit, and we saw that investor appetite reflected in the strong demand for the 2017 Fund." 
Hamilton Lane has long been an active investor in targeted strategies, including credit-oriented direct investments and co-investments. While the Fund represents the third dedicated vehicle of its kind, it is an extension of Hamilton Lane's broader credit platform, which the firm has been building for nearly 20 years and represents over $20 billion in assets under management and supervision as of December 31, 2016.
About Hamilton Lane Hamilton Lane (NASDAQ: HLNE) is a leading alternative investment management firm providing innovative private markets solutions to sophisticated investors around the world. Dedicated to private markets investing for 25 years, the firm currently employs more than 290 professionals operating in offices throughout the U.S., Europe, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. With more than $342 billion in total assets under management and supervision as of March 31, 2017, Hamilton Lane offers a full range of investment products and services that enable clients to participate in the private markets asset class on a global and customized basis.
