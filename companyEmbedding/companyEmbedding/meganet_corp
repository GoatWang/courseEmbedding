VME - Virtual Matrix Encryption - 1 Mega Bit Unbreakable Encryption
Virtual Matrix Encryption is a symmetric encryption algoritm with 1 Mega Bit Key. it is uncomparable to AES with only 256 Bit or any other symmetric cypher in existance. Further, it huge key size assures that this technology is future proof - it is unfeasible to do a brute force attack on a Mega Bit Key. No breakthrough in technology will change that. embedded in a FIPS 140-2 Certified Module, it is used by millions of government users worldwide, including the USA governmet. Over 100 products we sell incorporate this breakthrough technology which is also on our GSA Schedule.











VME Terminator - 2,500 Watt Output, 6,000 Concurrent Frequencies
The VME Terminator is like no other Bomb Jammer in the world. Unlike "digital" jammers who "barrage" the spectrum one frequency at a time and therefore allowing raw signals to penetrate, our "analog" bomb jammer continuesly jams all 6,000 frequencies concurrently and continuesly. This amazing feat is thanks to a 15,000 Watt power plant including 7,500 Watt custom generator, 7,500 Watt custom alternator, 500Ah batteries and a strategecly placed antennas to prevent harmonics and distortion. It is the world's most powerful with 100% success rate.











VME Dominator - GSM A5.1 Real Time Cell Phone Interceptor
The VME Terminator is a real time GSM A5.1 cell phone interceptor. It can not be detected. It aloows to itercept voice and text. It lso allows voice manipulation, up or down channel blocking, text intercept and modification, calling and sending text on behalf of the user, and also allows directional finding of a user during random monitoring of calls. The VME Dominator is far superior to passive systems in being able to intervene and manipulate calls and sms, working with up to 4 base stations concurrently, and up to 20 users in the system at any one time.











VME Cell, VME Phone & VME Radio Encrypted Communication
The VME Cell allows encrypted communications between cell phones. It includes voice encryption, text encryption, and encrypted conference calls. In addition, it offers a Windows PC version and a Linux PC version for the Office. The calls placed can't be intercepted or listened to. It works over 2G, 3G & 4G connections. The VME Radio offers encrypted radios for military use that are digitally encrypted and can't be intercepted or decodes. 











VME BioDrive Offers Biometric Flash Storage Devices from 1GB to 2TB
The VME BioDrive is a flash storage device offering biometric data encryption to prevent the loss of sensitive data in case the drive is lost. The drive offers auditing per transaction, easy user interface and many other unique features. There is also an optional key recovery mechanism. The VME Drive is another version without biometric that offers password data protection. Both products utilize our FIPS 140-2 certified crypto engine, and are on a GSA Schedule. Those drives are used by governments and corporations worldwide and offer the ultimate security.











VME Spy & Rat Phones, Spy Laptops, Fixtures and many other items.
The VME Spy & Rat Phones offers a unique combination of eavesdropping remotely and GPS coordinates via triangulation. It allows an operator to carry the spy phone to allow the agency to dial in quietly and record the conversation. Further, should the agent get in trouble they can send a silent sms to get the GPS coordinates to rescue the agent. In a victim mode, the unaware user is under constant surveillance sending quiet sms messages of any calls they make, and exposing their location. The law enforcement agency can listen in at will. Also integrated into laptops, fixtures and other items.

Shares totaling 10,000,000 offered by this prospectus are being offered solely 
for the account of the selling stockholders. We will not receive any proceeds 
from the sale of the shares by the selling stockholders.


Our competition consists principally of other defense industry contractors. Of 
this group, the five that are among the largest and constitute our main 
competition are Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, Harris 
Corporation and ITT Corporation. Because of the effectiveness of the VME 
Technology that supports our encryption products and which is protected by 
U.S. Patent # 6,219,421, and the effectiveness of certain of our real-time 
interceptor products that to date, no one we know of has been able to 
duplicate, Meganet feels it does not have competition in relation to these 
products. However, because of the effectiveness of some of these products and 
because of their importance in military and intelligence applications, our 
markets in some products are limited to the U.S. military and certain federal 
agencies. However, with most of our products our market is worldwide after 
obtaining the necessary export license under ITAR. If these entities are not 
purchasing these products at a particular time or if we have supplied them all 
that they need at any particular time, our opportunity to sell product is 
limited, even if we do not have competition with respect to these products.


Company Description
Meganet is in the business of inventing, developing, producing and marketing 
data security, intelligence/counter-intelligence and military operational 
devices. Meganet’s products include among other things encryption devices, 
bomb jammers, communication interceptors, devices that render


 communications 
secure and spy phones. Meganet’s success is largely dependent upon selling 
products to the U.S. military and the U.S. intelligence agencies. 

The purchasers of our products are predominantly governments and militaries 
which can create sporadic sales cycles typified by large purchases separated 
by low or quiet periods in between. For example, during times of war which can 
happen quickly, a country will have immediate need of products for military 
defense such as bomb jammers. During times of peace, bomb jammers may not be 
needed for many years. To the contrary, as a country develops and implements 
a long term homeland security strategy, it may put out bids for certain types 
of intelligence and counter-intelligence products that may stay out to bid 
for one to two years. These sales dynamics create times when the Company 
markets its products for many months without monthly revenue or cash flow. It 
also creates the potential circumstance of a large sale on the spur of the 
moment. Accordingly, sales and cash flow are difficult to predict with large 
sales always being a possibility with periods of low or no sales also being a 
possibility.
