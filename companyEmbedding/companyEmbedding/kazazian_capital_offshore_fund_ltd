About Cross Shore Capital Management, LLC 

Ownership

Cross Shore Capital Management, LLC (“Cross Shore”) was founded in November 2002 and manages funds of hedge funds focusing on long/short equity managers.
Cross Shore is wholly owned by Victor Linell, Benjamin Bloomstone and Neil Kuttner, the firm’s managing members.
The majority of the founders’ liquid net worth is invested in the Cross Shore Funds.

Structure

Cross Shore is a Delaware limited liability company with its principal office in Great Neck, New York.
Cross Shore is a registered investment advisor with the SEC, CRD # 136650. Please see the SEC website (www.sec.gov) to view our Form ADV.
Cross Shore is a qualified professional asset manager (“QPAM”). However, please note that at the present time we are not accepting Title One ERISA money.
Since the firm’s inception there have been no material changes to the firm’s structure.
The firm launched its first product, Cross Shore Partners, LP, an accredited investor fund in January 2003. In July 2003, the firm launched an offshore version, Cross Shore Fund, Ltd.  Both funds are now closed to new investors. To accommodate Qualified Purchasers, Cross Shore launched Cross Shore QP Partners, LP on January 1, 2004 and Cross Shore Overseas Fund, Ltd. on April 1, 2008.  As firm assets have grown, Cross Shore has invested in personnel, research, operations and client service.
Neither the firm nor any of its principals or employees derive revenue from any line of business outside of Cross Shore.
