If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

History[edit]
The company was founded by Reto Ringger in 1995 as the world's first investment company focused solely on sustainability themes.[6] The headquarters are in Zurich, Switzerland and RobecoSAM has approximately 100 employees.[7] Its parent company is the Dutch-based Robeco, which is a subsidiary of Rabobank.

Operations[edit]
The company’s assets under management and advice amount to about USD 11.5 billion (as of June 30, 2012).[14]
The main areas of business are: asset management, indexes, private equity and sustainability services (company benchmarking reports).[15]
In 1999, RobecoSAMand Dow Jones Indexes came together to produce the world’s first family of sustainability indexes called the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes (DJSI).[16] In 2012, S&P Indices and Dow Jones Indexes merged to form S&P Dow Jones Indices.[17] SAM now works with S&P Dow Jones Indices to produce the DJSI.
The DJSI are constructed according to the best-in-class approach and track the performance of global leaders in sustainability. Companies are chosen for the index based on an assessment of their economic, environmental and social practices.[18]
The Dow Jones Sustainability Index Family includes:[14]

Dow Jones Sustainability World Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Europe Index
Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Asia Pacific Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Korea Index

Asset Management[edit]
The asset management business is based purely on investing in sustainable companies. Although SAM refers to it as Sustainability Investing, this is often referred to in the mainstream as Socially Responsible Investing (SRI). Sustainable investing is based on the assumption that financial markets represent a powerful mechanism to promote sustainable business practices. Proponents of sustainable investing say that integrating sustainability considerations into investment decisions can lead to superior risk-adjusted returns over the long term.[19]
SAM has theme strategies based on major sustainability trends such as water, energy, materials, agribusiness, and climate. It also has core regional products such as a sustainable global active fund and a sustainable European equities fund.[20] The SAM Sustainable Water Fund received a lot of recognition as it was one of the first of its kind to be launched in 2001.[21] In 2011 it celebrated its 10th Anniversary.[22]
Clean Tech Private Equity[edit]
SAM houses the clean tech private equity team of its parent company Robeco, which is a member of ORIX.[23] The concept of clean tech investing is based on a world that is characterized by rapid population growth, finite natural resources, high prices and material shortages; all of which call for more efficient production processes. Investments include products, services, and processes across industry verticals that are designed to improve the productive and responsible use of natural resources, greatly reduce or eliminate environmental damage and provide superior performance at lower costs.[24]
SAM Clean Tech Private Equity invests in sustainable private equity through co-investments in unlisted companies or through private equity fund of funds. Since 2004, they have been integrating the ESG framework into investment process. The United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment indicated that SAM Clean Tech Private Equity is a leader in integrating ESG into the investment process as well as into its ownership policies and practices.[25][26] In 2010, Investment & Pensions Europe (IPE) named SAM Private Equity as the most Responsible European Private Equity Investor.[27]

Sustainability Services[edit]
In 2006, SAM founded a sustainability services division. Sustainability services provides company benchmarking reports[28] that provide companies with details about their individual sustainability performance as well as a peer group comparison.[29] Companies can see their strengths and weaknesses mapped against sustainability criterion and compared to best practice examples.[30]
SAM Research[edit]
SAM’s asset management, index and sustainability services are all rooted in its proprietary in-house research division. The financial analysts generate stock recommendations based on a combination of financial sustainability criteria.
The Research team develops the methodology for the annual corporate sustainability assessment that is used to determine the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.[31] SAM research has been analyzing companies along sustainability metrics since 1995 and has developed one of the largest global corporate sustainability databases. The research department often collaborates with academia to share the valuable data from this proprietary database. Ongoing collaborations include projects with ETH and IESE Business School.
Corporate sustainability assessment[edit]
The corporate sustainability assessment is an industry-specific questionnaire that is sent out to the 2,500 largest corporations. Accordingly, SAM annually assesses around 2,000 of the world's largest companies in 60 industry groups and determines their respective sustainability rating.[32] The assessment examines companies based on environmental social and corporate governance factors (ESG factors), which serve as the primary basis for determining a company's level of sustainability and subsequent global impact.[33] The questionnaire has a focus on long-term sustainability topics that are relevant to each industry including human capital, brands and innovation. Some of the sectors they look at include: airlines, communication technology, beverages, auto parts & tires, waste & disposal services, and electricity.[34] After the assessment, each participating company receives a peer benchmarking analysis.[35]
The family of Dow Jones Sustainability Index are based on the results of the corporate sustainability assessment.[31]
Much of the data derived from the corporate sustainability assessment is used in SAM's financial analysis. The data is integrated into the valuation models. Full integration of sustainability into valuation analysis is a differing approach to using data as a sustainability overlay. Advocates of the integration approach state that it is a more accurate reflection of the companies value as it takes into account the various ways in which sustainability factors affect different business models and cost structures.[36][37]
Also from the results of the corporate sustainability assessment, SAM produces a "Sustainability Yearbook"[34] in which they announce the companies that have been ranked as sustainability "sector leaders" and/or "sector movers". They also give a small number of companies a classification of gold, silver or bronze to recognize their added commitment to sustainability issues.[38] Sector leaders in the past have included: Adidas, BMW, Nokia, Panasonic, PepsiCo, Pirelli, and Rolls-Royce Group plc. Sector movers in the past have included: Air France, Fiat, Hormel, IBM, Mitsubishi, and Starbucks.
Awards[edit]

Best Climate Change Fund, 2010: The SAM Sustainable Climate Fund was awarded the "Best Climate Change Fund" by Investment Week[39]
SRI/Sustainable Investment Manager of the Year Award, 2010: awarded by Financial News in October 2010.[40]
TBLI Best Asset Manager Investing in ESG, 2008, 2009: awarded by IPE TBLI Group ESG Leaders Awards[41]

Sustainability leadership awards[edit]
In 2001, SAM and Sustainable Performance Group (SPG)[46] founded the sustainability leadership award. The award ran from 2001–2010 and was presented annually to a chosen sustainability leader and pioneer.[47]

History[edit]
The company was founded by Reto Ringger in 1995 as the world's first investment company focused solely on sustainability themes.[6] The headquarters are in Zurich, Switzerland and RobecoSAM has approximately 100 employees.[7] Its parent company is the Dutch-based Robeco, which is a subsidiary of Rabobank.

2012 SAM named Sustainable Investor of the Year by the Financial Times and the International Finance Corporation[13]
2013 SAM becomes RobecoSAM
Operations[edit]
The company’s assets under management and advice amount to about USD 11.5 billion (as of June 30, 2012).[14]
The main areas of business are: asset management, indexes, private equity and sustainability services (company benchmarking reports).[15]
In 1999, RobecoSAMand Dow Jones Indexes came together to produce the world’s first family of sustainability indexes called the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes (DJSI).[16] In 2012, S&P Indices and Dow Jones Indexes merged to form S&P Dow Jones Indices.[17] SAM now works with S&P Dow Jones Indices to produce the DJSI.
The DJSI are constructed according to the best-in-class approach and track the performance of global leaders in sustainability. Companies are chosen for the index based on an assessment of their economic, environmental and social practices.[18]
The Dow Jones Sustainability Index Family includes:[14]

Dow Jones Sustainability World Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Europe Index
Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Asia Pacific Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Korea Index

Asset Management[edit]
The asset management business is based purely on investing in sustainable companies. Although SAM refers to it as Sustainability Investing, this is often referred to in the mainstream as Socially Responsible Investing (SRI). Sustainable investing is based on the assumption that financial markets represent a powerful mechanism to promote sustainable business practices. Proponents of sustainable investing say that integrating sustainability considerations into investment decisions can lead to superior risk-adjusted returns over the long term.[19]
SAM has theme strategies based on major sustainability trends such as water, energy, materials, agribusiness, and climate. It also has core regional products such as a sustainable global active fund and a sustainable European equities fund.[20] The SAM Sustainable Water Fund received a lot of recognition as it was one of the first of its kind to be launched in 2001.[21] In 2011 it celebrated its 10th Anniversary.[22]
Clean Tech Private Equity[edit]
SAM houses the clean tech private equity team of its parent company Robeco, which is a member of ORIX.[23] The concept of clean tech investing is based on a world that is characterized by rapid population growth, finite natural resources, high prices and material shortages; all of which call for more efficient production processes. Investments include products, services, and processes across industry verticals that are designed to improve the productive and responsible use of natural resources, greatly reduce or eliminate environmental damage and provide superior performance at lower costs.[24]
SAM Clean Tech Private Equity invests in sustainable private equity through co-investments in unlisted companies or through private equity fund of funds. Since 2004, they have been integrating the ESG framework into investment process. The United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment indicated that SAM Clean Tech Private Equity is a leader in integrating ESG into the investment process as well as into its ownership policies and practices.[25][26] In 2010, Investment & Pensions Europe (IPE) named SAM Private Equity as the most Responsible European Private Equity Investor.[27]
The table below demonstrates some examples of clean tech sectors and technologies:

Sustainability Services[edit]
In 2006, SAM founded a sustainability services division. Sustainability services provides company benchmarking reports[28] that provide companies with details about their individual sustainability performance as well as a peer group comparison.[29] Companies can see their strengths and weaknesses mapped against sustainability criterion and compared to best practice examples.[30]
SAM Research[edit]
SAM’s asset management, index and sustainability services are all rooted in its proprietary in-house research division. The financial analysts generate stock recommendations based on a combination of financial sustainability criteria.
The Research team develops the methodology for the annual corporate sustainability assessment that is used to determine the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.[31] SAM research has been analyzing companies along sustainability metrics since 1995 and has developed one of the largest global corporate sustainability databases. The research department often collaborates with academia to share the valuable data from this proprietary database. Ongoing collaborations include projects with ETH and IESE Business School.
Corporate sustainability assessment[edit]
The corporate sustainability assessment is an industry-specific questionnaire that is sent out to the 2,500 largest corporations. Accordingly, SAM annually assesses around 2,000 of the world's largest companies in 60 industry groups and determines their respective sustainability rating.[32] The assessment examines companies based on environmental social and corporate governance factors (ESG factors), which serve as the primary basis for determining a company's level of sustainability and subsequent global impact.[33] The questionnaire has a focus on long-term sustainability topics that are relevant to each industry including human capital, brands and innovation. Some of the sectors they look at include: airlines, communication technology, beverages, auto parts & tires, waste & disposal services, and electricity.[34] After the assessment, each participating company receives a peer benchmarking analysis.[35]
The family of Dow Jones Sustainability Index are based on the results of the corporate sustainability assessment.[31]
Much of the data derived from the corporate sustainability assessment is used in SAM's financial analysis. The data is integrated into the valuation models. Full integration of sustainability into valuation analysis is a differing approach to using data as a sustainability overlay. Advocates of the integration approach state that it is a more accurate reflection of the companies value as it takes into account the various ways in which sustainability factors affect different business models and cost structures.[36][37]
Also from the results of the corporate sustainability assessment, SAM produces a "Sustainability Yearbook"[34] in which they announce the companies that have been ranked as sustainability "sector leaders" and/or "sector movers". They also give a small number of companies a classification of gold, silver or bronze to recognize their added commitment to sustainability issues.[38] Sector leaders in the past have included: Adidas, BMW, Nokia, Panasonic, PepsiCo, Pirelli, and Rolls-Royce Group plc. Sector movers in the past have included: Air France, Fiat, Hormel, IBM, Mitsubishi, and Starbucks.
Awards[edit]

Best Climate Change Fund, 2010: The SAM Sustainable Climate Fund was awarded the "Best Climate Change Fund" by Investment Week[39]
SRI/Sustainable Investment Manager of the Year Award, 2010: awarded by Financial News in October 2010.[40]
TBLI Best Asset Manager Investing in ESG, 2008, 2009: awarded by IPE TBLI Group ESG Leaders Awards[41]

Memberships[edit]
SAM is a member of the following organizations:[42]

PRI, Principles for Responsible Investment[43]
Eurosif, European Social Investment Forum[44]
Ceres, Investors and Environmentalists for Sustainable Prosperity
ASrIA, The Association for Sustainable & Responsible Investment in Asia[45]

Sustainability leadership awards[edit]
In 2001, SAM and Sustainable Performance Group (SPG)[46] founded the sustainability leadership award. The award ran from 2001–2010 and was presented annually to a chosen sustainability leader and pioneer.[47]
It was founded under the belief that individuals who place a great importance and effort to promote sustainability in the workplace should be publicly recognized.[48]

The Dow Jones Sustainability Index Family includes:[14]

Dow Jones Sustainability World Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Europe Index
Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Asia Pacific Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Korea Index

Asset Management[edit]
The asset management business is based purely on investing in sustainable companies. Although SAM refers to it as Sustainability Investing, this is often referred to in the mainstream as Socially Responsible Investing (SRI). Sustainable investing is based on the assumption that financial markets represent a powerful mechanism to promote sustainable business practices. Proponents of sustainable investing say that integrating sustainability considerations into investment decisions can lead to superior risk-adjusted returns over the long term.[19]
SAM has theme strategies based on major sustainability trends such as water, energy, materials, agribusiness, and climate. It also has core regional products such as a sustainable global active fund and a sustainable European equities fund.[20] The SAM Sustainable Water Fund received a lot of recognition as it was one of the first of its kind to be launched in 2001.[21] In 2011 it celebrated its 10th Anniversary.[22]
Clean Tech Private Equity[edit]
SAM houses the clean tech private equity team of its parent company Robeco, which is a member of ORIX.[23] The concept of clean tech investing is based on a world that is characterized by rapid population growth, finite natural resources, high prices and material shortages; all of which call for more efficient production processes. Investments include products, services, and processes across industry verticals that are designed to improve the productive and responsible use of natural resources, greatly reduce or eliminate environmental damage and provide superior performance at lower costs.[24]
SAM Clean Tech Private Equity invests in sustainable private equity through co-investments in unlisted companies or through private equity fund of funds. Since 2004, they have been integrating the ESG framework into investment process. The United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment indicated that SAM Clean Tech Private Equity is a leader in integrating ESG into the investment process as well as into its ownership policies and practices.[25][26] In 2010, Investment & Pensions Europe (IPE) named SAM Private Equity as the most Responsible European Private Equity Investor.[27]
The table below demonstrates some examples of clean tech sectors and technologies:

Sustainability Services[edit]
In 2006, SAM founded a sustainability services division. Sustainability services provides company benchmarking reports[28] that provide companies with details about their individual sustainability performance as well as a peer group comparison.[29] Companies can see their strengths and weaknesses mapped against sustainability criterion and compared to best practice examples.[30]
SAM Research[edit]
SAM’s asset management, index and sustainability services are all rooted in its proprietary in-house research division. The financial analysts generate stock recommendations based on a combination of financial sustainability criteria.
The Research team develops the methodology for the annual corporate sustainability assessment that is used to determine the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.[31] SAM research has been analyzing companies along sustainability metrics since 1995 and has developed one of the largest global corporate sustainability databases. The research department often collaborates with academia to share the valuable data from this proprietary database. Ongoing collaborations include projects with ETH and IESE Business School.
Corporate sustainability assessment[edit]
The corporate sustainability assessment is an industry-specific questionnaire that is sent out to the 2,500 largest corporations. Accordingly, SAM annually assesses around 2,000 of the world's largest companies in 60 industry groups and determines their respective sustainability rating.[32] The assessment examines companies based on environmental social and corporate governance factors (ESG factors), which serve as the primary basis for determining a company's level of sustainability and subsequent global impact.[33] The questionnaire has a focus on long-term sustainability topics that are relevant to each industry including human capital, brands and innovation. Some of the sectors they look at include: airlines, communication technology, beverages, auto parts & tires, waste & disposal services, and electricity.[34] After the assessment, each participating company receives a peer benchmarking analysis.[35]
The family of Dow Jones Sustainability Index are based on the results of the corporate sustainability assessment.[31]
Much of the data derived from the corporate sustainability assessment is used in SAM's financial analysis. The data is integrated into the valuation models. Full integration of sustainability into valuation analysis is a differing approach to using data as a sustainability overlay. Advocates of the integration approach state that it is a more accurate reflection of the companies value as it takes into account the various ways in which sustainability factors affect different business models and cost structures.[36][37]
Also from the results of the corporate sustainability assessment, SAM produces a "Sustainability Yearbook"[34] in which they announce the companies that have been ranked as sustainability "sector leaders" and/or "sector movers". They also give a small number of companies a classification of gold, silver or bronze to recognize their added commitment to sustainability issues.[38] Sector leaders in the past have included: Adidas, BMW, Nokia, Panasonic, PepsiCo, Pirelli, and Rolls-Royce Group plc. Sector movers in the past have included: Air France, Fiat, Hormel, IBM, Mitsubishi, and Starbucks.

Best Climate Change Fund, 2010: The SAM Sustainable Climate Fund was awarded the "Best Climate Change Fund" by Investment Week[39]
SRI/Sustainable Investment Manager of the Year Award, 2010: awarded by Financial News in October 2010.[40]

History[edit]
The company was founded by Reto Ringger in 1995 as the world's first investment company focused solely on sustainability themes.[6] The headquarters are in Zurich, Switzerland and RobecoSAM has approximately 100 employees.[7] Its parent company is the Dutch-based Robeco, which is a subsidiary of Rabobank.

Operations[edit]
The company’s assets under management and advice amount to about USD 11.5 billion (as of June 30, 2012).[14]
The main areas of business are: asset management, indexes, private equity and sustainability services (company benchmarking reports).[15]
In 1999, RobecoSAMand Dow Jones Indexes came together to produce the world’s first family of sustainability indexes called the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes (DJSI).[16] In 2012, S&P Indices and Dow Jones Indexes merged to form S&P Dow Jones Indices.[17] SAM now works with S&P Dow Jones Indices to produce the DJSI.
The DJSI are constructed according to the best-in-class approach and track the performance of global leaders in sustainability. Companies are chosen for the index based on an assessment of their economic, environmental and social practices.[18]
The Dow Jones Sustainability Index Family includes:[14]

Dow Jones Sustainability World Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Europe Index
Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Asia Pacific Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Korea Index

Asset Management[edit]
The asset management business is based purely on investing in sustainable companies. Although SAM refers to it as Sustainability Investing, this is often referred to in the mainstream as Socially Responsible Investing (SRI). Sustainable investing is based on the assumption that financial markets represent a powerful mechanism to promote sustainable business practices. Proponents of sustainable investing say that integrating sustainability considerations into investment decisions can lead to superior risk-adjusted returns over the long term.[19]
SAM has theme strategies based on major sustainability trends such as water, energy, materials, agribusiness, and climate. It also has core regional products such as a sustainable global active fund and a sustainable European equities fund.[20] The SAM Sustainable Water Fund received a lot of recognition as it was one of the first of its kind to be launched in 2001.[21] In 2011 it celebrated its 10th Anniversary.[22]
Clean Tech Private Equity[edit]
SAM houses the clean tech private equity team of its parent company Robeco, which is a member of ORIX.[23] The concept of clean tech investing is based on a world that is characterized by rapid population growth, finite natural resources, high prices and material shortages; all of which call for more efficient production processes. Investments include products, services, and processes across industry verticals that are designed to improve the productive and responsible use of natural resources, greatly reduce or eliminate environmental damage and provide superior performance at lower costs.[24]
SAM Clean Tech Private Equity invests in sustainable private equity through co-investments in unlisted companies or through private equity fund of funds. Since 2004, they have been integrating the ESG framework into investment process. The United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment indicated that SAM Clean Tech Private Equity is a leader in integrating ESG into the investment process as well as into its ownership policies and practices.[25][26] In 2010, Investment & Pensions Europe (IPE) named SAM Private Equity as the most Responsible European Private Equity Investor.[27]

Sustainability Services[edit]
In 2006, SAM founded a sustainability services division. Sustainability services provides company benchmarking reports[28] that provide companies with details about their individual sustainability performance as well as a peer group comparison.[29] Companies can see their strengths and weaknesses mapped against sustainability criterion and compared to best practice examples.[30]
SAM Research[edit]
SAM’s asset management, index and sustainability services are all rooted in its proprietary in-house research division. The financial analysts generate stock recommendations based on a combination of financial sustainability criteria.
The Research team develops the methodology for the annual corporate sustainability assessment that is used to determine the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.[31] SAM research has been analyzing companies along sustainability metrics since 1995 and has developed one of the largest global corporate sustainability databases. The research department often collaborates with academia to share the valuable data from this proprietary database. Ongoing collaborations include projects with ETH and IESE Business School.
Corporate sustainability assessment[edit]
The corporate sustainability assessment is an industry-specific questionnaire that is sent out to the 2,500 largest corporations. Accordingly, SAM annually assesses around 2,000 of the world's largest companies in 60 industry groups and determines their respective sustainability rating.[32] The assessment examines companies based on environmental social and corporate governance factors (ESG factors), which serve as the primary basis for determining a company's level of sustainability and subsequent global impact.[33] The questionnaire has a focus on long-term sustainability topics that are relevant to each industry including human capital, brands and innovation. Some of the sectors they look at include: airlines, communication technology, beverages, auto parts & tires, waste & disposal services, and electricity.[34] After the assessment, each participating company receives a peer benchmarking analysis.[35]
The family of Dow Jones Sustainability Index are based on the results of the corporate sustainability assessment.[31]
Much of the data derived from the corporate sustainability assessment is used in SAM's financial analysis. The data is integrated into the valuation models. Full integration of sustainability into valuation analysis is a differing approach to using data as a sustainability overlay. Advocates of the integration approach state that it is a more accurate reflection of the companies value as it takes into account the various ways in which sustainability factors affect different business models and cost structures.[36][37]
Also from the results of the corporate sustainability assessment, SAM produces a "Sustainability Yearbook"[34] in which they announce the companies that have been ranked as sustainability "sector leaders" and/or "sector movers". They also give a small number of companies a classification of gold, silver or bronze to recognize their added commitment to sustainability issues.[38] Sector leaders in the past have included: Adidas, BMW, Nokia, Panasonic, PepsiCo, Pirelli, and Rolls-Royce Group plc. Sector movers in the past have included: Air France, Fiat, Hormel, IBM, Mitsubishi, and Starbucks.
Awards[edit]

Best Climate Change Fund, 2010: The SAM Sustainable Climate Fund was awarded the "Best Climate Change Fund" by Investment Week[39]
SRI/Sustainable Investment Manager of the Year Award, 2010: awarded by Financial News in October 2010.[40]
TBLI Best Asset Manager Investing in ESG, 2008, 2009: awarded by IPE TBLI Group ESG Leaders Awards[41]

PRI, Principles for Responsible Investment[43]
Eurosif, European Social Investment Forum[44]
Ceres, Investors and Environmentalists for Sustainable Prosperity
ASrIA, The Association for Sustainable & Responsible Investment in Asia[45]

Sustainability leadership awards[edit]
In 2001, SAM and Sustainable Performance Group (SPG)[46] founded the sustainability leadership award. The award ran from 2001–2010 and was presented annually to a chosen sustainability leader and pioneer.[47]

The main areas of business are: asset management, indexes, private equity and sustainability services (company benchmarking reports).[15]
In 1999, RobecoSAMand Dow Jones Indexes came together to produce the world’s first family of sustainability indexes called the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes (DJSI).[16] In 2012, S&P Indices and Dow Jones Indexes merged to form S&P Dow Jones Indices.[17] SAM now works with S&P Dow Jones Indices to produce the DJSI.
The DJSI are constructed according to the best-in-class approach and track the performance of global leaders in sustainability. Companies are chosen for the index based on an assessment of their economic, environmental and social practices.[18]
The Dow Jones Sustainability Index Family includes:[14]

Dow Jones Sustainability World Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Europe Index
Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Asia Pacific Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Korea Index

Asset Management[edit]
The asset management business is based purely on investing in sustainable companies. Although SAM refers to it as Sustainability Investing, this is often referred to in the mainstream as Socially Responsible Investing (SRI). Sustainable investing is based on the assumption that financial markets represent a powerful mechanism to promote sustainable business practices. Proponents of sustainable investing say that integrating sustainability considerations into investment decisions can lead to superior risk-adjusted returns over the long term.[19]
SAM has theme strategies based on major sustainability trends such as water, energy, materials, agribusiness, and climate. It also has core regional products such as a sustainable global active fund and a sustainable European equities fund.[20] The SAM Sustainable Water Fund received a lot of recognition as it was one of the first of its kind to be launched in 2001.[21] In 2011 it celebrated its 10th Anniversary.[22]
Clean Tech Private Equity[edit]
SAM houses the clean tech private equity team of its parent company Robeco, which is a member of ORIX.[23] The concept of clean tech investing is based on a world that is characterized by rapid population growth, finite natural resources, high prices and material shortages; all of which call for more efficient production processes. Investments include products, services, and processes across industry verticals that are designed to improve the productive and responsible use of natural resources, greatly reduce or eliminate environmental damage and provide superior performance at lower costs.[24]
SAM Clean Tech Private Equity invests in sustainable private equity through co-investments in unlisted companies or through private equity fund of funds. Since 2004, they have been integrating the ESG framework into investment process. The United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment indicated that SAM Clean Tech Private Equity is a leader in integrating ESG into the investment process as well as into its ownership policies and practices.[25][26] In 2010, Investment & Pensions Europe (IPE) named SAM Private Equity as the most Responsible European Private Equity Investor.[27]
The table below demonstrates some examples of clean tech sectors and technologies:

Sustainability Services[edit]
In 2006, SAM founded a sustainability services division. Sustainability services provides company benchmarking reports[28] that provide companies with details about their individual sustainability performance as well as a peer group comparison.[29] Companies can see their strengths and weaknesses mapped against sustainability criterion and compared to best practice examples.[30]
SAM Research[edit]
SAM’s asset management, index and sustainability services are all rooted in its proprietary in-house research division. The financial analysts generate stock recommendations based on a combination of financial sustainability criteria.
The Research team develops the methodology for the annual corporate sustainability assessment that is used to determine the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.[31] SAM research has been analyzing companies along sustainability metrics since 1995 and has developed one of the largest global corporate sustainability databases. The research department often collaborates with academia to share the valuable data from this proprietary database. Ongoing collaborations include projects with ETH and IESE Business School.
Corporate sustainability assessment[edit]
The corporate sustainability assessment is an industry-specific questionnaire that is sent out to the 2,500 largest corporations. Accordingly, SAM annually assesses around 2,000 of the world's largest companies in 60 industry groups and determines their respective sustainability rating.[32] The assessment examines companies based on environmental social and corporate governance factors (ESG factors), which serve as the primary basis for determining a company's level of sustainability and subsequent global impact.[33] The questionnaire has a focus on long-term sustainability topics that are relevant to each industry including human capital, brands and innovation. Some of the sectors they look at include: airlines, communication technology, beverages, auto parts & tires, waste & disposal services, and electricity.[34] After the assessment, each participating company receives a peer benchmarking analysis.[35]
The family of Dow Jones Sustainability Index are based on the results of the corporate sustainability assessment.[31]
Much of the data derived from the corporate sustainability assessment is used in SAM's financial analysis. The data is integrated into the valuation models. Full integration of sustainability into valuation analysis is a differing approach to using data as a sustainability overlay. Advocates of the integration approach state that it is a more accurate reflection of the companies value as it takes into account the various ways in which sustainability factors affect different business models and cost structures.[36][37]
Also from the results of the corporate sustainability assessment, SAM produces a "Sustainability Yearbook"[34] in which they announce the companies that have been ranked as sustainability "sector leaders" and/or "sector movers". They also give a small number of companies a classification of gold, silver or bronze to recognize their added commitment to sustainability issues.[38] Sector leaders in the past have included: Adidas, BMW, Nokia, Panasonic, PepsiCo, Pirelli, and Rolls-Royce Group plc. Sector movers in the past have included: Air France, Fiat, Hormel, IBM, Mitsubishi, and Starbucks.
Awards[edit]

Best Climate Change Fund, 2010: The SAM Sustainable Climate Fund was awarded the "Best Climate Change Fund" by Investment Week[39]
SRI/Sustainable Investment Manager of the Year Award, 2010: awarded by Financial News in October 2010.[40]
TBLI Best Asset Manager Investing in ESG, 2008, 2009: awarded by IPE TBLI Group ESG Leaders Awards[41]

Memberships[edit]
SAM is a member of the following organizations:[42]

PRI, Principles for Responsible Investment[43]
Eurosif, European Social Investment Forum[44]
Ceres, Investors and Environmentalists for Sustainable Prosperity
ASrIA, The Association for Sustainable & Responsible Investment in Asia[45]

Sustainability leadership awards[edit]
In 2001, SAM and Sustainable Performance Group (SPG)[46] founded the sustainability leadership award. The award ran from 2001–2010 and was presented annually to a chosen sustainability leader and pioneer.[47]

History[edit]
The company was founded by Reto Ringger in 1995 as the world's first investment company focused solely on sustainability themes.[6] The headquarters are in Zurich, Switzerland and RobecoSAM has approximately 100 employees.[7] Its parent company is the Dutch-based Robeco, which is a subsidiary of Rabobank.

Operations[edit]
The company’s assets under management and advice amount to about USD 11.5 billion (as of June 30, 2012).[14]
The main areas of business are: asset management, indexes, private equity and sustainability services (company benchmarking reports).[15]
In 1999, RobecoSAMand Dow Jones Indexes came together to produce the world’s first family of sustainability indexes called the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes (DJSI).[16] In 2012, S&P Indices and Dow Jones Indexes merged to form S&P Dow Jones Indices.[17] SAM now works with S&P Dow Jones Indices to produce the DJSI.
The DJSI are constructed according to the best-in-class approach and track the performance of global leaders in sustainability. Companies are chosen for the index based on an assessment of their economic, environmental and social practices.[18]
The Dow Jones Sustainability Index Family includes:[14]

Dow Jones Sustainability World Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Europe Index
Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Asia Pacific Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Korea Index

Asset Management[edit]
The asset management business is based purely on investing in sustainable companies. Although SAM refers to it as Sustainability Investing, this is often referred to in the mainstream as Socially Responsible Investing (SRI). Sustainable investing is based on the assumption that financial markets represent a powerful mechanism to promote sustainable business practices. Proponents of sustainable investing say that integrating sustainability considerations into investment decisions can lead to superior risk-adjusted returns over the long term.[19]
SAM has theme strategies based on major sustainability trends such as water, energy, materials, agribusiness, and climate. It also has core regional products such as a sustainable global active fund and a sustainable European equities fund.[20] The SAM Sustainable Water Fund received a lot of recognition as it was one of the first of its kind to be launched in 2001.[21] In 2011 it celebrated its 10th Anniversary.[22]
Clean Tech Private Equity[edit]
SAM houses the clean tech private equity team of its parent company Robeco, which is a member of ORIX.[23] The concept of clean tech investing is based on a world that is characterized by rapid population growth, finite natural resources, high prices and material shortages; all of which call for more efficient production processes. Investments include products, services, and processes across industry verticals that are designed to improve the productive and responsible use of natural resources, greatly reduce or eliminate environmental damage and provide superior performance at lower costs.[24]
SAM Clean Tech Private Equity invests in sustainable private equity through co-investments in unlisted companies or through private equity fund of funds. Since 2004, they have been integrating the ESG framework into investment process. The United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment indicated that SAM Clean Tech Private Equity is a leader in integrating ESG into the investment process as well as into its ownership policies and practices.[25][26] In 2010, Investment & Pensions Europe (IPE) named SAM Private Equity as the most Responsible European Private Equity Investor.[27]

Sustainability Services[edit]
In 2006, SAM founded a sustainability services division. Sustainability services provides company benchmarking reports[28] that provide companies with details about their individual sustainability performance as well as a peer group comparison.[29] Companies can see their strengths and weaknesses mapped against sustainability criterion and compared to best practice examples.[30]
SAM Research[edit]
SAM’s asset management, index and sustainability services are all rooted in its proprietary in-house research division. The financial analysts generate stock recommendations based on a combination of financial sustainability criteria.
The Research team develops the methodology for the annual corporate sustainability assessment that is used to determine the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.[31] SAM research has been analyzing companies along sustainability metrics since 1995 and has developed one of the largest global corporate sustainability databases. The research department often collaborates with academia to share the valuable data from this proprietary database. Ongoing collaborations include projects with ETH and IESE Business School.
Corporate sustainability assessment[edit]
The corporate sustainability assessment is an industry-specific questionnaire that is sent out to the 2,500 largest corporations. Accordingly, SAM annually assesses around 2,000 of the world's largest companies in 60 industry groups and determines their respective sustainability rating.[32] The assessment examines companies based on environmental social and corporate governance factors (ESG factors), which serve as the primary basis for determining a company's level of sustainability and subsequent global impact.[33] The questionnaire has a focus on long-term sustainability topics that are relevant to each industry including human capital, brands and innovation. Some of the sectors they look at include: airlines, communication technology, beverages, auto parts & tires, waste & disposal services, and electricity.[34] After the assessment, each participating company receives a peer benchmarking analysis.[35]
The family of Dow Jones Sustainability Index are based on the results of the corporate sustainability assessment.[31]
Much of the data derived from the corporate sustainability assessment is used in SAM's financial analysis. The data is integrated into the valuation models. Full integration of sustainability into valuation analysis is a differing approach to using data as a sustainability overlay. Advocates of the integration approach state that it is a more accurate reflection of the companies value as it takes into account the various ways in which sustainability factors affect different business models and cost structures.[36][37]
Also from the results of the corporate sustainability assessment, SAM produces a "Sustainability Yearbook"[34] in which they announce the companies that have been ranked as sustainability "sector leaders" and/or "sector movers". They also give a small number of companies a classification of gold, silver or bronze to recognize their added commitment to sustainability issues.[38] Sector leaders in the past have included: Adidas, BMW, Nokia, Panasonic, PepsiCo, Pirelli, and Rolls-Royce Group plc. Sector movers in the past have included: Air France, Fiat, Hormel, IBM, Mitsubishi, and Starbucks.
Awards[edit]

Best Climate Change Fund, 2010: The SAM Sustainable Climate Fund was awarded the "Best Climate Change Fund" by Investment Week[39]
SRI/Sustainable Investment Manager of the Year Award, 2010: awarded by Financial News in October 2010.[40]
TBLI Best Asset Manager Investing in ESG, 2008, 2009: awarded by IPE TBLI Group ESG Leaders Awards[41]

Eurosif, European Social Investment Forum[44]
Ceres, Investors and Environmentalists for Sustainable Prosperity
ASrIA, The Association for Sustainable & Responsible Investment in Asia[45]

Sustainability leadership awards[edit]
In 2001, SAM and Sustainable Performance Group (SPG)[46] founded the sustainability leadership award. The award ran from 2001–2010 and was presented annually to a chosen sustainability leader and pioneer.[47]

History[edit]
The company was founded by Reto Ringger in 1995 as the world's first investment company focused solely on sustainability themes.[6] The headquarters are in Zurich, Switzerland and RobecoSAM has approximately 100 employees.[7] Its parent company is the Dutch-based Robeco, which is a subsidiary of Rabobank.

Operations[edit]
The company’s assets under management and advice amount to about USD 11.5 billion (as of June 30, 2012).[14]
The main areas of business are: asset management, indexes, private equity and sustainability services (company benchmarking reports).[15]
In 1999, RobecoSAMand Dow Jones Indexes came together to produce the world’s first family of sustainability indexes called the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes (DJSI).[16] In 2012, S&P Indices and Dow Jones Indexes merged to form S&P Dow Jones Indices.[17] SAM now works with S&P Dow Jones Indices to produce the DJSI.
The DJSI are constructed according to the best-in-class approach and track the performance of global leaders in sustainability. Companies are chosen for the index based on an assessment of their economic, environmental and social practices.[18]
The Dow Jones Sustainability Index Family includes:[14]

Dow Jones Sustainability World Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Europe Index
Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Asia Pacific Index
Dow Jones Sustainability Korea Index

Asset Management[edit]
The asset management business is based purely on investing in sustainable companies. Although SAM refers to it as Sustainability Investing, this is often referred to in the mainstream as Socially Responsible Investing (SRI). Sustainable investing is based on the assumption that financial markets represent a powerful mechanism to promote sustainable business practices. Proponents of sustainable investing say that integrating sustainability considerations into investment decisions can lead to superior risk-adjusted returns over the long term.[19]
SAM has theme strategies based on major sustainability trends such as water, energy, materials, agribusiness, and climate. It also has core regional products such as a sustainable global active fund and a sustainable European equities fund.[20] The SAM Sustainable Water Fund received a lot of recognition as it was one of the first of its kind to be launched in 2001.[21] In 2011 it celebrated its 10th Anniversary.[22]
Clean Tech Private Equity[edit]
SAM houses the clean tech private equity team of its parent company Robeco, which is a member of ORIX.[23] The concept of clean tech investing is based on a world that is characterized by rapid population growth, finite natural resources, high prices and material shortages; all of which call for more efficient production processes. Investments include products, services, and processes across industry verticals that are designed to improve the productive and responsible use of natural resources, greatly reduce or eliminate environmental damage and provide superior performance at lower costs.[24]
SAM Clean Tech Private Equity invests in sustainable private equity through co-investments in unlisted companies or through private equity fund of funds. Since 2004, they have been integrating the ESG framework into investment process. The United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment indicated that SAM Clean Tech Private Equity is a leader in integrating ESG into the investment process as well as into its ownership policies and practices.[25][26] In 2010, Investment & Pensions Europe (IPE) named SAM Private Equity as the most Responsible European Private Equity Investor.[27]

Sustainability Services[edit]
In 2006, SAM founded a sustainability services division. Sustainability services provides company benchmarking reports[28] that provide companies with details about their individual sustainability performance as well as a peer group comparison.[29] Companies can see their strengths and weaknesses mapped against sustainability criterion and compared to best practice examples.[30]
SAM Research[edit]
SAM’s asset management, index and sustainability services are all rooted in its proprietary in-house research division. The financial analysts generate stock recommendations based on a combination of financial sustainability criteria.
The Research team develops the methodology for the annual corporate sustainability assessment that is used to determine the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.[31] SAM research has been analyzing companies along sustainability metrics since 1995 and has developed one of the largest global corporate sustainability databases. The research department often collaborates with academia to share the valuable data from this proprietary database. Ongoing collaborations include projects with ETH and IESE Business School.
Corporate sustainability assessment[edit]
The corporate sustainability assessment is an industry-specific questionnaire that is sent out to the 2,500 largest corporations. Accordingly, SAM annually assesses around 2,000 of the world's largest companies in 60 industry groups and determines their respective sustainability rating.[32] The assessment examines companies based on environmental social and corporate governance factors (ESG factors), which serve as the primary basis for determining a company's level of sustainability and subsequent global impact.[33] The questionnaire has a focus on long-term sustainability topics that are relevant to each industry including human capital, brands and innovation. Some of the sectors they look at include: airlines, communication technology, beverages, auto parts & tires, waste & disposal services, and electricity.[34] After the assessment, each participating company receives a peer benchmarking analysis.[35]
The family of Dow Jones Sustainability Index are based on the results of the corporate sustainability assessment.[31]
Much of the data derived from the corporate sustainability assessment is used in SAM's financial analysis. The data is integrated into the valuation models. Full integration of sustainability into valuation analysis is a differing approach to using data as a sustainability overlay. Advocates of the integration approach state that it is a more accurate reflection of the companies value as it takes into account the various ways in which sustainability factors affect different business models and cost structures.[36][37]
Also from the results of the corporate sustainability assessment, SAM produces a "Sustainability Yearbook"[34] in which they announce the companies that have been ranked as sustainability "sector leaders" and/or "sector movers". They also give a small number of companies a classification of gold, silver or bronze to recognize their added commitment to sustainability issues.[38] Sector leaders in the past have included: Adidas, BMW, Nokia, Panasonic, PepsiCo, Pirelli, and Rolls-Royce Group plc. Sector movers in the past have included: Air France, Fiat, Hormel, IBM, Mitsubishi, and Starbucks.
Awards[edit]

Best Climate Change Fund, 2010: The SAM Sustainable Climate Fund was awarded the "Best Climate Change Fund" by Investment Week[39]
SRI/Sustainable Investment Manager of the Year Award, 2010: awarded by Financial News in October 2010.[40]
TBLI Best Asset Manager Investing in ESG, 2008, 2009: awarded by IPE TBLI Group ESG Leaders Awards[41]

Memberships[edit]
SAM is a member of the following organizations:[42]

PRI, Principles for Responsible Investment[43]
Eurosif, European Social Investment Forum[44]
Ceres, Investors and Environmentalists for Sustainable Prosperity
ASrIA, The Association for Sustainable & Responsible Investment in Asia[45]

Sustainability leadership awards[edit]
In 2001, SAM and Sustainable Performance Group (SPG)[46] founded the sustainability leadership award. The award ran from 2001–2010 and was presented annually to a chosen sustainability leader and pioneer.[47]
It was founded under the belief that individuals who place a great importance and effort to promote sustainability in the workplace should be publicly recognized.[48]

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
