(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.  Overview  DCT Industrial Trust Inc. is a leading industrial real estate company specializing in the acquisition, development, leasing and management of bulk distribution and light industrial properties located in high-volume distribution markets in the United States. As used herein, the terms "Company," "we," "our" and "us" refer to DCT Industrial Trust Inc. and its subsidiaries, including its operating partnership, DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP. When we use the term "DCT," we are referring to DCT Industrial Trust Inc. by itself, and not including any of its subsidiaries, and when we use the term the "Operating Partnership," we are referring to DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP by itself, and not including any of its subsidiaries.  DCT was formed as a Maryland corporation in April 2002 and has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are structured as an umbrella partnership REIT under which substantially all of our current and future business is, and will be, conducted through a majority owned and controlled subsidiary, DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP, a Delaware limited partnership, for which DCT is the sole general partner. DCT owns properties through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2014, DCT owned approximately 95.4% of the outstanding equity interests in the Operating Partnership.  Our primary business objectives are to maximize long-term growth in Funds From Operations, or FFO, as defined on page 33, net asset value of our portfolio and total shareholder returns. In our pursuit of these long-term objectives, we seek to:  ? maximize cash flows from existing properties;  ? deploy capital into quality acquisitions and development opportunities which meet our asset, location and financial criteria; and  ? recycle capital by selling assets that no longer fit our investment criteria and reinvesting the proceeds into higher growth opportunities.  Outlook  We seek to maximize long-term earnings growth and value within the context of overall economic conditions, primarily through increasing occupancy, rents and operating income at existing properties and acquiring and developing high-quality properties with attractive operating income and value growth prospects. Fundamentals for industrial real estate continue to improve in response to general improvement in the economy as well as trends that particularly favor industrial assets, including the growth of e-commerce and U.S. based manufacturing. We expect moderate economic growth to continue through 2015, which should result in continued positive demand for warehouse space as companies expand and upgrade their distribution and production platforms.  In response to positive net absorption and lower market vacancy levels, rental rates are increasing in most of our markets, although they generally remain below peak levels. Rental concessions, such as free rent, have also declined in all markets. Consistent with recent experience and based on current market conditions, we expect average net effective rental rates on new leases signed during 2015 to be higher than the rates on expiring leases. As positive net absorption of warehouse space continues, we expect the rental rate environment to continue to improve.  New development has begun to increase in many markets where fundamentals have improved, however construction is below current levels of net absorption in most markets and below peak levels. We expect that the operating environment will continue to be favorable for landlords with a meaningful improvement of rental rates and continued strong occupancy levels.  We expect same store net operating income to be higher in 2015 than it was in 2014, primarily as a result of higher occupancy in 2015 and the impact of increasing rental rates on leases signed in 2015 compared to expiring leases.  In terms of capital investment, we will continue to pursue the acquisition of well-located distribution facilities at prices where we can apply our leasing experience and market knowledge to generate attractive returns. Going forward, we will pursue the acquisition of buildings and land and consider selective development of new buildings in markets where we perceive demand and market rental rates will provide attractive financial returns.  We anticipate continuing to selectively dispose of non-strategic assets where demand continues at levels where we perceive opportunities to recycles capital into higher growth assets in an effort to enhance long-term growth in earnings and cash flows.  We anticipate having sufficient liquidity to fund our operating expenses, including costs to maintain our properties and distributions, though we may finance investments, including acquisitions and developments, with the issuance of new common shares, proceeds from asset sales or through additional borrowings. Please see "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for additional discussion.  Inflation  Although the U.S. economy has recently experienced a modest increase in inflation rates, and a wide variety of industries and sectors are affected differently by changing commodity prices, inflation has not had a significant impact on us in our markets. Most of our leases require the customers to pay their share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. In addition, most of our leases expire within five years which enables us to replace existing leases with new leases at then-existing market rates.  Summary of Significant Transactions During 2014  Significant transactions for the year ended December 31, 2014  ? Acquisitions  ? During the year ended December 31, 2014, we acquired 36 buildings comprising 5.6 million square feet in the Atlanta, Baltimore/Washington D.C., Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Miami, New Jersey, Northern California, Phoenix, Seattle and Southern California markets for a total purchase price of approximately $363.1 million. Average occupancy upon acquisition of the properties was 78.1%.  ? In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2014, we acquired 103.2 acres of land in the Chicago, Dallas, Pennsylvania and Seattle markets for approximately $21.5 million.  ? Development Activities  ? As of December 31, 2014, construction was shell-complete on seven buildings totaling 1.4 million square feet in the Houston, Orlando and Seattle markets. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we stabilized four buildings totaling 1.5 million square feet and had three development projects for sale totaling 0.2 million square feet under contract. Additionally, we recognized development profit, net of taxes, of approximately $2.0 million related to the completion and sales of 8th & Vineyard A and 8th & Vineyard B.

We received approximately $6.6 million in net proceeds from the transactions. Based on the structure of the transactions, we recognized a gain of approximately $0.9 million on the sale of our interest in TRT-DCT Venture I and we recognized our share of the TRT-DCT Venture II's gain on sale of properties of approximately $2.4 million.  ? During March 2014, we obtained 100.0% controlling interest through the purchase of our partner's 50.0% interest in one building from the IDI/DCT, LLC joint venture for approximately $10.3 million and recognized a gain on the business combination of approximately $1.0 million.  ?

The proceeds from the sale of shares were contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for an equal number of OP Units in the Operating Partnership and were used for general corporate purposes, including funding of acquisitions and repaying debt. As of December 31, 2014, no shares were available to be issued under the current offering.  ? On November 7, 2014, we issued 3.4 million shares of common stock in a public offering at a price of $33.68 per share for proceeds of approximately $112.4 million, net of offering expenses.  ? On November 17, 2014, we completed a one-for-four reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock and a corresponding reverse split of the partnership interests of the Operating Partnership. The number of authorized shares and the par value of the common stock were not changed. All common stock/unit and per share/unit data for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been restated to give effect to the reverse stock split.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  General  Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on-going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following discussion pertains to accounting policies management believes are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations that require management's most difficult, subjective or complex estimates.  Revenue Recognition  We record rental revenues on a straight-line basis under which contractual rent increases are recognized evenly over the lease term. Certain properties have leases that provide for tenant occupancy during periods where no rent is due or where minimum rent payments change during the term of the lease. Accordingly, we record receivables from tenants that we expect to collect over the remaining lease term rather than currently, which are recorded as a straight-line rent receivable. When we acquire a property, the terms of existing leases are considered to commence as of the acquisition date for the purposes of this calculation.  Tenant recovery income includes payments and amounts due from tenants pursuant to their leases for real estate taxes, insurance and other recoverable property operating expenses and is recognized as "Rental revenues" during the same period the related expenses are incurred.  We maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our tenants to make required payments. If a tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the net outstanding balances.  In connection with property acquisitions qualifying as business combinations, we may acquire leases with rental rates above or below the market rental rates. Such differences are recorded as an intangible lease asset or liability and amortized to "Rental revenues" over the reasonably assured term of the related leases. The unamortized balances of these assets and liabilities associated with the early termination of leases are fully amortized to their respective revenue line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations on a straight-line basis over the estimated remaining contractual lease term.  Early lease termination fees are recorded in "Rental revenues" on a straight-line basis over the estimated remaining contractual lease term or upon collection if collectability is not assured.  We earn revenues from asset management fees, acquisition fees, property management fees and fees for other services pursuant to joint venture and other agreements. We recognize revenues from asset management fees, acquisition fees, property management fees and fees for other services when the related fees are earned and are realized or realizable.  We develop certain properties for specific buyers, called build-to-suit projects. We make certain judgments based on the specific terms of each project as to the amount and timing of recognition of profits from the project. Projects are generally accounted for using the percentage of completion method or full accrual method. Profits under the percentage of completion method are based on our estimates of the percentage of completion of individual contracts, commencing when the work performed under the contracts reaches a point where the final costs can be estimated with reasonable accuracy. The percentage of completion estimates are based on a comparison of the contract expenditures incurred to the estimated final costs. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to the costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. If the sale recognition criteria for using the percentage of completion or full accrual methods are not met, we apply another recognition method provided by GAAP, such as the installment or cost recovery methods. The profit recognized from these projects is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable, and is included in "Development profit, net of taxes."  Capitalization of Costs  We capitalize costs directly related to the development, pre-development, redevelopment or improvement of our investment in real estate, referred to as capital projects and other activities included within this paragraph. Costs associated with our capital projects are capitalized as incurred. If the project is abandoned, these costs are expensed during the period in which the project is abandoned. Costs considered for capitalization include, but are not limited to, construction costs, interest, real estate taxes and insurance, if appropriate. We capitalize indirect costs such as personnel, office, and administrative expenses that are directly related to our development projects based on an estimate of the time spent on the construction and development activities. These costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use. We determine when the capitalization period begins and ends through communication with project and other managers responsible for the tracking and oversight of individual projects. In the event that the activities to ready the asset for its intended use are suspended, the capitalization period will cease until such activities are resumed. In addition, we capitalize initial direct costs incurred for successful origination of new leases. Costs incurred for maintaining and repairing our properties, which do not extend their useful lives, are expensed as incurred.  Interest is capitalized based on actual capital expenditures from the period when development or redevelopment commences until the asset is ready for its intended use, at the weighted average borrowing rates in effect during the period. We also capitalize interest on our qualifying investments in unconsolidated joint ventures based on the average capital invested in a venture during the period when the venture has activities in progress necessary to commence its planned principal operations, at our weighted average borrowing rate during the period. A "qualifying investment" is an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture provided that our investee's activities include the use of funds to acquire qualifying assets, such as development or predevelopment activities, and planned principal operations have not commenced.  Investment in Properties  We record the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests associated with property acquisitions which qualify as business combinations at their respective acquisition date fair values which are derived using a market, income or replacement cost approach, or a combination thereof. Acquisition related costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred. As defined by GAAP, a business is an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return in the form of dividends, lower costs or other economic benefits directly to investors or other owners, members or participants. We generally do not consider acquisitions of land or unoccupied buildings to be business combinations. Rather, these transactions are treated as asset acquisitions and recorded at cost.  The fair value of identifiable tangible assets such as land, building, building and land improvements, and tenant improvements is determined on an "as-if-vacant" basis which requires significant judgment by management. Management considers estimates such as the replacement cost of such assets, appraisals, property condition reports, comparable market rental data and other related information in determining the fair value of the tangible assets. The recorded fair value of intangible lease assets or liabilities includes the value associated with leasing commissions, legal and other costs, as well as the estimated period necessary to lease such property and lease commencement. An intangible asset or liability resulting from in-place leases that are above or below the market rental rates are valued based upon management's estimates of prevailing market rates for similar leases. Intangible lease assets or liabilities are amortized over the reasonably assured lease term of the remaining in-place leases as an adjustment to "Rental revenues" or "Real estate related depreciation and amortization" depending on the nature of the intangible. The difference between the fair value and the face value of debt assumed in connection with an acquisition is recorded as a premium or discount and amortized to "Interest expense" over the life of the debt assumed. The valuation of assumed liabilities is based on our estimate of the current market rates for similar liabilities in effect at the acquisition date.  We have certain properties which we have acquired or removed from service with the intention to redevelop the property. Buildings under redevelopment require significant construction activities prior to being placed back into service. We generally do not depreciate properties classified as redevelopment until the date that the redevelopment properties are ready for their intended use.  Real estate, including land, building, building and land improvements, and tenant improvements, leasing costs and intangible lease assets and liabilities are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless circumstances indicate that the cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. Our estimate of the useful life of our assets is evaluated upon acquisition and when circumstances indicate a change in the useful life, which requires significant judgment regarding the economic obsolescence of tangible and intangible assets.  Impairment of Properties  Investments in properties classified as held for use are carried at cost and evaluated for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable. As we selectively dispose of non-strategic assets and redeploy the proceeds into higher growth assets, our intended hold period may change due to our intention to sell or otherwise dispose of an asset. As a result, we would assess whether that asset is impaired. Depending on the carrying value of the property at that time and the amount that we estimate we would receive on disposal, we may record an impairment loss. Other indicators include the point at which we deem a building to be held for sale or when a building remains vacant significantly longer than expected.  . . .

	EXPLANATORY NOTE




	This report combines the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the period ended


	March 31, 2017


	 of DCT Industrial Trust Inc., a Maryland corporation, and DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP, a Delaware limited partnership. Except as otherwise indicated herein, the terms “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to DCT Industrial Trust Inc. and its subsidiaries, including its operating partnership, DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP. When we use the term “DCT” or “DCT Industrial,” we are referring to DCT Industrial Trust Inc. by itself, and not including any of its subsidiaries, and when we use the term “Operating Partnership,” we are referring to DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP by itself, and not including any of its subsidiaries.




	We are a leading industrial real estate company specializing in the ownership, acquisition, development, leasing and management of bulk-distribution and light-industrial properties located in high-demand distribution markets in the United States. DCT's actively managed portfolio is strategically located near population centers and well-positioned to take advantage of market dynamics. DCT has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are structured as an umbrella partnership REIT under which substantially all of our current and future business is, and will be, conducted through a majority owned and controlled subsidiary, DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP, a Delaware limited partnership, for which DCT is the sole general partner. We own our properties through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. As of


	March 31, 2017


	, DCT owned approximately


	96.2%


	 of the outstanding equity interests in the Operating Partnership.




	We operate DCT and the Operating Partnership as one enterprise. The management of DCT consists of the same members as the management of the Operating Partnership. As general partner with control of the Operating Partnership, DCT consolidates the Operating Partnership for financial reporting purposes. DCT does not have significant assets other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of DCT and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements.




	We believe combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of DCT and the Operating Partnership into this single report results in the following benefits:













	•






	enhances investors’ understanding of DCT and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business;


















	•






	eliminates duplicative disclosures and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation as a substantial portion of the Company’s disclosures apply to both DCT and the Operating Partnership; and
















	•






	creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports.








	Stockholders’ equity, partners’ capital and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference between the Consolidated Financial Statements of DCT and those of the Operating Partnership. Equity interests in the Operating Partnership held by entities other than DCT are classified within partners’ capital in the Operating Partnership’s financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in DCT’s financial statements. Equity interests of


	3.8%


	 of the Operating Partnership were owned by executives and non-affiliated limited partners as of


	March 31, 2017


	.




	To help investors understand the differences between DCT and the Operating Partnership, this report provides separate Consolidated Financial Statements for DCT and the Operating Partnership; a single set of consolidated notes to such financial statements that includes separate discussions of each entity’s stockholders’ equity or partners’ capital, as applicable; and a combined Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section that includes distinct information related to each entity.




	This report also includes separate Part I, Item 4. Controls and Procedures sections and separate Exhibits 31 and 32 certifications for DCT and the Operating Partnership in order to establish that the requisite certifications have been made and that DCT and the Operating Partnership are both compliant with Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and 18 U.S.C. §1350.

We are structured as an umbrella partnership REIT under which substantially all of our current and future business is, and will be, conducted through a majority owned and controlled subsidiary, DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP, a Delaware limited partnership, for which DCT is the sole general partner. DCT owns properties through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. As of


	March 31, 2017


	, DCT owned approximately


	96.2%


	 of the outstanding equity interests in the Operating Partnership.




	As of


	March 31, 2017


	, the Company owned interests in approximately


	74.0 million


	 square feet of properties leased to approximately


	900


	 customers, including:













	•






	64.0 million


	 square feet comprising


	398


	 consolidated operating properties that were


	97.5%


	 occupied;


















	•






	7.8 million


	 square feet comprising


	23


	 unconsolidated properties that were


	96.1%


	 occupied and which we operated on behalf of


	two


	 institutional capital management partners and an unconsolidated joint venture; 

















	•






	0.7 million


	 square feet comprising


	three


	 consolidated value-add acquisitions;


















	•






	0.3 million


	 square feet comprising


	three


	 consolidated properties under redevelopment; and
















	•






	1.2 million


	 square feet comprising


	four


	 consolidated properties developed by DCT which are shell-complete and in lease-up.








	In addition, the Company has


	12


	 projects under construction and several projects in pre-development. See “Note 3 – Investment in Properties” for further details.













	Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies




	Interim Financial Information


	 




	The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X for interim financial information. Accordingly, these statements do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring items, necessary for their fair presentation in conformity with GAAP. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and related notes thereto included in our Form 10-K filed on February 17, 2017.




	Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation




	The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company, the Operating Partnership, their wholly-owned qualified REIT subsidiaries and taxable REIT subsidiaries, and their consolidated joint ventures in which they have a controlling interest.








	13






















	Equity interests in the Operating Partnership held by entities other than DCT are classified within partners’ capital in the Operating Partnership’s financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in DCT’s financial statements. Equity interests in entities consolidated into the Operating Partnership that are held by third parties are reflected in our accompanying balance sheets as noncontrolling interests. We also have noncontrolling partnership interests in unconsolidated institutional capital management and other joint ventures, which are accounted for under the equity method. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.




	We hold interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures for the purposes of operating and developing industrial real estate. All joint ventures over which we have financial and operating control, and variable interest entities (“VIEs”) in which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary, are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We use the equity method of accounting for joint ventures over which we do not have a controlling interest or where we do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions but where we exercise significant influence and include our share of earnings or losses of these joint ventures in our consolidated results of operations.




	We analyze our joint ventures in accordance with GAAP to determine whether they are VIEs and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary. Our judgment with respect to our level of influence or control over an entity and whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE involves consideration of various factors including the form of our ownership interest, our representation on the entity’s board of directors (or equivalent body), the size of our investment (including loans), our obligation or right to absorb its losses or receive its benefits and our ability to participate in major decisions.  




	If a joint venture does not meet the characteristics of a VIE, we apply the voting interest model to determine whether the entity should be consolidated. Our ability to assess our influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in the Consolidated Financial Statements and our financial position and results of operations.




	We concluded our Operating Partnership meets the criteria of a VIE as the Operating Partnership’s limited partners do not have the right to remove the general partner and do not have substantive participating rights in the operations of the Operating Partnership. Under the Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement of the Operating Partnership (the “Partnership Agreement”), DCT is the primary beneficiary of the Operating Partnership as we have the obligation to absorb losses and receive benefits, and the power to control substantially all of the activities which most significantly impact the economic performance of the Operating Partnership. Accordingly, the Operating Partnership is consolidated within DCT’s financial statements.




	Use of Estimates




	The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.




	Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash




	Cash and cash equivalents include cash held in financial institutions and other highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less. We have not realized any losses in our cash and cash equivalents and believe that these short-term instruments are not exposed to any significant credit risk. Restricted cash consists of escrow deposits held by lenders for real estate taxes, insurance and capital replacement reserves, security deposits and amounts held by intermediary agents to be used for tax-deferred, like-kind exchange transactions.


	As of March 31, 2016


	 approximately


	$62.3 million


	 of restricted cash was included in “Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash” in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows related to tax deferred, like-kind exchange transactions that was utilized during


	2016


	.




	The following table presents a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within our Consolidated Balance Sheets to amounts reported within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands):

	Revenue Recognition




	At the inception of a new lease arrangement, including new leases that arise from amendments, we assess the terms and conditions to determine the proper lease classification. A lease arrangement is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met: (i) transfer of ownership to the lessee, (ii) lessee has a bargain purchase option during or at the end of the lease term, (iii) the lease term is equal to 75% or more of the underlying property’s economic life, or (iv) the present value of future minimum lease payments (excluding executory costs) are equal to 90% or more of the excess estimated fair value (over retained investment tax credits) of the leased building. Generally our leases do not meet any of the other criteria above and accordingly are classified as operating leases.




	We record rental revenues on a straight-line basis under which contractual rent increases are recognized evenly over the lease term. Certain properties have leases that provide for tenant occupancy during periods where no rent is due or where minimum rent payments change during the term of the lease. Accordingly, receivables from tenants that we expect to collect over the remaining lease term are recorded on the balance sheet as straight-line rent receivables. The total increase to “Rental revenues” due to straight-line rent adjustments was approximately


	$3.4 million


	 and


	$5.5 million


	 for the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	 and


	2016


	, respectively.




	If the lease provides for tenant improvements, we determine whether the tenant improvements are owned by the tenant or us. When we are the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially complete. When we are the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvements funded by the tenant are treated as lease payments which are deferred and amortized into rental revenues over the lease term. When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, we record any tenant improvement allowance funded as a lease incentive and amortize it as a reduction of rental revenue over the lease term. Tenant recovery income includes reimbursements due from tenants pursuant to their leases for real estate taxes, insurance, repairs and maintenance and other recoverable property operating expenses and is recognized as “Rental revenues” during the period the related expenses are incurred. The reimbursements are recognized and presented on a gross basis, as the Company is generally the primary obligor and, with respect to purchasing goods and services from third party suppliers, has discretion in selecting the supplier and bears the associated credit risk. Tenant recovery income recognized as “Rental revenues” was approximately


	$25.9 million


	 and


	$22.2 million


	 for the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	 and


	2016


	, respectively. We maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If a customer fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the net outstanding balances.




	In connection with property acquisitions qualifying as business combinations, we may acquire leases with rental rates above or below the market rental rates. Such differences are recorded as an intangible lease asset or liability and amortized to “Rental revenues” over the reasonably assured term of the related leases. We consider a reasonably assured term to be the measurement period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. The unamortized balances of these assets and liabilities associated with the early termination of leases are fully amortized to their respective revenue line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations on a straight-line basis over the estimated remaining contractual lease term. The total net impact to “Rental revenues” due to the amortization of above and below market rents was an increase of approximately


	$0.7 million


	 for the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	 and


	2016


	.




	Early lease termination fees are recorded in “Rental revenues” on a straight-line basis over the estimated remaining contractual lease term or upon collection if collectability is not assured. Early lease termination fees were approximately


	$0.5 million


	 and


	$0.1 million


	 for the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	 and


	2016


	, respectively.




	We earn revenues from asset management fees, acquisition fees, property management fees and fees for other services pursuant to joint venture and other third-party agreements. These are included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in “Institutional capital management and other fees.” We recognize revenues from asset management fees, acquisition fees, property management fees and fees for other services when the related fees are earned and are realized or realizable.

	New Accounting Standards




	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (“FASB”) issued an accounting standard update (“ASU”), 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASU 2014-09”), that requires companies to recognize revenue from contracts with customers based upon the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard also results in enhanced disclosures about revenue, provides guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively and improves guidance for multiple-element arrangements. The FASB subsequently issued additional ASU's which improve guidance and provide clarification of the new standard. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company expects to adopt the standard effective January 1, 2018 and utilize the modified retrospective transition method. Given the nature of our business, our primary revenue stream is from relatively short lived leases with tenants. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.




	In February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that modifies existing accounting standards for lease accounting. The new standard requires a lessee to record a lease asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Leases in which we are the lessee will generally be accounted for as operating leases and we will record a lease asset and a lease liability. Leases in which we are the lessors will be accounted as sales-type leases, direct financing leases or operating leases. Revenue related to the lease components of a lease contract will be recognized on a straight-line basis while revenue related to non-lease components will be recognized under ASU 2014-09. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Leases in which we are the lessor will continue to be accounted for as operating leases with minimal impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operation. The standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for all capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with an option to use certain transition relief. The Company expects to adopt this standard effective January 1, 2019. The new standard allows only for the capitalization of initial direct costs that would have been incurred if the lease had not been obtained. The adoption of this guidance will impact our current policy regarding the capitalization of internal direct costs related to the successful origination of new leases.




	In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that simplifies the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, the classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and the classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. Effective January 1, 2017, we elected to account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than estimate expected forfeitures. The adoption of the guidance was applied prospectively and did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.




	In January 2017, the FASB issued an ASU that clarifies the definition of a business. The ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this standard prospectively effective January 1, 2017. As a result, we anticipate that fewer of our acquisitions made in the normal course of business will meet the definition of a business, as our typical acquisitions consist of properties whereby substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset (land, building and in-place leases).

	The fair values of our borrowings were estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. Credit spreads and market interest rates used to determine the fair value of these instruments are based on unobservable Level 3 inputs which management has determined to be its best estimate of current market values.

	The carrying amount of our fixed rate debt includes premiums and discounts and excludes deferred loan costs.

	The fair value of our interest rate swaps is determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash flows and the discounted expected variable cash flows based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from Level 2 observable market interest rate curves. We also incorporate a credit valuation adjustment, which is derived using unobservable Level 3 inputs, to appropriately reflect both our nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement. The asset or liability is included in “Other assets, net” or “Other liabilities,” respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

When assets and liabilities are transferred between levels, we recognize the transfer at the beginning of the period. There were no transfers between levels during the

	Hedging Activities




	To manage interest rate risk for variable rate debt and issuances of fixed rate debt, we primarily use treasury locks and interest rate swaps as part of our cash flow hedging strategy. These derivatives are designed to mitigate the risk of future interest rate increases by providing a fixed interest rate for a limited, pre-determined period of time. Such derivatives have been used to hedge the variability in existing and future interest expense associated with existing variable rate borrowings and forecasted issuances of debt, which may include issuances of new debt, as well as refinancing of existing debt upon maturity.




	Accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the designation of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.




	For derivatives designated as “cash flow” hedges, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in “Other comprehensive income (“OCI”)” in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (i.e., not included in earnings) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings or the hedging relationship is no longer effective at which time the ineffective portion of the derivative’s change in fair value is recognized directly into earnings. We assess the effectiveness of each hedging relationship whenever financial statements are issued or earnings are reported and at least every three months. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.




	During


	June 2013


	, certain of our consolidated ventures entered into


	two


	 pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of future cash flows attributable to changes in the 1 month USD LIBOR rates. The pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swaps have an effective date of


	June 2013


	 and a maturity date of


	June 2023


	. These interest rates swaps effectively fix the interest rate on the related debt instruments at


	4.72%


	. As of


	March 31, 2017


	 and


	December 31, 2016


	, we had borrowings payable subject to these pay-fixed, receive-floating interest swaps with aggregate principal balances of approximately


	$6.6 million


	 in each corresponding period.








	19






















	During


	December 2015


	, we entered into a pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swap to hedge the variability of future cash flows attributable to changes in the 1 month USD LIBOR rates on our


	$200.0 million


	 unsecured term loan. The pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swap has an effective date of


	December 2015


	 and a maturity date of


	December 2022


	. The interest rate swap effectively fixes the interest rate on the related debt instrument at


	3.31%


	, however, there is no floor on the variable interest rate of the swap whereas the current variable rate debt is subject to a


	0.0%


	 floor. In the event that USD LIBOR is negative, the Company will make payments to the hedge counterparty equal to the negative spread between USD LIBOR and zero. During the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	 and


	2016


	, we recorded a non-cash charge of approximately


	$30,000


	 and


	$1.1 million


	, respectively, of hedge ineffectiveness in earnings attributable to a


	0.0%


	 floor mismatch in the hedging relationships (i.e., there is no floor on the variable interest rate of the swap whereas the current variable rate debt from which the hedged forecasted transactions are expected to flow is subject to a


	0.0%


	 floor on the USD LIBOR component of the interest rate). As of


	March 31, 2017


	 and


	December 31, 2016


	, the entire


	$200.0 million


	 principal amount of the term loan was subject to this pay-fixed, receive-floating interest swap.

	$5.1 million


	 will be reclassified from “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” to “Interest expense” resulting in an increase in interest expense.













	Note 6 – Outstanding Indebtedness




	As of


	March 31, 2017


	, our outstanding indebtedness of approximately


	$1.7 billion


	 consisted of mortgage notes, senior unsecured notes and bank unsecured credit facilities, excluding approximately


	$35.0 million


	 representing our proportionate share of non-recourse debt associated with unconsolidated joint ventures. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, our outstanding indebtedness of approximately


	$1.6 billion


	 consisted of mortgage notes, senior unsecured notes and bank unsecured credit facilities, excluding approximately


	$35.2 million


	 representing our proportionate share of non-recourse debt associated with unconsolidated joint ventures.




	As of


	March 31, 2017


	, the gross book value of our consolidated properties was approximately


	$4.5 billion


	 and the gross book value of all properties securing our mortgage debt was approximately


	$0.5 billion


	. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the gross book value of our consolidated properties was approximately


	$4.4 billion


	 and the gross book value of all properties securing our mortgage debt was approximately


	$0.6 billion


	. Our debt has various covenants with which we were in compliance as of


	March 31, 2017


	 and


	December 31, 2016


	.




	Line of Credit




	As of


	March 31, 2017


	, we had


	$107.0 million


	 outstanding and


	$291.1 million


	 available under our


	$400.0 million


	 senior unsecured revolving credit facility, net of


	two


	 letters of credit totaling


	$1.9 million


	. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had


	$75.0 million


	 outstanding and


	$323.1 million


	 available under our


	$400.0 million


	 senior unsecured revolving credit facility, net of


	two


	 letters of credit totaling


	$1.9 million


	.








	20






















	Debt Issuance and Payoffs




	During March 2017, we repaid the remaining


	$25.0 million


	 outstanding on our


	$100.0 million


	 term loan at par maturing April 2017 using proceeds from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility.




	During the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	, we paid-off


	three


	 mortgage notes at par totaling


	$26.3 million


	 maturing in 2017 using proceeds from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility.




	During March 2017, the Operating Partnership issued


	$50.0 million


	 aggregate principal amount of


	4.50%


	 senior notes due


	2023


	 at


	103.88%


	 of face value in a public offering for net proceeds of approximately


	$51.2 million


	 after offering costs and excluding accrued interest of approximately


	$0.9 million


	. The notes were issued under our indenture dated


	October 9, 2013


	 and form part of the same series as our previously issued


	4.50%


	 senior notes due


	2023


	. We primarily used the net proceeds to pay down our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.




	Guarantee of Debt




	DCT has guaranteed the Operating Partnership’s obligations with respect to the senior unsecured notes and the bank unsecured credit facilities.













	Note 7 – Noncontrolling Interests




	DCT




	Noncontrolling interests are the portion of equity, or net assets, in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. Noncontrolling interests of DCT primarily represent limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership and equity interests held by third party partners in consolidated real estate investments, including related parties as discussed in “Note 9 – Related Party Transactions.”




	Operating Partnership




	Equity interests in the Operating Partnership held by third-parties and LTIP Units, as defined in “Note 8 – Stockholders’ Equity of DCT and Partners’ Capital of the Operating Partnership,” are classified as permanent equity of the Operating Partnership and as noncontrolling interests of DCT in the Consolidated Balance Sheets


	.













	Note 8 – Stockholders’ Equity of DCT and Partners’ Capital of the Operating Partnership




	DCT




	Common Stock




	As of


	March 31, 2017


	, approximately


	91.8 million


	 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding.




	On September 10, 2015, we registered a continuous equity offering program whereby the Company may issue


	5.0 million


	 shares of common stock, at a par value of


	$0.01


	 per share, from time-to-time through


	September 10, 2018


	 in “at-the-market” offerings or certain other transactions. During the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	, we issued approximately


	0.2 million


	 shares of common stock through the continuous equity offering program, at a weighted average price of


	$48.30


	 per share for proceeds of approximately


	$10.4 million


	, net of offering costs. We used the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including funding developments and redevelopments. As of


	March 31, 2017


	, approximately


	2.3 million


	 shares of common stock remain available to be issued under the current offering.




	During the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	 and


	2016


	, we issued approximately


	31,000


	 and


	41,000


	 shares of common stock in each corresponding period related to vested shares of restricted stock and stock option exercises.




	Operating Partnership




	OP Units




	For each share of common stock issued by DCT, the Operating Partnership issues a corresponding OP Unit to DCT in exchange for the contribution of the proceeds from the stock issuances.








	21






















	As of


	March 31, 2017


	 and


	December 31, 2016


	, DCT owned approximately


	96.2%


	 and


	96.3%


	, respectively, of the outstanding equity interests in the Operating Partnership. The remaining common partnership interests in the Operating Partnership were owned by executives of the Company and non-affiliated limited partners.




	DCT holds its interests through both general and limited partner units. The Partnership Agreement stipulates the general partner shall at all times own a minimum of


	1.0%


	 of all outstanding OP Units. As a result, each reporting period certain of DCT’s limited partner units are converted to general partner units to satisfy this requirement as illustrated in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Capital.




	Limited partners have the right to require the Company to redeem all or a portion of the OP Units held by the limited partner at a redemption price equal to and in the form of the Cash Amount (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) provided that such OP Units have been outstanding for at least one year. The Company may, in its sole discretion, purchase the OP Units by paying to the limited partner either the Cash Amount or the REIT Shares Amount (generally one share of DCT’s common stock for each OP Unit), as defined in the Partnership Agreement.




	During the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	, approximately


	56,000


	 OP Units were redeemed for approximately


	$0.8 million


	 in cash and approximately


	40,000


	 shares of DCT common stock. During the


	three months ended March 31, 2016


	, approximately


	0.1 million


	 OP Units were redeemed for approximately


	0.1 million


	 shares of DCT common stock. The OP Unit redemptions exclude LTIP Unit redemptions, see “LTIP Units” below for a summary of LTIP Unit redemptions.




	As of


	March 31, 2017


	 and


	December 31, 2016


	, there were approximately


	3.6 million


	 and


	3.5 million


	 outstanding OP Units in each corresponding period held by entities other than DCT and redeemable, with an aggregate redemption value of approximately


	$174.2 million


	 and


	$168.9 million


	 based on the


	$48.12


	 and


	$47.88


	 per share closing price of DCT’s common stock on


	March 31, 2017


	 and


	December 31, 2016


	, respectively. As of


	March 31, 2017


	 and


	December 31, 2016


	, included in OP Units were approximately


	0.9 million


	 and


	0.7 million


	 vested LTIP Units issued under our Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended, respectively.




	Equity-Based Compensation




	On October 10, 2006, the Company established the Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended, to grant restricted stock, stock options and other awards to our personnel and directors, as defined in the plan. Awards granted under this plan are measured at fair value on the grant date and amortized to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period during which the awards fully vest. Such expense is included in “General and administrative” expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.




	Restricted Stock




	Holders of restricted stock have voting rights and rights to receive dividends. Restricted stock may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of and is subject to a risk of forfeiture prior to the expiration of the applicable vesting period. Restricted stock is recorded at fair value on the date of grant and amortized to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period during which the stock vests. Restricted stock generally vests ratably over a period of


	four


	 or


	five


	 years, depending on the grant. During the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	, we granted approximately


	36,000


	 shares of restricted stock to certain officers and employees at the weighted average fair market value of


	$44.30


	 per share.




	LTIP Units




	Pursuant to the Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended, the Company may grant limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership called LTIP Units. Vested LTIP Units may be redeemed by the Company in cash or DCT common stock, at the discretion of the Company, on a one-for-one basis with common shares, subject to certain restrictions of the Partnership Agreement. LTIP Units receive distributions equally along with common shares. LTIP Units are valued by reference to the value of DCT’s common stock and generally vest ratably over a period of


	four


	 to


	five


	 years, depending on the grant. LTIP Unit equity compensation is amortized into expense over the service period during which the units vest.




	During the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	, approximately


	0.1 million


	 LTIP Units were granted to certain senior executives, which vest over a


	four


	 year period with a total fair value of approximately


	$5.9 million


	 at the date of grant as determined by a lattice-binomial option-pricing model based on a Monte Carlo simulation using a weighted average volatility factor of


	19%


	 and a weighted average risk-free interest rate of


	1.93%


	. During the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	, there were approximately


	36,000


	 vested LTIP Units converted into approximately


	36,000


	 shares of DCT common stock. As of


	March 31, 2017


	, approximately


	1.3 million


	 LTIP Units were outstanding of which approximately


	0.9 million


	 were vested.








	22






















	During the


	three months ended March 31, 2016


	, approximately


	0.2 million


	 LTIP Units were granted to certain senior executives, which vest over a


	four


	 year period with a total fair value of approximately


	$6.3 million


	 at the date of grant as determined by a lattice-binomial option-pricing model based on a Monte Carlo simulation using a weighted average volatility factor of


	23%


	 and a weighted average risk-free interest rate of


	1.28%


	. During the


	three months ended March 31, 2016


	, approximately


	53,000


	 vested LTIP Units were converted into approximately


	53,000


	 shares of DCT common stock and approximately


	13,000


	 LTIP Units were redeemed for approximately


	$0.5 million


	 in cash. As of


	March 31, 2016


	, approximately


	1.2 million


	 LTIP Units were outstanding of which approximately


	0.7 million


	 were vested.













	Note 9 – Related Party Transactions




	Southern California Consolidated Ventures




	We previously entered into


	four


	 agreements with entities controlled by our former president,


	two


	 in December 2010 and


	two


	 in January 2011, whereby we acquired a weighted average ownership interest, based on square feet, of approximately


	48.4%


	 in


	five


	 bulk-industrial buildings located in the Southern California market. Entities controlled by a former executive have a weighted average ownership in these properties of approximately


	43.7%


	, based on square feet, and the remaining


	7.9%


	 is held by a third-party. Each venture partner will earn returns in accordance with their ownership interests. We have controlling rights including management of the operations of the properties and we have consolidated the properties in accordance with GAAP. The total acquisition price of


	$46.3 million


	 was determined to be at fair value.




	 








	Note 10 – Net Earnings per Share/Unit




	We use the two-class method of computing net earnings per common share/unit which is an earnings allocation formula that determines net earnings per share/unit for common stock/unit and any participating securities according to dividends declared (whether paid or unpaid) and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Under the two-class method, net earnings per common share/unit are computed by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders/OP Unitholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders/OP Unitholders by the weighted average number of common shares/units outstanding for the period.




	A participating security is defined by GAAP as an unvested share-based payment award containing non-forfeitable rights to dividends and must be included in the computation of earnings per share/unit pursuant to the two-class method. Nonvested restricted stock and LTIP Units are considered participating securities as these share-based awards contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends irrespective of whether the awards ultimately vest or expire.

	Note 11 – Segment Information




	The Company’s segments are based on our internal reporting of operating results used to assess performance based on our properties’ geographical markets. Our markets are aggregated into


	three


	 reportable regions or segments, East, Central and West, which are based on the geographical locations of our properties. Management considers rental revenues and property net operating income aggregated by segment to be the appropriate way to analyze performance.

	Property net operating income (“property NOI”) is defined as rental revenues, which includes expense reimbursements, less rental expenses and real estate taxes, and excludes institutional capital management fees, depreciation, amortization, casualty and involuntary conversion gain (loss), impairment, general and administrative expenses, equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures, interest expense, interest and other income and income tax expense and other taxes. We consider property NOI to be an appropriate supplemental performance measure because property NOI reflects the operating performance of our properties and excludes certain items that are not considered to be controllable in connection with the management of the properties such as amortization, depreciation, impairment, interest expense, interest and other income, income tax expense and other taxes and general and administrative expenses.  However, property NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our overall financial performance since it excludes expenses which could materially impact our results of operations. Further, our property NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating property NOI.  Therefore, we believe net income, as defined by GAAP, to be the most appropriate measure to evaluate our overall financial performance.  


















	Note 12 – Subsequent Events




	GAAP requires an entity to disclose events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued (“subsequent events”) as well as the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events. There are two types of subsequent events. The first type consists of events or transactions that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet, including the estimates inherent in the process of preparing financial statements, (“recognized subsequent events”). The second type consists of events that provide evidence about conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance sheet but arose subsequent to that date (“nonrecognized subsequent events”). No significant recognized or nonrecognized subsequent events were noted.

	Overview




	DCT Industrial Trust Inc. is a leading industrial real estate company specializing in the ownership, acquisition, development, leasing and management of bulk-distribution and light-industrial properties located in high-demand distribution markets in the United States. DCT's actively managed portfolio is strategically located near population centers and well-positioned to take advantage of market dynamics. As used herein, the terms “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to DCT Industrial Trust Inc. and its subsidiaries, including its operating partnership, DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP. When we use the term “DCT” or “DCT Industrial,” we are referring to DCT Industrial Trust Inc. by itself, and not including any of its subsidiaries, and when we use the term “Operating Partnership,” we are referring to DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP by itself, and not including any of its subsidiaries.




	DCT was formed as a Maryland corporation in April 2002 and has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are structured as an umbrella partnership REIT under which substantially all of our current and future business is, and will be, conducted through a majority owned and controlled subsidiary, DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP, a Delaware limited partnership, for which DCT is the sole general partner. DCT owns properties through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. As of


	March 31, 2017


	, DCT owned approximately


	96.2%


	 of the outstanding equity interests in the Operating Partnership.




	As of March 31, 2017, our operating portfolio was revised to include only stabilized operating properties, developments, redevelopments and value-add acquisitions. Previously, value-add acquisitions were added to the operating pool upon acquisition and prior to stabilization. This change increased our March 31, 2017 operating portfolio occupancy 70 basis points over what it would have been prior to this change. Additionally, our same-store portfolio was revised to include value-add acquisitions only if they were stabilized throughout both periods presented. Previously, value-add acquisitions would have been included if they were owned throughout both periods presented.




	As of


	March 31, 2017


	, the Company owned interests in approximately


	74.0 million


	 square feet of properties leased to approximately


	900


	 customers, including:













	•






	64.0 million


	 square feet comprising


	398


	 consolidated operating properties that were


	97.5%


	 occupied;


















	•






	7.8 million


	 square feet comprising


	23


	 unconsolidated properties that were


	96.1%


	 occupied and which we operated on behalf of


	two


	 institutional capital management partners and an unconsolidated joint venture; 

















	•






	0.7 million


	 square feet comprising


	three


	 consolidated value-add acquisitions;


















	•






	0.3 million


	 square feet comprising


	three


	 consolidated properties under redevelopment; and
















	•






	1.2 million


	 square feet comprising


	four


	 consolidated properties developed by DCT which are shell-complete and in lease-up.








	In addition, the Company has


	12


	 projects under construction and several projects in pre-development. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3 – Investment in Properties” for further details related to our development activity.




	Our primary business objectives are to maximize long-term growth in Funds From Operations, or FFO, as defined on page 42, net asset value of our portfolio and total shareholder returns. In our pursuit of these long-term objectives, we seek to:













	•






	maximize cash flows from existing properties;


















	•






	deploy capital into quality acquisitions and development opportunities which meet our asset, location and financial criteria; and
















	•






	recycle capital by selling assets that no longer fit our investment criteria and reinvesting the proceeds into higher growth opportunities.








	Outlook




	We seek to maximize long-term earnings growth per share and shareholder value primarily through increasing cash flow at existing properties and developing and acquiring high-quality properties with attractive operating income and value growth prospects. Fundamentals for industrial real estate continue to improve in response to general improvement in the economy as well as trends that particularly favor industrial assets, including the growth of e-commerce and U.S. based manufacturing. We expect moderate economic growth to continue in 2017, which we expect to result in continued positive demand for warehouse space as companies expand and upgrade their distribution and production platforms.








	27






















	In response to positive net absorption and lower market vacancy levels, rental rates are increasing in most of our markets. Rental concessions, such as free rent, remain at historically low levels. Consistent with recent experience and based on current market conditions, we expect average net effective rental rates on new leases signed during 2017 to be higher than the rates on expiring leases.




	New development, including speculative development, is present in most markets in response to strong tenant demand for high-quality space. However, construction remains rational in relation to net absorption in most markets and below historical peak levels. We expect that the operating environment will continue to be favorable for lessors given our favorable outlook for market occupancy levels and rental rate growth.




	We expect same-store net operating income to be higher in 2017 than it was in 2016, primarily as a result of the impact of increasing rental rates on leases signed in 2016 and 2017 compared to expiring leases.




	In terms of capital investment, we will continue to pursue selective development of new buildings and the opportunistic acquisition of buildings in markets where we perceive demand and market rental rates will provide attractive financial returns.




	We anticipate continuing to selectively dispose of non-strategic assets to fund our investment in developments and acquisitions in an effort to enhance long-term growth in our net asset value, earnings and cash flows as well as to improve the overall quality of our portfolio.




	We anticipate having sufficient liquidity to fund our operating expenses, including costs to maintain our properties and distributions, though we may finance investments, including acquisitions and developments, with the issuance of new common shares, proceeds from asset sales or through additional borrowings. Please see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional discussion.




	Inflation




	The U.S. economy has experienced low inflation over the past several years and as a result, inflation has not had a significant impact on our business. Moreover, most of our leases require the customers to pay their share of the cost to operate our properties, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. In addition, most of our leases expire within five years which enables us to replace existing leases with new leases at then-existing market rates. While slowing global growth has the potential to dampen demand for distribution space, we have not yet seen any indications of this reduced demand.




	Summary of Significant Transactions and Activities for the


	Three Months Ended March 31, 2017















	•






	Development Activities


















	•






	As of


	March 31, 2017


	, we completed shell construction on


	four


	 buildings in the Atlanta, Dallas, Orlando and Seattle markets totaling


	1.2 million


	 square feet with cumulative costs to date of approximately


	$70.8 million


	 and a projected investment of approximately


	$80.0 million


	. These properties are


	42.4%


	 leased based on weighted average square feet.
















	•






	Also as of


	March 31, 2017


	, we have


	12


	 projects under construction totaling


	2.9 million


	 square feet with cumulative costs to date of approximately


	$131.1 million


	 and a projected investment of approximately


	$273.0 million


	. These projects are


	21.4%


	 pre-leased.
















	•






	Additionally, during the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	, we acquired


	28.4 acres


	 of


	land in the Houston, Northern California and Orlando markets


	 for approximately


	$9.8 million


	 that is held for future development.

	Although base rent is supported by long-term lease contracts, customers who file bankruptcy generally have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases. In the event that a customer with a significant number of leases in our properties enters bankruptcy and cancels its leases we could experience a reduction in our cash flow from revenues and an increase in allowance for doubtful accounts receivable.




	We frequently monitor the financial condition of our customers. We communicate regularly with those customers that have been delinquent or are in bankruptcy. We are not currently aware of any significant financial difficulties of any tenants that would cause a material reduction in our revenues.








	Results of Operations




	Summary of the


	three months ended March 31,




	2017


	 compared to the same period ended


	March 31, 2016




	We are a leading industrial real estate company specializing in the ownership, acquisition, development, leasing and management of bulk-distribution and light-industrial properties located in high-demand distribution markets in the United States. Our actively managed portfolio is strategically located near population centers and well-positioned to take advantage of market dynamics. As of


	March 31, 2017


	, the Company owned interests in or had under development approximately


	74.0 million


	 square feet of properties leased to approximately


	900


	 customers, including


	5.2 million


	 square feet managed on behalf of


	two


	 institutional capital management joint venture partners and


	2.6 million


	 square feet in an unconsolidated joint venture. As of


	March 31, 2017


	, we consolidated


	398


	 operating properties,


	three


	 value-add acquisitions,


	four


	 development properties and


	three


	 redevelopment properties. As of


	March 31, 2016


	, we consolidated


	392


	 operating properties,


	two


	 value-add acquisitions,


	three


	 development properties and


	five


	 redevelopment properties.

	Comparison of the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	 compared to the same period ended


	March 31, 2016






	The following table presents the changes in rental revenues, rental expenses and real estate taxes, property net operating income, other revenue and other income, and other expenses for the three months ended


	March 31, 2017


	 compared to the three months ended


	March 31, 2016


	. Our same-store portfolio includes


	a


	ll consolidated stabilized acquisitions acquired before January 1, 2016 and all consolidated development and redevelopment properties and value-add acquisitions stabilized prior to January 1, 2016. Once a property is included in our same-store portfolio, it remains until it is subsequently disposed or placed into redevelopment. We consider our same-store portfolio to be a useful measure to improve comparability between periods by excluding the effects of changes in our consolidated operating portfolio period over period. Developments and redevelopments are deemed to be stabilized upon the earlier of achieving 90% occupancy or 12 months after shell-completion. Value-add acquisitions are deemed to be stabilized i) if the property acquired is less than 75% occupied upon acquisition, the property will stabilize upon the earlier of achieving 90% occupancy or 12 months from the acquisition date, or ii) if the property is acquired with known move-outs, the property will stabilize upon the earlier of achieving 90% occupancy after the known move-outs have occurred or 12 months after the known move-outs have occurred. All other acquisitions are deemed stabilized upon acquisition. Non-same-store operating properties include properties not meeting the same-store criteria and exclude development and redevelopment properties and value-add acquisitions that are not stabilized or ready for their intended use. For the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	, we had


	371


	 properties classified as same-store comprising


	57.5 million


	 square feet and 37 classified as non-same-store consisting of properties that did not meet our same-store definition, which includes 27 operating properties, four development properties, three redevelopment properties and three value-add acquisitions that were not stabilized.

	Property net operating income (“NOI”) is defined as rental revenues, which includes expense reimbursements, less rental expenses and real estate taxes, and excludes institutional capital management fees, depreciation, amortization, casualty and involuntary conversion gain (loss), impairment, general and administrative expenses, equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures, interest expense, interest and other income and income tax expense and other taxes. We consider property NOI to be an appropriate supplemental performance measure because property NOI reflects the operating performance of our properties and excludes certain items that are not considered to be controllable in connection with the management of the properties such as amortization, depreciation, impairment, interest expense, interest and other income, income tax expense and other taxes and general and administrative expenses.  However, property NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our overall financial performance since it excludes expenses which could materially impact our results of operations.  Further, our property NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating property NOI.  Therefore, we believe net income, as defined by GAAP, to be the most appropriate measure to evaluate our overall financial performance. For a reconciliation of our NOI to our reported “Net income attributable to common stockholders” see “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 11 – Segment Information.”

	Rental Revenues




	Rental revenues, which are comprised of base rent, straight-line rent, amortization of above and below market rent intangibles, tenant recovery income, other rental income and early lease termination fees,


	increased


	 by


	$11.4 million


	 for the three months ended


	March 31, 2017


	 compared to the same period in


	2016


	, primarily due to the following changes:













	•






	$6.7 million




	increase


	 in total revenues in our non-same-store portfolio, of which $8.4 million is attributed to six operating property acquisitions, one value-add acquisition and 20 development and redevelopment properties placed into our operating portfolio since December 31, 2015, offset in part by a $1.7 million decrease attributed to 15 consolidated property dispositions since December 31, 2015.
















	•






	$4.4 million




	increase


	 in total revenues in our same-store portfolio primarily due to the following:


















	•






	$5.9 million increase in base rent primarily resulting from increased rental rates and a 90 basis point increase in average occupancy period over period;
















	•






	$1.5 million increase in operating expense recoveries related to higher average occupancy and increases in property tax expense; and
















	•






	$0.4 million increase in early lease termination fees primarily attributable to two tenants in 2017; which was partially offset by

















	•






	$2.5 million decrease in straight-line rental revenue; and


















	•






	$0.9 million decrease in miscellaneous income from tenants primarily due to higher move-out repairs in 2016 compared to the same period in 2017.
















	•






	$0.4 million




	increase


	 in total revenues primarily due to four properties that were not stabilized as of March 31, 2017.

	Segment Summary for the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	 compared to the same periods ended


	March 31, 2016






	The Company’s segments are based on our internal reporting of operating results used to assess performance based on our properties’ geographical markets. Our markets are aggregated into three reportable regions or segments, East, Central and West, which are based on the geographical locations of our properties. These regions are comprised of the markets by which management and their operating teams conduct and monitor business (see further detail on our Segments in “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 11 – Segment Information”). Management considers rental revenues and property net operating income aggregated by segment to be the appropriate way to analyze performance.

	East Segment













	•






	East Segment assets


	increased


	 by approximately


	$2.8 million


	 in


	2017


	 due to the acquisition of one land parcel since December 31, 2016.
















	•






	East Segment property NOI


	increased


	 approximately


	$2.1 million


	 for the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	 compared to the same period in


	2016


	, primarily as a result of:
















	•






	$2.0 million


	 increase in NOI, of which a $1.3 million increase in rental revenues is attributed to the timing of property acquisitions and completion of developments and a $0.7 million increase is attributed to higher rental rates in our same-store portfolio; and
















	•






	$0.1 million increase in NOI due to decreases in operating expenses primarily related to lower snow removal costs incurred during 2017 compared to 2016, partially offset by increased property taxes driven by the cessation of capitalization on developments placed into operation and property acquisitions.










	Central Segment













	•






	Central Segment assets


	increased


	 by approximately

	 for the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	 compared to the same period in


	2016


	 primarily as a result of:
















	•






	$3.8 million


	 increase in NOI, of which a $3.3 million increase in rental revenues is attributed to the timing of property acquisitions and completion of developments and a $2.1 million increase is attributed to higher rental rates and operating expense recoveries due to increased occupancy in our same-store portfolio, offset in part by a $1.6 million decrease in rental revenues attributed to property dispositions in 2016; which was partially offset by
















	•






	$0.5 million decrease in NOI, of which a $0.7 million increase in operating expenses is attributed to increased property taxes driven by the cessation of capitalization on developments placed into operation and property acquisitions and a $0.3 million increase in operating expenses is attributed to our same-store portfolio, offset in part by a $0.5 million decrease in operating expenses attributed to property dispositions in 2016.










	West Segment

	West Segment assets


	increased


	 by approximately

	$4.4 million


	 for the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	 compared to the same period in


	2016


	, primarily as a result of:
















	•






	$5.6 million


	 increase in rental revenues, of which a $4.2 million increase is attributed to the timing of property acquisitions and completion of developments and a $1.5 million increase is attributed to increased rental rates at properties in our same-store portfolio, offset in part by a $0.1 million decrease in rental revenues attributed to property dispositions; which was partially offset by
















	•






	$1.2 million decrease in NOI due to increases in operating expenses primarily due to increased property taxes driven by the cessation of capitalization on developments placed into operation and property acquisitions, and increased property management fees.

















	Liquidity and Capital Resources




	Overview




	We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for potential capital requirements for expansions and renovation of properties, developments, acquisitions, and debt service and distributions to shareholders will include:













	•






	Cash flows from operations;
















	•






	Proceeds from dispositions;
















	•






	Borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility;











	37































	•






	Other forms of secured or unsecured financings;
















	•






	Offerings of common stock or other securities;
















	•






	Current cash balances; and
















	•






	Distributions from institutional capital management and other joint ventures.







	Our sources of capital will be used to meet our liquidity requirements and capital commitments, including operating activities, debt service obligations, equity holder distributions, capital expenditures at our properties, development funding requirements and future acquisitions. We expect to utilize the same sources of capital to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements.




	Cash Flows




	“Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash” were


	$14.4 million


	 and $18.1 million as of


	March 31, 2017


	 and


	December 31, 2016


	, respectively.




	Net cash provided by operating activities


	increased




	$8.6 million


	 to


	$52.2 million


	 during the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	 compared to


	$43.6 million


	 during the same period in


	2016


	. This change was primarily due to an increase in property net operating income attributable to acquired properties, development and redevelopment properties and value-add acquisitions placed into operation and operating performance at existing properties.




	Net cash used in investing activities


	increased




	$35.2 million


	 to


	$65.3 million


	 during the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	 compared to


	$30.1 million


	 during the same period in


	2016


	 primarily due to the following activities:













	•






	$9.9 million


	 increase in cash outflows related to acquisitions;
















	•






	$1.6 million


	 increase in cash outflows related to investments in unconsolidated joint ventures due to increased contributions to our SCLA unconsolidated joint venture to fund the development of one project during 2017;
















	•






	$1.3 million


	 increase in cash outflows related to deferred costs and refundable deposits for acquisitions that have not closed as of March 31, 2017; and
















	•






	$56.1 million


	 decrease in cash inflows from dispositions; partially offset by
















	•






	$33.8 million


	 decrease in cash outflows related to capital expenditures and development activities, as reflected in the table below.







	We pursue the acquisition of buildings and land and consider selective development of new buildings in markets where we perceive that demand and market rental rates will provide attractive financial returns. The amount of cash used related to acquisitions and development and redevelopment investments will vary from period to period based on a number of factors, including, among others, current and anticipated future market conditions impacting the desirability of investments, leasing results with respect to our existing development and redevelopment projects and our ability to locate attractive opportunities. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Summary of Significant Transactions and Activities for the


	Three Months Ended March 31, 2017


	 – Development Activities” for further details regarding projected investment of our current development activities as well as cumulative costs incurred as of


	March 31, 2017


	. Our total capital expenditures were comprised of the following (in thousands):

	We capitalize costs directly related to the development, pre-development, redevelopment or improvement of our investments in real estate. Building and land improvements comprise capital expenditures related to maintaining our consolidated operating activities. Due diligence capital relates to deferred acquisition costs identified during due diligence that are needed to stabilize an asset or bring an asset up to our physical standards. These costs are generally incurred within 12 months of the acquisition date.




	We capitalize indirect costs such as personnel, office and administrative expenses that are directly related to our development projects, redevelopment projects and successful origination of new leases based on an estimate of the time spent on the development and leasing activities. The total of these capitalized costs was comprised of the following (in thousands):

	In addition, we capitalize interest costs incurred associated with development and construction activities. During the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	 and


	2016


	 total interest capitalized was


	$2.7 million

	 compared to


	$14.8 million


	 during the same period in


	2016


	 primarily due to the following activities:













	•






	$59.0 million


	 net decrease in proceeds from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility in 2017 compared to 2016, as borrowings of


	$106.0 million


	 during 2016 exceeded our


	$93.0 million


	 of borrowings during 2017 and repayments of


	$61.0 million


	 during 2017 exceeded our


	$15.0 million


	 of repayments during 2016;
















	•






	$26.8 million


	 increase in cash outflows due to the following:


















	•






	Repayment of three mortgage notes at par totaling approximately


	$26.3 million


	; and
















	•






	Scheduled principal payments of mortgage notes totaling approximately $1.7 million during 2017 compared to scheduled principal payments of mortgage notes totaling approximately $1.2 million during 2016;
















	•






	$0.6 million


	 increase in cash outflows for loan costs related to the issuance of


	$50.0 million


	 of our


	4.50%


	 senior notes due 2023 in March 2017; and
















	•






	$0.5 million


	 increase in cash outflows due to the net settlement of stock-based awards; which was partially offset by
















	•






	$76.9 million


	 increase in net proceeds from senior unsecured notes due to the following:
















	•






	$51.9 million increase in cash inflows resulting from the issuance of our


	4.50%


	 senior notes due in 2023 in March 2017; and
















	•






	$25.0 million net increase due to the early repayment of the remaining $25.0 million outstanding on our $100.0 million term loan at par in March 2017 compared to the $50.0 million repayment of our senior unsecured fixed rate note at par in February 2016.
















	•






	$4.6 million


	 net increase in cash inflows due to a


	$7.8 million


	 increase in cash inflows as a result of the issuance of 0.2 million shares of common stock in 2017 under our continuous equity offering program compared to the issuance of 0.1 million shares of common stock in 2016, which was offset by a $3.2 million increase in cash outflows in distributions paid to common stockholders and unitholders as a result of an increase in our dividend rate per share, an increase in our common stock outstanding, operating partnership redemptions and offering costs.








	Common Stock


	 




	As of


	March 31, 2017


	, approximately


	91.8 million


	 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding.








	39






















	On September 10, 2015, we registered a continuous equity offering program whereby the Company may issue 5.0 million shares of common stock, at a par value of $0.01 per share, from time-to-time through September 10, 2018 in “at-the-market” offerings or certain other transactions. During the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	, we issued approximately


	0.2 million


	 shares of common stock through the continuous equity offering program, at a weighted average price of


	$48.30


	 per share for proceeds of approximately


	$10.4 million


	, net of offering costs. We used the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including funding developments and redevelopments. As of


	March 31, 2017


	, approximately


	2.3 million


	 shares of common stock remain available to be issued under the current offering.




	OP Units




	Limited partners have the right to require the Company to redeem all or a portion of the OP Units held by the limited partner at a redemption price equal to and in the form of the Cash Amount (as defined in the Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement of the Operating Partnership (“Partnership Agreement”)). DCT may, in its sole discretion, purchase the OP Units by paying to the limited partner either the Cash Amount or the REIT Shares Amount (generally one share of DCT’s common stock for each OP Unit), as defined in the Partnership Agreement.




	During the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	, approximately


	56,000


	 OP Units were redeemed for approximately


	$0.8 million


	 in cash and approximately


	40,000


	 shares of DCT common stock. During the


	three months ended March 31, 2016


	, approximately


	0.1 million


	 OP Units were redeemed for approximately


	0.1 million


	 shares of DCT common stock. The OP Unit redemptions exclude LTIP Unit redemptions, see “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8 – Stockholders’ Equity of DCT and Partners’ Capital of the Operating Partnership” for a summary of LTIP Unit redemptions.




	As of


	March 31, 2017


	 and


	December 31, 2016


	, there were approximately


	3.6 million


	 and


	3.5 million


	 outstanding OP Units in each corresponding period held by entities other than DCT and redeemable, with an aggregate redemption value of approximately


	$174.2 million


	 and


	$168.9 million


	 based on the


	$48.12


	 and


	$47.88


	 per share closing price of DCT’s common stock on


	March 31, 2017


	 and


	December 31, 2016


	, respectively. As of


	March 31, 2017


	 and


	December 31, 2016


	, included in OP Units were approximately


	0.9 million


	 and


	0.7 million


	 vested LTIP Units issued under our Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended, respectively.




	Distributions




	During the


	three months ended March 31,




	2017


	 and 2016, our board of directors declared distributions to stockholders and unitholders totaling approximately $29.8 million and $27.2 million, respectively. Existing cash balances, cash provided from operations, borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and dispositions were used to pay distributions during


	2017


	 and


	2016


	.




	The payment of quarterly distributions is determined by our board of directors and may be adjusted at its discretion at any time. During May 2017, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.31 per share and unit, payable on July 12, 2017 to stockholders and OP Unitholders of record as of June 30, 2017.




	Outstanding Indebtedness




	As of


	March 31, 2017


	, our outstanding indebtedness of approximately


	$1.7 billion


	 consisted of mortgage notes, senior unsecured notes and bank unsecured credit facilities, excluding approximately


	$35.0 million


	 representing our proportionate share of non-recourse debt associated with unconsolidated joint ventures. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, our outstanding indebtedness of approximately


	$1.6 billion


	 consisted of mortgage notes, senior unsecured notes and bank unsecured credit facilities, excluding approximately


	$35.2 million


	 representing our proportionate share of non-recourse debt associated with unconsolidated joint ventures.




	As of


	March 31, 2017


	, the gross book value of our consolidated properties was approximately


	$4.5 billion


	 and the gross book value of all properties securing our mortgage debt was approximately


	$0.5 billion


	. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the gross book value of our consolidated properties was approximately


	$4.4 billion


	 and the gross book value of all properties securing our mortgage debt was approximately


	$0.6 billion


	. Our debt has various covenants with which we were in compliance as of


	March 31, 2017


	 and


	December 31, 2016


	.




	Our debt instruments require monthly, quarterly or semiannual payments of interest and mortgages generally require monthly or quarterly repayments of principal. Currently, cash flows from our operations are sufficient to satisfy these debt service requirements and we anticipate that cash flows from operations will continue to be sufficient to satisfy our debt service excluding principal maturities, which we plan to fund from refinancing and/or new debt.

	Financing Strategy




	We do not have a formal policy limiting the amount of debt we incur, although we currently intend to operate so that our financial metrics are generally consistent with investment grade peers in the real estate industry. We continually evaluate our secured and unsecured leverage and among other relevant metrics, our fixed charge coverage ratio. Our charter and our bylaws do not limit the indebtedness that we may incur. We are, however, subject to certain covenants which may limit our outstanding indebtedness.

	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements




	As of


	March 31, 2017


	 and


	2016


	, respectively, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements, other than those disclosed under contractual obligations, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors, other than items discussed herein.




	As of


	March 31, 2017


	, our proportionate share of the total construction loans of our unconsolidated development joint ventures was


	$35.0 million


	, which is scheduled to mature in October 2017. Our proportionate share of the total construction loans, including undrawn amounts, of our unconsolidated development joint ventures includes 50.0% of the construction loans associated with the SCLA joint venture which are non-recourse to the venture partners.




	Indebtedness and Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements




	There are no lines of credit or side agreements related to, or between, our unconsolidated joint ventures and us, and there are no other derivative financial instruments between our unconsolidated joint ventures and us. In addition, we believe we have no material exposure to financial guarantees, except as discussed above.




	We may elect to fund additional capital to a joint venture through equity contributions (generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests), advances or partner loans, although such funding is not required contractually or otherwise. As of


	March 31, 2017


	, our proportionate share of non-recourse debt associated with unconsolidated joint ventures is

	Funds From Operations




	DCT Industrial believes that net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, DCT Industrial considers FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”), to be a useful supplemental, non-GAAP measure of DCT Industrial’s operating performance. 




	NAREIT developed FFO as a relative measure of performance of an equity REIT in order to recognize that the value of income-producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under GAAP. 




	FFO is generally defined as net income attributable to common stockholders, calculated in accordance with GAAP, with the following adjustments:













	•






	Add real estate-related depreciation and amortization;
















	•






	Subtract gains from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes;
















	•






	Add impairment losses on depreciable real estate and impairments of in substance real estate investments in investees that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of the depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures; and
















	•






	Adjustments for the preceding items to derive DCT Industrial’s proportionate share of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures.











	42
























	We also present FFO, as adjusted, which excludes hedge ineffectiveness, certain severance costs, acquisition costs, debt modification costs and impairment losses on properties which are not depreciable. We believe that FFO, as adjusted, excluding hedge ineffectiveness, certain severance costs, acquisition costs, debt modification costs and impairment losses on non-depreciable real estate is useful supplemental information regarding our operating performance as it provides a more meaningful and consistent comparison of our operating performance and allows investors to more easily compare our operating results. 




	Readers should note that FFO or FFO, as adjusted, captures neither the changes in the value of DCT Industrial’s properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of DCT Industrial’s properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact DCT Industrial’s results from operations. NAREIT’s definition of FFO is subject to interpretation, and modifications to the NAREIT definition of FFO are common. Accordingly, DCT Industrial’s FFO, as adjusted, may not be comparable to other REITs’ FFO or FFO, as adjusted, should be considered only as a supplement to net income (loss) as a measure of DCT Industrial’s performance.

	ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK


	 




	Market risk is the exposure to losses resulting from changes in market prices such as interest rates and rental rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and OP unitholders and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the risk of fluctuating interest rates.




	Interest Rate Risk




	Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and other variable rate borrowings and forecasted fixed rate debt issuances, including refinancing of existing fixed rate debt. Interest rate risk may result from many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control. To manage interest rate risk for variable rate debt and issuances of fixed rate debt, in the past we have primarily used treasury locks and forward-starting swaps as part of our cash flow hedging strategy. These derivatives are designed to mitigate the risk of future interest rate increases by providing a fixed interest rate for a limited, pre-determined period of time. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors.




	During


	June 2013


	, certain of our consolidated ventures entered into


	two


	 pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of future cash flows attributable to changes in the 1 month USD LIBOR rates. The pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swaps have an effective date of


	June 2013


	 and a maturity date of


	June 2023


	. These interest rates swaps effectively fix the interest rate on the related debt instruments at


	4.72%


	. As of


	March 31, 2017


	 and


	December 31, 2016


	, we had borrowings payable subject to these pay-fixed, receive-floating interest swaps with aggregate principal balances of approximately


	$6.6 million


	 in each corresponding period.    




	During


	December 2015


	, we entered into a pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swap to hedge the variability of future cash flows attributable to changes in the 1 month USD LIBOR rates on our


	$200.0 million


	 unsecured term loan. The pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swap has an effective date of


	December 2015


	 and a maturity date of


	December 2022


	. The interest rate swap effectively fixes the interest rate on the related debt instrument at


	3.31%


	, however, there is no floor on the variable interest rate of the swap whereas the current variable rate debt is subject to a


	0.0%


	 floor. While LIBOR rates in certain foreign countries have been or are currently negative, USD LIBOR rates in the U.S. have never been negative nor do we expect them to become negative in the future. In the event that USD LIBOR is negative, the Company will make payments to the hedge counterparty equal to the negative spread between USD LIBOR and zero. During the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	 and


	2016


	, we recorded a non-cash charge of approximately


	$30,000


	 and


	$1.1 million


	, respectively, of hedge ineffectiveness in earnings attributable to a 0.0% floor mismatch in the hedging relationships (i.e., there is no floor on the variable interest rate of the swap whereas the current variable rate debt from which the hedged forecasted transactions are expected to flow is subject to a 0.0% floor on the USD LIBOR component of the interest rate). As of


	March 31, 2017


	 and


	December 31, 2016


	, the entire


	$200.0 million


	 principal amount of the term loan was subject to this pay-fixed, receive-floating interest swap. See “Notes to a Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 5 – Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities” for additional information.




	Our variable rate debt is subject to risk based upon prevailing market interest rates. As of


	March 31, 2017


	, we had approximately


	$232.0 million


	 of variable rate debt outstanding indexed to LIBOR rates. If the LIBOR rates relevant to our variable rate debt were to increase 10%, we estimate that our interest expense during the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	 would have increased approximately $0.1 million based on our outstanding floating-rate debt as of


	March 31, 2017


	. Additionally, if weighted average interest rates on our fixed rate debt were to have increased by 100 basis points due to refinancing, interest expense would have increased by approximately $3.5 million during the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	.




	As of


	March 31, 2017


	, the estimated fair value of our debt was approximately


	$1.7 billion


	 based on our estimate of the then-current market interest rates.

	ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES




	DCT Industrial Trust Inc.




	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures




	Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
