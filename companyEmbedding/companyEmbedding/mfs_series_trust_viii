The Morningstar Category is shown next to the Morningstar Style Box which identifies a fund's investment focus, based on the underlying securities in the fund.Morningstar CategoryWhile the investment objective stated in a fund's prospectus may or may not reflect how the fund actually invests, the Morningstar category is assigned based on the underlying securities in each portfolio. Morningstar categories help investors and investment professionals make meaningful comparisons between funds. The categories make it easier to build well-diversified portfolios, assess potential risk, and identify top-performing funds. We place funds in a given category based on their portfolio statistics and compositions over the past three years. If the fund is new and has no portfolio history, we estimate where it will fall before giving it a more permanent category assignment. When necessary, we may change a category assignment based on recent changes to the portfolio.Fund OverviewCategoryMultisector BondFund FamilyMFSNet Assets317.51MYTD Return3.55%Yield2.83%Morningstar Rating★★Inception DateAug 31, 1994Fund OperationsLast Dividend0.02Last Cap Gain0.00Holdings Turnover21.00%Average for CategoryN/AFees & ExpensesExpenseMIOCXCategory AverageAnnual Report Expense Ratio (net)1.80%1.04%Prospectus Net Expense Ratio1.81%N/AProspectus Gross Expense Ratio1.86%N/AMax 12b1 Fee1.00%N/AMax Front End Sales LoadN/A3.93%Max Deferred Sales Load1.00%1.56%3 Yr Expense Projection580N/A5 Yr Expense Projection1,001N/A10 Yr Expense Projection2,176N/AYahoo Small BusinessData DisclaimerHelpSuggestionsPrivacyAbout Our AdsTerms (Updated)

Applicants' Representations
1. Each Trust is organized as a Massachusetts business trust and is registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company. Each Trust may consist of one or more series and may offer additional series in the future (“Funds”). MFS, a Delaware corporation, is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Start Printed Page 62471serves as the investment adviser to each Fund.[1] 

2. Some Funds, including money market Funds that rely on rule 2a-7 under the Act (“Money Market Funds”), may lend money to banks or other entities by entering into repurchase agreements, purchasing other short-term instruments, or, in the case of Funds other than the Money Market Funds, investing in the MFS Institutional Money Market Fund (“IMMF”) pursuant to rule 12d1-1 under the Act. Other Funds may borrow money from the same or similar banks for temporary purposes to satisfy redemption requests, to cover unanticipated cash shortfalls such as a trade “fail” in which cash payment for a security sold by a Fund has been delayed, or for other temporary purposes. Currently, the Trusts have a committed credit facility provided by a syndicate of lenders and uncommitted lines of credit with two separate banks (collectively, the “Loan Agreements”). The Funds also have an overdraft facility with their custodians.
3. If a Fund were to borrow money under a Loan Agreement, the Fund would pay interest on the borrowed cash at a rate which would be higher than the rate that would be earned by other (non-borrowing) Funds on investments in repurchase agreements and other short-term instruments of the same maturity as the bank loan. In addition, while bank borrowings generally can supply needed cash to cover unanticipated redemptions and sales fails, the borrowing Funds incur commitment fees and/or other charges involved in obtaining a bank loan.
4. Applicants request an order that would permit each Trust to enter into master interfund lending agreements (“Interfund Lending Agreements”) that would permit each Fund to lend and borrow money for temporary purposes directly to and from each other Fund through a credit facility (“Interfund Loan”). Applicants believe that the proposed credit facility would reduce the Funds' borrowing costs and enhance their ability to earn higher interest rates on short-term lendings. Although the proposed credit facility would reduce the Funds' need to borrow from banks, the Funds would be free to establish or renew committed lines of credit or other borrowing arrangements with unaffiliated banks.
5. Applicants anticipate that the credit facility would provide a borrowing Fund with significant savings when the cash position of the Fund is insufficient to meet temporary cash requirements. This situation could arise when redemptions exceed anticipated volumes and certain Funds have insufficient cash on hand to satisfy such redemptions. When a Fund liquidates portfolio securities to meet redemption requests, it often does not receive payment in settlement for up to three days (or longer for certain foreign transactions). The credit facility would provide a source of immediate, short-term liquidity pending settlement of the sale of portfolio securities.
6. Applicants also propose using the credit facility when a sale of securities “fails” due to circumstances such as a delay in the delivery of cash to a Fund's custodian or improper delivery instructions by the broker effecting the transaction. Sales fails may present a cash shortfall if a Fund has undertaken to purchase securities using the proceeds from the securities sold. As a result, the Fund could fail on its intended purchase due to lack of funds from the previous sale, resulting in additional cost to the Fund, or sell a security on a same-day settlement basis, earning a lower return on the investment. Use of the credit facility under these circumstances would enable the Fund to have access to immediate short-term liquidity.
7. While bank borrowings generally can supply needed cash to cover unanticipated redemptions and sales fails, under the proposed credit facility a borrowing Fund would pay lower interest rates than those offered by banks on short-term loans. In addition, Funds making short-term cash loans directly to other Funds would earn interest at a rate higher than they otherwise could obtain from investing their cash in repurchase agreements. Thus, applicants believe that the proposed credit facility would benefit both borrowing and lending Funds.
8. The interest rate charged to a Fund on any Interfund Loan (“Interfund Loan Rate”) would be the average of the “Repo Rate” and the “Bank Loan Rate,” both as defined below. The Repo Rate on any day would be the highest rate available to a lending Fund from investing in overnight repurchase agreements. The Bank Loan Rate on any day would be calculated by the “Interfund Lending Committee” (as defined below) each day an Interfund Loan is made according to a formula established by each Fund's board of trustees (“Fund Board”) intended to approximate the lowest interest rate at which bank short-term loans would be available to the Funds. The formula would be based upon a publicly available rate (e.g., Federal funds rates and/or Libor), plus an additional spread of basis points and would vary with this rate so as to reflect changing bank loan rates. The initial formula and any subsequent modifications to the formula would be subject to the approval of each Fund Board. Each Fund Board would at least annually review the continuing appropriateness of using the method of calculating the Bank Loan Rate, as well as the relationship between the Bank Loan Rate and current bank loan rates that would be available to the Funds.
9. The credit facility would be administered by investment professionals and administrative personnel from MFS (the “Interfund Lending Committee”). No portfolio manager, including research analysts with portfolio management responsibilities, for any Fund will serve as a member of the Interfund Lending Committee. Under the proposed credit facility, senior members of MFS' investment management team and senior administrative and management personnel (the “Investment Management Committee”) or a portfolio manager for each participating Fund could provide standing instructions to the Interfund Lending Committee that the participating Fund is authorized to participate as a borrower or lender; alternatively, the portfolio manager could provide instructions from time to time as to when the Fund wishes to participate as a borrower or a lender. The Interfund Lending Committee, no more frequently than once daily in the morning of each business day that a transaction is requested under the credit facility pursuant to instructions (an “Interfund Lending Day”), would request and collect data on the uninvested cash and borrowing requirements of all participating Funds from the Funds' custodian. Once it has determined the aggregate amount of cash available for loans and borrowing demand, the Interfund Lending Committee would allocate loans among borrowing Funds without any further communication from a Fund's portfolio managers. Applicants expect there will typically be more available uninvested cash each day than borrowing demand. After the Interfund Lending Committee Start Printed Page 62472has allocated cash for Interfund Loans, MFS' cash desk personnel would invest any remaining cash in accordance with the Funds' investment policies and practices in the ordinary course.
10. The Interfund Lending Committee would allocate borrowing demand and cash available for lending among the Funds on what the Interfund Lending Committee believes to be an equitable basis, subject to certain administrative considerations applicable to all participating Funds, such as the time of filing requests to participate, minimum loan lot sizes, the need to minimize the number of transactions and associated administrative costs, and the amount of the existing borrowings outstanding. To reduce transaction costs, each Interfund Loan normally would be allocated in a manner intended to minimize the number of participants necessary to complete the loan transaction. The method of allocation and related administrative procedures would be approved by each Fund Board, including a majority of trustees who are not “interested persons” of the Fund, as defined in section 2(a)(19) of the Act (“Independent Fund Board Members”), to ensure that both borrowing and lending Funds participate on an equitable basis.
11. The Interfund Lending Committee would (a) monitor the Interfund Loan Rates charged and the other terms and conditions of the Interfund Loans; (b) limit the borrowings and loans entered into by each Fund to ensure that they comply with the Fund's investment policies and limitations; (c) ensure equitable treatment of each Fund; and (d) directly or through MFS make quarterly reports to each Fund Board concerning any transactions by the Funds under the credit facility and the Interfund Loan Rate charged.
12. MFS, through the Interfund Lending Committee, would administer the credit facility as a fiduciary as part of its duties under the investment management contract with each Fund and provide administrative support pursuant to the administrative services agreement between each Fund and MFS and would receive no additional fee as compensation for its services.
13. No Fund may participate in the credit facility unless: (a) The Fund has obtained shareholder approval for its participation, if such approval is required by law; (b) the Fund has fully disclosed all material information concerning the credit facility in its prospectus and/or statement of additional information (“SAI”); and (c) the Fund's participation in the credit facility is consistent with its investment objectives, limitations and organizational documents.
14. In connection with the credit facility, applicants request an order under (a) section 6(c) of the Act granting relief from sections 18(f) and 21(b) of the Act; (b) section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act granting relief from section 12(d)(1) of the Act; (c) sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act granting relief from sections 17(a)(1), 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Act; and (d) under section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act to permit certain joint arrangements.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 17(a)(3) of the Act generally prohibits any affiliated person, or affiliated person of an affiliated person, from borrowing money or other property from a registered investment company. Section 21(b) of the Act generally prohibits any registered management company from lending money or other property to any person if that person controls or is under common control with the company. Section 2(a)(3)(C) of the Act defines an “affiliated person” of another person, in part, to be any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, the other person. Applicants state that the Funds may be under common control by virtue of having MFS as their common investment adviser and/or by having a common Fund Board and officers.
2. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that an exemptive order may be granted where an exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section 17(a) provided that the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, and the transaction is consistent with the policy of the investment company as recited in its registration statement and reports filed under the Act and with the general purposes of the Act. Applicants believe that the proposed arrangements satisfy these standards for the reasons discussed below.
3. Applicants submit that sections 17(a)(3) and 21(b) of the Act were intended to prevent a party with strong potential adverse interests to, and some influence over the investment decisions of, a registered investment company from causing or inducing the investment company to engage in lending transactions that unfairly inure to the benefit of such party and that are detrimental to the best interests of the investment company and its shareholders. Applicants assert that the proposed credit facility transactions do not raise these concerns because: (a) MFS, through the Interfund Lending Committee, would administer the program as a fiduciary; (b) all Interfund Loans would consist only of uninvested cash reserves that the lending Fund otherwise would invest in short-term repurchase agreements or other short-term instruments; (c) the Interfund Loans would not involve a greater risk than such other investments; (d) the lending Fund would receive interest at a rate higher than it could otherwise obtain through such other investments; and (e) the borrowing Fund would pay interest at a rate lower than otherwise available to it under its bank loan agreements. Moreover, applicants believe that the other terms and conditions in the application would effectively preclude the possibility of any Fund obtaining an undue advantage over any other Fund.
4. Section 17(a)(1) of the Act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or an affiliated person of an affiliated person, from selling any securities or other property to the company. Section 17(a)(2) of the Act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such a person, from purchasing securities or other property from the investment company. Section 12(d)(1) of the Act generally makes it unlawful for a registered investment company to purchase or otherwise acquire any security issued by any other investment company except in accordance with the limitations set forth in that section.
5. Applicants state that the obligation of a borrowing Fund to repay an Interfund Loan may constitute a security for the purposes of sections 17(a)(1) and 12(d)(1). Applicants also state that any pledge of assets in connection with an Interfund Loan could be construed as a purchase of the borrowing Fund's securities or other property for purposes of section 17(a)(2) of the Act. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt persons or transactions from any provision of section 12(d)(1) if and to the extent such exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors. Applicants contend that the standards under sections 6(c), 17(b), and 12(d)(1)(J) are satisfied for all the reasons set forth above in support of their request for relief from sections Start Printed Page 6247317(a)(3) and 21(b) and for the reasons discussed below. Applicants also state that the requested relief from section 17(a)(2) of the Act meets the standards of section 6(c) and 17(b) because any collateral pledged to secure an Interfund Loan would be subject to the same conditions imposed by any other lender to a Fund that imposes conditions on the quality of or access to collateral for a borrowing (if the lender is another Fund) or the same or less restrictive conditions (in any other circumstance). Any collateral pledged to secure an Interfund Loan will be available solely to secure repayment of such Interfund Loan.
6. Applicants state that, among other things, section 12(d)(1) was intended to prevent the pyramiding of investment companies in order to avoid imposing on investors additional and duplicative costs and fees attendant upon multiple layers of investment companies. Applicants submit that the proposed credit facility does not involve these abuses. Applicants note that there will be no duplicative costs or fees to the Funds or shareholders, and that MFS will receive no additional compensation for its services in administering the credit facility through the Interfund Lending Committee. Applicants also note that the entire purpose of the proposed credit facility is to provide economic benefits for all of the participating Funds and their shareholders.
7. Section 18(f)(1) of the Act prohibits open-end investment companies from issuing any senior security except that a company is permitted to borrow from any bank; provided, that immediately after the borrowing, there is asset coverage of at least 300 per centum for all borrowings of the company. Under section 18(g) of the Act, the term “senior security” includes any bond, debenture, note or similar obligation or instrument constituting a security and evidencing indebtedness. Applicants request relief from section 18(f)(1) to the limited extent necessary to implement the credit facility (because the lending Funds are not banks).
8. Applicants believe that granting relief under section 6(c) is appropriate because the Funds would remain subject to the requirement of section 18(f)(1) that all borrowings of a Fund, including combined interfund and bank borrowings, have at least 300% asset coverage. Based on the conditions and safeguards described in the application, applicants also submit that to allow the Funds to borrow from other Funds pursuant to the proposed credit facility is consistent with the purposes and policies of section 18(f)(1).
9. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act generally prohibit any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or affiliated person of an affiliated person, when acting as principal, from effecting any joint transactions in which the company participates unless the transaction is approved by the Commission. Rule 17d-1(b) provides that in passing upon applications filed under the rule, the Commission will consider whether the participation of a registered investment company in a joint enterprise on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act and the extent to which the company's participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
10. Applicants submit that the purpose of section 17(d) is to avoid overreaching by and unfair advantage to investment company insiders. Applicants believe that the credit facility is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act in that it offers both reduced borrowing costs and enhanced returns on loaned funds to all participating Funds and their shareholders. Applicants note that each Fund would have an equal opportunity to borrow and lend on equal terms consistent with its investment policies and fundamental investment limitations. Applicants therefore believe that each Fund's participation in the credit facility will be on terms that are no different from or less advantageous than that of other participating Funds.
Applicants' Conditions
Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
1. The Interfund Loan Rate will be the average of the Repo Rate and the Bank Loan Rate.
2. On each business day that the Interfund Lending Committee considers whether to use Interfund Loans, the Interfund Lending Committee will compare the Bank Loan Rate with the Repo Rate and will make cash available for Interfund Loans only if the Interfund Loan Rate is: (a) More favorable to the lending Fund than the Repo Rate and, if applicable, the yield of any money market fund approved by the Investment Management Committee as a money market fund in which the lending Fund could otherwise invest; and (b) more favorable to the borrowing Fund than the Bank Loan Rate.
3. If a Fund has outstanding borrowings, any Interfund Loans to the Fund: (a) Will be at an interest rate equal to or lower than any outstanding bank loan; (b) will be secured at least on an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding bank loan that requires collateral; (c) will have a maturity no longer than any outstanding bank loan (and in any event not over seven days); and (d) will provide that, if an event of default by the Fund occurs under any agreement evidencing an outstanding bank loan to the Fund, that event of default will automatically (without need for action or notice by the lending Fund) constitute an immediate event of default under the Interfund Lending Agreement entitling the lending Fund to call the Interfund Loan (and exercise all rights with respect to any collateral) and that such call will be made if the lending bank exercises its right to call its loan under its agreement with the borrowing Fund.
4. A Fund may make an unsecured borrowing through the proposed credit facility if its outstanding borrowings from all sources immediately after the interfund borrowing total 10% or less of its total assets, provided that if the Fund has a secured loan outstanding from any other lender, including but not limited to another Fund, the Fund's interfund borrowing will be secured on at least an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding loan that requires collateral. If a Fund's total outstanding borrowings immediately after an interfund borrowing would be greater than 10% of its total assets, the Fund may borrow through the proposed credit facility only on a secured basis. A Fund may not borrow through the proposed credit facility or from any other source if its total outstanding borrowings immediately after such borrowing would be more than 331/3% of its total assets.
5. Before any Fund that has outstanding interfund borrowings may, through additional borrowings, cause its outstanding borrowings from all sources to exceed 10% of its total assets, the Fund must first secure each outstanding Interfund Loan by the pledge of segregated collateral with a market value at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the loan. If the total outstanding borrowings of a Fund with outstanding Interfund Loans exceed 10% of its total assets for any other reason (such as a decline in net asset value or because of shareholder redemptions), the Fund will within one business day thereafter: (a) Repay all its outstanding Interfund Loans; (b) reduce its outstanding indebtedness to 10% or less of its total assets; or (c) secure each outstanding Interfund Loan by the pledge of segregated collateral with a Start Printed Page 62474market value at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the loan until the Fund's total outstanding borrowings cease to exceed 10% of its total assets, at which time the collateral called for by this condition 5 shall no longer be required. Until each Interfund Loan that is outstanding at any time that a Fund's total outstanding borrowings exceeds 10% is repaid or the Fund's total outstanding borrowings cease to exceed 10% of its total assets, the Fund will mark the value of the collateral to market each day and will pledge such additional collateral as is necessary to maintain the market value of the collateral that secures each outstanding Interfund Loan at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the Interfund Loan.
6. No Fund may lend to another Fund through the proposed credit facility if the loan would cause its aggregate outstanding loans through the proposed credit facility to exceed 15% of the lending Fund's current net assets at the time of the loan.
7. A Fund's Interfund Loans to any one Fund shall not exceed 5% of the lending Fund's net assets.
8. The duration of Interfund Loans will be limited to no more than the number of days required to receive payment for securities sold, up to a maximum of seven days. Loans effected within seven days of each other will be treated as separate loan transactions for purposes of this condition.
9. The Fund's borrowings through the proposed credit facility, as measured on the day when the most recent loan was made, will not exceed the greater of 125% of the Fund's total net cash redemptions or 102% of sales fails for the preceding seven calendar days.
10. Each Interfund Loan may be called on one business day's notice by a lending Fund and may be repaid on any day by a borrowing Fund.
11. A Fund's participation in the proposed credit facility must be consistent with its investment objectives and limitations and organizational documents.
12. The Interfund Lending Committee, on each Interfund Lending Day, will calculate total Fund borrowing and lending demand through the proposed credit facility, and allocate loans on an equitable basis among the Funds, without the intervention of any portfolio manager of participating Funds. The Interfund Lending Committee will not solicit cash for loans from any Fund or prospectively publish or disseminate the amount of current borrowing demand to the Investment Management Committee or portfolio managers of the Funds. Once it determines the aggregate amount of cash available for loans and borrowing demand, the Interfund Lending Committee will allocate loans among borrowing Funds without any further communication from a Fund's portfolio managers. If there is more available uninvested cash than borrowing demand on any Interfund Lending Day, any remaining cash will be invested in accordance with the Funds' investment policies and practices in the ordinary course.
13. The Interfund Lending Committee will monitor the Interfund Loan Rates charged and the other terms and conditions of the Interfund Loans and will make a quarterly report to each Fund Board concerning the participation of the Funds in the proposed credit facility and the terms and other conditions of any extensions of credit under the credit facility.
14. Each Fund Board, including a majority of the Independent Fund Board Members, will:
(a) Review, no less frequently than quarterly, each Fund's participation in the proposed credit facility during the preceding quarter for compliance with the conditions of any order permitting such transactions;
(b) Review at least annually the continuing appropriateness of the method used to calculate the Bank Loan Rate; and
(c) Review, no less frequently than annually, the continuing appropriateness of each Fund's participation in the proposed credit facility.
15. In the event an Interfund Loan is not paid according to its terms and such default is not cured within two business days from its maturity or from the time the lending Fund makes a demand for payment under the provisions of the Interfund Lending Agreement, MFS will promptly refer such loan for arbitration to an independent arbitrator who was selected by each Fund Board involved in the loan who will serve as arbitrator of disputes concerning Interfund Loans.[2] 
           The arbitrator will resolve any dispute promptly, and the arbitrator's decision will be binding on both Funds. The arbitrator will submit, at least annually, a written report to each Fund Board setting forth a description of the nature of any dispute and the actions taken by the Funds to resolve the dispute.
16. Each Fund will maintain and preserve for a period of not less than six years from the end of the fiscal year in which any transaction by it under the proposed credit facility occurred, the first two years in an easily accessible place, written records of all such transactions setting forth a description of the terms of the transactions, including the amount, the maturity and the Interfund Loan Rate, the rate of interest available at the time on overnight repurchase agreements and commercial bank borrowings, and such other information presented to the Fund Board in connection with the review required by conditions 13 and 14.
17. MFS, through or on behalf of the Interfund Lending Committee, will prepare and submit to the Fund Board for review an initial report describing how the proposed credit facility will operate and the procedures to be implemented to ensure that all Funds are treated fairly. For each calendar quarter after the commencement of the credit facility, the Interfund Lending Committee will report on the operations of the credit facility at the Fund Board's quarterly meetings.
Each Fund's chief compliance officer (“CCO”), as defined in rule 38a-1(4) under the Act, shall prepare an annual report for its Fund Board each year that the Fund participates in the proposed credit facility, that evaluates the Fund's compliance with the terms and conditions of the application and the procedures established to achieve such compliance. Each Fund's CCO will also annually file a certification pursuant to Item 77Q3 of Form N-SAR as such Form may be revised, amended, or superseded from time to time for each year that the Fund participates in the proposed credit facility, that certifies that the Fund and MFS have established procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the terms and conditions of the order. In particular, such certification will address procedures designed to achieve the following objectives:
(a) That the Interfund Loan Rate is higher than the Repo Rate, but lower than the Bank Loan Rate;
(b) Compliance with the collateral requirements as set forth in the Interfund Loan Borrowing Conditions;
(c) Compliance with the percentage limitations on interfund borrowing and lending;
(d) Allocation of interfund borrowing and lending demand in an equitable manner and in accordance with procedures established by the Fund Board; and
(e) That the interest rate on any Interfund Loan does not exceed the interest rate on any third-party borrowings of a borrowing Fund at the time of the Interfund Loan. Start Printed Page 62475Additionally, each Fund's independent auditors, in connection with their audit examinations of the Fund, will review the operation of the credit facility for compliance with the Interfund Loan Borrowing Conditions and their review will form the basis, in part, of the auditor's report on internal accounting controls in Form N-SAR.
18. No Fund will participate in the proposed credit facility upon receipt of requisite regulatory approval unless it has fully disclosed in its prospectus and/or SAI all material facts about its intended participation.

1.
     Applicants request that the relief apply to (a) any Fund, (b) any successor entity to MFS, and (c) any other registered open-end management investment company or its series advised by MFS and for which MFS Fund Distributors, Inc. (“MFD”) or a person controlling, controlled by, or under common control (within the meaning of section 2(a)(9) of the Act) with MFD serves as principal underwriter (each, also a “Fund”). The term “successor” is limited to entities that result from a reorganization into another jurisdiction or a change in the type of business organization. All entities that currently intend to rely on the requested relief are named as applicants. Any other existing or future Funds that subsequently rely on the order will comply with the terms and conditions set forth in the application.
