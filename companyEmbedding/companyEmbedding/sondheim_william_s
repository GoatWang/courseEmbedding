SynopsisAmerican composer Stephen Sondheim was born on March 22, 1930, in New York City. After early practice at songwriting, his knowledge of musical theater was influenced by master lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II, who served as a mentor. Sondheim's contributions to West Side Story and Gypsy in the 1950s brought him recognition as a rising star of Broadway. Known for the startling complexity of his lyricism and music, his major works for the theater also include A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, Sweeney Todd, Sunday in the Park With George and Into the Woods.Early Life and Musical InterestsStephen Joshua Sondheim was born on March 22, 1930, in New York City. His parents, Herbert and Janet (née Fox) Sondheim, worked in New York's garment industry; his father was a dress manufacturer and his mother was a designer. They divorced in 1942 and Sondheim moved to Doylestown, Pennsylvania with his mother. He began studying piano and organ at a young age, and he was already practicing songwriting as a student at the George School. In Pennsylvania, Sondheim became friends with the son of Broadway lyricist and producer Oscar Hammerstein II, who gave the young Sondheim advice and tutelage in musical theater, and served as a surrogate father during a time of tumult. In his teens, Sondheim had penned a satire about his school, the musical By George!, which he thought his mentor would love and thus asked for feedback. Hammerstein in fact thought the project needed tons of work and offered honest criticism, which Sondheim would later see as invaluable. Sondheim also worked as an assistant on 1947's Allegro, one of Hammerstein's theater collaborations with composer Richard Rodgers, with the experience having long-lasting implications on the young composer's approach to his work. Sondheim attended Williams College, where he majored in music. After graduating from the school in 1950, he studied further with avant-garde composer Milton Babbitt and moved to New York City.Beginning a Career in TheaterIn the early 1950s, Stephen Sondheim moved to Los Angeles, California, and wrote scripts for the television series Topper and The Last Word. Returning to New York, he composed background music for the play The Girls of Summer in 1956. An acquaintance with director Arthur Laurents brought Sondheim into contact with composer Leonard Bernstein and choreographer Jerome Robbins, who were looking for a lyricist for a contemporary musical adaptation of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Writing the song lyrics for West Side Story, which opened in 1957, Sondheim thus became part of one of Broadway's most successful productions of all time. Sondheim's next theater project was similarly high profile: He teamed up with composer Jule Styne to write the lyrics for Gypsy, which opened in 1959 with Ethel Merman as its star. After musical contributions to 1960's Invitation to a March, Sondheim then wrote both lyrics and music for A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, a Zero Mostel farce based on comedies by ancient playwright Plautus. It opened in 1962, ran for nearly 1,000 performances and won a Tony Award for best musical. Broadway Hits and CollaborationsSondheim won several more Tony Awards in the 1970s for his collaborations with producer/director Harold Prince, including the musicals Company (1970), a meditation on contemporary marriage and commitment; Follies (1971), an homage to the Ziegfeld Follies and early Broadway; A Little Night Music (1973), a period comedy-drama that included the hit song "Send in the Clowns"; and Sweeney Todd (1979), a gory melodrama set in Victorian London destined to become a 2007 Tim Burton film. Sondheim became known for his witty, conversational lyrics, his seamless merging of words with music and the variety of his source materials. Pacific Overtures (1976) was partially inspired by haiku poetry and Japanese Kabuki theater, and 1981's Merrily We Roll Along was adapted from a 1934 play by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart. In the 1980s, Sondheim collaborated several times with playwright/director James Lapine. Their Sunday in the Park with George, which opened in 1984, was inspired by the iconic painting "A Sunday on La Grande Jatte" by Georges Seurat, and 1987's Into the Woods was a collage of plots from classic fairy tales. (The latter was eventually made into a 2014 film starring Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt, James Corden and Anna Kendrick, among an ensemble cast.)Later Works and RevivalsSondheim continued to combine various musical genres with sharp lyrical writing and unexpected subject matter in the 1990s, though some of his work of that decade received less critical and popular acclaim. Assassins (1990) told the tales of nine presidential assassins in American history; and Passion, a 1994 collaboration with Lapine, was a melodramatic romance based on the Italian film Passione d'Amore. Sondheim also wrote five songs for the 1990 film Dick Tracy, starring Warren Beatty and Madonna, and won an Academy Award for "Sooner or Later." Sondheim's work has also been the subject of several revues, including Side by Side by Sondheim in 1976, Putting It Together in 1992 and Sondheim on Sondheim in 2010. Broadway has continued to host Sondheim classics as well, including the 2009 revivals of West Side Story and A Little Night Music, with the latter starring Catherine Zeta-Jones and Angela Lansbury. In 2011, Follies was revived, starring Bernadette Peters. Sondheim was honored as a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom in November 2015. In 2017, Sondheim became the first composer-lyricist to win the PEN/Allen Foundation Literary Service Award. The annual prize is given to a “critically acclaimed writer whose body of work helps us understand and interpret the human condition,” and has previously been awarded to novelists Salman Rushdie and Toni Morrison.

An Evening with Composer, Lyricist Stephen Sondheim and NYT's Frank Rich in a Discussion of the American Musical Theater









Media contact: Noelle Lemoine, communications assistant; tele: (413) 597-4277; email: [email protected]
WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass., January 12, 2010 — On Saturday, Jan. 23, Williams College welcomes back composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim, who graduated in 1950. He will be joined on stage by author and New York Times columnist and former chief theatre critic Frank Rich in a conversation about Sondheim’s career, including his collaborations with Leonard Bernstein, Jerome Robbins, and Tim Burton; the state of the American musical theater; and Sondheim’s creative process, specifically works ranging from his early shows “Gypsy” and “West Side Story” to such later classics as “Company,” “Follies,” and “Sweeney Todd.”
Stephen SondheimSondheim has not only collaborated on more than a dozen landmark shows and written countless standard songs, but is acknowledged as the single most influential force in “bringing the Broadway musical into the modern age.” Rich has called Sondheim “the greatest and perhaps best-known artist in the American musical stage” (Vanity Fair 3/08).
The evening’s unscripted conversation promises to provide a personal view of Sondheim and his life in the theater. The event will take place at 8 p.m. in Chapin Hall on the Williams campus. It is open to the public, free of charge, but tickets are required. Tickets may be reserved online (limit two/person) at https://webapps.williams.edu/admin-forms/ephpubevent/ or by phone (413) 597-4435.
While still in his 20s, Sondheim contributed the lyrics to Arthur Laurents’ and Jerome Robbins’ “West Side Story” (music by Leonard Bernstein) and “Gypsy” (music by Jule Styne). His first produced Broadway show as both composer and lyricist was “A Funny Thing Happened On the Way to the Forum” (1962). Sondheim went on to create a remarkable succession of groundbreaking musicals, including “Company” (1970), “Follies” (1971), “A Little Night Music” (1973), “Sweeney Todd” (1979), and “Sunday in the Park with George” (1984).
It is hard to find a musical today that hasn’t been influenced by Sondheim’s remaking the rules that once governed the traditional Broadway musical.
Sondheim has won every coveted award: the Kennedy Center honors, Pulitzer Prize, multiple Grammys, an Academy Award, and multiple Tonys (more than any other composer) including a special award for Lifetime Achievement in the Theater in 2008. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the most prestigious academic society in America, in 1983.
Rich is an op-ed columnist for The New York Times, who has been said to “view political life through a theatrical lens” (NYTs 4/07). He served as the Time’s chief drama critic, beginning in 1980, the year he joined the Times, for 14 years. Leaving the dramatic hot seat, from 2003 to 2005, he was the Times front-page columnist for the Sunday Arts & Leisure section. Before joining the Times, he was a founding editor of The Richmond Mercury and a film and television critic at Time Magazine.
His opinion matters: he is a recipient of the prestigious George Polk Award for commentary, given annually by Long Island University in honor of contributions to journalistic integrity and investigative reporting.
Rich is the author of “The Greatest Story Ever Sold: The Decline and Fall of Truth from 9/11 to Katrina” and “Hot Seat: Theater Criticism for The New York Times, 1980-1993,” among other titles.
He graduated from Harvard College in 1971, where he was editorial chairman of the Harvard Crimson. While at the Crimson, Rich wrote a lengthy essay about the Sondheim musical “Follies'” pre-Broadway run in Boston. It is reported the article “fascinated” director Harold Prince and “absolutely” intrigued Sondheim, who invited the undergraduate to lunch to discuss the production.
The evening’s event at Williams College is sponsored by the President’s Office, the Leadership Studies Program, the Program in Jewish Studies, and the music and theatre departments.

Stephen Sondheim's Into the Woods









Media contact: Noelle Lemoine, communications assistant; tele: (413) 597-4277; email: [email protected]
WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass., Nov. 28, 2006 — Are you certain what you wish is what you want?
Williams College Cap & Bells is proud to present Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine’s Tony Award-winning musical, Into the Woods, directed by Ren McDermott ’07 and Eric Kang ’09.
The musical features fairy tales, such as “Jack and the Beanstalk,” “Cinderella,” “Little Red Ridinghood,” “Sleeping Beauty,” “Snow White” and “Rapunzel,” but deals with consequences that traditional fairy tales conveniently ignore. Ultimately, all of the characters in the stories must deal with what happens after “happily ever after.”
Into the Woods opens December 7 at 8 p.m. There will also be performances December 8 and 9 at 8 p.m. and a 2 p.m. matinee on December 9. There will be a special Family Matinee on Sunday, December 10, with a one-act “family friendly” performance at 2 p.m. All performances will be held in the ’62 Center’s Adams Memorial Theatre. Tickets are $5 per person ($3 for the Family Matinee) and can be purchased by calling the ’62 Center Box Office at (413) 597-2425.
