How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Texas:













Does Sims James K carry a valid contracting license?



Only certain types of specialty contractors (e.g. HVAC, electrical) need to be licensed in Texas. There are no licensing requirements when it comes to hiring for a construction or major remodeling project.
Sims James K currently holds license 23702, 123292 (Electrician, Ec Electrical Contractor, Me Master Electrician), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Texas?



The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) regulates HVAC and electrical contractors. You should verify their license status on the TDLR Website before hiring. General contractors and home builders are not licensed so you should do additional research before hiring one.











Your liability risk when hiring Sims James K



Although it isn't a regulatory requirement, you can ask your general contractor to provide evidence of workers' compensation and general liability insurance prior to hiring them. 











Financial recourse when hiring Sims James K



The Texas Department of Licensing Regulation does not require general contractors to carry a surety bond nor is there a state recovery fund.











What else should I know before hiring Sims James K



There is no financial or criminal background check performed on general contractors by the TDLR. The State's Department of Public Safety does maintain a publicly accessible database so you can run your own background check prior to hiring. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



The information on BuildZoom is made available as a public service and should not be considered advertising. We collect client feedback and verify contractors' permitted history with dozens of local building departments in Texas, which saves you time and helps minimize your risk when hiring. 











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Texas Attorney General's office recommends getting several bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).

for any job, commercial or residential.

BUSINESS PEOPLE
BUSINESS PEOPLE; Concurrent Chief to Get Top Jobs After Merger


By LAWRENCE M. FISHER


Published: August 3, 1988









                    The Massachusetts Computer Corporation said Monday that it will acquire the Concurrent Computer Corporation for $20 a share, or about $230 million. But there is a twist: Although Massachusetts Computer will be the surviving entity, its name will be changed to Concurrent Computer, and James K. Sims, Concurrent's president and chief executive, will be chairman, president and chief executive of the new company.        

                    Mr. Sims, who has been president of Concurrent since it was spun off by the Perkin-Elmer Corporation in November 1985, said the merger presented greater opportunities for increased operating efficiency and a broader product line than could have been achieved by a leveraged buyout of Concurrent itself.        

                    Perkin-Elmer, which has agreed to tender its 9.4 million shares, or 82 percent, of Concurrent's common stock, determined three years ago to leave the computer business and concentrate on its core of analytical instruments and semiconductor equipment, Mr. Sims said.        

                    Describing the merger as a ''double win,'' Mr. Sims said that joining with Massachusetts Computer, which is based in Westford, Mass., would allow substantial reductions in operating expenses, as well as additional low-end product offerings which Concurrent has lacked.        

                    Concurrent, which is based in Tinton Falls, N.J., and Massachusetts Computer both produce superminicomputers for applications requiring extremely rapid response, but Concurrent's machines sell for $100,000 to $1.5 million, while the Massachusetts machines cost $10,000 to $150,000.        

                    August Klein, Massachusetts Computer's president and chief executive, resigned earlier this year and was succeeded on an acting basis by Russell Planitzer, a venture capitalist who is a director of the company and will serve on the new company's board.        

                    Mr. Sims said he is currently analyzing which members of Massachusetts Computer's management will remain. ''They have some excellent vice presidents who will be part of this organization,'' he added.        

                    Mr. Sims began his career with Concurrent, which was then known as Interdata, in 1974 as a salesman. The company was acquired by Perkin-Elmer in 1975. Rising through the ranks to become manager of worldwide service and sales, Mr. Sims then led the spinoff of the unit as Concurrent in 1985. Prior to joining Interdata, he held positions in engineering and later, sales and marketing with Scientific Data Systems Inc. of El Segundo, Calif.

So When Will Religious Organizations Choose Not to Discriminate?



Leading church-state scholar Marci A. Hamilton comments on a recent decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in which it held that a female principal of a Catholic school has no legal recourse when a priest engages in gender discrimination that would be actionable in any other setting.
