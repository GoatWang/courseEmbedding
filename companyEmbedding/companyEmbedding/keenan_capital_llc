Honesty, Respect, Passion & Hard Work.
OUR MISSION:
To find, acquire, and lead a single, outstanding business.
A Message to Business Owners:
I am a 38 year-old entrepreneur looking to acquire and lead a successful company whose owner is motivated to sell it to someone who will build on that success, continue to grow the company, its customers, its employees and its markets. I hope to bring my own business experience and that of my investors to bear on that task, but I also want to understand thoroughly how the company has achieved its current success, as that will be a very important part of charting its future direction. If you have built such a company, I know how much you care about its future, and that of the people who have helped you create it. I am confident, with your help and the counsel of others who will be supporting me, that I will be a good steward for your company during the next phase of its development. I will be devoting 100% of my time and energy to this enterprise and have enough committed capital to get a deal done quickly. If you have any interest in pursuing what I’ve described, I’d very much like to make your acquaintance and talk with you about your company and your plans.
Sincerely,
Al Sullivan
Managing Partner

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability

Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
