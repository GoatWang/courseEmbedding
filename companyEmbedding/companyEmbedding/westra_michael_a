It's a good idea to know how much fire coverage your policy provides. Here are a few things you may want to consider if you're purchasing or updating your homeowners coverage.Learn More Rental Car InsuranceYou found a great deal online for a car rental. But now you're standing at the rental counter, wondering if you need all the rental insurance offered and whether it's worth paying the higher price. Chances are you can avoid the unexpected expense, because the rental company's coverage may duplicate the auto insurance coverage you already have. Your credit card company may also offer insurance if you use their card for the rental. Avoid the confusion and stay in your vacation budget - talk to me about what's covered before you get to the rental counter.Learn More Rent Or Own CalculatorIf you're wondering whether you should rent or own, there's a lot to consider.

You'll need to consider monthly as well as long-term expenses in your decision. Use this calculator to help you compare the costs and whether renting or buying makes the most sense for you.Learn More New ParentsWhen you find out a new baby is on the way, you'll probably dive head-first into decorating the baby's room, researching the perfect stroller and stocking up on diapers. Life insurance is not likely on the top of your list, but maybe it should be. It's understandable that your immediate focus is on what your baby needs in those first few months and years, but making sure you have life insurance may help protect her future needs, too. Here are some important things to consider as you're planning for your growing family's future.Learn More Tips for Managing Small Business Insurance CostsBeing a small business owner can mean working long after you've "closed" for the day.

From making sure you having the right amount of protection to managing risks and bundling coverages, I'm here to help you choose the coverage that is right for your business.Learn More Insurance That Protects Your BikeYour motorcycle is more than just a way to get around. You've invested your time in it, you've made sure it's in perfect working order and you took classes and bought the right gear so you could enjoy it safely. It only make sense that you put the same effort into safeguarding your bike, and you, with insurance. Whether it's collision coverage or a custom paint job, it's important to make sure you have the protection that fits your bike. Here's a breakdown of coverages to help you decide what is right for you.Learn More Motorhome Insurance BasicsIf you own a motorhome or are thinking about purchasing one, here are some things you may want to consider when it comes to protecting your home on wheels.Learn More Water Damage In Your CondoOne of the great perks to living in a condo is that it's fairly low-maintenance. You likely don't have to worry about lawn care or replacing the roof. But what about water damage? Whether your washer overflows or a bathroom pipe bursts, water damage can wreak havoc. If you have condo insurance, though, you'll generally have coverage for accidental damage caused by your plumbing or appliances. While I hope your home stays dry and cozy, it's a good idea to know what your condo policy may cover just in case.Learn More Show moreShow lessInsurance Products & ServicesInsurance is unlike any other product out there - you pay for it and hope you never have to use it. And that makes paying more than you need to that much more uncomfortable.With a policy from Allstate, you can help keep your insurance costs low with the wide variety of discounts we offer.

Safe Nest recently received a $56,000 Allstate Foundation Helping Hands in the Community grant on behalf of agency owners in the southwest to support the organization’s efforts to help people affected by domestic violence. Our agency also participated in collecting and donating supplies to Purple Purse. One in four women will experience domestic violence in her lifetime, and financial abuse is the number one reason why women stay in or return to abusive relationships. Without access to money, financial resources or even transportation, victims remain trapped. We’re committed to helping survivors in our community have the resources to get help and rebuild their lives, which is why we’re proud to support Safe Nest’s work.Share This Location
