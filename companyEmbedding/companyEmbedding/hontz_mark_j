Our lawyers have experience with resolving employee issues involving compensation, benefits, and the scope and enforceability of non-compete and confidentiality agreements.Property LawReal Estate LitigationZoning & variances — We advise owners and developers at all stages of the development process from application, to dealing with state, local and federal agencies, to obtaining approvals, variances and settling boundary disputes.Real Estate TransactionsMr. Hollander is a graduate of Brown University and Columbia Law School. He clerked for New Jersey Attorney General Grover Richman. He has practiced law in New Jersey since 1958 and was named Professional Lawyer of the Year by the Sussex County Bar Association in 2002. His practice focuses on real estate transactions, municipal law and estate planning.Land Use and ZoningWhile purchasing commercial or residential property can be a very profitable move, it can also open up a range of legal issues. Land use issues, codes, and maintenance and landlord/tenant matters can pop up frequently and consume a great deal of your time. That is why property owners in Warren and Sussex Counties can benefit from having reliable legal counsel readily available when these issues arise. At the law firm of Hollander, Strelzik, Pasculli, Hinkes, Wojcik, Gacquin, Vandenberg & Hontz, L.L.C., we have advised property owners in northwestern New Jersey for decades regarding all types of land use issues. Our attorneys help you work with government regulators, neighboring property owners and tenants to resolve real estate issues quickly and effectively.Landlord-Tenant DisputesCommercial litigation — For almost 50 years, we have been committed to successfully solving your commercial litigation matters. From contract disputes, corporate compliance issues, commercial collections, to commercial landlord and tenant disputes and tax and finance issues, our seasoned litigators are prepared to resolve your commercial litigation case so that you can focus on your business.Criminal LawCriminal Defense, Pasculli, Pasculli, Hinkes, Wojcik, Gacquin, Vandenberg & Hontz, L.L.C. He now focuses his practice on municipal court and criminal defense, bankruptcy and debt issues, estate planning, family law and Social Security disability.DUI/DWIA license suspension, whether for  driving under the influence (DUI) or another violation, almost always has a huge effect on your life. Most people take their driving privileges for granted and never stop to think about what it would be like to lose them. However, if you have had your license suspended, you understand what living without a license is like and are probably anxious to get it back. At the law firm of Hollander, Strelzik, Pasculli, Hinkes, Wojcik, Gacquin, Vandenberg & Hontz, L.L.C., we help our clients in Morris, Warren Passaic and Sussex Counties fully understand what they are up against when facing DUI or related charges and the steps they will need to take, including license reinstatement, to get their lives back to normal.Traffic ViolationsAnd traffic violations, our goal is to offer the types of legal services people like you need most. We can assist you with any aspect of family law, including divorce, child custody and adoption. Attorney Catherine AnneBurglaryAssaultRestraining OrderThe ability to get protection is essential for victims of domestic abuse and violence. That is why New Jersey law allows domestic violence victims to quickly obtain temporary restraining orders (TROs), often without prior notice to the party being restrained. For these orders to be made permanent, however, you must have evidence that your allegations are warranted. Likewise, if you are the subject of a TRO, you will have an opportunity to show that the restraint against you is not justified.KidnappingFinance LawBankruptcyWhen choosing a bankruptcy law firm, you have to be very careful. This area of practice is often saturated with “bankruptcy mills” and other services that make unrealistic promises about the results they can deliver and then devote only minimal attention to your case. Bankruptcy is a complex area of law for which competent and reliable representation is crucial. After nearly 50 years of serving the Sussex and Warren County communities from our offices on the square in Newton, Hollander, Strelzik, Pasculli, Hinkes, Wojcik, Gacquin, Vandenberg & Hontz, L.L.C. is well-suited to provide the personal service and thorough counsel you need to confront your financial issues through the bankruptcy process.Tax LawTax appeals — We represent clients in residential and commercial property tax appeals. Our property tax attorneys will negotiate on you behalf for a reduction, and if a settlement cannot be reached we are prepared to take your case to trial.Family LawDivorceHollander, Strelzik, Pasculli, Hinkes, Wojcik, Gacquin, Vandenberg & Hontz, L.L.C. can keep you on top of the adoption process, minimize your stress and uncertainty, and help you avoid mistakes that can delay and complicate the process. If you are considering adoption in Warren, Morris, Passaic or Sussex County, call our Newton office today at 862-273-3465 or contact us online to schedule a consultation with one of our family law and divorce attorneys.Child SupportIf you are paying or receiving child support, an experienced New Jersey family lawyer can assist you with the recent changes in state rules regarding emancipation. Under a law that took effect on February 1, 2017, with a few exceptions, 19 is now the age when parental child support obligations end for nondisabled youths who aren’t full-time students.  Previously, there was no set age for emancipation in the state. At Hollander, Strelzik, Pasculli, Hinkes, Wojcik, Gacquin, Vandenberg & Hontz, L.L.C.  in Newton, our experienced family law attorneys advise parents on emancipation and how it affects issues such as child support and medical insurance. We will look at your current or pending arrangements to explain how you and your children will be affected.Child Custody and VisitationFamily can be the source of both the happiest and the most painful moments of our lives. It is this emotional roller coaster that makes family law issues so challenging. Divorce, child custody disputes and other issues can quickly become overwhelming to even the most poised individuals in Sussex and Warren Counties. It is all right to ask for help. For nearly 50 years as part of the Newton, New Jersey community, we at Hollander, Strelzik, Pasculli, Hinkes, Wojcik, Gacquin, Vandenberg & Hontz, L.L.C. have built a reputation for being effective, compassionate advocates for our clients going through difficult domestic issues. If you are contemplating divorce, fighting for custody, considering adoption or seeking support for yourself or your child, our attorneys can mitigate some of the pressure.AdoptionMost adoptions are uncontested and terminating parental rights is not an issue. However, there are situations where you may wish to adopt a child over the objections of one or both natural parents. This is especially prevalent in stepparent adoptions and when people want to adopt the children of a family member they believe to be unfit. To succeed in a contested adoption, you must show that grounds exist for terminating the biological parents’ rights...Premarital AgreementPrenuptial agreements — Our attorneys are experienced in the drafting and review of Prenuptial Agreements.  A prenuptial agreement is an agreement between two people who are about to marry that addresses financial and other issues in the event of death or divorce.  A prenuptial agreement is particularly important if you have children from a previous relationship, are involved in a family business or there is a big disparity in your respective incomes.GuardianshipIf you are struck by illness or injury without these documents in place, your family may need to go through a more expensive — and sometimes emotionally difficult — guardianship proceeding to provide for your needs and manage your affairs. Our firm drafts advance directives that express your wishes about your assets and your end-of-life care in the event that you become too ill or injured to make your wishes known clearly. We also can help you in the guardianship process, especially for a special needs family member.Spousal SupportIt is usually a good idea to make every reasonable effort to resolve equitable distribution issues outside court through a property settlement agreement. This can speed up the divorce process, decrease the overall cost and ensure you receive the assets you actually want and need. Much like alimony, the rules regarding the division of assets are subjective and somewhat unpredictable, so leaving it up to the court can be risky for both sides. Nevertheless, sometimes it is necessary to litigate when the parties cannot come to an agreement. In these cases, a judge in Sussex or Warren County will try to fairly distribute the marital property after considering several factors...Trusts and EstatesEstate PlanningMs. Pasculli devotes her practice to estate planning and elder law and is a certified Elder Law Attorney by the National Elder Law Foundation.WillsMaking sure that your family knows your wishes and that a person you trust is in charge of your affairs if you become incapacitated can be a huge source of comfort. We can help you use living wills and powers of attorney to accomplish these goals.TrustsElder law — Our lawyers work with seniors and their families throughout Sussex and Warren Counties to plan for incapacity, wealth succession and asset protection. We can help you with elder law, including issues involving Medicaid and Medicare and the establishment of guardianship and special needs trusts for an incapacitated family member. We can help with the administration of complicated estates or disputes over estate problems.Power of AttorneyIf you are struck by a debilitating illness or injury, you may no longer be able to make decisions for yourself. This is a risk regardless of your age or health. The fact of the matter is that your financial and other affairs will continue to require attention as you recuperate. If you have not planned ahead, your loved ones may struggle to provide this attention on your behalf. A power of attorney and a living will are easy steps you can take to prepare for this type of situation, give yourself peace of mind and remove some pressure from your loved ones. Our attorneys at Hollander, Strelzik, Pasculli, Hinkes, Wojcik, Gacquin, Vandenberg & Hontz, L.L.C. have helped people throughout Warren and Sussex Counties address incapacity planning issues for nearly 50 years.Health LawPersonal InjuryWorkers’ compensation is designed to protect injured workers by requiring their employers to compensate them for on-the-job injuries, regardless of fault. In return, employers are immune from lawsuits instituted by their employees for personal injury. A personal injury lawsuit may provide a higher award than the money you receive for a similar injury from workers’ compensation. You and your family deserve to understand what is available when pursuing your case or negotiating a settlement. Our team of Newton attorneys at Hollander, Strelzik, Pasculli, Hinkes, Wojcik, Gacquin, Vandenberg & Hontz, L.L.C. can go over workers’ comp benefits with you so you understand what is at stake and can make well-informed decisions.Social Security DisabilityMr. Wojcik is a graduate of Columbia University and Boston University School of Law. He spent more than 20 years serving the public interest in Legal Services programs before joining Hollander, Strelzik, Pasculli, Hinkes, Wojcik, Gacquin, Vandenberg & Hontz, L.L.C. He now focuses his practice on municipal court and criminal defense, bankruptcy and debt issues, estate planning, family law and Social Security disability.Medicaid PlanningBusiness and Corporate LawCorporate LawBusiness FormationBusiness formation — Choosing the right type of business formation for your new enterprise is an important decision. There are various types of businesses available under New Jersey business law, and the type you choose can influence your tax position, liability exposure, management structure and ability to raise capital. Our attorneys can review your business plan to determine the type of structure that would be the most appropriate.Business DisputesBusiness is about relationships. Striking the balance between asserting your company’s rights and protecting those relationships can be difficult. When a business dispute occurs, it helps to know your legal position so you can negotiate with confidence. With a strong reputation built over nearly 50 years in Newton, NJ, our attorneys at Hollander, Strelzik, Pasculli, Hinkes, Wojcik, Gacquin, Vandenberg & Hontz, L.L.C. have helped companies throughout Warren and Sussex Counties broker beneficial resolutions to all types of business disputes. We understand the realities of doing business and strive for practical solutions, but we are also ready to litigate when necessary to protect the rights of your business.Limited Liability CompaniesLimited liability companies — As the name implies, limited liability companies (LLCs) offer members limited liability for company debts. They also provide a great deal of flexibility in management structure and the raising of capital. LLCs also enjoy a great deal of flexibility in tax treatment, with multi-member companies having the option of being taxed as partnerships or as corporations.Send to PhoneHontz Mark J40 Park Pl, Newton, NJ 07860(973) 383-3233Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailHontz Mark J40 Park Pl, Newton, NJ 07860(973) 383-3233Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend
