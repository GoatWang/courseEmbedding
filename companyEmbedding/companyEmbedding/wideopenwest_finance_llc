History[edit]
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 gave way for more competition to enter the cable TV market. Encouraged by this law a number of investors, led by local telephone companies, established competitive broadcast cable services in markets across the country. These entities became known in the industry as 'cable overbuilders,' meaning they would build new cable infrastructure into areas where there were existing cable systems.[6]
WOW! was founded in November 1999 in Denver, Colorado. After building a network in April 2001, WOW! initially served about 200 people in the Denver area. In November 2001, WOW! purchased Americast, an overbuild system in the Midwest built and operated by Ameritech New Media for an undisclosed amount per subscriber, estimated to have been at a cost of $600 per sub.[citation needed] This purchase opened WOW! to over 310,000 new customers in metropolitan areas surrounding the cities of Chicago, Cleveland, Columbus, Detroit, Denver, and Evansville.[7] WOW! no longer serves the Denver market.
In August 23, 2011, Wave Broadband and WOW! announced that they entered into an agreement to purchase substantially all of the assets of Broadstripe LLC, a provider of residential and commercial bundled communications services. On January 14, WOW! completed the acquisition of Broadstripe's cable systems in Michigan.
In April 2012, WOW! purchased Knology, a broadband company, operating in 13 markets. With the merger the combined customer total will be over 800,000.[8]
In June 2014, WOW! sold its cable, Internet and phone systems in the South Dakota markets to Clarity Telecom. Part of the multimillion-dollar deal, worth $262 million, included the markets in Iowa and Minnesota previously served by Knology and PrairieWave Communications.[9] In March 2015 these markets would officially become known as Vast Broadband.[10]
In September 2016, WOW! purchased NuLink, a cable company serving Newnan, Georgia with approximately 34,000 customers at the time the deal closed.[11]
In October 2016, WOW! came to an agreement with Midco to sell its systems in Lawrence, Kansas. These systems currently pass approximately 67,000 homes and businesses in the area.[12]
On June 28, 2017, WOW! officially no longer serves the Lawrence, Kansas area.[13]

History[edit]
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 gave way for more competition to enter the cable TV market. Encouraged by this law a number of investors, led by local telephone companies, established competitive broadcast cable services in markets across the country. These entities became known in the industry as 'cable overbuilders,' meaning they would build new cable infrastructure into areas where there were existing cable systems.[6]
WOW! was founded in November 1999 in Denver, Colorado. After building a network in April 2001, WOW! initially served about 200 people in the Denver area. In November 2001, WOW! purchased Americast, an overbuild system in the Midwest built and operated by Ameritech New Media for an undisclosed amount per subscriber, estimated to have been at a cost of $600 per sub.[citation needed] This purchase opened WOW! to over 310,000 new customers in metropolitan areas surrounding the cities of Chicago, Cleveland, Columbus, Detroit, Denver, and Evansville.[7] WOW! no longer serves the Denver market.
In August 23, 2011, Wave Broadband and WOW! announced that they entered into an agreement to purchase substantially all of the assets of Broadstripe LLC, a provider of residential and commercial bundled communications services. On January 14, WOW! completed the acquisition of Broadstripe's cable systems in Michigan.
In April 2012, WOW! purchased Knology, a broadband company, operating in 13 markets. With the merger the combined customer total will be over 800,000.[8]
In June 2014, WOW! sold its cable, Internet and phone systems in the South Dakota markets to Clarity Telecom. Part of the multimillion-dollar deal, worth $262 million, included the markets in Iowa and Minnesota previously served by Knology and PrairieWave Communications.[9] In March 2015 these markets would officially become known as Vast Broadband.[10]
In September 2016, WOW! purchased NuLink, a cable company serving Newnan, Georgia with approximately 34,000 customers at the time the deal closed.[11]
In October 2016, WOW! came to an agreement with Midco to sell its systems in Lawrence, Kansas. These systems currently pass approximately 67,000 homes and businesses in the area.[12]
On June 28, 2017, WOW! officially no longer serves the Lawrence, Kansas area.[13]

TV service[edit]
WOW! offers three different cable packages under their new simplified plans, Small Cable, Medium Cable, and Large Cable. In addition they offer a whole home DVR/internet modem combo they call Ultra, which uses the Arris MG5125G or Arris DCX3635 along with the ARRIS MP2000 Media Player as their whole home solution. The Ultra product combines the DVR, Internet modem, and phone modem all into one box.
This is WOW!'s TV lineup as of July 17, 2017[18].

History[edit]
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 gave way for more competition to enter the cable TV market. Encouraged by this law a number of investors, led by local telephone companies, established competitive broadcast cable services in markets across the country. These entities became known in the industry as 'cable overbuilders,' meaning they would build new cable infrastructure into areas where there were existing cable systems.[6]
WOW! was founded in November 1999 in Denver, Colorado. After building a network in April 2001, WOW! initially served about 200 people in the Denver area. In November 2001, WOW! purchased Americast, an overbuild system in the Midwest built and operated by Ameritech New Media for an undisclosed amount per subscriber, estimated to have been at a cost of $600 per sub.[citation needed] This purchase opened WOW! to over 310,000 new customers in metropolitan areas surrounding the cities of Chicago, Cleveland, Columbus, Detroit, Denver, and Evansville.[7] WOW! no longer serves the Denver market.
In August 23, 2011, Wave Broadband and WOW! announced that they entered into an agreement to purchase substantially all of the assets of Broadstripe LLC, a provider of residential and commercial bundled communications services. On January 14, WOW! completed the acquisition of Broadstripe's cable systems in Michigan.
In April 2012, WOW! purchased Knology, a broadband company, operating in 13 markets. With the merger the combined customer total will be over 800,000.[8]
In June 2014, WOW! sold its cable, Internet and phone systems in the South Dakota markets to Clarity Telecom. Part of the multimillion-dollar deal, worth $262 million, included the markets in Iowa and Minnesota previously served by Knology and PrairieWave Communications.[9] In March 2015 these markets would officially become known as Vast Broadband.[10]
In September 2016, WOW! purchased NuLink, a cable company serving Newnan, Georgia with approximately 34,000 customers at the time the deal closed.[11]
In October 2016, WOW! came to an agreement with Midco to sell its systems in Lawrence, Kansas. These systems currently pass approximately 67,000 homes and businesses in the area.[12]
On June 28, 2017, WOW! officially no longer serves the Lawrence, Kansas area.[13]

History[edit]
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 gave way for more competition to enter the cable TV market. Encouraged by this law a number of investors, led by local telephone companies, established competitive broadcast cable services in markets across the country. These entities became known in the industry as 'cable overbuilders,' meaning they would build new cable infrastructure into areas where there were existing cable systems.[6]
WOW! was founded in November 1999 in Denver, Colorado. After building a network in April 2001, WOW! initially served about 200 people in the Denver area. In November 2001, WOW! purchased Americast, an overbuild system in the Midwest built and operated by Ameritech New Media for an undisclosed amount per subscriber, estimated to have been at a cost of $600 per sub.[citation needed] This purchase opened WOW! to over 310,000 new customers in metropolitan areas surrounding the cities of Chicago, Cleveland, Columbus, Detroit, Denver, and Evansville.[7] WOW! no longer serves the Denver market.
In August 23, 2011, Wave Broadband and WOW! announced that they entered into an agreement to purchase substantially all of the assets of Broadstripe LLC, a provider of residential and commercial bundled communications services. On January 14, WOW! completed the acquisition of Broadstripe's cable systems in Michigan.
In April 2012, WOW! purchased Knology, a broadband company, operating in 13 markets. With the merger the combined customer total will be over 800,000.[8]
In June 2014, WOW! sold its cable, Internet and phone systems in the South Dakota markets to Clarity Telecom. Part of the multimillion-dollar deal, worth $262 million, included the markets in Iowa and Minnesota previously served by Knology and PrairieWave Communications.[9] In March 2015 these markets would officially become known as Vast Broadband.[10]
In September 2016, WOW! purchased NuLink, a cable company serving Newnan, Georgia with approximately 34,000 customers at the time the deal closed.[11]
In October 2016, WOW! came to an agreement with Midco to sell its systems in Lawrence, Kansas. These systems currently pass approximately 67,000 homes and businesses in the area.[12]
On June 28, 2017, WOW! officially no longer serves the Lawrence, Kansas area.[13]

WideOpenWest Finance, LLC Key Developments

WideOpenWest Finance, LLC Enters into Eighth Amendment to its Credit Agreement
Jul 17 17
On July 17, 2017, WideOpenWest Finance, LLC (WOW!) entered into an eighth amendment to its credit agreement with WideOpenWest Inc., as parent guarantor, the lenders from time to time party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the administrative agent and revolver agent, and the other parties thereto (Eighth Amendment) whereby WOW! borrowed new term B loans in an aggregate principal amount of $230,487,500, for a total outstanding term B loan principal amount of $2.28 billion and the revolving credit commitments were increased by an aggregate principal amount of $100,000,000, for a total outstanding revolving credit commitment of $300,000,000 available to WOW! under the revolving credit facility. The new term B loans will mature in August 2023 and bear interest, at WOW!’s option, at a rate equal to ABR plus 2.25% or LIBOR plus 3.25%. Loans under the revolving credit facility bear interest, at the option of WOW!, at a rate equal to ABR plus 2.00% or LIBOR plus 3.00%. The guarantees, collateral and covenants in the Eighth Amendment remain unchanged from those contained in the credit agreement prior to the Eighth Amendment.


WideOpenWest Finance Receives Commitments of $2.28 Billion for New Term B Loans
Jun 22 17
WideOpenWest announced that WideOpenWest Finance has received commitments of $2.28 billion for new term B loans. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding Inc. are expected to act as lead arrangers and lead book runners. The company expects the new term B loan transaction to close in mid-July 2017, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions. The new term B loans are expected to mature in August 2023, subject to certain exceptions, and to bear interest, at the company's option, at a rate equal to LIBOR + 325bps. The company expects to use the proceeds of the new term B loans, along with borrowings under its revolving credit facility and cash on hand, to refinance the company's existing term B loans, to redeem all of WOW! Finance's outstanding 10.250% Senior Notes due 2019 and to pay certain fees and expenses. The company has previously delivered a notice to holders of the Senior Notes to redeem, as of July 15, $323 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes. The company expects that its annual interest costs will be reduced by an amount in excess of $60 million as a result of the combined impact of (i) the deleveraging from the closing of its previously announced initial public offering and (ii) the Debt Refinancing.

May 31 17
WideOpenWest Finance, LLC (WOW!) entered into a seventh amendment to its credit agreement with Credit Suisse AG, as administrative agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the revolver agent, and the other parties thereto. (the Seventh Amendment). The Seventh Amendment (i) refinances the existing $200 million of borrowings available to WOW! under the revolving credit facility, with an additional $100 million of revolving credit facility borrowings to become available upon compliance by WOW! with certain condition and (ii) extends the maturity date of the revolving credit facility to May 31, 2022, unless an earlier date is triggered under certain circumstances. Loans under the revolving credit facility will bear interest, at the option of WOW!, at a rate equal to ABR plus 2.00% or LIBOR plus 3.00%. The guarantees, collateral and covenants in the Seventh Amendment remain unchanged from those contained in the credit agreement prior to the Seventh Amendment.
