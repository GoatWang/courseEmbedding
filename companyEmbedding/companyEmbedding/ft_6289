It looked great when we first received it. However after a couple vacuums the edges are coming undone. I expected it to be better quality with Home Depot putting there name by it.

        Great rug, but gets very dirty easily.
This rug is amazing, however the white colors show dirt too easily. I have it in my office here in Hawaii and the white parts of the "G" are already turning orange after a week or two. Might be permanently stained. Looks awesome though!

ADD PDF TO PRINT ORDER
$100



For those that want both prints and a PDF electronic file, order the prints and choose the option to ADD A PDF ELECTRONIC FILE TO A PRINT ORDER.  When choosing this option, the customer must order prints.  This is a great option because prints can be used to distribute to your contractor for use on the job site.  The PDF electronic files can be sent to sub-contractors, permit departments and your lender.





Additional Sets
$15



Additional sets must be ordered with original order in order to obtain the price shown.  Additional sets may be ordered later and up to 6 months after the original order for a price of $50 per set plus shipping.





Mirror Reverse Set
$60



The image is reversed 180 degrees in a mirror reverse plan; however, the lettering and dimensions will also be reversed.  If you select the mirror reverse option, you will receive 2 sets of your total order in mirror reverse.  The mirror reverse sets will assist your contractor to lay out the foundation and framing in reverse.  The remaining sets of your order will not be mirror reversed.  Your lender and permit department will not accept mirror reverse plans.
