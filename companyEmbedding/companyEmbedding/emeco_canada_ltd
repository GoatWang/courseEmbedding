  Why a Brand Built in the Arctic Is Releasing a Spring-Friendly CollectionCanada Goose is making a big push into the (slightly) warmer months.

Most Popular








By
Pete Forester


Mar 28, 2017












 



Canada Goose is extreme outerwear. When you shop on the brand's website you'll find its blisteringly warm parkas categorized by how warm they'll keep you (some will protect in weather as low as -40 degrees), with puffy vests and snow suits for those extra hours in the chill. Even the famous branded patches, mimicked by imitators, say "Arctic Program." They're no joke. That's why we were (pleasantly) surprised to learn that Canada Goose is presenting a robust spring collection—not only that, but it's pretty broad and on-trend.




Canada GooseAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowThis is the third year that Canada Goose has offered a spring collection, and although its famous down parkas are missing—they're only for winter—the mission hasn't changed. "We still stand for the same thing, which is making sure that we're able to protect you in any kind of adventure. And rather than thinking of just crazy, arctic landscapes and extreme cold, what we want to do is just think about the everyday adventure," explains Spencer Orr, VP of Design and Merchandising at Canada Goose. "We're still utility and function first, it just happens that we've extended that expertise into another season."
Most PopularThe collection features a series of light density jackets, wind wear, rain shells, and quilted down crewnecks. Each of the pieces is made to be combined with the others, but for Orr, it's less about creating packaged looks and more about having options. The "shoulder seasons"—fickle transitional moments—require versatility. This is something that Orr knows first hand from living in Toronto, Canada Goose's hometown."It's all about unpredictability," he explains. "This morning I walked out to a little light mist. I'm going to go home in some heavier rain, and then the middle of the day is not that warm. So, when we're able to take some of our expertise and really play pieces that can either stand alone or work together as a system, that's how Canada Goose interprets spring."Years ago, Canada Goose released the Hybridge Lite, a jacket made for milder winter days. But fans of the brand were wearing their Hybridge Lites into the spring, and early in the fall. When Orr saw this, he took it as a cue to start offering collections for the warmer seasons.





The McKinnon jacket, Albanny shirt, and Sandpoint jacket.
Canada Goose"Spring is leveraging all our expertise that we have in fall and winter, and really taking that trust that we have with our fans, and our consumers, and bringing it into a season that we believe is actually not all smiles, and sunshine, and gum lollipops, and butterflies," he says. Spring is more than budding flowers and bunnies, it's icy morning mud and wet afternoons. It's blustery freezing rain between quick bouts of crisp cloudless skies. It's allergies taking over as the flu lets go. Canada Goose wants to be there during all those transitions.Our favorite item from the collection is the Albanny shirt, a crewneck that reimagines a Canada Goose parka as a pullover shirt, complete with water-resistance and down fill. It has a kangaroo pocket like your favorite hoodie, as well as side vents when the day heats up. The Sandpoint and McKinnon jackets are light and thin, in colors that are cheerier than what we world normally think of for a traditionally winter brand, while utilizing a "diamond yarn" to stand up to that extra hard wind. The Faber Bomber takes the popular Chiliwack Bomber that Drake used as the silhouette for his recent collaboration, and renders it without the down. You get the same look for warmer days. 





Canada Goose"People trust us to keep them protected, not only just warm, but protected," says Orr. "I think it makes sense in these shoulder seasons. We will not be a summer brand, we'll make sure that we're purely function first with an intent there."Canada Goose has been around for 60 years and the team has a mission. They want to help their customers on their adventures, removing the liability of shifting weather. The shoulder seasons through spring and fall offer different challenges than the winter, so really it's not that Canada Goose is expanding its scope: It's simply making good on its central promise. Plus it doesn't hurt that now you can wear your Goose almost all year."Once someone wears a Canada Goose jacket, they don't want to take it off. It's almost sad when they put it away for storage," Orr says. Well, now they don't.Related Story

Equipment Services
Emeco provides earthmoving equipment rental solutions to mining companies and contractors in two simple ways:
Maintained Dry Rental
As a customer, maintained dry rental allows you to focus on mining while we keep our equipment working reliably and productively for you. Our skilled maintenance team integrates seamlessly onsite to manage and maintain Emeco equipment and deliver peak machine performance. Whether onsite or through a field service arrangement, our maintenance solutions are tailored to each individual project and offer flexibility throughout the life of any mine.
Dry Rental
A dry rental solution is ideal where Emeco rental equipment joins with an existing fleet and is supported by an already established onsite maintenance capability. A pure dry rental solution enables you to retain full control over the management and maintenance of all onsite equipment. Your operators and maintenance teams can rely on the fact that every Emeco machine is maintained to Original Equipment Manufacturer specifications and should you need any back-up assistance, Emeco's after-hire support team is ready to help.
Equipment for Sale
As a result of the ongoing renewal of our global fleet, we have a number of quality, low-houred, well-maintained and/or re-conditioned machines for sale that are no longer required to support our equipment rental offerings.
