Top positive reviewSee all 3 positive reviews› 4.0 out of 5 starsA Worthy SequelByChris Thomason July 3, 2010As a lover of stories following the same characters, I'll be the first to say I can't stand terribly written sequels when the originals were so compelling. Fortunately for me, and fans of the Lincoln time travel series, Good Friday was a worthy sequel to Abraham Lincoln, A Novel Life. This story addressed more thoroughly the characters that I wanted more from in the original. For instance, Joan Matcham is much more developed in Good Friday, and her obsession/love for ol' Abe is evident in her research, charting, and emotions. Tony Wolk certainly delivered a slew of more complex characters this time around, with more attention paid to plot development than Civil War era history. I would have, however, liked to have seen more interaction with Abe and Joan. I felt their relationship was truly genuine in the first account, so the overall absence of Abe in Good Friday was slightly disappointing. Also, I felt less attached to the side story of Harry Stein. The book could have done with less Harry, in my opinion. All in all, Good Friday was an interesting sequel to Abraham Lincoln, A Novel Life. Any fan of the original would be pleased to witness the continuation of Joan Matcham's journey.

Top critical reviewSee all 5 critical reviews› 1.0 out of 5 starsPlotless in Two TimelinesByKristin M Chorubyon August 27, 2016This was the most painfully dull book I’ve muddled through in years. Like its predecessor, Abraham Lincoln, A Novel Life, this novel is basically time-travelling Lincoln fanfiction, but at least the first book in the series had a plot. Good Friday mostly consists of Lincoln’s milquetoast twentieth-century one-night-stand waffling about her plight as a single woman pregnant by a man who will inevitably be assassinated ninety years ago. The book limps along through the device of throwing in an antagonist who comes across as more whiny than sinister and who, like every other character of note, accepts the whole “Abraham Lincoln traveled forward in time” story much too readily. Even with the addition of the underwhelming antagonist, not much happens plot-wise until the ending, which itself is a total cop-out (Spoiler alert: she alters history and saves Lincoln, which somehow results in a 20th century full of airships). Even the writing was a disappointment; it relied excessively on repetitive sentence fragments, and it was clear the author was out of his element in trying to write from a woman’s point of view. I usually try to find something good to say about any book I read, but I got nothin’ for Good Friday—one star.

This is the sequel to Abraham Lincoln: A Novel Life, in which Lincoln goes forward in time ninety years, to Illinois in 1955.  He meets Joan Matcham and spends one day with her before he vanishes again, back to his own time.  In Good Friday, we return to Joan Matcham and learn how Lincoln was able to send her a letter and how his visit has changed her life.  Because of her connection to him, she is able to flit back and forth between her era and his.  This is a magical and haunting page-turner in which the veil between two eras thins.

I found this to be a fun and fluffy read. I thought the idea of Lincoln time traveling was interesting, but I couldn't buy into the romance part of the story. Maybe it's just my perception of what Lincoln was like, but I have a hard time imagining that he would be the type of guy to have a one night fling with a woman and fall in love with her. It just doesn't really sound like something Honest Abe would do.
