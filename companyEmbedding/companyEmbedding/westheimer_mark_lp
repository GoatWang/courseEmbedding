Mark E hails from the West Midlands, and identifies the industrial background of the area as an influence on his sound, particularly on this album, Product Of Industry (obviously). But, refreshingly, this isn’t just a byword for ‘heavy’ and ‘dark’ music. Mark E takes the mechanical relentlessness of industry, but tempered with warm analogue synth sounds. Its a strong combination.

We're not your normal record shop...


Please note that whilst we're always happy to see you, we are not a normal record shop where you can come and browse the stacks.
There are no stacks. 
Nope, instead we are basically a kind of crap lo-fi Argos for vinyl records. So, instead of trudging all the way to sunny Holbeck in anticipation of being able to flick through shelf after shelf of releases, please place your orders online first and use our 'In-store collect' option in the checkout. 
Cheers,
Team Normanx

Free shipping...


As far as we can tell you're a UK customer. That means you get free shipping on:

any order over £50
all CDs.

Please note that if you enter a non-UK shipping address in the checkout then all shipping charges will be recalculated accordingly. Your final shipping costs may also vary according to the checkout preferences you choose such as insurance and packaging, etc.

Related artist data is provided by Spotify. Why? 

They are much, much better at writing clever algorithms than us.
They have much, much more data to set their algorithms on.

We think this is a better option than stinking up your browsing experience here on Norman Records with a crummy implementation of our own. (We only wish we were this clever: Artist Explorer.)
Please note
Spotify generate recommendations based on the listening patterns of their massive audience, so they are generally pretty good. The data does throw up some odd combinations though. So, if you do spot anything daft have a little chuckle at their robots but please don't contact us about it. There is nowt we can do.
