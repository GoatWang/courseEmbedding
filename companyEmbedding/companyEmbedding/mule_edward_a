It’s been a pleasure doing business with you. And if I never get to meet you here on earth I’ll see you in heaven!Toby CookI received the Mulerider’s Martingale, tried it and I am more than pleased with the result. I was able to get my mule past one of her ‘monsters’ with much less effort. By the time I had finished riding the monsters weren’t so scary. Thanks!Bobby CappsAfter pairing up with a fantastic molly mule named Big Jane I had a few fine points I wanted to talk with Steve about. He was friendly and happy to talk to me – but he really expanded my horizons! Steve taught me ways to better communicate with Jane and she has been delighted to see the change in me. I’m the proud owner of a Trail Lite Saddle, britchen and breast collar – and I’m at a ton smarter when ti comes to mules. Steve is the guy for any mule question.Tracey MerrettI bought a 16″ cowboy saddle with breast collar and britchen straps and have been very pleased with them. My mule and I were exercising at a light canter on flat ground when she tripped, went down – and I was thrown clear. We both got back up and no damage – the rider, mule or saddle. Now we know the saddle will survive the weight of an upside down mule!Marlin "Moon" MullinsPreviousNextMost Popular ProductsCinch-Neoprene “Trail” Cinch $62.00 Select optionsBeta Britchen $165.00 Select optionsCome-A-Long Rope $20.00 Add to cart Show Details Beta Breast Collar $135.00 Select optionsTrail Lite Saddle $990.00 Select optionsContact the Ranch Queen Valley Mule Ranch 1855 W Running Deer Queen Valley, AZ 85118  Phone: 602-999-6853 Email: steve@muleranch.com Recent PostsCatching Your Mule on Your TermsMay 11, 2017 - 12:00 pmThe Halter and the Lead Rope Working TogetherMay 10, 2017 - 12:00 pmBits and BridlesMay 9, 2017 - 12:00 pmWhat’s Wrong With My Saddle?May 8, 2017 - 12:00 pmReady to Buy a Mule?

We are blessed with some very temperate weather though it can surely get very hot during summer months. We do not, however, get snow or blistering cold days. Most of our “coldest” days are in the 40’s though they are not that common.Our landscape is lovely with desert, buttes, mountains, and cactus plants all around us. Mules work well for us as they can tolerate the heat better than most horses and their water consumption is a tad easier to manage as well. As you may know, mules are the animals of choice for Grand Canyon trips, not only because they are known to be sure footed, but also because they can perform the job in the hot and dry conditions.We are a working ranch. Our business is mules. So while we have some outstanding riding opportunities, we are not open to the public for trail access. We train mules to pack, drive, and ride and our lands are used for animals in training and for accommodating our guests and students.There are several options for those who come to work with us. While we are not terribly far from big cities like Mesa (less than 30 miles), Scottsdale (right around 40 miles) and Phoenix (just shy of 50 miles), we have accommodations right on the ranch. Should you decide to visit us, we will share the options with you.I live on the ranch with my wonderful wife, Susan. We have been together following our dreams since 1968. Susan is the bookkeeper and “party planner” (code for event coordinator) for our pack trips. She also watches over many of the day to day details of the ranch. She is the real “trail boss” truth be told! All kidding aside, she is as passionate about our work as I am and our work is truly a labor of love.So long story short, if you come to the ranch, you are not far from a major airport. If you are trucking in, the ride is breathtaking and we are happy to share our home with you. Visit our accommodations page to learn about camping, our guest houses, and stalls for your animals. Please be sure to review our pet policy as well.Product CategoriesBitsBooksClinicsDriving ProductsInstructional VideosOther ItemsPack Saddles & EquipmentSaddle PadsSaddlesTackRecent PostsCatching Your Mule on Your TermsMay 11, 2017 - 12:00 pmThe Halter and the Lead Rope Working TogetherMay 10, 2017 - 12:00 pmBits and BridlesMay 9, 2017 - 12:00 pmUpcoming EventsThere are no upcoming events at this time.

Welcome to Mule Head Brand. We are featuring selections from our library of product literature highlighting our degreasers, cleaners, brighteners, hand cleaners, metal cleaners, and odor eliminators. This literature is available for downloading.
Contact us for details about our complete line of Mule Head Brand products. We sell only to authorized distributors and will be happy to steer you to the distributor nearest you.
Our proprietary high performance maintenance products for the heavy-duty truck and R.V., industrial and janitorial industries truly “Kick Stubborn Grease in the Head.”  Our odor elimination products set the standard for the rest of the industry.
Manufactured by T. W. Pelton & Co., Mule Head Brand modestly began in 1988 with one product, Formula 4000 Cleaner/Degreaser. Market acceptance of this product was immediate and enthusiastic. High performance Formula 4000’s success paved the way for our current line of more than 30 maintenance products for virtually any application where grease, grime and obnoxious odors create problems. 
Our network of distributors now covers 40 states and continues to grow. Whatever your company's need might be — greasy hands, problem floors, obnoxious odors, or dirty equipment — our Mule Head Brand products offer you a high performance solution. 
Contact us to find your nearest authorized Mule Head Brand distributor.
