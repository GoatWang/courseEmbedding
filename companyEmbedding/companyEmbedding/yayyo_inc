Reporter








YayYo, Inc., an app that provides metasearch applications for ridesharing services, said Tuesday that it had qualified its Regulation A+ offering at $8 a share to raise proceeds of $50 million. Under Regulation A+ offerings, known as a "mini-IPO," private companies can raise up to $50 million from the general public, not just accredited investors. The company says it provides a "Kayak-style" metasearch service and allows consumers to compare prices across different ridesharing services. YayYo started in June and the founder Ramy El-Batrawi said he anticipates the app launching in the next few months.

Elon Musk details Tesla Model 3 pricing, range
              
              Tesla Inc.'s  Model 3 will cost $35,000 for a base version and $44,000 for a model with longer range, Chief Executive Elon Musk announced Friday night at an event outside the company's Fremont, Calif., factory. Tesla has announced hundreds of thousands of reservations for the car, which included $1,000 deposits, but only announced the final pricing schedule at the event, where the first 30 Model 3 units were supposed to be delivered to owners. The two options for range introduced Friday night were a Standard edition expected to travel 220 miles on a full charge, and a Long-Range model that would travel 310 miles. Musk reiterated at the event that he expects to soon build the cars at a rate of 5,000 a week, ramping up to 10,000 a week by the end of next year, and that customers who order the cars now would likely receive them late next year.

Stitch Fix has confidentially filed to go public: report
              
              Stitch Fix, a subscription clothing service, has filed confidentially to go public, according to TechCrunch, citing sources. The company has been rumored to be going public for months, with Reuters reporting in May that the company had hired Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase & Co. to underwrite the offering. Under the JOBS Act, companies are able to file confidentially before releasing a public prospectus. In late June, the Securities and Exchange Commission moved to allow confidential filing for all companies, rather than the previous standard of companies with annual revenue of less than $1 billion. Stitch Fix would be another test of a subscription service model, after Blue Apron Holdings Inc.'s  offering earlier this month. Shares of Blue Apron have fallen 28% month-to-date, while the S&P 500  has gained 2%.

              Shares of Redfin Corp.  debuted Friday on the Nasdaq with a bang, opening at $19.56 at 11:05 a.m. ET, which was 30% above the $15 initial public offering price. The stock has since added to gains be up 35% in morning trade. The real-estate company, which mixes online technology with traditional agents, had priced its IPO above the previously expected range of $12 to $14.

The stock was listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol "RDFN." The stock debuted on a day that the SPDR Real Estate Select Sector ETF  was up 0.1% and the S&P 500  was down 0.4%.

Atlantic Media selling ownership stake to organization run by Laurene Powell Jobs
              
              Emerson Collective, founded by Laurene Powell Jobs, wife of late Apple founder Steve Jobs, is acquiring a majority ownership stake in The Atlantic. According to a news release on Friday Atlantic Media Chairman David Bradley told staff of the deal, which includes its flagship magazine, digital properties, live events business and consulting services. Bradley, through Atlantic Media, will hold a minority stake and continue to run The Atlantic for the next three to five years. In a letter to The Atlantic staff Bradley said, "Against the odds, The Atlantic is prospering. While I will stay at the helm some years, the most consequential decision of my career now is behind me: Who next will take stewardship of this 160-year-old national treasure? To me, the answer, in the form of Laurene, feels incomparably right." The terms of the deal were not disclosed. In the 18 years since Bradley acquired the magazine from Mortimer Zuckerman, digital readership has grown to a monthly average of 33 million unique visitors from 2 million in 2009, and it generates profits above $10 million per year after recording losses of more than $10 million a year in Bradley's early days. About 20% of the magazine's revenue comes from print advertising with 80% coming in digital advertising.

Goodyear Tire's stock dives after slashed profit outlook offsets in-line earnings
              
              Shares of Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.  plunged 9.3% in premarket trade Friday, after the tire maker slashed its 2017 profit outlook. Net profit for the quarter to June 30 fell to $147 million, or 58 cents a share, from $202 million, or 75 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share came to 70 cents, matching the FactSet consensus. Revenue slipped to $3.69 billion from $3.88 billion, just shy of the FactSet consensus of $3.73 billion. The company cut its 2017 guidance for segment operating income to a range of $1.60 billion to $1.65 billion from "approximately" $2.0 billion. "In addition to higher raw material costs, we have seen a weakening in OE and consumer replacement demand across many of our key markets during the first half, despite strong underlying industry fundamentals," said Chief Executive Richard Kramer. "The combination of these factors has led to a highly unusual first half environment, particularly given the favorable trends in miles driven, gasoline prices and unemployment that are generally supportive of our industry." The stock has rallied 14.9% year to date through Thursday, while the S&P 500  has gained 10.6%.

Wells Fargo: FDA plan to lower nicotine could be opportunity for Altria, Philip Morris
              
              Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog said Friday that a new Food and Drug Administration plan to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes could be a long-term opportunity for makers of reduced-risk products like Altria Group Inc.  and Philip Morris International Inc. . Shares of cigarette producers plunged after the FDA announcement, with Altria plummeting 9.6%, Philip Morris declining 0.4% and British American Tobacco  plunging 7.2% in extremely heavy midday trade. Altria and Philip Morris, however, have a "unique competitive advantage" with smokeless iQOS devices. Philip Morris said "iQOS heats the tobacco just enough to release the flavorful nicotine-containing vapor but without burning the tobacco." Even so, one medical journal study found that smoke from heat-not-burn cigarettes have 85% of the nicotine in conventional cigarettes. "We see this as an opportune entry point for long-term investors and would recommend building positions on today's broad weakness," Herzog said. "We also note that PM/MO's premarket tobacco product application with the FDA to commercialize iQOS in the U.S. remains under review." Altria shares have dropped 6.9% over the last three months and Philip Morris shares have risen 5.8%, compared with a 3.6% rise in the S&P 500 .

LOS ANGELES, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 05/15/17 --  YayYo, Inc. ("YayYo"), the leading app providing smartphone metasearch for ridesharing services, today announced it has hired automotive industry veteran and visionary Laurie DiGiovanni as Head of Fleet Operations. DiGiovanni will manage operations for YayYo's rideshare services, including the RideYayYo service recently announced into beta in Los Angeles.
DiGiovanni will immediately focus on leading operations for RideYayYo, including driver training and fleet management, as it ramps up its beta test within LA County. RideYayYo will provide LA residents with the riding experience the city now lacks due to the daily surge pricing from the dominant rideshare companies driving up consumer costs -- a steep expense to ride in old cars with untrained drivers. 
DiGiovanni is the founder of the Association for Finance and Insurance Professionals (AFIP), an association that has certified tens of thousands for more ethical car buying practices, and mandatory for auto industry employees and implemented in leading global automotive markets. She also played key roles in the launch and success of many automotive initiatives, including managing new divisions and brands for Beverly Hills Travel and Lifestyle and American Dream Classics; serving as Director of Training for CarsDirect.com, which achieved revenue of $650M+ in one year; and leading marketing and customer experience campaigns for Barrett-Jackson Car Auction. 
"I'm excited for the opportunity to join such an innovative company like YayYo, and to revolutionize the ridesharing industry," said DiGiovanni, Head of Fleet Operations, YayYo. "Consumers have made it clear that they are sick of surge pricing from the big players in the space, and that they are ready to seek out alternatives that bring better value for their money. We're excited to bring a quality ridesharing opportunity back to the consumers with YayYo." 
DiGiovanni also has direct brand experience within the automotive industry, including project management and training positions with Toyota, Mazda, and Nissan. She is a sought-after speaker and thought leader by manufacturers, women's groups, and other automotive businesses.
"We are thrilled to be able to add someone of Laurie's pedigree to the YayYo team during this crucial time for the Company's growth. Her extensive experience with national product launches, technology implementations, and automotive marketing campaigns will be of great value as we continue to expand," said Ramy El-Batrawi, CEO, YayYo. "Laurie is a recognized leader within the automotive space, and we will rely on her vision and experience as we bring YayYo and RideYayYo to a national market."

YayYo, Inc. Announces Initial Public Offering






























LOS ANGELES, May 02, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
        YayYo, 
      Inc.
 (        www.YayYoIpo.com
), 
      the first app providing smartphone metasearch applications for 
      ridesharing services, announced that the Securities and Exchange 
      Commission, as of March 17, 2017, qualified the Company’s Regulation A+ 
      Initial Public Offering at $8 per share to raise gross proceeds of $50 
      million.


                                        








Under Regulation A+ the public can buy shares directly from the company 
      at         www.YayYoIpo.com

According to YayYo Founder and CEO Ramy El-Batrawi, the Company started 
      in June of last year to fulfill the vision of a metasearch for the 
      transportation industry that he anticipates will be launched in the next 
      few months. “The initial idea was simple,” said Mr. El-Batrawi. “I 
      wanted users to be able to readily compare prices and distance of 
      rideshare and other transportation operators, and now it is becoming a 
      reality.”


                                        

About YayYo, Inc
.


                                        

YayYo
 
      is a single-sign-on metasearch app for smartphones that provides price 
      comparison and booking of eventually all available ridesharing and taxi 
      services along with select limousine and public transportation services. 
      YayYo offers all the convenience users expect plus unique benefits and 
      conveniences not available from Uber, Lyft or taxi services alone.


                                        








As the first single-sign-on solution for the growing ridesharing & 
      transportation economy, YayYo will provide a “Kayak-style” metasearch 
      experience for the ridesharing world by enabling real-time 
      transportation quotes and comparison options as well as a seamless, 
      multiservice provider-booking engine. With YayYo, users only need to 
      sign up for one app one time and instantly gain the benefit of mobile, 
      one-tap order efficiency from a growing list of popular on-demand 
      ridesharing services.


                                        








This app is built to make things easier for users and gives them peace 
      of mind knowing that they are saving money while getting them where they 
      need to go how they want to get there.


                                        








We give users the benefit of seeing multiple service providers from one 
      app. The best thing about YayYo is that users only need a YayYo account 
      and they will have access to every provider on our app.


                                        








YayYo will also be offering a rewards program that lets users acquire 
      Yaymiles points with every trip they take that can be redeemed for ride 
      fare discounts and free rides within the YayYo app.

How is performance calculated?







 





U.S. Sectors & Industries Performance is represented by the S&P 500 GICS® (Global Industry Classification Standard) indices. Last % change is the nominal change in the price of the index from the previous trading day's close expressed as a percentage as of the index value at the time noted in the Date & Time field.  All dates and times are reported in ET.
Last % change is the nominal change in the price of the index from the previous trading day's close expressed as a percentage as of the index value at the time noted in the Date & Time field. All dates and times are reported in ET. Chart Performance figures may vary slightly from 1 Year % Change due to different timeframes used in chart calculations.
GICS is an industry classification system developed by Standard & Poor's in collaboration with Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI). S&P uses GICS to determine the market segment to which a company is assigned. A company is assigned to a single GICS industry according to the definition of its principal business activity as determined by Standard & Poor's and MSCI. Revenues are a significant factor in defining principal business activity; however, earnings analysis and market perception are also important criteria for classification. There are currently 10 sectors and 68 industries.  Three of the 68 industries do not have companies represented in the S&P 500 Index; therefore, performance is not available for Marine, Transportation and Infrastructure, and Water Utilities.
Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500) Index is an unmanaged market-weighted index of 500 of the nation's largest stocks from a broad variety of industries. The S&P 500 represents about 80% of the total market value of all stocks on the New York Stock Exchange. Market-weighted means that component stocks are weighted according to the total value of their outstanding shares.
Indexes are unmanaged, statistical composites and their returns do not include payment of any sales charges or fees an investor would pay to purchase the securities they represent. Such costs would lower performance. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

Los Angeles, California alleges in its complaint that it hired Hurst Capital LLLP a Florida
Limited Liability Limited Partnership in the summer of 2016 to develop, create, launch and run
its mobile applications and website for consumer use, business development and marketing. In
contrary, Hurst Capital LLLP was never hired, contracted or signed any agreements be that
contractor agreements, work for hire agreements or any form of employment agreement with
YayYo, Inc. or any of its affiliates. Additionally, Hurst Capital LLLP, an entity two of the
defendants, Austin Hurst and Zach Hurst joint-manage never signed allon-Disclosure
Agreement with YayYo, Inc. or any of its affiliates. The only written agreement between
defendants Austin Hurst and Zach Hurst is a Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement dated June 9,
2016 and signed personally by the defendants Austin Hurst and Zach Hurst. That agreement
included a walkaway clause stating "
The Plaintiff also alleges that it paid Hurst Capital, LLLP approximately $76,802 for services to
aid YayYo, Inc. in delivering a usable work product. YayYo, Inc. founder Ramy El-Batrawi
verbally agreed to provide the Defendants Austin Hurst and Zach Hurst 15%management level
equity in the company in trade for writing the technology plan, recruiting contractors with very
unique skillsets, assisting with the business and financial plans, managing the technical teams
'~ that were contracted and providing access to their vast rolodex of relationships all in an effort to
help YayYo become profitable. There were approximately 40 individuals contracted by YayYo,
Inc. while the Defendants Austin Hurst and Zach Hurst were actively involved with the
company. The Defendants Austin Hurst and Zach Hurst allowed YayYo, Inc. to independently
contract the majority of their engineering relationships directly; however, the Defendants Austin
~ Hurst and Zach Hurst paid a few of these individuals' invoices directly from Hurst Capital,

LLLP for which YayYo, Inc. reimbursed Hurst Capital, LLLP dollar for dollar totaling
appro~mately $76,802. This reimbursement is in no way considered remuneration for Austin
Hurst or Zach Hurst's material contribution developing YayYo, Inc. including, but not limited to
hundreds of combined hours of "sweat equity" and the creation of a proprietary technical plan
that YayYo, Inc. used in order to overcome specific market obstacles providing YayYo, Inc. the
"secret sauce" necessary in order to accomplish multi-operator rideshare booking through a
single app without direct operator API access. The Defendants Austin Hurst and Zach Hurst
provided the core material for the business plan that YayYo, Inc. used when securing its upstart
capital and also provided YayYo, Inc. with numerous opinions disclosing the execution risk that
~ would be involved such as YayYo's unstable reliance on unofficial 3rd party Application
Programming Interface access, merchant liabilities and legal threats from rideshare operators,
among other concerns. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants Austin Hurst and Zach Hurst are
~, at all times relevant to the complaint. The Plaintiff alleges Austin Hurst and Zach Hurst made
fraudulent representations to YayYo in order to persuade YayYo to pay hundreds of thousands
dollars for work that was either never completed or incapable of being performed as they
represented. It also alleges Austin Hurst and Zach Hurst conspired with their co-Defendants in
this action to defraud YayYo and to steal and/or convert approximately $800,000 for their
collective personal gain and benefit. This allegation is beyond frivolous and is presented with
~ zero merit. The Plaintiff YayYo, Inc. set forth in its business plan to build the first meta search
engine to compare the cost of ride share operators such as Uber and Lyft as well as manage
bookings and rewards through a single app. It was made clear by Austin Hurst to Ramy El-
Batrawi, YayYo, Inc.'s founder, in their very first meeting that what he was proposing to do was
strictly against the terms and conditions of Uber and the other ride shaxe operators YayYo, Inc.

would need to function with in order to attract users. Both Austin Hurst and Zach Hurst
concluded that In order to successfully deploy the meta type search engine Mr. El-Batrawi was
requesting, YayYo, Inc. would have to build proprietary software that automatically booked
rides on behalf of YayYo users by managing virtual accounts with each operator in those user's
names. Similar processes have been successfully executed before by companies such as
Travelocity; Hotwire, and Orbitz prior to having permission from airlines and allowed them to
quote and compare the airline service offerings. These companies used a process in technology
called screen-scraping where the computer would download a copy of the travel websites data
and publish relevant pieces of it to the aggregator or meta search page the user was viewing. In
two previous ventures, the Defendants Austin Hurst and Zach Hurst worked with Ryan
O'Connor as well as the other defendants listed in this suit on virtualization-based software
~ projects and described to Mr. El-Batrawi that the unique demands of his project would require
the very specific virtualization skill-set and domain expertise that Ryan O'Connor and his team
possessed. Inane-mail titled "Additional info for YayYo Plan" sent to Mr. El-Batrawi on Fri,
Jun 24, 2016 at 6:19 PM, Zach Hurst submitted additional material for Mr. El-Batrawi to add to
the YayYo business plan for Mr. El-Batrawi's express purpose of raising capital. Included was
more than a page describing the Defendants Austin Hurst and Zach Hurst's applicable work
~ history with Mr. O'Connor and a detailed description describing the team's previous failures
with virtualization ventures; however, it also included the line "The foundational knowhow
necessary to execute on the proposed virtualization goals was acquired by the YayYo
engineering team over the course of several years through previous virtualization ventures." Mr.
~ El-Batrawi responded to that email on Sat, Jun 25, 2016 at 7:51 AM stating "i would really
shorten the virtualization experience section and remove the negative out of it..." The

Austin Hurst and Zach Hurst made overwhelming efforts to disclose all of the risks associated
with the YayYo business model and expected that Mr. El-Batrawi would be similarly
forthcoming with his shareholders. Since other meta search websites in the airline and hotel
industries had not been shut down, Mr. El-Batrawi was confident that a metasearch engine in
ride-sharing would not be shut down either. Mr. El-Batrawi believed that Uber and other large
operators would negotiate ofFicial deals with YayYo, Inc. as soon as YayYo, Inc. proved
traction. In a copy of the business plan sent to Austin Hurst on June 22, 2016 at 12:18:44 AM
PDT by Mr. El-Batrawi, it was published under risks that "We may be unable to maintain or
establish relationships with providers, which could limit the information we are able to provide
to users." and that "Ridesharing providers choose to reduce or even eliminate the fees they pay,
our financial performance could be materially adversely affected." In a copy of the business plan ~
sent to Austin Hurst and Zach Hurst on Sat, Jul 9, 2016 at 8:57 AM, Mr. El-Batrawi published
under "Revenue Model" that "With critical mass, YayYo intends to gain the necessary
negotiating leverage to demand referral fees. In the beginning, each trip will be processed at a
loss accounting for merchant fees and general operating considerations such as compute and
bandwidth costs. These expenses will initially be slated as marketing with forecasted ROI
resulting from rebates and future localized offer arbitrage initiatives." Mr. El-Batrawi was so
confident in the strategy that he asked the Defendants Austin Hurst and Zach Hurst to create a
pre-registration website offering "two free ride credits" to every new YayYo user and granularly
~ track referral codes for the marketing initiatives YayYo, Inc. was running, including cable
television advertisements. While the Defendants Austin and Zach Hurst were actively involved
with YayYo, Inc., Mr. El-Batrawi's marketing campaigns resulted in over 10,000 pre-registered
users, all of which were promised "two free ride credits" with Uber and Lyft. Mr. El-Batrawi

was extremely confident that upon launch, a significant number of the pre-registered YayYo
users would redeem theiX free ride credits enmass and create volumes of immediate transaction
activity with both Uber and Lyft that could not be ignored by either operator; hence, creating the
perfect case for an official Uber and Lyft partnership with YayYo, Inc.. Mr. El-Batrawi also
believed that because Uber and Lyft were reportedly spending upwards of $100 per user on .
customer acquisition at that time, the capital markets would also support YayYo's free-ride
credit strategy and aggressive marketing expense forecast. For that reason, Mr. El-Batrawi was
convinced that YayYo.'s reliance on unofficial connections into Uber and other operators'
services would merely be a temporary dependency and that he could raise "100s of million of
dollars" once the app was live in the app store and negotiate direct deals. What the Defendants
Austin and Zach Hurst proposed to Mr. El-Batrawi was not only possible, but was successfully
accomplished by their teams per the requirements set forth. In fact, Mr. O'connor successfully
deployed a prototype version of the app that booked a ride with a third party rideshare operator
as proposed. Meeting the rigorous launch deadline for YayYo's beta required that Uber did not
change their systems or infrastructure as a means of disrupting the connection between the
YayYo technology and the Uber Technology. Several times during the development process
Uber, in fact, did change their systems, disrupting the connection beriveen the Uber app and the
YayYo technology. This, in addition to various other unforeseen development hurdles such as
numerous changeovers with merchant providers, naturally created development delays for
YayYo. The entire project scope drastically expanded several times throughout the user-
experience design, user-interface prototyping and user story development phases as well as upon
I~~ new updates to Uber or Lyft's respective apps. The Defendants Austin Hurst and Zach Hurst
vehemently deny any allegations that they or their teams were incapable of completing the

project. In fact, Mr. El-Batrawi had several third party technology consultants interview Ryan
O'Connor before ever contracting him, communicated directly with Ryan regarding change-
order requests and fully understood the risks involved every step of the way. On numerous
occasions Mr. El-Batrawi broke the chain of command and communicated directly with
contractors that were under the direction of the Defendants Austin Hurst and Zach Hurst which
,eventually caused internal confusion, developmental delays and three weeks of unnecessarily
expensed hours across the design and front-end programming deparhnents. If anyone is to blame
'or development delays at YayYo, Inc. it is Mr. El-Batrawi for gross mismanagement and
general incompetency. The complaint of Fraudulent Representation is baseless and therefore
unwarranted.

~ informed and believes and on that basis alleges that there was a commingling of funds or other
~ assets, identical equitable ownership, inadequate capitalization, disregard of corporate
formalities, and a lack of segregation of corporate records as among Austin, Zach and Hurst
Capital. Hurst Capital LLLP is a Florida based Limited Liability Limited Partnership established
and incorporated on Apri16, 2012 following a company operating agreement prepared and

Hurst Capital LLLP is based out of its Florida office located at 5386 Gulf Dr. Suite 107, Holmes
Beach, FL 34217. Per the terms of the Hurst Capital LLLP Operating Agreement the defendants
Austin & Zach Hurst jointly hold all equitable interests in Hurst Capital LLLP and from time to
time the LLLP makes investments in companies. In a verbal contract The Defendants Austin
Hurst & Zach Hurst asked Plaintiff to assign the YayYo partnership equity to Hurst Capital
LLLP to follow the strict guidelines set forth in their own partnership agreement. Hurst Capital
LLLP maintains its corporate records and justly operates as a Limited Liability Limited
Partnership in the State of Florida. The Plaintiff's effort to pierce the corporate veil of Hurst
Capital by making allegations of every legal possibility is completely frivolous, unwarranted and
without merit. I
Answering the allegations of Pages 7-11, Paragraphs 16-27 of the Complaint herein,
Defendant denies all claims. The primary allegation states Mr. El-Batrawi during mid June 2016
acting on YayYo's behalf met with Austin Hurst who was representing Hurst Capital, LLLP at
the W Hotel in Hollywood. Through way of a mutual acquaintance he met with Austin in an
effort to fmd a company to hire to build his mobile and web applications. Mr. El-Batrawi alleges
that after sharing his idea; "Austin jumped at the chance" also continuing that Austin claimed
through Hurst Capital he and his brother had successfully built and launched numerous mobile
applications such as Celebvidy. Austin spoke highly of his "team in Miami", insisted that he
along with Zach and Hurst Capital were experts in the field and promised that they could build
an application and website that performed exactly how Mr. El-Batrawi envisioned. The meeting
took place on June 2, 2016 at the W Hollywood. Contrary to these allegations Austin did not
"jump at the chance". In fact, Austin was very vocal about the risks involved in violating Uber's
Terms of Service and confidently presented to Mr. El-Batrawi in front of the mutual

acquaintance his concern. Mr. El-Batrawi was very bullish in not worrying about a lawsuit
saying "If I generate them millions in revenue day one they will not shut me down, only embraa
me:" Not once in the initial meeting did Austin speak about his team in Florida. He merely
indicated one possible way of accomplishing it would be to use Android powered virtual
machines running the Uber app and build software that mimicked finger taps when someone
pressed the same commands on the YayYo app. He was very clear that he needed to consult
some advisors and experts before coming back to Mr. El-Batrawi. Austin never promoted any
experience launching numerous mobile applications. Mr. El-Batrawi actually didn't ask Austin
about his background in the meeting. If that information was presented, then it was by way of
their mutual acquaintance who Mr. El-Batrawi spent a considerable amount of time with prior to
the start of the meeting. The app Mr. El-Batrawi mentions in this complaint is "Celebvidy".
While working on YayYo, Austin and Zach were very vocal with Mr. E1=Batrawi regarding the
state of Celebvidy's platform development and the fact that it was not complete yet. In fact, any
delay to YayYo's development timeline could threatened Austin and Zach's attention to
Celebvidy as well as their vested interest in YayYo as well as other ventures. Mr. El-Batrawi
indicated Austin and Zach would make so much money from YayYo they need not to worry
about Celebvidy and showed absolutely zero interest in hearing the Celebvidy business plan or
acknowledging Austin & Zach's fiduciary duty to complete the project. As such, while working
in partnership with Mr. El-Batrawi to design and build YayYo, Austin & Zach contributed what
little hours they had remaining to their other holdings, Celebvidy included. In the June 2nd
meeting Austin made no indication to Mr. El-Batrawi he could or had the teams in place to do
what Mr. El-Batrawi was requesting and needed to consult some advisors and experts before
coming back to him. In an e-mail sent by Mr. El-Batrawi to Austin Hurst, Zach Hurst, Mr.

O'Connor and two other technical team members on Sun, Sep 25, 2016 at 6:39 PM, Mr. El-
Batrawi stated "I looked and our teams and I find that everyone on them is amazing. The talent is
undeniably there. Austin and Zack put together something special when they pull all of you
together. Every team lead by Ryan, Shadi, Cris, Desire, even the small teams that Austin put
together for the website are great..... Austin and Zach are more like me big thinkers and
dealmakers and can see the big picture and this is not the only thing they are working on. As they
pointed out a few times when I approached them they were not sitting on their hands. They were
working on 40 other projects. So the technical side of project management is not what they able
to do at this time.
The complaint continues "Austin stated that Hurst Capital could complete the project by
September IS` and that it woti~lc~ cost YayYo $1 S0, 000 for both the website and the mobile
application .that worked on both the Apple and AndYoid platforms.
The September 1St delivery date was nothing more than an optimistic dream stated
numerous times over by Mr. El-Batrawi. Mr. El-Batrawi actually reference several times a book
called "Think and Grow Rich" where a select passage taught him to give himself and others
unrealistic timelines therefore he/they were motivated to work hard every day knowing that they
most likely wouldn't achieve the goal but would be much further along than if his deadline was
later. This is a philosophy Mr. El-Batrawi preached to not only the defendants but anyone who
came into his- office. He kept copies of the books to hand out to individuals he chose to gift them
to. Austin never saw eye-to-eye with Mr. El-Batrawi on this delivery date saying numerous time:
over a 90 day track that to develop a full working app was beyond crazy; it would take a perfect
world scenario where there were zero setbacks the entire way. Mr. El-Batrawi continued to say
September 1 to everyone even when it was clear to him that was never going to happen. In the

initial meeting Austin threw out a ballpark figure of $150,000 to develop a website, mobile app
(ios/android) and tech plan based on a full stack single engineer working on the whole project.
Before making a final assessment Austin made it clear to Mr. El-Batrawi he needed to do some
technical discovery and due diligence to make sure what they were proposing was even possible.
It wasn't until this discovery was complete that Austin could make an accurate assessment the
project would move forward.
The complaint continues: Within a couple of weeks of the fast meeting, Mr. El-Batrawi
had a second meeting with Hurst Capital. This time, both Austin and Zach attended. They met at
cafe in Beverly Hills, California and further discussed a potential deal between YayYo and
~ Hurst Capital in which Hurst Capital would create, develop and finalize YayYo's website and
mobile applications.
June 8~, 2016: Mr. El-Batrawi did not have a meeting with Hurst Capital. He had a
meeting with Austin and Zach Hurst. The purpose of the meeting was to come to terms on their
~ partnership. In this meeting Mr. El-Batrawi asked Austin directly what he would like in terms of
equity. Austin suggested the following terms: 15% founders equity in the company. Mr. El-
~ Batrawi also indicated that his partner Henrich Bari would be receiving 5°/a. It was clear to
~ Austin and Zach at this time Mr. El-Batrawi was willing to dilute up to 20% of the company and
keep 80%for himself. Austin asked Mr. El-Batrawi how the company was structured and Mr. El
~ Batrawi indicated he had a special LLC structure where 50% of the company belonged to the
~ founders and 50% belonged to the investors. Investors would receive all their principle back first
from net profit and then all proceeds following would be split pari-passu among the founders
investors. The way the LLC was structured the founders could never be diluted from their 50%.
This sounded like an appealing structure. At the worst outcome Austin & Zach would own 10%

of the company which at the diluted value would be 5% of the entire LLC. This verbal agreement
was in place and Austin requested paperwork documenting it. Never did Austin & Zach agree
they would or Hurst Capital would create, develop and finalize YayYo's website and mobile
applications. In fact, Austin only indicated he would introduce Mr. El-Batrawi to developers that
could handle the task.
The complaint continues: Again, Austin represented that they (meaning he, Zach, Hurst
Capital and them "team ") could unequivocally create a website and mobile application that
could accomplish exactly that MY. EZ-Batrawi envisioned. Zach also spoke throughout the
meeting, confirming too that Hurst Capital and their teams were experts in coding, developing
software and programming. Both Austin and Zach represented that they were capable of
developing code and programming that could access real-time pricing offered by all Nide-
sltaYing and private ride services (such as Uber and Lyft). Austin and Zach spec~cally
guaranteed they-had the know-how and technology experience to accomplish the speck prod
Mr. El-Batrawi explained.
Never did Austin or Zach indicated "Hurst Capital" was a software development
company or was to be "hired" by YayYo nor, did Austin and Zach refer to the
engineers/programmers/developers as "Their Team". These were all independent contractors
with real world jobs that did not actively work with or directly for Austin and Zach. Austin and
Zach agreed to becoming founding equity partners in YayYo, LLC in trade for the sweat equity
of planning, recruiting and leading teams down a critical path of development. In trade for a
verbal contract and a extremely aggressive artificial deadline Austin and Zach went immediately
to work identifying highly qualified individuals axound the country all with specific skillsets
deemed necessary by not only Austin and Zach but also Mr. El-Batrawi in accomplishing the

job. Mr. El-Batrawi had Austin's first hire do numerous phone and slcype driven interviews with
people Mr. El-Batrawi trusted to be experts in technology to further validate his resume and
wherewithal. Mr. El-Batrawi did not "hire" Hurst Capital, Austin or Zach Hurst at any point; it
was a partnership from the start. In this meeting Austin made it very clear a technical discovery
would have to be completed to validate the theories being tossed around in respect of how to
accomplish the tasks. He was also very clear no one he put Mr. El-Batrawi on the phone with
would consult for that many hours for free. Mr. El-Batrawi said money was not a problem. He
also indicated in that meeting he was raising $500,000 for the company. Austin made it clear to
Mr. El-Batrawi he did not believe Mr. El-Batrawi could raise money from any sophisticated
investors without the technical discovery complete, a business plan and a financial plan in place.
He suggested to Mr. El-Batrawi everything needed to get to that next stage.
The complaint continues: When discussing the cost, Austin and Zach represented that the
price would be somewhere between ~1 S0, 000 to $250, 000. They were clear that the cost would
never exceed $250; 000.
This statement was made without any technical discovery or research to reveal the
complexity of the task moving forward and cannot be taken as fact. Additionally, when Mr. El-
Batrawi met the potential engineering hires (The remaining defendants on this complaint) it was
made clear their hourly rates, number of hours needed per work week and provided a detailed
breakdown of costs well exceeding the $250,000 figure. Mr. El-Batrawi chose to move forward
with them as independent contractors, pay them directly, communicate with them directly and
receive all invoices and related statements regarding hours worked and when payments were duf
Austin and Zach were never CC'ed on these communications. This was a direct relationship
between the other defendants and Mr. El-Batrawi. Austin merely facilitated an introduction.

The complaint continues: Soon thereafter, Austin and Zach insastec~ that Mr. El-Batrawi
meet them team of developers and technology staff in FloNida. They claimed Mr. El-Batrawi
would be impressed with their team and that this meeting would solidify HuYst Capital as the
right company for YayYo 's job.
Austin shared with Mr. El-Batrawi a research report completed by 451 Group out of San
Francisco validating Ryan O'Connor's competency in virtual machines. Austin also shared with
Mr. El-Batrawi that he met Mr. O'Connor after Mr. O'Connor was executively recruited to
become the head of engineering at a Tampa based tech company Austin & Zach were customers
of. Austin indicated to Mr. El-Batrawi not only has someone else already burdened the expense
of an executive recruiter, but this assembled team was the best in their field (that field being
software virtualization) and what Mr. El-Batrawi was trying to do required experts in said field.
Never did Austin or Zach represent Mr. O'Connor was an employee, part of an active "team" or
that Hurst Capital was a software development company looking for work. Austin & Zach Hurst
are 15% equity parhiers with Mr. El-Batrawi who owns the majority of the company and Henric
Bari who owns 5% in the startup company YayYo, LLC.
The complaint continues: Mr. El-Batrawi obliged their request and traveled to Florida to
meet Hurst Capital's team. Mr. El-Batrawi met with Austin and O'Conna~ at a Yestaurant
around Orland, Florida. He spent time once again discussing the intricacies of the pYoduct
YayYo envisioned. Mr. El-Batrawi specifically discussed the fact that YayYo needed to be able to
access real-time, accurate pYicing options available to the public via all ride-sharing and pYivate
ride applications so that they could offer these prices to the consumer. Mr. El-Batrawi
emphasized that the pricing needed to be correct, and updated to reflect exactly what the pYices
and options were available to a customer, at any given time, foY any Yide sought. MY. El-Bat~awi
15
Case 2:16-cv-08653-TJH-E Document 53 Filed 02/08/17 Page 16 of 30 Page ID #:261
1 also discussed that YayYo's product needed to interface with these ride-shaping and pYivate ride
2 applications (such as Uber and Lyft) so that its cicstomeYs could book rides with these carYiers
3 through YayYo's application. Austin emphatically confirmed that Hurst Capital's team
4
absolutely could accomplish these objectives. O'ConnoY also specifically represented that he,
5
6 along with Hurst Capitals' "team "could accomplish these objectives. Austin and O'Connor
~ discussed various technology avenues available to achieve these product features. They touted
g their experience in this industry and insisted these were completely accomplishable objections.
9 Never once did Austin, Zach or O'ConnoY ever state verbally or in writing that it wozrld be
10impossible for them to build the product YayYo wanted to bring to market. To the contrary, they
11
12 assuYed Mr. El-Batrawi that they could make YayYo's vision areality and that they could do sc
13 by September IS`for no more than $250, 000.
14 Mr. El-Batrawi demanded an in person meeting with Mr. O'Connor and requested Austin
15 book a flight with his identical itinerary. Mr. El-Batrawi never referred to Mr. O'Connor as
16Austin's "team". Neither Mr. O'Connor or Austin referred to "Hurst Capital" as a software
17
1 g company specifically responsible for the delivery of the product. Mr. El-Batrawi was very aware
19 Mr. O'Connor had a full time job and was a potential recruit for a position as Engineer. Mr. El-
20 Batrawi and Austin Hurst flew to Miami International Airport where Mr. El-Batrawi rented a car
21 and the two of them drove to West Palm, Beach where O'Connor would meet them at a
22restaurant half-way in-between his house and the hotel Mr. El-Batrawi was staying at. In the
23
meeting Mr. O'Connor made it clear to Mr. El-Batrawi that as an engineer he and his colleagues
24
25 like to break things down and figure out how they work. Therefore this job would be a fun one to
26 do. Mr. O'Connor's response when Mr. El-Batrawi would ask him if he was capable of making i~
27 work was always "I'll figure it out". Mr. El-Batrawi complimented him numerous times on the

response saying he liked that attitude. Never did O'Connor agree to a deliverable date and
laughed every time Mr. El-Batrawi said, "so you can get it done by September 1". He simply
said "I can try my best". Mr. El-Batrawi worked hard to convince Mr. O'Connor to quit his job
and come work full time for YayYo in California. He even went as far as showing Mr. O'Connor
a real estate listing on Zillow of amulti-million dollar home he said he would purchase for
O'Connor if he moved. Austin always disclosed the risks associated with reliance on Third Party
vendors the company had no contracts with; furthermore, emphasizing the fact it could bring
forth legal action as well as legislative troubles. Mr. El-Batrawi removed all disclosures of risk
from the business plan drafts before forwarding it on to potential investors against Austin &
Zach's insistence on keeping them in there. Mr. El-Batrawi called Austin's attitude "negative"
and would not let him come to meetings with potential investors. Austin was afraid there would '~,
be disclosure violations in the fundraising effort but Mr. El-Batrawi assured him it was all above
board and he knew what he was doing. "Hurst Capital" was-never mentioned in any
conversations related to being contracted, hired, assigned, etc. nor are there any contracts of such
a relationship. Contrary to the allegations in the complaint, a total price for the development of
the project was never discussed during the initial dinner in West Palm Beach with Mr.
O'Connor. This discussion would take place the following morning in Mr. El-Batrawi's hotel
room. In Mr. El-Batrawi's hotel room Mr. O'Connor discussed his rates with Mr. El-Batrawi. It
was Mr. O'Connor's personal hourly rate as well as the rates of the individuals Mr. O'Connor
suggested were necessary in order to accomplish different tasks associated with the backend
development and engineering of the platform. Mr. El-Batrawi asked him if he could get the
project finished by September 1 in which Mr. O'Connor laughed again and said "that's really
aggressive and probably won't happen". Mr. El-Batrawi offered Mr. O'Connor and his team

bonuses for finishing on time. In the meeting he told Mr. O'Connor was told that if he finished
by September 1St he would receive a bonus check for both him and every member of his team,
but that amount would reduce incrementally if he delivered the product in October, November or
December. If the product took longer to produce there would be no bonus. O'Connor verbally
agreed and said they would do their best to get the job completed. O'Connor also asked Austin
during the meeting who was in charge of the front-end development of the application to which
Austin indicated he had a team in mind but were not ready for them yet. Later, Austin would hire
Shadi Fares to handle front-end development and work with O'Connor to connect it via API
End-Points to the backend.
The complaint continues: Following these meetings, in reliance on Austin's, Zach's and
O'Connor's express Yepresentations, YayYo entered into an agreement with Hurst Capital. to
build YayYo's website and mobile applications and to have both fully complete and operational
by Septemberl, 2016, in exchange foY compensation not to exceed $250, 000.
Mr. El-Batrawi's claims are patently false and no such agreement exists either verbally
written with Hurst Capital. The verbal agreement on June 8, 2016 with Henrich Bari as witness
was that Austin & Zach Hurst would receive 15%founders equity in the company. Henrich Bari
would receive 5%. Austin and Zach Hurst are partners in YayYo, LLC now YayYo, Inc. Not
employees. Not contractors.
The complaint continues: YayYo relied on Austin's, Zach's and O'Connor's
representations to its detriment. Among other things, YayYo solicited funding from vaNious
investors, spent $500, 000+ on marketing materials and profnotional spots, opeNations and made
deals with various investoYs and third parties to Yaise further capital and generate market
interest in YayYo's pYoduct. Unfortunately for YayYo, it tuYned out that Austin's, Zach's and

O'Connor's representations were false, that it was impossible foN Hurst Capital to provide the
deliverables as promised, and that the Defendants were conspiring all along to defraud YayYo to
the tune of $800, 000, all for their personal gain and benefit.
Mr. El-Batrawi asked Austin and Zach Hurst to lead the development teams and deploy a
Ipre-registration website where users could fill out basic information in anticipation of an app
launch. Not only was apre-registration website launched, the database collected in excess of
10,000 customer records. Mr. El-Batrawi never consulted his business partners Austin or Zach
Hurst on spending the company money freely and if he spent in excess of $500,000 on
marketing, he did so without their consent. Austin and Zach Hurst never had access to the
company financial accounts, never saw a copy of the operating agreement, nor can confirm how
much money the company raised and for what percentages. Any investors in the company
subscribed under Mr. El-Batrawi's own disclosures. Mr. El-Batrawi showed Austin an e-mail
from a banker in New York City requested information about how YayYo has obtained API
Access from Uber. Mr. El-Batrawi showed Austin how he avoided the topic in his replies but
insisted YayYo needed to get a deal in place so he could respond without omission. It's Austin's
opinion Mr. El-Batrawi did not disclose risks properly when promoting the investment. These
allegations are frivolous, baseless, unwarranted and without merit.
The complaint continues: AfteY YayYo hiYed Hurst Capital and HuYst Capital 's "team " 
which was compNised of Defendants  YayYo learned that they had been the victim of a bait and
switch. It turned out that Defendants were utterly incapable of providing the deliverables they
promised. Despite Defendants' repYesentations and proclamations to the contrary, it was
actually impossible for them to access real-time, continuously updated pricing from available

ride-sharing and private-ride seYvices in the area. This was the key component of YayYo's
product. Without it, the product was useless. Defendants were also far fYom the experts they
claimed to be in the technology and soflwaYe industries. They created a website that was fraught
with erYors and bugs, so much that Yay~'o had to hire a new company to completely retool the
website so that it functioned properly. Defendants' work product on the mobile applications was
even more useless.
YayYo did not "hire" Hurst Capital. YayYo's backend engineering team, which
comprised of all defendants with the exception of Hurst Capital, Austin Hurst and Zach Hurst,
was YayYo's "team". They were all independent contractors who signed agreements
individually with Mr. El-Batrawi to work directly for YayYo, LLC. They were paid directly by
YayYo, LLC. They reported to Mr. El-Batrawi directly through Mr. O'Connor. Mr. El-Batrawi
chose to carry communications with Mr. O'Connor directly about the product, the features, the
road map and the progress. These conversations took place several hours per day without Austin
or Zach. Mr. El-Batrawi never summarized or updated Austin or Zach in respect to these
conversations. Mr. El-Batrawi had numerous technology consultants at the highest-level
interview Mr. O'Connor about his experience as well as his objectives on how to accomplish the
job. Mr. El-Batrawi had a copy of Mr. O'Connor's resume as well as the resumes of every team
member which he published in the business plans shown to his investors. Mr. El-Batrawi was
extremely controlling of the process and demanded direct relationships with every member of thF
team. The Plaintiff's claim is "impossible foY them to access real-time, continuously updated
przcing from available ride-sharil~g and private-ride services in the area. " This claim has zero
merit. Accessing real time pricing is a feature of both Uber and Lyft's public APIs. It requires no
hacking of Uber and Lyft. The data the Plaintiff is claiming O'Connor was unable to access is

publically available to anyone in the world. There are several dozen websites on the Internet that
tap this data to create search tools. The "key component" of YayYo's technology was not
accessing the pricing of the rides. It was being able to book one without leaving the YayYo app
and entering the ride share provider's app. It is clear from the complaint Mr. El-Batrawi does not
understand his own product. Austin and Zach Hurst contributed the core of the business plan
which clearly defines the purpose of the company and what the investors bet on. The buggy
website Mr. El-Batrawi is referring to is the pre-registration page that was developed in offshore
India to save Mr. EI-Batrawi money. It was not recommended by his partners Austin & Zach
Hurst to task Mr. O'Connor at his high hourly rate to build a website and Austin told Mr. El-
Batrawi on several occasions the speed and efficiency in which the website was being developed
was dependent on the talent level expectancy of offshore resources. It was against the better
judgment of Austin and Zach Hurst to burn excess company dollars on code that would be
scrapped when the product launched: Clearly, Mr. El-Batrawi's philosophy of how to spend his
investors' money differed. At the time NIr. El-Batrawi asked Austin and Zach Hurst to allow a
product manager with 17 years of experience in Silicon Valley take over, there was no mobile
app. Mr. El-Batrawi had worked behind the backs of Austin and Zach Hurst to redesign the
entire product from the ground up wasting 30 days of development time and forcing the front-
end developer to throw out all of his code. Whatever code was delivered tuider the leadership of
the new product manager and under the obsessive control of Mr. El-Batrawi is in no way a
reflection of Austin and Zach Hurst's departure on October 3, 2016. These allegations are
frivolous, baseless, unwarranted and without merit.
The complaint continues: Over the course of July to OctobeY 2016, Defendants continued
to insist that YayYo pay more and mope money in oYdeY to cover the cost of hiring additional

engineers. Defendants claimed they needed to hire more and/or different people to pNovide the
prodicct they initially promised to deliveY on September 1, 2016 and for no more than $250, 000.
Defendants missed their deliverable deadline and forced YayYo to pay it an additional $550, 000
thro~cgh nonstop invoices fog additional engineers and services it insisted were necessary to
complete the application.
The aggressive and artificial deadline of September 1, 2016 forced the defendants to
recommend the hires of multiple resourceful teams in parallel against all best practices of
technology development. The defendants made it clear to Mr. El-Batrawi how traditional
technology tracks work and he was told this not only by Austin and Zach Hurst, but also by the
resources they recommended he hire. Mr. El-Batrawi refused to listen to reality and operated
from a delusional state of mind. Mr. Shadi Fares the front-end developer had an extensive
background in enterprise app development working for Pitney Bowes and told Mr. El-Batrawi
his deadline was "absolutely crazy" for the best of the best. He created what we referred to as a
"waterfall effect" where all hands were on deck to handle tasks as they presented themselves
instead of planning out features and teams waiting for their predecessors to complete jobs. The
feature list set forth in the initial Florida meeting was reduced to 10% of the total features
presented after a month of planning. Mr. El-Batrawi saw 100% of the features and said he
wanted them all for launch. Mr. El-Batrawi said money wasn't .an issue and if we needed more
people to get the job done he would pay for them. Mr. El-Batrawi had control of the company
accounts. Mr. El-Batrawi had complete control over how much money was being spent. If the
$550,000 exceeding a budget he concocted was spent, his signature will be found on every
check. No one forced Mr. E1-Batrawi to do anything. If what Mr. El-Batrawi is saying was
accurate, it would also be accurate to suggest gross mismanagement of investor funds by Mr. El-

Batrawi. However, not a word of this complaint is accurate. These allegations are frivolous,
baseless, unwarranted and without merit.
The complaint continues: Some five months and $800, 000 later, YayYo realized it had
been duped. Defendants still did not have a functioning product, the work they had claimed to
complete was entirely useless and in the end, YayYo had absolutely nothing to show for the time
and money it spent relying on Defendants' representations. YayYo ultimately had to hire a new
team of expeYts to build its pYoduct from scratch.
On October, 3`d, 2016 under the threat of legal action for interfering with the new
Manager Austin and Zach Hurst decided to sit on their equity and focus their time on other
business ventures. Plaintiff instructed all contractors of YayYo that if they communicated or
attempted to communicate with Austin and Zach Hurst that they would be sued and that he was
preparing a lawsuit against Austin and Zach Hurst. Following being served papers alongside the
other defendants, Austin was able to speak for the first time to Mr. O'Connor. It turns out the
product was in fact completed. The only portion of the product that was not working had to do
with the phone numbers YayYo would need to assign to its users when signing them up on the
Uber and Lyft apps. The team contracted by Austin and Zach Hurst to handle the phone numbers
were never paid and fired on October 3rd when Mr. El-Batrawi asked Austin and Zach to cease
their involvement with YayYo. It turns out this decision by Mr. El-Batrawi single handedly cost
hirn a working product. A decision which happened after Austin and Zach departed their
operational roles in the business. A decision Mr. El-Batrawi made in haste because he was
misinformed about his own company and why each team was hired. Removing key people
without a proper transition plan is a recipe for disaster in any business and Mr. El-Batrawi made
this decision under his own authority. The Plantiff alleges that they had to build the product from

scratch; however they are still using the code. The repository of source code shows it's been
forked and is still being accessed and used by YayYo, Inc. YayYo published an app to the
iTunes App Store on December 5~', several days after filing the lawsuits using the code. The pre-
registration website is still active on the yayyo.com homepage where they are still using the
code. It is without a doubt YayYo is not rebuilding a product from scratch just continuing to
work with what was already contributed by its contractors. These allegations are frivolous,
baseless, unwarranted and without merit.
The complaint continues: To date, YayYo is still recovering from the damages defendants
causecl. Its product launch has been delayed. It has lost out on millions of dollars in funding and
capital investments due to Defendants' shoNtcotnings. It has lost out on other viable income
generating opportunities because it did not have a working product by September 1 Sr as
Defendants guaranteed. YayYo suffered additional out ofpocket losses in increased costs, wastec
opportunities and money spent on maYketing and Zaunch tasks.
On Wednesday, September 28th, 2016 at 7:48pm the Plaintiff's contractor Desiree
Sisneros accidentally attached new design files to an e-mail titled "Video for site" and e-mailed
it to Austin Hurst at which point Austin and Zach Hurst uncovered a compartmentalized agenda
to undermine their work and set the tech development off its planned trajectory. Austin
questioned Desiree's objectives but she had no valid defense for why Austin and Zach were out
of the loop. At 8:41pm Austin conducted a 2 hour and 23 minute conversation with Shadi Fares
trying to understand why all these changes were happening. It was pretty obvious he also, on
several occasions, made it clear to the Plantiff and Desiree that the changes were so drastic he
would have to start over. In the coming days we spoke to all team members to verify the
directives came from the Plaintiff. Mr. El-Batrawi was paying all contractors directly therefore

~ he was their boss. They did what he said and did not feel the need to run it by Austin and Zach
for approval. On the morning of Monday, October 3 2016, Mr. El-Batrawi spoke for 15 long
minutes admitting to a month long internal compartmentalized effort to direct the teams himself
as he believed jobs were not being done properly. He shortly thereafter asked for Austin and
Zach Hurst to stop anything related to YayYo. By removing the two key individuals capable of
leading YayYo's development teams to the finish line, the Plaintiff is solely responsible for the
company's failure; due to protecting his own ego, pride and enacting a hastily rush to judgment.
Therefore, his allegations are frivolous, baseless, unwarranted and without merit.
In summary Mr. El-Batrawi, the Plaintiff, admittedly in his claims had no prior
substantive experience in the technology or software industries. Mr. El-Batrawi needed
Defendants Austin and Zach Hurst to oversee the technology side of the business this is why he
partnered with them. Mr. El-Batrawi is trying to erroniously persuade the court Defendants Hursi
Capital, Austin Hurst and Zach Hurst were employees and/or contractors "hired" by his company
to provide services when in fact that is far from the truth. Hurst Capital LLLP is a 15%equity
holder of YayYo, LLC. or the equivalent conversion when the company was changed to YayYo,
Inc. With software ventures, it is not unusual to acquire what is commonly referred to as
"technical debt" inside of a start-up business. Oftentimes, start-ups hire on marketing and sales
teams before the software is fully complete because it is important to develop the brand and
prepare the sales materials for the inevitable product launch. In these cases, the software
development teams are further pressured to meet their proposed deadline because if they miss it,
it could lead to layoffs in other departments across the organization. When technical debt
presented itself at YayYo, marketing efforts were not impacted whatsoever because the strategy
was solely focused on pre-registering as many users as possible by launch, be that in September

2016 or later. Sy running several cable television advertisements among other sizable marketing
campaigns which drove traffic to the YayYo.com landing page, asking the Defendents to
develop an automated referral system which, not only credited bonus miles upon new user
referrals in a rewards program but also, made it incredibly easy fox these incentivized users to
share their unique affiliate links, by offering two free ride credits for Uber and Lyft to empower
every new user, exposing the company to in excess of $400,000 in redemption liability that
Austin and Zach Hurst are aware of through these programs, disregarding opinions regarding
legal, legislative and/or regulatory risks in addition to putting zero restrictions on his pre-
enrollment sign-up forms or caps on how many reward miles a new afFiliate user could earn, Mr.
El-Batrawi illustrated without a shadow of a doubt that his company's operational style was
consistent with that of a very well capitalized Silicon Valley start-up company and likely was not
forthcoming with his- shareholders regarding the true reason for the development delays leading
to suspicion of misappropriation. By falsely placing the blame on the Defendants Austin Hurst
and Zach Hurst with this claim and promoting an absolutely absurd potential for damages to his
shareholders, Mr. El-Batrawi was able to conceal his own judgements as a CEO; namely, his
inability to properly manage his own company's runway or burn-down expectations. The wishful
thinking and decudions made in a vaccuum left YayYo is an illiquid state, presented issues
making payroll and eventually resulted in the unjust removal of the Defendants Austin Hurst and
Zach Hurst from their management roles. Defendants Austin Hurst and Zach Hurst are both
managing partners of Hurst Capital, LLLP where they see apro-rata distribution of Hurst
Capital's equitable interest in YayYo, Inc.

The Plaintiff's misremembering of key facts should discredit the Plaintiff in this case. Fc
example Mr. El-Batrawi could not remember that he requested his only in-person meeting with
Mr. O'Connor or where Mr. El-Batrawi travelled to meet Mr. O'Connor. Mr. El-Batrawi falsely
contends that he hired Hurst Capital (a private equity firm) as a software development company
and believes his 1099 contractors (all locked in legally binding independent contractor
agreements), paid by YayYo at the sole direction of Mr. E1-Batrawi, were somehow employees
or contractors of Hurst Capital.
Not some but all-27 claims in General these Allegations are fictional at best, patently
false at worst. It should be clear to the court that the Plaintiff brought this frivolous, baseless,
unwarranted and without merit claim against the Defendants in an effort to more easily promote
YayYo to current and new potential shareholders following his previous missteps.
Answering the allegations of Pages 11-22, Paragraphs 28-88 of the Complaint herein,
Defendant denies all facts. The Plaintiff alleges Hurst Capital, LLLP, Austin Hurst and Zach
Hurst were employees, contractors, work for hire and contractually obligated to provide services
not exceeding $250,000 for YayYo, Inc. in the deployment and development of their website,
i0S Application and Android Application. The Plaintiff alleges the Defendants misrepresented
their capabilities in an effort to bill more hours, hire more workers and steal $800,000 from the
company. The Plaintiff alleges the Defendants delivered no working product or code and the
Plaintiff is rebuilding their product from scratch. The Plaintiff alleges the Defendants conspired
with the other Defendants to carry out this plan and keep the company from launching,
interfering with the Plaintiff's economic business interests. Hurst Capital, LLLP, Austin Hurst
and Zach Hurst axe in fact not employed or contracted by the Plaintiff. There is no agreement or
written representation of such agreement in existence. In the company business plan that has

been shared with investors, Defendants Austin Hurst and Zach Hurst are titled as Advisors and
Consultants and in a verbal agreement with witness on June 8, 2016, the Defendants Austin
~~
Hurst and Zach Hurst agreed to accept ~% equitable interest in the company, in trade for "sweat
equity" and managing the tech side of the company. All of the other contractors signed
individual independent contractor agreements; several of which were countersigned by Austin
Hurst as an acting officer of YayYo. All of the other employees including the other Defendants
listed were paid by the company directly and not through Austin or Zach Hurst. The Defendants
Austin Hurst and Zach Hurst have thousands of combined hours of material contribution to the
business including writing the technology plan, recruiting contractors with very unique skillsets,
assisting with the business and financial plans, managing the technical teams contracted and
providing access to their vast rolodex of relationships only in an effort to help YayYo become
profitable. On October 3`d, 2016 the Plaintiff hired a product manager with 17 years experience
to replace the duties fulfilled by Austin and Zach Hurst as business partners. Austin and Zach
Hurst removed themselves quietly and respectfully from the roles and have made a continued
effort not to harm YayYo's reputation. Austin and Zach Hurst wish only for YayYo's to be
successful which would inevitably increase the vested value of their sweat equity. The claims
brought forth in this lawsuit are not only misrepresentative of who the defendants were to
YayYo, Inc., they are frivolous, baseless, unwarranted and without merit.

YayYo,
      Inc. (www.YayYoIpo.com),
      the first app providing smartphone metasearch applications for
      ridesharing services, announced that the Securities and Exchange
      Commission, as of March 17, 2017, qualified the Company's Regulation A+
      Initial Public Offering at $8 per share to raise gross proceeds of $50
      million.
    

      Under Regulation A+ the public can buy shares directly from the company
      at www.YayYoIpo.com.
      Link to YayYo's IPO commercial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yua0CMJXK4Y.
    

      According to YayYo Founder and CEO Ramy El-Batrawi, the Company started
      in June of last year to fulfill the vision of a metasearch for the
      transportation industry that he anticipates will be launched in the next
      few months. "The initial idea was simple," said Mr. El-Batrawi. "I
      wanted users to be able to readily compare prices and distance of
      rideshare and other transportation operators, and now it is becoming a
      reality."
    

About YayYo, Inc.
    

YayYo
      is a single-sign-on metasearch app for smartphones that provides price
      comparison and booking of eventually all available ridesharing and taxi
      services along with select limousine and public transportation services.
      YayYo offers all the convenience users expect plus unique benefits and
      conveniences not available from Uber, Lyft or taxi services alone.
    

      As the first single-sign-on solution for the growing ridesharing &
      transportation economy, YayYo will provide a "Kayak-style" metasearch
      experience for the ridesharing world by enabling real-time
      transportation quotes and comparison options as well as a seamless,
      multiservice provider-booking engine. With YayYo, users only need to
      sign up for one app one time and instantly gain the benefit of mobile,
      one-tap order efficiency from a growing list of popular on-demand
      ridesharing services.
    

      This app is built to make things easier for users and gives them peace
      of mind knowing that they are saving money while getting them where they
      need to go how they want to get there.
    

      We give users the benefit of seeing multiple service providers from one
      app. The best thing about YayYo is that users only need a YayYo account
      and they will have access to every provider on our app.
    

      YayYo will also be offering a rewards program that lets users acquire
      Yaymiles points with every trip they take that can be redeemed for ride
      fare discounts and free rides within the YayYo app.
