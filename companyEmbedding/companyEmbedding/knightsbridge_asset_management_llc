Knightsbridge Asset Management, LLC is an independent, 100% employee owned, Registered Investment Advisor. The firm was established in 1998, solely managing individual portfolios for both private clients and institutions.  We are investment managers you can trust and talk directly with, not a faceless organization.
We invest opportunistically with a focus on capital preservation as well as rate of return. Contrarian in nature and informed by extensive internal research, we employ a value oriented investment discipline, seeking to capitalize on market inefficiencies and irrational investor behavior. Our investment track record dates back to 1992 and is independently verified.  And our personal and family wealth is invested alongside clients.

Philosophy
We believe the best long term returns come from owning quality companies, while also opportunistically taking advantage of mispriced situations.  We seek to invest in businesses, not trade stocks.  Throughout our track record, we have extensively researched areas of market inefficiency, finding unusual occurrences in the marketplace where pricing may be undeserved and temporarily undervalued.  
We conduct ongoing fundamental valuation work in order to identify stocks exhibiting desired discounted valuation relative to peers and historic norms.  Stocks purchased also typically operate in out-of-favor industries in terms of performance, valuation and sentiment.  Acceptable financial leverage and strong cash flow and revenue per share alongside earnings improvement potential are additional common attributes of purchases.  Stocks are typically sold when no longer undervalued or no longer out of favor.
We deploy capital for the long-term (beyond Wall Street’s typical 18 month horizon), seeking an adequate absolute return in a tax efficient manner.  Owning quality businesses for the long-term (i.e. 3-5+ years) makes for good after-tax results.  We invest where a reasonable starting valuation allows business cash flows, not perceptions, to ultimately drive investment results.
Key attributes associated with the firm’s Opportunistic Value Equity strategy:
-	Opportunistic investment across the full range of market capitalization
-	Portfolios concentrated among 15 to 25 stocks
-	Portfolio construction without regard to any benchmark
-	Sector weightings are residual of stock selection
-	"Owning" cash as a defensive tool
-	Emphasis on after-tax returns where relevant

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

Company Description


Knightsbridge Asset Management seeks to perform in all market and economic environments by investing opportunistically among equities with a focus on capital preservation, as well as rate of return. The firm employs a value-oriented approach, seeking to capitalize on market inefficiencies and irrational investor behavior. The firm believes that excess returns can be generated by exploiting ‘investment anomalies’ or disruptive events believed to cause temporary undervaluation and that signal future outperformance. Knightsbridge places emphasis on absolute returns and invests opportunistically without regard to index characteristics. At times, they may use cash as a defensive tool. Portfolio holdings are diversified across market-capitalization. Stocks are purchased only when Knightsbridge believes an 80% to 100% investment return is probable over a three year holding period.

Home































Knightsbridge Asset Management, LLC is an independent, 100% employee owned, Registered Investment Advisor. The firm was established in 1998, solely managing individual portfolios for both private clients and institutions.  We are investment managers you can trust and talk directly with, not a faceless organization.
We invest opportunistically with a focus on capital preservation as well as rate of return. Contrarian in nature and informed by extensive internal research, we employ a value oriented investment discipline, seeking to capitalize on market inefficiencies and irrational investor behavior. Our investment track record dates back to 1992 and is independently verified.  And our personal and family wealth is invested alongside clients.
