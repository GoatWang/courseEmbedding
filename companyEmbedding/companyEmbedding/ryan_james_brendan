            I have over 30 years experience working with children and adolescents. I have worked  in adolescent inpatient settings as a therapist and Psychologist.  I have also worked with adults in outpatient clinic settings. I have had good success working with clients with anger control issues and ADHD features. I have lots of experience working with clients with depression and suicidal ideation. I have also done family therapy as well. I  also have over 20 years experience coaching a variety sports at the high school level.
        

            I have a strong interest and backround in working with teens with anger control issues. I have focused much of my practice on developing coping skills and working on self control strategies. I have good experience and success with clients suffering from depression as well.
        

            I have been able to use my backround in coaching and sports successfully with my interactions with my clients. I have a laid back but firm approach in my sessions. I have good interpersonal skills that leads to good client relationships.
