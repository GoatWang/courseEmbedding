Overview
 NOTE:  Hines Global REIT closed to new investors on April 11, 2014.



Hines Global REIT: Your passport to global real estate.® 



Hines Global REIT owns and manages a diversified real estate portfolio that includes office, multifamily, retail, industrial and other real estate investments in domestic and international markets. It was launched in August 2009 and has a portfolio of investments in 18 locations in the U.S., the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Poland, Russia and Australia.3

Portfolio Summary4

Estimated aggregate value: $4.8 billionNumber of investments: 40 projects, 16.0 million square feetPercentage leased: 93%


16.5% annualized distribution rate is based on the $10.03 per share estimated NAV and assumes the daily distribution rate ($0.0017808 per share, per day) declared since January 2015 is maintained for one year.2Our cash flows from operations have been and may continue to be insufficient to fully years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with cash flows from financing activities, which may include proceeds from our public offerings and proceeds from our debt financings. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, we paid $1.1 million and $22.0 million in acquisition fees and expenses. Under GAAP, acquisition fees and acquisition-related expenses were expensed and therefore reduced cash flows from operating activities. However, we funded these expenses with proceeds from our public offerings or other equity capital.3Data as of March 31, 2017.4Assumes 100% ownership in each of Hines Global REIT’s real estate assets and investments in real estate-related debt. We own less than 100% of the interests in three projects. Assuming the REIT’s effective ownership, the estimated aggregate value would be $4.8 billion; square feet would be 16.0 million and the percentage leased would be 93%.5Please see Hines Global REIT’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 28, 2017 for a discussion of the assumptions and methodologies used to determine the estimated per share net asset value, or NAV, as well as the limitations of the estimated per share NAV. The estimated per share NAV was calculated as of a moment in time, and, although the value of shares of Hines Global REIT’s common stock will fluctuate over time as a result of, among other things, developments related to individual assets, purchases and sales of additional assets and the payment of fees and closing costs in connection therewith, changes in the real estate and capital markets, the distribution of sales proceeds to Hines Global REIT’s stockholders (if any) and changes in corporate policies such as Hines Global REIT’s distribution level relative to earnings, Hines Global REIT does not undertake to update the estimated per share NAV on a regular basis. As a result, stockholders should not rely on the estimated per share NAV as an accurate measure of the then-current value of shares of Hines Global REIT’s common stock in making a decision to buy or sell shares of Hines Global REIT’s common stock, including whether to reinvest distributions by participating in Hines Global REIT’s distribution reinvestment plan and whether to request redemption under Hines Global REIT’s share redemption program. The estimated per share NAV is not a representation, warranty or guarantee that (i) a stockholder would be able to realize an amount equal to the estimated per share NAV if such stockholder attempts to sell the his or her shares; (ii) a stockholder would ultimately realize distributions per share equal to the estimated per share NAV upon Hines Global REIT’s liquidation or sale; (iii) shares of Hines Global REIT’s common stock would trade at the estimated per share NAV on a national securities exchange; or (iv) a third party would offer the estimated per share NAV in an arm’s-length transaction to purchase all or substantially all of Hines Global REIT’s shares of common stock.

HMS Income Fund taps the experience and resources of Main Street Capital Corporation (“Main Street”), a publicly-traded BDC (NYSE: MAIN), through MSC Adviser I, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary that is the sub-adviser to the fund. The sub-adviser recommends and monitors all of HMS Income Fund’s investments, targeting investment opportunities that arise from ownership transitions, strategic acquisitions, business expansions and other growth initiatives, primarily for later stage businesses. Since its inception, Main Street has specialized in providing long-term loans and equity capital to middle-market and lower middle-market U.S. companies.
There are substantial costs associated with an investment in this offering. An investor must review the fees and expenses in the prospectus prior to investing.
Click here for information on sales charges, fees and expenses.
Please note: Investors are not acquiring an interest in Main Street.1There is no assurance that the Fund will pay distributions. The amount and timing of distributions are not guaranteed. Investment income has been insufficient to fund distributions due to the incentive fee on income, which the Adviser and Sub-Adviser have agreed to waive. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, 100% of distributions were paid from net realized income from operations (before the waiver of the incentive fee on income), 0.0% came from the waiver of the incentive fee on income, and 0.0% came from distributions in excess of net investment income, which represents adjustments made to GAAP basis net investment income to arrive at taxable income available for distributions. If the advisors had not agreed to waive their fees, these distributions would have come from investors' paid in capital. Paying distributions from sources other than net realized income lowers an investor's overall return. 
2Price effective as of the Company's January 19, 2017 weekly closing. Based upon the calculated NAV, the pricing committee reviews the offering price to ensure that shares are not being offered at a price, after deduction of selling commissions and dealer manager fees, below NAV per share. Periodic valuations will cause offering price to fluctuate.

REITs Overview
 Real estate is one of the oldest means by which individuals have accumulated and measured their wealth. In fact, there was once a time when real estate was considered the more "traditional" investment while stocks and bonds were thought of as “alternatives.” Today there are a number of ways to invest in real estate, and one that has grown exponentially in popularity is the non-traded real estate investment trust, or REIT.
REITs are specialized investments that pool the money of many investors to purchase real estate assets, primarily properties. REITs can focus on one property type, such as office, or include many different kinds of properties in a single portfolio. REITs can also vary in terms of their geographic focus—they can be regional, national or global in scope.
An investor’s return from a REIT investment may come from different sources depending on the REIT’s strategy. Typically, income from rents, minus expenses, is passed through to the REIT and, after paying other expenses of the REIT, is then distributed to shareholders. The REIT may also seek to grow the value of invested capital, providing additional return to investors in the event of a future liquidity event, such as a listing on an exchange, merger, or sale of REIT assets.
Remember that, like real estate, an investment in a non-traded REIT does not offer ready liquidity like you would find with stocks and bonds. Distributions from a REIT are not guaranteed, nor is growth in the value of invested capital. Future liquidity events are also not guaranteed. An investment in a non-traded REIT is subject to significant upfront and ongoing expenses which can reduce the amount available for an investment and reduce an investor's overall return.

Hines REIT Announces Liquidation Plan


June 30, 2016




(HOUSTON) - Hines Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. (“Hines REIT" or the “Company”), one of three public non-listed REITs sponsored by Hines, announced today that its board of directors unanimously voted to approve a plan for liquidation and dissolution of the Company.  The plan, which is subject to stockholder approval, takes advantage of the current strong demand for high-quality assets by institutional buyers, and includes Hines REIT entering into a definitive agreement to sell seven West Coast office assets in a cash transaction for $1.162 billion to an affiliate of Blackstone Real Estate Partners VIII ("Blackstone").  Additionally, Hines REIT is currently in the process of selling its interests in and liquidating the remaining assets that comprise its portfolio, including Chase Tower in Dallas, 321 North Clark in Chicago and a grocery-anchored retail portfolio located primarily in the southeastern United States. As a result of the plan of liquidation and dissolution of the Company, it is estimated that the net proceeds to be distributed to stockholders will approximate $6.35 to $6.65 per share of common stock.  Hines REIT previously distributed $1.01 per share from July 2011 through April 2013 which was designated by the Company as partial return of invested capital.  In light of the pending plan, the Company will cease paying regular quarterly distributions after payment of distributions declared for the second quarter of 2016 and instead expects to make final distributions to its stockholders on or before December 31, 2016.  There can be no assurances regarding the amounts of any distributions or the timing thereof. “When we first launched Hines REIT in 2003, it was structured as a perpetual life vehicle, much like many institutional funds,” said Sherri Schugart, president and CEO of Hines REIT.  “Impacts from the great recession caused us to close the fund to new investors in 2009, so we began considering other options that could provide the best opportunities for enhancing stockholder value through the following economic recovery.  By making strategic asset sales and redeploying proceeds into Class A West Coast office properties over the last several years, we’ve been able to add to the overall quality and concentration of our portfolio, sustain attractive distributions to investors, and increase our net asset value per share.  After our management and Board of Directors considered a variety of strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value through a liquidity event, we are confident that the plan of liquidation achieves that goal.” The transaction with Blackstone is structured as an asset purchase of approximately 3 million square feet of office properties and includes Howard Hughes Center in Los Angeles, CA; Daytona Buildings in Redmond, WA; Laguna Buildings in Redmond, WA; 5th and Bell in Seattle, WA; 2100 Powell in Emeryville, CA; 2851 Junction Avenue in San Jose, CA; and 1900 and 2000 Alameda in San Mateo, CA (the “West Coast Asset Sale”).  The transaction will be subject to stockholder approval of the plan of liquidation, and certain closing conditions.  There will be no financing contingency associated with the transaction. The Eastdil Secured group of Wells Fargo Securities, LLC acted as financial advisor to Hines REIT on this transaction and Robert A. Stanger & Co., Inc. provided certain financial advisory services to the board of directors in connection with the transaction.
