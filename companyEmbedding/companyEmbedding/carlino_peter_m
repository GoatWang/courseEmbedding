It's good to be in charge at greater Berks County's top companies, especially on payday.
Executives leading Berks-area publicly traded companies brought home a median of $2 million in 2012 in a time when wages have fallen in Pennsylvania.
Locally, the top-paid executive was Peter M. Carlino, the chairman and chief executive officer of Penn National Gaming Inc., Wyomissing, with a total of $12.5 million in pay, stock and benefits in 2012, according to a review of financial documents of locally publicly traded companies. The firms are required to disclose compensation of the principal executive officer and financial officer, plus the top three highest-paid executives. Coming in a close second is The Hershey Co. President and CEO John Bilbrey, with compensation of $12.3 million. Trexlertown-based Air Products and Chemicals Inc. President and CEO J. E. McGlade was third with $12 million.
More than three-quarters of top executives at 10 Berks-area publicly traded companies received a raise in 2012. Nearly 15 percent had their pay cut, and 10 percent weren't listed in company filing documents last year.
The paychecks are high, but that's the premium companies will pay to find the right executive, said Aaron Boyd, director of governance research with Equilar, a California company that tracks executive compensation.
"Companies are getting bigger and bigger, and more dollars are at stake," he said.
Bringing in the right executive can increase revenue or sales by a billion dollars. So companies are willing to pay top dollar.
Executive pay has become a hot topic with the Occupy Wall Street movement, the recession and the push to make corporate practices transparent, which resulted in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, passed in 2010.
After several years of lower pay, most local companies are paying executives pre-recession paychecks, said Chet Mosteller, president of Mosteller and Associates, a human resources consulting firm in Cumru Township.
"Things are starting to bounce back to what we're calling normalcy," he said.

Berks County companies, in general, offer fairly conservative compensation for executives, Mosteller said. Top management pay reflects the region's value of rewarding hard work. Also, for smaller companies, the boards of directors are typically local businesspeople and are aware of shareholders who live in the same community.
The firm works with companies throughout the Mid-Atlantic to create peer compensation studies, Mosteller said.
Executives at the area's top companies are paid base salaries, plus annual cash incentives based on performance and long-term incentive awards in stock and options. There are also benefits such as health and life insurance and retirement funds, and perks such as car allowances, spousal travel to business events and bonuses for overseas assignments.
The compensation packages differ from company to company, but generally, more than half of an executive's pay is based on performance.
Compensation is set by board committees and usually based on pay among companies in the same industry or similar size. Additional performance targets are based on things such as revenue and shareholder return. Shareholders have a say as well. "Say on pay" votes became a requirement for public companies in 2011, and more companies are trying to do a better job to communicate with shareholders about pay, Boyd said.
For example, Penn National spoke directly with its top 40 shareholders about pay and held quarterly conference calls about the issue.
"You're seeing companies having these conversations, and shareholders are explaining what they don't like," Boyd said.
Last year, stockholders approved executive pay at all of the top 10 local companies, most with an overwhelming majority.
The companies use compensation to attract top managers, as well as grow business and shareholder returns.
Incentives are based on goals, such as operating margins, safety records and individual performance. If the thresholds aren't met, there's no bonus.
Performance pay is often tied to stock, including stock that can't be traded for several years. That helps retain management, minimize risk and connect compensation to the company's financials.
While in the past, local boards may have been more lackadaisical about the metrics, more boards are getting better at establishing formulas, goals and strategies to set executive compensation, Mosteller said.
In addition, several of the companies, including Hershey and Teleflex Inc., Limerick, require the top executives to own up to five times their salaries in company stock.
Nationally, pay is starting to flatten out, said Equilar's Boyd. But there's a balancing act tween cash bonuses and stock awards. Cash bonuses have dropped from high levels of 2010 as companies set more aggressive goals. At the same time, the stock market has improved, increasing the value of stock awards.
In 2012, most executives in the top 10 list brought home more money. At Hershey, they earned above-target incentive awards after total shareholder return hit 20 percent, triple the S&P 500 Index.
Susquehanna Bancshares Inc., Lititz, acquired Tower Bancorp, Harrisburg, and saw revenues and returns increase nearly 30 percent. Top executive salaries grew to fit the new category, and they also received $250,000 to $500,000 more in retirement plans.
Boards also gave special awards. At Teleflex, President and CEO Benson F. Smith received an extra $1 million in stock to recognize his performance and the significant increase in shareholder value under his tenure. At Carpenter Technology Corp., Andrew T. Ziolkowski, senior vice president of Latrobe operations, received a special performance-based restricted stock award worth $300,000 for his role in the acquiring and integrating Latrobe Specialty Metals Inc.
However, because Air Products and Chemicals didn't meet growth targets, executive incentive payments were significantly lower than in previous years.
Even terminated executives got a golden parachute. Richard A. Meier, former executive vice president and chief financial officer for Teleflex, was terminated in March and received $937,388, including $25,380 for a car lease and $20,000 in executive outplacement services.
But resignations aren't as lucrative. Wyomissing-based Customers Bancorp Inc. Chief Financial Officer Thomas R. Brugger resigned to take the same role at New Jesrey-based Sun National Bank. With his resignation, he didn't get any additional payments and he forfeited his outstanding equity awards.
Also of note, just three of the top 50 executives are women: Michele Buck and Leslie Turner from The Hershey Co. and Sandra L. Bodnyk at National Penn Bancshares Inc.
As more baby boomer executives retire, Mosteller expects to see upper management pay increase.
Traditionally, middle managers were trained in a broad range of areas and groomed to become top executives. Training programs have been drastically cut, leaving a smaller pool of qualified candidates as boomers retire.
"Another five to 10 years from now, it might be 30 percent fewer available executives in the marketplace," Mosteller said.
